0,"Hey all, TLDR at end of post.
2 friends and I (males) are renting the top half of a house, above 2 girls who live downstairs. Their lease agreement is nearing renewal and we really want to get one of the girls kicked out. An unbearable human being. Unfortunately she has yet to break any lease rules so we cannot complain to our landlord about her. Her roommate also wants to get rid of her, and she is also willing to stoop to moral lows to get her out. The catch? she is dating one of my friends who lives upstairs with me. So, she comes upstairs constantly and is quite disruptive, but her boyfriend (my roommate) wouldn't let us kick her out or dispute with the landlord. My other friend, and the other girl living downstairs all want the girl in question to leave with no technical wrongdoings. What do we do? We laughed over ideas of making her think the house is haunted, but upon further interest we decided it's just about the only option we have. Short of framing her for noise complaints/disturbances, which we do not want to do because the landlord is partial towards her, what do I do reddit?
TLDR: Shitty downstairs tenant needs to go, how do I make her leave without breaking the law?

1,"Backstory I (22 male)  went out with my ex gf (23 female) for a few months at the beggining of this year and it was a crappy relationship. In the space of 4 months she dumped  me twice once over text. I liked her but but I didn't find her very attractive ( barley had actual sex because she just didnt really turn me on) she wasn't very nice to me and we didn't hang out much. Since the breakup we've text a bit and met up 3 times one of which we slept in the same bed but nothing happened. 

About a month after she dumped me I met my current Gf (22f), she's very smart very attractive, treats me great and we spend loads of time together, she's just a bit of me. 

Recently I saw a picture of my ex with what I assume is the new guy in her life and it crushed me, I felt jealous and sad and worthless and I've been down about it ever since but I really don't know why I'm having these feelings. By contrast I randomly bumped into me ex, ex Gf the other day and her boyfriend and she was pregnant, I really loved her but didn't feel a thing and didn't  give it a second thought.

I could use some man advice on how to get over what I'm feeling here and move on my life, I felt like I'd already done it given the fact I was happily in another relationship but I guess not.",19Nov2019,1
2,"Honestly I don’t even know where to start. I feel as though my life has been stressful event after another. I was adopted at birth, my adopted mom died when I was 8. Thus leaving my dad with my sister (who was always horrible to me), me, and my 1 year old little brother. I was forced to take care of him for the rest of my childhood. I found my birth mother a few years later, her husband turned out to be a total creep. So being around her was very stressful for me, but I wanted that motherly figure in my life.

Fast forward a few years, I started working at 16, and haven’t stopped, always about 30 hours a week. As soon as I graduated high school I got an associates degree, and transferred to a University. My first semester started off good, but then in November my dog, who we had for 11 years died. Followed my mother’s death right before finals in my first semester. I did great on my exams, because school has always been important to me. Last semester I really struggled with finding motivation to work on one of my classes, which lead me to get the first C I’ve ever gotten. Then this semester started, and I just haven’t had any motivation to go to class, or do homework. I’m just barely scraping by. 

I have to declare a major this semester. I just feel like I have completely lost any motivation, and that makes me feel like I’m wasting my time and money. I just don’t know what to do. When I go to class I don’t retain anything that is being taught, it kills me to have to sit down and do my homework. I’ve missed turning in a lot of assignments, because I’ve haven’t even bothered to check what was due. I’ve never been this type of student, and it makes me feel terrible about myself. I don’t know what to do. I’m terrified of my future, because I’ve always had to live life in the moment and haven’t ever thought about what I want to do with my life. 

Tl:dr I think I’m burned out, and I don’t know what to do about it.",19Nov2019,1
3,"I have already asked for advice from my parents, my friends, my youth leaders, everyone, and nothing seems to get better. I felt like I would maybe have a shot here. 

I was dating this guy, and he was literally the light I my life. He was the reason why I was growing in my self esteem, he was funny, smart, perfect, he was everything I could have asked for. I was so happy being in a relationship with him. Last month he broke up with me, two days before Halloween, and he took a piece of me with him.

I don’t eat, I don’t sleep, I make bad decisions. He said that he still wants me in his life, but only platonically. I want him in my life more than anything, but I just can’t stop loving him. I am completely distraught about the whole situation, and I just feel like I’m slowly crumbling. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get over someone you love?",19Nov2019,1

I slipped going up the stairs last week and hit my shin incredibly hard. I did manage to get up the stairs, but I was worried I wouldnt make it back down after I grabbed my infant.

5,"So, I had this best friend online. We were very close, and had a connection that was untouchable. My life got horrible, and I had a bad case of borderline personality disorder and body dysmorphia. I didn’t know, and so I let it take over me. I was abusive, controlling, and even manipulative. I wasn’t proud of it, but I lost myself in this mania. My impulses I couldn’t control. That I thought was depression but days I struggled with moods, explosive anger, intense wants to self harm, irritation, sadness, emptiness and he got caught in it. All the emotional abuse, I couldn’t stop myself. He himself was struggling with depression, and was making concerning ideals. I asked my friend for help, and she blew up. She contacted the police, and screamed at me to comply with information because if he died I’d be my fault. But what he was saying wasn’t even that bad but my friend got angry and said what if it was it’s your fault. I got scared and backed off. 

Fast forward, he went silent then he was very angry at me. Removed me from his life and refused to talk things out. Depressed I had to go to inpatient due to an attempt, there I figured things out, and got therapy for my disorders. I’ve been working towards changing, and I apologized in every form. I tried to make it up to him any way I could because he was my best friend. Who was also in love with me since I meant the world to him. I then asked him for a second chance he said “I’ll think about it.” And for a month I backed off. After him being rude and aggressive with me, then saying he missed me. A month later he wanted to contact me. He reached out to me randomly saying he wanted to talk immediately. He wanted to call, and worried I asked him if it’d be a bad talk he told me not to worry. I asked him if he was okay and if he wanted to and he said yes. Relieved I asked if he was ready around the time he set. He said yes, then 360 on me, and said his mom wasn’t okay with it. Which I expressed my confusion since she she approved of that, and in his final sentence he said she was okay with it totally contradicting his mother not being okay to be perfectly 100 cool with it. He then said he felt sick, queasy, thinking about it. He felt really bad and scared to call, then he got angry and said I forced him (though he reached out to me to asked and schedule immediately), and he said he never wanted to he felt like he had to. Then told me “leave me alone I said that’s what I wanted before.” And I’m just really confused. Like what he did was a walking contradiction and I’m so confused I just want to fix things. 

TL;DR Ex Friend contradicting actions.",19Nov2019,1
6,I don’t know. It kinda makes me uncomfortable. If I do I won’t be able to get him something personal from just me. I’m from a different kind of family and background. My mom struggled with raising two kids on her own so she worked holidays for extra pay. She also struggled with addiction in my teenage years so there’s that. I’ve never really cared about stuff. I’m happy just spending time with my people. I’m feeling pressured and overwhelmed. New job so there’s a little trepidation about whether I’ll stay there or not.

9,"For context, I’m a 17 year old female. I grew up thinking I had a decent childhood and that any punishment I got was because I deserved it, but ever since I turned 15 my friends have been helping me realize that nothing about my childhood was okay. 

My mother once beat me until I had a nosebleed because I was an hour late coming home. I told her the bus was delayed and she didn’t believe me, and accused me of having sex. I was 12. I wrote about it in my diary, which she then took from me and yelled at me for an hour saying that I’m only writing these things to show people so I can make people hate her. 

My father constantly puts his wife before me, and will take from the child support he’s supposed to give me monthly to help her out of situations. She’s a drug addict who constantly cheats on him, but he stays with her and treats his kids like shit just to please her. 

My grandmother treats me like a servant and manipulates me into loving her more than I love my mother. My mother notices this and constantly says terrible things about my grandmother to me so that I stay on her side. 

There’s a lot more but I don’t think anyone would care to listen. I really want to get a therapist and let it all out, but I’m still a minor and scared CPS would be called, and if that’s the case I would never hear from my family ever again. 

I had a therapist earlier this year but it didn’t help much, because during the screenings my mother was the one who spoke and told them what she thought was wrong with me.

I’m scared to get help even though i think I should. I’m in college now (early admit), but i still rely on them for assistance and support. What do I do?",19Nov2019,1
10,"I moved into a basement apartment under the impression the tenants above worked a similar schedule to me (9-5). However, they are up all hours of the night. There is absolutely no soundproofing, so I am constantly hearing loud footsteps, loud creaking, things dropping on the floor etc. This doesn't bother me before 11PM, but when it goes on into 1am (and then starts again at 5am), I start to get really frustrated. The shower pipes are loud as well (was woken up at 5AM by them). The house is two floors, so when they go upstairs eventually, I don't hear them.

I think the tenants above are not aware of how loud it is when they run /walk around upstairs. And I do not want to bother them about basic things like showering or watching TV. However for weeks now my sleep is entirely determined by them, and I'm wondering if it's fair to ask them to tread a little lightly late at night (I'm thinking 11PM-7AM) and perhaps ask about the shower. Again it's tough because I know I can't interfere with their basic living needs. I'm just wondering if maybe they don't realize how loud it sounds late at night.

Note that they do not make any unfair sounds such as playing music loudly or talking loudly. Still, I haven't slept properly in weeks. I would say I am a very quiet tenant, make no noise after 11 and none before 7 in the morning (not that they could hear me on the second floor anyway). I am rarely home and only make noise with appliances/vaccuum at reasonable hours.",19Nov2019,1
11,"So my roommate got a free pure-bred 6 year old dauchsend a couple months ago. She was just told that the dog is ""peeper pad trained"", is also ""territorial"", and was unspayed but never pregnant despite belonging to breeders.

So my roommate works 40 hours a week, is out of town at least 2 nights a week, and enjoys going out after work leaving the dog unattended to for probably around 80 hours a week.

The dog is also in no way house broken. Shell run off and use the bathroom wherever she pleases. We've attempted to convince roommate to start training the dog to go outside using treats, which she constantly forgets. Then since the dog is ""peepee pad trained"" she just doesn't take her outside because shes running late, it's raining, or it's too cold.
So guess who ends up taking the dog out? 🙋🏻‍♀️

The dog is also ""territorial"".
Meaning she has now bitten at least 5 of our friends. We got the dog a muzzle and attempted to adapt her to new people, but this change in behavior is going to take months, and the dog almost bit our friend AGAIN yesterday.

So obviously this is unacceptable. But roommate doesnt enjoy confrontation about the dog, probably because she knows shes a shit owner tbh. So everytime I bring up something about the dog, she brings up some petty grievance she has with me or attempts to laugh it off. I can also see the stress and anxiety build up, so I dont take the remarks too personally.

So what should I do?",19Nov2019,1
12,"I’m 20 yrs old and live with my parents and siblings. I have two cats. The first, we found when he was a baby. We had him for three years before my brother adopted our second cat. Therefore, my eldest cat had had a hard time accepting the presence of another animal in the house. He started acting rebellious by pooping in places like the floor, carpet, sink, and beds.

Even though he got used to our other cat and are now even friendly together, he’s acted like that on and of for the past three years. Also, since he is a found kitten (about 3 weeks old) he never got to be well potty trained by his mother and so, he never burries his pops when he goes in the litter. His fur is also long and poop often sticks to his butt. 

His behaviour has been taking a toll on my parents and they’ve had enough of cleaning up after him. They truly want to get rid of him but I simply cannot let that happen. He is still an adorable cat and I have a big emotional attachment to him.

The downside is that the salary is $10k lower than what I will be making in december at my current job and that is a significant amount to me, and it is only a temporary position with the possibility on being renewed based on funding.

18,"Ms. _______

I don’t know if you are part of Human Resources at ————————— or if you could forward this to someone in HR for me. 

I was removed during my first day of training today due to pending results of my background check. 

I’d like to give full disclosure of what my charges are and why they happened.

My first charge for theft came in March of 2017 for a crime committed in August of 2016. I was with two friends late one night during college and we found a credit card in the parking lot of a store, and made the collective decision to order a pizza on the card. I was found and charged for the crime due to my phone number being traced by the pizza company. Even though I was with friends that committed this crime with me, I took complete responsibility because my friends had more to lose than I did at the time, with one in the military and the other training to become a teacher. 

I truly regret this crime. It was a low for me as a person and led me to change and mature a lot in the last few years. It is the only crime I have ever been guilty of and really made me reflect and consider my life and how to go down the right path to be the person I want to be. I never was convicted of this crime because it was set on a diversion and subsequently placed on a year of probation.

In October of 2017 I was pulled over for a traffic violation. A police officer noticed a broken marijuana pipe in my back seat cup holder and searched my vehicle. They confiscated the pipe and charged me with possession of drug paraphernalia. This pipe did not belong to me. I am not and have never been a drug user, but I have had some friends that are in the past. One of those friends left the pipe in my vehicle without my knowledge, leading to my criminal citation when I got pulled over for an unrelated traffic stop. The charge was retired and I was once again placed on probation which I completed in July. 

In January of 2018 I was mistakenly charged with a violation of probation for a failure to appear in court. This occurred due to a court document not being filed correctly as I never missed a court date, and the charge was dismissed. 

In August of this year I helped a friend move into a new apartment and he borrowed my car at one point during the move. He accidentally left a bag of marijuana and a marijuana grinder in my vehicle that he didn’t want me to know about. I was pulled over the next day on my way home from work for a traffic violation and a police officer spotted the grinder in a pouch behind my drivers side front seat. He searched my vehicle and I was charged with possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. I am currently in the process of fighting these charges, including taking drug tests regularly since the day after I was charged to prove to the court that I am not a drug user and am completely clean.

If I hadn’t acquired the new possession charges this year, I would have gotten my charges all expunged from my criminal record this fall. A judge told me that once I do get my new charges dropped or dismissed he will expunge my other charges. 

I have been having a lot of trouble in my job search since graduating from college in May of this year due to these criminal charges. My plan was to not apply for too many jobs before my criminal charges were expunged so it wouldn’t hurt my ability to get a job. I made a mistake over three years ago that shouldn’t be on my record, but due to unfortunate circumstances my record is damaged because of drug charges for a drug I have never used or knowledgeably possessed. 

I am willing to take drug tests as often if you would like to prove I am clean to ____________. I believe I can prove myself as a hard worker and that I am unaffected by my unfortunate criminal record if you give me this opportunity. 

If my charges disqualify me automatically please let me know so I can begin to pursue other job opportunities.

27,"I'm a 21 year old male from a small Midwestern town. I'm currently attending university (3rd year, but only second at this particular school) about 3.5 hours away from home. My plans for after high school were to join the military because I really didn't want to take on the debt that accompanies college. This didn't happen because I found myself in a relationship my junior year of high school, which led to the two of us living together in an apartment attending college together. Long story short, this relationship turned out to be extremely toxic and put a lot of strain on me and my family. I had taken out a few loans in order to pay for this year of college as well as rent and money to live off of since I was living in my own apartment. This is all important because it's part of the problem I've been facing the last few years or so. I believe I know the cause of me feeling lost and empty but I don't know what actions to take to fix these problems so that's why I'm posting this here. 

My first problem is that I absolutely hate college and would love to drop out and figure my life out from there, but its just not possible because of the loans I have taken out for college and living. I would need to start paying them back and the monthly payments for student loans are quite high, but with no guaranteed job right now I don't see how that's possible. I'm also wrapped up in another lease for the following year with my friends from high school that also attend this university. I really enjoy learning about things that interest me, but could care less about the process of learning in a school setting. I've been struggling to figure out what to do with my life. I hate the current degree program I'm in right now (computer science). I thought since I enjoy playing video games and like fiddling around on computer and excel in math that it would be a great thing to major it. I should have done more research on it before declaring that as my major because now here I am in my 3rd year of college with a half finished degree that I can't stand and am in the process of changing to just a Mathematics degree just so I can graduate college with a degree.

My second problem is more about my mental health. I'm paralyzed by social anxiety and depressive symptoms. I have a hard time getting out of bed before 10am most mornings. I'm not really sure when this started but I think I've always had social anxiety. It was never as bad as it is now because I lived in a small town where I had known the people there for most of my life. I think the awareness of my social anxiety has made me somewhat depressed because I never want to go out and do anything. I struggle making new friends because I'm shy and suck at small talk. This anxiety influences decisions I make on a daily basis. It makes me not want to go to class or make any social interactions for that matter. My performance in class is also influenced by this because I can't even develop a relationship with professors or other kids in class because I'm too worried about what kids in class think of me when I speak or ask questions.

I know that I need to get out of my own head and stop overthinking things but I don't really know how to. The only time I really find relief from all this is when I consume cannabis. I find an altered state of consciousness helps get me out of my own head. This is a problem though because it isn't exactly practical to be under the influence of cannabis as often as I sometimes am. I really would like to figure out the root causes of these issues so I can directly address them rather than just treating the symptoms with cannabis.

If anyone has gone through anything similar or knows someone going through the same types of issues, I'd really like to hear from you. Any and all thoughts on my situation are welcome. Thanks in advance!",19Nov2019,1

I had to no ill intention, I just forwarded the email to my personal email so I could review the PPT presentation on my train ride home. This is what what told to me when they fired me, however upon reading my termination letter it says I was fired for no cause. I reached out to HR and have a phone call scheduled with them later this week. 

Looking for any advice, input or anything in general. 

Thank you.",19Nov2019,1
30,"So this guy I've been friends with for around 4 years recently told one of my friends he has a crush on me. And we have been texting for a while and like a week ago he told me he loves me. I just don't think i like him the same as he likes me, i don't want to ruin our friendship or hurt him but i don't know what to tell him. This has been going on for over a month now and i feel like i might be leading him on. Is there anyway i can let him down easily without hurting him? If you were him what would you want to be told?",19Nov2019,1
31,"So basically I work in a union environment at a job that requires scientific background and hold a mid-level certification in X skill (keeping this brief for anonymity). 

Recently a few jobs were posted for my department which required strictly 1 year of experience. We hired 4 people who my boss knew previously from her old job.  The new people worked in a company doing different work for a few years that is not related to this current job skill X requirement except maybe a few hours a week if needed, they didn’t do X full time. These people were hired and were trained for the past 6 months.  In order to become certified in X skill you need 1 year of experience and you have to pass the exam. The new people took the exam and passed (which is fair).  I’ve been working at this job for 4 years full time and I cannot get my certification until I’ve reached 5 years. Since the new people worked at a different company for 5 years doing this skill 1 day a week, they qualify for this certification and will get paid more than me and my co-workers who have been doing this full time for 4 years. 

What would you do?",19Nov2019,1
32,"ok this might be a bit serious for this subreddit but i have nowhere to put this. my mother died when i was young, and my father claimed it was from disease, claiming that she got better when she gave birth to be but then got worse. i just found an article (not providing details) that said that she got killed from long term mercury poison. my father had no reason to lie about this. he is abusive. he was once jailed for suspicion of this murder but released. i don't doubt that she didn't love my father because he is, again, abusive. he works in a uni where you could plausibly get mercury, and few others had constant access to her in order to apply the mercury. we had no housemates, long term friends etc. there is no other option then this. what the fuck can i do here im not going back home for another 4 months and am traveling so that limits my options because running away in a country that i don't speak the language in (not that i am seriously considering that). he has many times told myself and my brother how to commit crimes like school shootings, how to make a bomb, hide a body, jack a car very enthusiastically and strangely and even though he normally acts weird like this he acts almost advocating, and has said before that if it was nessesary if i was say, homeless, then i \*should\* murder/carjack/steal etc. i might just be a bit paranoid with the last bit but if he can hit children and wives then i have no reason to think that he didn't try to use the illness as a disguise to kill my mother. i know this is too serious to post here but i don;t have anywhere else to put this and writing helps me clear my head",19Nov2019,1

This is a long post and I truly feel so much guilt and massive anxiety about the situation. I may delete this.
I have a friend whom I've known for 6 years, moved into an apartment with 4 years ago (for 2 years), and began working together a little over 1.5 years ago. We live in the same apartment complex and will hang out on the weekends and after work sometimes. She is introverted where I am extroverted. Initially she said she was happy for us to work together because she would have someone ""on her side"" and to sit with at events and to hang out and talk with at after work events. Well that has not happened.
A few months into working there, she became really distant and cold at work. We've had talks where I tell her that her behavior hurts me and she tells me that my outgoing personality and want to talk with everyone but her, hurts her. But the reason I don't talk to her at work is because of the way she treats me, if she will even talk to me. We do this stupid little song &amp; dance every 1 - 2 months. She gets mad when I talk to anyone, about anything. Our offices are a few doors down from each other on a corner, and any time someone comes into my office and talks to me about my life or my recent wedding, she slams her door. If I try to talk to her, she barely looks at me and is clipped in her response, gives me nasty looks, speaks to me like I'm an idiot, will flat-out ignore me like I didn't even say anything, or she'll say she ""has to work"" in a tone that indicates that I or anyone else doesn't work. She'll also avoid my gaze when we're in the office in front of others, will turn the other way if she sees me coming, and will get up and move if I sit too close to her at a meeting. She got into the elevator today when I was in the lobby and she turned and faced the wall so she wouldn't have to look at me. I haven't made eye contact with her in a month. I have tried and tried and TRIED to include her in on things, but she refuses. She won't do anything out after work and doesn't want to go to events. Our company held an event at a baseball game and she asked me not to go so that she could go - she does not want to be around me at work and treats me like complete and total garbage when we are around each other. She's mentioned that she doesn't want to share me with work people, and ""mock"" gets jealous when I speak about other friends.
I've tried to give her advice on how to ""fake it until you make it"" but she refuses to accept it or act on it. She claims that being polite and speaking to coworkers you don't really care for is being fake, while I maintain it's being an adult. She says people don't ""say good morning to her"" or ""say hello"" when she passes, but I've said to her that she should do those things first then, but she refuses. She asked me to quit so that we can maintain our friendship, because she cannot work with me. I told her when I first started that I would do that, but she asked me to a few months ago. I, stupidly, said yes, but would have to wait for after the wedding. Now I have to find a new job because my work has become so ridiculously toxic. I don't want to approach anyone about her behavior because she's my friend. But sometimes I wonder if she really is, because you don't treat someone you love the way she's treating me. I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship.
I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around this person now. She makes me feel so bad when we're at work.
I told her I would quit, but I'm having a hard time finding another job that has equivalent pay &amp; benefits. I come from a lower-class family and I have no financial support other than my husband, and I pay some bills for my disabled brother and my mom. I have student loan debt and am living paycheck to paycheck. This is the best job I've ever had - a $10K increase from my last job and benefits that I've never had before. She makes double what I make, comes from an upper middle class family, has no student loan debt,and if she ever gets into financial trouble, she can ask her parents to bail her out. 
I don't want to quit at all; aside from her I like everyone I work with. Should I leave this job? Call it quits on the friendship? I feel a lot of guilt about all of this; I don't want to be mean, but I feel like this relationship is more damaging than anything.",19Nov2019,1

I turned on the heater for the first time today and... I can smell it. everywhere in the house. my room is directly across the hall from his, and it's bad in my room. I'm sitting downstairs, and I can smell it.

my parents who rent the room to him, they dont care. granted it's not like a sickening smell, but it's super musky. and, I dont know what to really do. i dont have any ground to talk to him, but my parents dont care. or maybe, I dont know. it's just bad.

tl;dr: my roommates room smells horrible, makes the whole house smell like it when the heater is on. my parents who rent to him wont say anything, what can I do? 

do I casually suggest he wash whatever the hell is in there? maybe leave some febreeze by his door?",19Nov2019,1
37,"Sorry In advance as this is my first time posting on reddit and a friend said to use a throwaway for this specific post. 

So my moms ex husband was loaded before his passing leaving a small fortune to my mother. Her boyfriend (let’s call him Joe) used to help take care of him in and out of the house before they got together.  After he passed they began dating and eventually my mom bought a house and he moved in with her and that’s 1 hour 30 minutes away from the closest family member on our side.

One day my brother got a call from Joe and said that our mom is in the cornfield naked talking to herself mumbling and what not about Indians or whatever and being really weird. I can’t say much as to what my brother had seen as I’ve forgotten but I remember being appalled in disbelief when I first heard about it as the story just didn’t add up.

Ever since my mother has been heavily medicated to the point where she has almost no emotion. The most I’ve gotten out of her was a smirk when she wanted to laugh but it’s like talking to a ghost, there’s no energy in the conversation like there used to be. I’d also like to add that he’s bought himself a motorcycle, a few fishing rods, and guns (for hunting) and god knows what else with no job. He probably has her money by now but I want my mother back.

Also, my moms side of the tree including my brother and I do not like him because of his shady background but we understand you can’t decide who’s right for someone and who’s not. 

What should I do with this information? It seems like he’s using her medication and her current mental state to blow through her money. Can anything be done at all?",19Nov2019,1

I’ve been with my girlfriend on/off for 4 years.

I’m currently in my last year of university.
I want to do a masters in another city. My girlfriend moved here this year and has made some foundations. She has a job and friends and extra curricular’s. She clearly doesn’t want to relocate but for my career and future it’s kind of not an option. She’s supported me through my studies really well and I love her for it. Hearing the following was hard for me to take...

She told me tonight she doesn’t see a future with me anymore and it’s quite apparent the way she is acting and the fact we haven’t had sex for 2 months or more...we usually have it 2-3 times a day. The spark has just gone. She probably doesn’t love me anymore.

I need advice on what to do, we rent an apartment together. I need to plan for the inevitable. She’s clearly fallen out of love with me and I just need to focus on myself I guess. I’ve come a long way to get into university.

For starters, I've never been a full-blown athlete. I've done about two sports a year (max). I have done a lot of sports. but none have really stuck with me and the only one that I sort of liked was track. However, with track season coming up I feel like I don't wanna do it. I'm just not excited and can't seem to find any joy in it. I'm afraid to bring this up to my family because I'm afraid they'll call me lazy, a pansy, etc. But, it's not the exercise that doesn't make me wanna do it.

43,"**TW** Suicide, self harm, mental illness

I have quite sever bipolar disorder and scizophrenia. I hear voices, think my friends are constantly conspiring against me, believe random things randomly about them without even being told it.  Every day I go through life not knowing what is real or not. I've been selfharming for nearly 2 years and have actively had an eating disorder for about a year. When I was 14, I first tried to kill myself, I slit my wrist and laid by a river and somehow woke up in the hospital. I was diagnosed initially with schizoaffective disorder, after talking about some things. I went away for 3 weeks to the suicidewatch section of the psych ward and we later moved out of the country (Netherlands).

 No one knew about it except my immediate family. After that I tried 2 times more, both times waking up in the hospital and going to the psych ward for at least a week (got rediagnosed there). The last time was last October, each time I'm gone, I tell my friends and classmates that I'm just going on a trip. My teachers don't know anything about it and my parents just send me back to school as if everything's normal after I'm out of the hospital. They seriously don't care and just act as if everything is normal.

I am terrified of telling my friends any of this, I'm a guy and allegedly we never have these things happen. There is so much stigma surrounding guys and mental illnesses, I fear that they would hate me. It's not so much that they aren't nice to me, we talk and do stuff as friends do, I'm normally included in conversations and such.. I just think that they are always conspiring against me and would make me a laughing stock. 

 I'm still terrified to tell anyone though. I know people who are open about their issues. I can't seem to, there seems to be a barrier preventing me from talking about any of it. Half the time I don't even know what's going on. My parents refuse to give me medication, refuse to acknowledge anything and continuously berate me for failing when I'm busy trying to distinguish what's real or my mind. I'm failing school and no one even knows it, I go through cycles of being productive and doing all my work then just giving  up and just fail, I am sick of this. Last semester, I went from a high 90s average to below 50 in a few months, right before finals. It's exhausting and I just seem to have to have no control of anything I do.

I seriously have no idea what to do at this point, like, it can't get worse, but it seems impossible to climb out of. I would need to take 2 more years more of high school to graduate. I'm 15 (16 in 3 weeks) and am in what would be my last year of highschool. I was put a year ahead when I first immigrated to Canada. I've managed to keep my failing secret from other people, I've always just said I'm taking courses in different times than them. About the only thing I have is extracurricular band (had to make own money to pay for it as my parents didn't care), even then, I suck. 

I just want to be normal and not have to constantly deal with everything inside and outside my mind berating me for everything. I feel trapped, though. I can't be I independant until I'm out of school, and to get out of school, I need to be able to function.",19Nov2019,1
44,"My friend keeps objectifying women. Doesn’t matter how old, from a 16 year old to a grandma. I hear him saying under his breath “oh yeah bend over”. Every time someone walks by he’s always checking them out and openly saying how much he wants to fuck their fat ass. He has a baby mama who’s in love with him, random tinder girls and a friend of mine he’s hooking up with. 

My friend he’s hooking up with is 20 and still lives with her parents so she asks to come to my place to drink, not for a hook up. She comes to hang out yet he came over and asked to fuck her in my bathroom. I told him no of course not and told him to fuck her at his place. He said he can’t because he lives with his parents. I’m like why the  FUCK would I let you fuck in my place and you won’t even fuck at your own??!!!

Then he keeps smacking her ass like he owns it. She’s a hook up not his girlfriend he shouldn’t be doing that whenever he wants like he owns it. I get she’s a hook up but she’s also a human being and he shouldn’t expect her to be down to fuck whenever he wants. Like my god have a little respect for her.

Then since I’m cock blocking him he finds some random girl online to fuck and up and leaves. My friend calls him an hour later asking for a ride since I can’t take her home. He ignores every text and call until 1am asking if she still needs a ride. By then she got an Uber.

47,"Hey Reddit, 
First time ever posting so I apologize for anything wrong or weird or whatever that I do.
But I'm really needing some help/advice/or something. 
I've got plenty going wrong with me, from depression/anxiety, being unemployed for a year +, questioning if I should stay best friends with my best friend of almost 10 years,  etc. But Im tackling things kinda one at a time, and I've come to this community for help concerning trying to get in shape. This isn't asking how or anything (i know there are subreddits for that), but my issue is that in an effort to try and get into better shape, I feel like it would be less painful to just cut my arms and legs off. As a quick summary of why, I've got some weird nerve issues (was diagnosed several years ago as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, or CRPS) that essentially boils down to my nerves send pain signals even after the stimulus that started it ended. The pain it causes can even last for hours after whatever caused it. The thing is, it's not only injury that causes it. Carrying objects of decent weight, writing with pen or pencil for moderate lengths of time (20 or so minutes minimum usually), or even just wearing gloves. The pain this causes is best described as a sharp/ piercing/slicing ache (imagine a sore muscle being used feeling in terms of intensity and being cut by lots of small blades in sharpness) that feels like it's on my bones directly. This pain is most predominate in my hands, but over the 9 or so years I've dealt with it, it has seemingly 'spread' to my forearms/elbows/feet/shins/calves. 

Sorry that was such a long description of what is going on, but I do want to try and convey the situation as best I can. 

The reason I'm here is, I, for the first time ever, have the motivation to get myself in shape. I want to lose weight, gain some muscle, and feel better about my appearance. But this nerve issues makes it to when I do my exercises, my arms and legs hurt all day the next day to day and a half approximately. They hurt while doing it as well, and the intensity doesn't change from consecutive days of exercise or anything. So finally my actual question(s).

Should I just stop exercising right now? Should i try again with a neurologist and see if anyhing can be done? (The only thing that they could do before was physical and occupational therapy which only kinda helped but not enough) Have any of you dealt with CRPS or something similar and have things you do that help? Or hell, just any advice at all to have me tell myself for when it hurts like hell? (I do tell myself that I'm bettering myself, but that only helps so much)

Sorry for such a lengthy vent/explanation but thanks for anyone who takes the time to read.

tl:dr summary: nerve issues cause day long pain from exercising, what should I do?",19Nov2019,1
48,"I apologize, but I have to keep all information at bare minimum because my parents use reddit, and would like to keep my anonymity.

So just for some context, my parents have had some pretty bad conflict (I'll refer to them as parent #1 and parent #2) Parent #1 was mildly abusive for quite some time, say 2 and a half years. Not anything physical or severe, but they would slam doors, scream at us, threaten to do this and that, thrown things at walls in anger (at us). They would always find a reason to be mad at Parent #2 and I, and it caused a lot of stress and I would be near fearful just being home, always wondering if Parent #1 would be mad again. Anyway, we once were fed up with it and me and parent #2 left for a decent amount of time (over a month, but less than a year). Finally, we came back after Parent #1 promised to never act with such behavior again. It was going well for about a few months, however he started to slowly go back to his old self again. 

Fast foward about a year since we first came back to present day, and he's been pretty bad lately. I feel like I can't do anything right, because no matter what I do, Parent #1 gets angry. At this point, 3 nights a week Parent #1 and #2 are arguing about something, and it usually isn't civil. Parent #2 contacted a lawyer recently whilst I was at school, and they're divorcing Parent #1. Awesome, I hate the living with Parent #1, I feel I never have a happy day at home unless he's at work or if he's rarely in a good mood. As you'd probably assume, I'm running with Parent #2, because we have a very special bond and have been through some rough shit together. 

However, there is a problem. Me and Parent #2 have a semi-rare disease/disability that can cause pain in certain areas that can make it very hard to find employment, because A.) the employer would rather have a healthy person than someone who may not be able to work a certain day, or B.) Parent #2 Might not be able to keep the job, because they have very bad painful days, and some good days. So we may be happily living on our own, but we may face financial crisis, because parent #2 may not be able to find proper employment. I also cannot work, because I am fairly young (Older than 12, younger than 16), and I need to focus on education. I probably won't have to, but I might possibly have to transfer schools, which would bring a whole crashing wave of, maybe depression isn't the right word, but I wouldn't be very happy, that's for sure. So if Parent #2 can't do physical labor, and I can't work either, what the hell are we going to do? I don't even know what I'm asking for, I just want reassurance, or some advice as to how parent #2 will be able to find employment and support the two of us. 

Again, I apologize for the extremely vague information, but if one of my parents possibly stumbles across this post, I don't want them to have the context to think it's me.

51,"Hi guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

So I am from the US and I am in a program with my uni where I have moved to a large city on the opposite coast to complete an internship for credit. I take one class at a big uni in the city for some credit, but the bulk of my semester credit is from my internship. This grade is from supervisors and my performance throughout the semester. Typically they take a few evaluations and compare progress. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first internship site was horrible. I explicitly told them I was interested in marketing and was assured that is what I would be doing but because of the small company, I would get to see a lot of the departments. Cool! Not cool is me working retail while the girl in the store takes lunch, me getting their milk from the store, making coffee, filling online orders, and having to clean their dishes. It was a horrible experience. I had to arrive before everyone else to wait outside in horrible weather for an unknown amount of time until they showed up. It was very hard to communicate with them and I ended up leaving the internship and told them it was to pursue an avenue that would allow me to grow a business I started, which was true. I didn't want to leave on a bad note so I kept it positive. 

&amp;#x200B;

They essentially told me I wasn't allowed to leave, or wouldn't let me for weeks more. They talked to my school and lied about the work I did and essentially accused my school of being irresponsible and sending them someone incompetent. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning, they signed an agreement for the school and the expectations. I told them before I was leaving about the evaluation coming up. Then they freaked out on the school and have refused to fill out the form. My school pretty much thinks I lied about what they had me doing and said (according to the site) the work I did was expected in the industry. I emailed my old boss and asked them to fill out the form politely.  They will not respond to the school.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this, my school is unable to evaluate my performance and is treating it as incomplete. I'm really upset because I have always been in high standings at my university, and not only are they accusing me of undermining the integrity of the university, but now I'm at risk of failing. I'm also really upset about it because that internship violated SO many labor laws and I am the one being screwed over. I don't know what to do since they won't grade me based on my new internship site alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

The department chairs at my school are behind my director of the program because of the false information they told her--so I really can't turn to anyone at school for support. Does anyone know anything I could do? 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory:

I am a 20 M and My relationship with my dad has been very rocky the past couple of months. My dad while fairly smart is very emotionally immature and quite a bully sometimes . On Saturday, we went to the grand opening of a bar that a friend is working at. There was a group of us there, one of the group despises my dad and asked if i could sit in front of her, I obliged which left my dad and stepmom to sit on either side of me. After a moment, my dad abruptly and aggressively said to me ""Move your ass so i can sit and talk to your mum"". I again obliged but added that ""he didn't have to be such an ass about it"". I understand this was disrespectful, I was just trying to call a spade a spade. Conversations continued and about 10mins later before either of us had finished our first drink, he said to me ""can I talk to you for a moment"".  I followed him into a small hallway at which point he pushed me up against a wall and started cussing me out about disrespecting him. He then said someone along the lines of let's take this outside so i followed him. He then started pushing me around trying to provoke me to hit him. I didnt. After more cussing and pushing he went back inside where i told my stepmom what had happened and mentioned i planned to finish my beer and leave.

Here's where I screwed up. Instead of just finishing the beer, I instead decided to mutter the words fuck off as I was drinking my beer and saying goodnight to everyone. At which point my dad got right up in my face and told me to go outside again. I followed him again where he continued to push me and try to provoke me to hit him. I then left the bar and got an uber home, where I got a text saying that i needed to find somewhere else to stay. So i grabbed my things and left and havent heard anything since. I have been told by a mutual friend that i am no longer welcome at home and to give him a list of all the things I want to get from the house and my parents will pack them up tand give it to him to give to me. As my parents are divorced I will be staying with my mom from now on

My question is, where do i start to fix my relationship with him, I understand and and have accepted I will probably never get an apology from him and would like to find some way to start seeking closure snd salvage any little bit of the relationship I have left.",19Nov2019,1
57,Got into an argument with the wife and in the process my guitar was smashed. It was one of the last things my father gave me before he passed away.

60,"so at my job in retail, there's this women in a different department whom I've been acquainted with all year..

we don't talk much, I keep to myself in general but I'm attracted to her and am not sure if she is as well.. this could be nothing, but I bought this new pink hoodie and wore it.. and then the next time we worked together this happened....

.the second I walked into work, on the other end of the store about 100 feet away from where she is, she instantly noticed and looked over at me.. and sure enough, she was wearing a pink hoodie very similar to the one I wore a few days ago..

i've never seen her wear this hoodie in the year I've been working here.. coincidence?

I mean to notice me within like literally two seconds of walking in a busy store from about 100 feet away, wearing this hoodie.. it may be a subtle hint?

and then one other time at work a few days later, i was helping a customer and glanced over and saw her smiling while looking at me from afar..

63,"Honestly, this is a typical topic and I'm sure a lot of other people go/have gone through the same but I feel most comfortable asking in my own words rather than looking at other threads.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 18, and pretty much a degenerate. I've only ever gone with the flow of things due to having an absent family, and even now pretty much live alone and not employed/not in class. I've been trying to take small steps and still feel no satisfaction in life, regardless of small steps or experiences that would be seen as good by other people. I don't know if i just don't know where to start or if i'm lacking the mentality to be better. I've applied for jobs, and am trying to get student aid but it's hard. 

I have no friends and I have an extreme disconnect with my family. I've let my online persona affect me way too much as well (not going in-depth on this but i think that's the best way to say how i feel about that). I just feel extremely lost, I don't know what I'm gonna do and I don't know how to mentally better myself. 

I also have physical health issues, particularly with my lungs.  

I still feel like i haven't expressed myself well at all and i guess i just want someone to console me or give me advice on what to do because after writing all of this i just feel like saying sorry for whining

So about a week ago a guy asked me out. I was desperate because I thought Naruto didn’t like me back. Well now it is one week till Semi Formal and of course my boyfriend wants to go with me but I want to break up with him.

66,"But of backstory for those that are interested: a friend of mine recently broke up with her girlfriend and confided in me with how she feels/what she wants to do (which has happened before I’m good at listening to people and I enjoy doing it). After a while over text she confessed to me that she has a crush on me. I’m not bi or gay and not interested in experimenting, I’m straight and she knows that. I kept telling her the same thing (I’m straight, I like someone else, not interested in experimenting) but she keeps on trying to get me to ‘just give it a try’ with her.

Eventually one of my classmates would find out and say to everyone in my school I’m hella gay or some shit like that... this would screw me over.

72,"Hello. This is gonna be a bit long because I want to give full context so if you take time to read this whole thing thank you. 
I’m 18f and still live at home. My parents divorced when I was 9 but were on and off for years-long intervals at a time after that. It was “I hate you get out of my house” one year and “I love you will you re-marry me” the next. It really toyed with my emotions because I would get my hopes up of them getting back together and then they’d get crushed over and over and over again. Whenever they’d be in an “off period”, my dad would always tell me that I didn’t deserve this and that he knows my mom better than I do and that he knows what she’s doing (he’d never be more specific than that). Whereas my mom would say that my dad would randomly start ignoring her and that’s why she’d stop liking him. My mindset was I guess just always annoyed at my dad and that was my stance on their whole relationship. I hope that made sense.
A few months ago I saw a text message pop up on my mom’s phone from a Bob and it had the word “baby” in it but that’s all I saw. She instantly snatched it away and said “that’s just my friend”. She was so quick to defend herself and changed the story twice, which only made me more suspicious obviously. One day while she was in the shower I snooped through her phone (I memorized her password by peering over her shoulder once) and found risqué messages to Bob. I confronted her about it the next day quite bluntly and she just kept denying everything and deflecting everything. She kept playing dumb which frustrated me so much. At that point I decided it would be easier for me to not care. Ignorance is bliss as they say.
Flash forward to now. My parents are currently in an “on period”, so my dad and mom are together right now. I was walking to MY closet and I see my mom rushing out of it with her phone, I don’t want to go into any more detail than that but let’s just say I know what kind of pictures she was taking. A few days later she asks me to come with her to Best Buy to help her pick out an iPhone tripod mount because she says she wants to get into photography. The next day I find the tripod in her bedroom. I know what it’s for. The next day she brings MY vanity mirror from MY bedroom into her bedroom. I know what it’s for. Disclaimer, I know this is not for my dad because even though they are together, they still live in different houses and don’t spend the night with each other. A few days later I see a message pop up on her phone from a Kieth saying “I like what we have”. Just yesterday I took her to a movie and during the previews I see her texting Kieth saying “I’m at the movies right now with my daughter. How much does that turn you on?” He replied with “makes me lose control”. I am so absolutely sickened. It made me feel violated. She used MY closet to take her photos, she put MY mirror in her room, she used MY videography knowledge to get her tripod mount, and now she’s texting him THAT? I am disgusted. It also is so shocking to me because I never in a million years would have thought my mom would do this. Especially since her sister (my aunt) was recently cheated on. It’s all I’ve been thinking about. I am a full time college student and I just took on an extremely stressful job. I just don’t have time for this. Every time I’m around her it’s all I think about. It’s especially painful when she makes her cute innocent jokes to make me laugh, but all I can think about is Kieth. On top of feeling sickened, I feel so stupid for defending my mom to my dad all this time. And I also feel like she must think I’m stupid for not knowing. She does a terrible job at hiding this obviously. I don’t want to confront her about it now because it’s almost time for the holidays. Also, if I ever do confront her later, I know she’s just going to play dumb like last time. I’m thinking about snooping more and just getting more information to find a way to make it all fall apart. Please tell me what I should do. Thank you again for reading and sorry if I was a little hard to understand.",19Nov2019,1

77,"My husband hated his job and I wanted to be supportive so I didn’t give him too much of a hard time two years ago. I understand the feeling of dread in going to work everyday, but over the course of two years he didn’t really make any progress in finding a new career. We ended up moving to a new city with a lower cost of living where my career could pay the bills and let us live without pulling money out of savings but it’s still just a 1 bedroom apartment. 

He finally found a job that he seemed excited about with a 6 figure salary and international travel. Of course I was over the moon as this meant we would have so much extra income and could buy a house, be completely debt free etc. Now 3 weeks later he says he is going to quit again and would rather just go travel on his own (and live the life like many of the Instagram people he so admires). 

How do I continue to be supportive when honestly I feel so crushed inside? I just lost a parent and I’m experiencing a hard first birthday / holidays without them. One of my shining lights was it seemed like the financial burden was lifted from me but now it’s just going to come hitting right back. I don’t want him to be miserable every day but it seems like he is making a rash decision without giving the job a chance and doesn’t really seem to care how it affects me in any way. 

I need your advice on what I should do and how to move forward, both to help him be happy in working and making an income (whatever that may be) and how to deal with the situation.",19Nov2019,1
79,"My boyfriend and I broke our 1 year relationship a month ago. This was the first serious relationship I ever had. 


We met on an app but as soon as we met we blindly fell for each other. We thought we had things in each other that we needed. The first two months in the relationship it was like fire. I felt like he really loved me for who I was. When we went long distance, he came to the US from Korea to see me twice although he wasn't from a well-off family. I opened my everything to him. As time passed, we kept fighting. I wanted constant reminder that I was loved but sometimes he was busy to keep contacting me or remind me. At first he tried but he also gradually stopped. He wanted me to become Christian and get married but I didn't want to. I knew it in my heart that I didn't want to live with this guy forever but his love and him just being by my side was my cocaine. Him being by my side helped me get through my senior year when I was lonely and mentally insecure.

When I came back to Korea in May, things were still bad. We were exhausted from the constant fighting and he wasn't the guy that I fell in love with - the guy that showered me with love. Maybe I wasn't the same person then when he fell in love with me. I needed stability, and he needed someone caring for him. But we were both in a stressful situation when I had to be on a constant job search with my low self esteem, and him having to provide for his family.

It has only been a month but I am afraid that I won't be over him as fast as I should. Every time of the month, every time I drink I can only cry and think of him and how he brought me roses and smiled and cooked for me. I call him and text him and leave him long messages begging for him to come back and love me. I know it in my head that I shouldn't and that I would regret it but I do it any way. we called before that, he said that he didn't have any more romantic feelings for me anymore but cared about me as a friend, and a person. That put a knife through my heart. But he finally blocked me through all types of social media. I keep checking his private instagram account to see if he uploaded any more posts, to see if the number changed and if he will ever see the messages sent by me. I keep messaging him. But he doesn't get back to me.

I was so sure that I didn't love this guy as a person. I was unhappy when until the end he swore at me and treated me like I didn't matter at all. I got to a new low begging him to be by my side even when he didn't love me. I don't know if I tried my best or if it was my fault the relationship ended. I honestly don't know. I don't know how to get through this right now. I really feel like I have hit my lowest point.

He told me he wasn't in a right place for a relationship but I just feel like its a rejection towards me and I am afraid  that he will find someone although he said that he didn't want a relationship. My self esteem is getting very low and I feel like I will find no one and I know that I will take a longer time to heal than he got over me.

It really hurts.",19Nov2019,1
80,"I'm an 18 year old male and I really want to start a serious relationship with a woman in her late 20's to early 30's. The reason is because I really do not enjoy relationships with people my age at all, not only do most of them not have any stability, they cheat and are very impulsive and think with their genitals. I want to find a more mature woman that can understand me and guide me to being a better person every day.

I'm a career musician (Not in college) who produces music videos for a living. I enjoy wine tasting, old horror movies and stuff of that sort. I'm really looking for something serious, I'm not wanting to experiment or party I honestly just want to settle down with kids. I have too much trauma from my past and I do not like chaos. Also if it helps, I look a lot older then 18 (More like 25-30) and have tattoos up my arms.

So yeah, thanks for reading this, any idea of where to go with this info in mind to potentially meet a beautiful mature woman entering her 30's? I've seen a lot of old young relationships between 18-21 year old girls and 40-50 year old men work out fine, so I think this could too.",19Nov2019,1

82,I live in Maine and I need help with what I should do for issues with a teacher. This teacher is doing stuff a guidance counselor should be doing (and not even should but is at least qualified to do) like helping someone apply to Mainecare but they’ve misdirected then and now they don’t qualify for stuff that they should. They’ve also suggested mediations for someone to take when in that situation they’re not supposed to take that specific med. Or if a student is talking to a friend about an issue then they get mad and separate them and tell the friends that they don’t know what they’re talking about and that if someone needs help they need to talk to them(the teacher) and no one else. I want to find a way to stop them before they over-step more but I’m afraid of them knowing it’s me. Before this teacher was kind of annoying but now it’s very much clear that they need to be reported or talked to by someone because they’re giving misinformation and don’t care about it because the feeling of helping someone else is more favorable to them.,19Nov2019,1

86,"Howdy! 

So for years now, I've been made fun of for not driving yet. I have a learners permit, of which I've had for over a year now.  It sits, unused and dusty in my wallet. I would love to go take a drivers test, and get on the road. 

But, as soon as I get behind the wheel I lock up, and am terrified. I imagine every little thing going wrong and I get nervous-sweaty and just want to stop. 

I've never been in a major car accident, or anything like that. However I am a nervous and paranoid person by nature. This is not helped by a depth-perception issue that makes it harder to know where I am / my car is on the road. This doesn't happen to motorcycle (I still have a healthy nervousness on a bike, which I think is necessary), but my family insists on me ""driving a real vehicle first"".

I want to skip it all and just get a motorcycle license, but I don't think life is taking me that way. Since I need a Class E for my future job. (A four month time limit). 

Any advice for pushing through my fear enough to get out and practice, and get a proper license? 

Thank you!",19Nov2019,1
87,"When we first met, we were both angsty tweens who hated our parents so we became...basically best friends. We’ve been through a bit together, stupid hormonal teen stuff. I won’t get into everything, but he had a suicide attempt once and shit went downhill from there. 

He got a girlfriend a month later and she was crazy, immediately talking about sex and marriage, and after they broke up she tried to get with me, I rejected her and unfriended her a few *months* later, and my old friend has completely changed from it. We used to talk about all kinds of stuff, now he’s quiet and distant, and our conversations never go further than “How are you?”

Since he’s gone to college, he has a new best friend, and he’s raising pet mice with her. We barely talk at all, and I’m always the one to initiate conversation, which again, doesn’t go anywhere. I’m well aware of how much I screwed up and I don’t deserve to be his friend, though I’m more of a bad memory and a stranger at this point. I wish none of it ever happened. I should’ve unfriended his ex girlfriend the second they broke up, but I had no spine. 

I’m not going to go on about my screw-ups. I can’t change any of it, but I just don’t know if I should even keep trying. As I’m writing this I realize I don’t belong anymore, he doesn’t get anything good out of me sticking around. I’m not working to get back into the close friend zone, but I just want to be able to talk to him again. 

This is a really messy post, but if anyone made sense out of this...what should I do? Is there anything I can do?

Quick note: I didn’t know where to mention this, but during their breakup she would use my spineless self as a flying monkey, and have me send him screenshots of whatever she wanted to say to him, but at some point I stopped doing it and just lied to her about it. I don’t know what the hell was wrong with me, getting involved like that.

88,"Hello all,

Posted this on r/careeradvice but feel like theres more traffic here. 

Would love some input on my current situation. I am 21 years old and recently took a job as a doorman for the Ritz-carlton but was offered a job at a high volume car dealership as a salesman. I like the company I'm with, they provide excellent benefits, great pay, and everyone is super nice but on the downside my job is boring and isnt challenging in the slightest. I feel like a zombie. 

The car dealership told me I should have no problem making 6 figures (all commission) and at my age thats a substantial amount of money. When talking to one of the other salesman he said expect to be working ""bell-to-bell"" and if I dont have really any hobbies outside of work then that's probably a good thing.

I'm torn because I really value my work life balance, especially with where i live and the age I'm at. I dont have any expenses and dont have much debt so either way I can save up money fast. But I also dont view either of these options as a career so they both are amazing opportunities but am having a hard time weighing the options. Thanks in advance for the advice!!",19Nov2019,1

After that I told her I’d really prefer to take her out before anything progressed, and she happily agreed and help set plans. Both times after the first cancel, she cancelled within 30 minutes of the date. Fed up, I just downloaded Tinder again and figured she was sending me a message. 

She’s now claiming she wanted to keep seeing me, but finding me on Tinder again was such a turnoff that she doesn’t think it’ll work anyways. I’m over the whole situation but I’m just curious, was I ever in the wrong? My friends have said I muffed a huge opportunity with her.",19Nov2019,1

Tonight shattered everything I thought I knew about my father.

My mother discovered that my father had personally asked another woman to make him porn videos. When confronted about it, my dad just shrugged and nonchalantly said ""I know.""

2 weeks prior to this I was in the hospital for DKA, (I'm a diabetic) And my mother stayed while my dad left. Just found out he went home to another lady.

I keep trying to get a reaction out of my dad,something anything. Yet all he does is keep telling me to leave his room and that he has to go to sleep for work tomorrow. He's treating me like i'm not even his daughter anymore.

We had planned stuff for the future just days before.

I'm trying really hard to be okay, and I'm struggling. I've gotten nightmares since I was young, and so I semi-recently started taking melatonin to help me sleep, but ever since the breakup, even with the melatonin, I've been having an even more difficult time sleeping than before I started taking it. Connecting with people helps, but I'm in a place in my life where I don't have a lot of friends (they all live far away), and even the ones I have I'm not very close to.

During the test which was located in the testing center i was being an idiot and looked up a few questions on quizlet not knowing they had full access to my computer and could see what i was doing. Towards the end after i had hit submit i went into the history tab and deleted the history. Not even a second later my mouse started moving on it’s own not knowing what to do. Shortly after they called me in and accused me of going to other sites and the only thing i could say was yes i was on other sites. Due to this my teacher had given me a 0 on the exam (which is okay because i can drop the lowest exam) but, due to lack of evidence because they had no visual information or screenshot of me using any other site i had gotten just a warning for lack of evidence. Not even 2 weeks later i get a call from the dean asking to speak to me. Anyone know either the consequences or advice for me to say to the dean tomorrow afternoon. I have absolutely earned the 0 as well as learned i need to no longer cheat. Is that enough though? i’m worried",19Nov2019,1
98,"I have a long history of different forms of malice set upon my life. I have worked hard to not live the victimized life because of it. But the feelings are still there and I know that I need to let go. Being 23 and realizing this, you can make the assumption that I've lived the life I've told you about. There's this book that comes highly recommended that helps the specific area that drives my emotions to boil. But every time I look at this book and know that it will say and go into detail of what I already know but get me to realize and understand how to move on, I take a deep breath and turn away as if fear strikes me. As if Im not ready.

No one is willing to pick me up. I am visiting the Dominican Republic, and it's not like the US. Everything is a bartering system, its dangerous from what my family tells me or visited there, and I know will stick out as a sore thumb, people can't drive here from the travel tip videos I have seen and a whole slew of issues. 
I call them Priceline, they can't change my terminal gate, nor they can give me a refund. I got a basic economy class.  I'm not sure whether or not if I can transfer my ticket or even able to sell it. 2hour phone call wasted. I could file a claim but it takes 10 days and my flights this Sunday. 


is this a loophole I can try? 
can I reschedule the flight, I know this comes with a fee to 30-200$? I'm trying to be frugal as possible.

I wasn't. This morning I woke up and she was breathing weird and I started petting her and I saw the light leave her eyes. I don't know what to do with myself now, I don't have many friends and don't go out much so she was my only company a lot. I didn't go to school today and I don't want to go tomorrow either. My room feels so empty and depressing without her. It seems like I can't stop thinking about her, idk how to recover.  
But the worst part is we didn't have the money to cremate her and we live in an APT so burial wasn't an option. So we had to have animal control take her body. And I feel terrible for it.  I don't really have anything to remember her by, so I wish I couldve had her ashes, but I can't do anything about it now. I know time heals but man this sucks and I miss her terribly",19Nov2019,1

102,"So my company has annual reviews, it was my first one, so I spoke honestly. What a mistake that turned out to be.

I got called into a conference room today with my manager and the COO. What this meeting actually was, was the COO trying to provoke me and trying to make me feel stupid.

All of my complaints he basically said that I can’t speak for others (even though I hear complaints every day), that I don’t actually know what I’m talking about and that they already do the stuff I was proposing. 

This guy treated me like a child. I am only 23 but I am still entitled to a level of respect. He was trying to provoke me and actively got me to argue with him. He said “Do you even want to be here?” (So threatening to fire me, but calling it quitting).

It got to the point where he asked me “So, what do you want to do??” And I said “Nothing, I guess. Let’s just ignore the problems.” Again he provoked me so I said that I wasn’t going to take part in this anymore and I walked out.

I think it’s clear grounds for HR but my HR department is also a problem. My buddy already reported the COO once for standing on a chair and yelling at us about how we can’t send emails like his example. He had printed out my coworkers email, didn’t cover his name and pretty much actively shamed him in front of the entire company. The HR said “Well, meet with him and talk it out.”

So they are totally ineffective but I feel like I should still put this on record right?

109,"I feel really really awful admitting this. But I really don’t like the cat I adopted. 
I adopted him about exactly a year ago, and have stuck it out hoping he would grow out of it or stop his antics but he has not changed at all. And nothing I do discourages his behavior. 
He is extremely destructive no matter how much attention I give him or how many toys I get for him. He destroys the bathroom, any papers left out, the couch, literally anything in his path. He has annoyed my roommates and I feel awful because I give him as much attention as I can working full time. 
The worst part is what he does to my other cat. I’ve had her for four years and she has never caused any issues. He constantly torments her and chases her around, making her do this awful panther-like scream that wakes the whole house up. I try to keep them separated but it’s not realistic as I only rent one room in a house with 2 others. If I try a spray bottle when he attacks her he continues the attack, if I yell, if I try to grab him, if I try to distract him, he continues. Literally nothing scares or stops him. 
I have tried what feels like everything for the last year of my life and have not been able to make this work. I would feel like an awful person rehoming him but no idea what to do. It’s not fair to my other cat and not fair to my roommates to have to deal with my demon cat.

111,"I apologize for this reference, but it's like on the Big Bang Theory (The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis) where Sheldon talks about the gift giving: 


&gt;*The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you’ve given me.*


I've only been with my boyfriend for around 5 months, next month as well as Christmas it's his birthday too. The issue is the above conundrum.


I've got to figure out an appropriate gift that he'll like (buying for guys can be tricky, and novelty gifts or socks aren't appropriate for a boyfriend), that I can afford (as I'm poor), and that will match whatever he gets me for Christmas...


It's complicated by the fact that with his birthday around the same time I'll essentially be getting him twice as much as he'd be getting me anyway, but if I also go overboard it'll be even worse. 


My boyfriend and I dated around 10 years ago around this time of year too, I was more into him than he was into me, this situation came up then too. I gave him what I thought was an appropriate gift with two CDs from his favourite artist, a bottle of whiskey, music books for his guitar, and a personalized Zippo all nicely wrapped...he got me a CD, he also just wrapped it in loads of paper which made it all the more awkward to open after I'd given him his gift. It was so incredibly awkward and upsetting. That was 10 years ago, but that situation just adds to my anxiety over this!

He is extremely antisocial and almost avoids any and all human contact. He seldom leaves his house and didn’t go as far as to complete high school when we were younger. Which i believe may have had a snowball effect on his self esteem. 

This was the point in time when him and i parted ways. I had gone years without speaking or seeing him. But after reconnecting he had informed me that he wasn’t up to anything at all. He just lived his life in the solitary confinement of his room, playing xbox from the minute he woke up to the minute he slept. 

I had the courage to ask him tonight: “are you depressed”

to which there was a long pause and he replied 
“that’s pretty much become the standard”

I then just felt so awful. Like i had abandoned him all these years, without even a thought of checking in on him until recently

If i didn’t plug in my xbox just to talk to him i wouldn’t have had any other way of contacting him... mainly because he hasn’t owned a phone since 2013 and i didn’t wanna randomly show up at his house.

Only when it involves studying or something academic i am included(i tend to do well in school)

I mean, if there wasn’t anything wrong with me then why do I cut myself? Why do I feel suicidal 4 out of the 7 days of the week? Why do I twitch when I’m uncomfortable? Why can’t I talk to strangers without psyching myself up first? Why do I sometimes feel like killing my family? Why does death seem more interesting than life when I’m not even officially an adult yet? Why do I sometimes have panic attacks? Why am I never truly happy for more than a moment? Why do I always have an impending sense of doom? 

I’ve tried talking to my mother but she says my feeling are normal for my age. I had a panic attack when I was 10.  She also knows I cut myself but she’s never said a word about it. 

I guess it’s kind of my fault for not getting the point across to her because I physically can’t talk about anything serious face to face with someone without crying but I’ve tried to give her nonverbal signs. I’m actually choking up just writing this. I’ve left her obvious hints but she just doesn’t seem to want to accept it and I don’t know why.

My dad treats my mom like a queen and me like a sack of potatoes. When I am just siting in the couch my dad says move your mom wants to sit there. I tell him no and he yells at me. When my mom wants a drink my dad says go get your mom a drink. When I say no he says she works all day. I say I go to school all day and I get sent to my room. Sometimes I get really mad and my parents and they get mad at me too. But like an hour later they aren’t mad at me anymore. They also treat my brother nice sometimes. They let him buy things and he pays for half of it but he buys expensive things but I don’t get anything. The money was from my parents for his birthday but all they gave me was $5.

My roommates touch their feet all the time and its starting to make me nauseous just thinking about it. They touch their feet whenever they're lounging on the couch and it makes me nauseous a little just thinking about it. At first it was just that I could look away and it wouldn't bother me but now it really gets to me.

Thinking about/seeing them touch their feet (especially when they touch other things without washing their hands) makes me feel so disgusted. I have to look away or it gives me a skin-crawling feeling. I always loved scary movies and video games so I've never had a problem with gore but one of my medical shows once had a picture of a diseased foot that made me start crying. It felt similar to past panic attacks which is why I'm concerned it's going to keep getting worse.


I know this sounds like a joke but I am serious, I don't want this to become something that hinders any day to day activity like seeing people wearing sandals in public or even taking care of my own feet (because that is starting to affect me aswell.)

133,"I created a throw away for this because I don't want this associated with my regular account.

I've known my husband for 12+ years. We started dating 5.5 years ago, we have a child together who is 2.5yo, we have been married about 6 months.

For the last 2+ years he's been in and out of the hospital for mental health and physical health. He was misdiagnosed with a mental disorder he didn't have and has only been dealing with being off of those medications and only on anxiety meds for about a year now and a few weeks ago it was determined he most likely has fibromyalgia.

Our child was at Grandma and Grandpa's for a few days until last night. Before we went to pick up the kiddo, he wanted to watch a movie and I wanted to play my 3ds so I watched the movie with him while I played and thought everything was fine. We cuddled and had adult time then left to get the kid.

We came home and I'd been up since early that morning so I went to bed around 10 and was up at around 7. I got kiddo up and when he came down it was around noon and I was making her lunch. When I was done I went to go sit down and he very angrily stormed to the kitchen and I heard banging. I went to check and he said he thought I was making him something too and was really angry. I told him sorry, that he doesn't usually eat anything when he first wakes up and didn't ask for anything and he got mad and said I didn't even ask him.

Now I get that he's a grown man and can make his own food, but with all the pain he's been in and the fatigue, standing for prolonged periods can make him really dizzy and so I often just make the food. It's not a big deal because I'm usually cooking for everyone anyway.

Our kiddo went in timeout for some reason a while after this angry outburst, after which he went to the couch and curled up under a blanket barely responding to me. I made him food, told him about it, he didn't eat it or move. Kiddo kept getting out of the chair and crying loudly and he got up very suddenly, moved the chair to face a different direction, screamed something about you are in time out stop getting up and sit there. I told him not to scream at kiddo and that's not ok.

I'm not sure exactly the words that were said but shortly after this screaming at kiddo he screamed even louder ""DADDY WANTS TO BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU RIGHT NOW"" to which I immediately pushed him into a laying down position, sat down on him, and told him very sternly that's not ok to say and do I need to take kiddo and leave and call the police? He started repeating ""I hate myself"" over and over and over and I repeated it, pulling out my phone. He said no.

He's at work right now and I moved the safe with his gun in it to a place I don't *think* he'll be able to find it because I don't trust him right now, to scream that right at our child. Even if the kid is that young, even if you *think* they won't understand the words, that's NOT ok.

I don't know how he's going to react to me having moved the safe. But I don't want to lose him. I even think I should contact grandma and grandpa to see if they can take it out of the house. I love him. But with that outburst? I can't take that risk.

I believe him when he says I don't need to call the police but when I ask if he's ok he just shrugs. He's not a liar, just keeps A LOT to himself. I'm just not sure if what I did was the right thing to do it if I should do more?",19Nov2019,1

135,"My best friend in the world decided to cheat on her boyfriend of 5 years three months ago. She cheated on him with multiple men, then she found out she was pregnant a month ago. Apparently, that made her have a “change of heart” and decided she wanted to be with her long term boyfriend. She told him it’s his baby when she know it isn’t because he pulls out every time, yet she let all these other guys cum in her.
It is keeping me up at night because I just can’t believe someone could do this to someone they’ve dated for so long. I’ve told her how disgusted I am and she says I’m being dramatic.
What would you do in my situation? Would you tell her boyfriend? I’m good friends with him too, but not as close as I am to her. Would you stop being friends with her? What would you do?
I feel like it’s affecting me on a really deep, personal level and I don’t know how to move on knowing this poor guy is basically getting scammed and humiliated. Guess I just need to know an outsiders opinion. :( And how can I move on from this? It’s annoying that it’s affected me more than it is her.

136,"So this is gonna be a long one.
Here’s the backstory: so there’s this dude let’s call him George. He liked me and he told me on Instagram. We talked a little and I started to like him back. Few weeks later we talk in person for the first time. It was really awkward. Before we talked he told me he loved everything about me and that I was perfect. Later that day he told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship. He also mentioned he was cheated on by this one girl let’s call her Samantha.(she did not cheat) I was very confused and felt like he lead me on.
So then heres when things get interesting. A week later My dumbass decided to tell people in my math class what happened. Apparently this one dude was close with Samantha so he told her. Things got out of control from here. I actually showed Samantha screenshots of what he said, she went off on him. So he obviously found out I told her. George has anger issues, really bad. I didn’t know this. I found out he was pissed at me and I was sure he was gonna beat my ass. 
He was pissed at me for at least 2 weeks. At my school instead of semesters we have quarters and every quarter we get a new schedule. My new schedule has 3 classes with George. The first day of the quarter george messaged me on Instagram and I was obviously suprised to see that. He said he wanted to drop everything that happened. I apologized.
So he has never talked to me since. I really want to talk to him. I’m worried if he’ll get pissed at me again. I still have feelings for him and I just want to talk to him just to know for sure if he’s still pissed. I don’t want a relationship I just want to know he’s not pissed and be on good terms. Should I talk to him again? If so what should I say?",19Nov2019,1

139,"I have depression and anxiety and was a young carer for my mother for several years before she died a year ago. I don't have any family and I only really have my boyfriend. 

I've had talking therapy in the past and found it really helpful. I had a great relationship with my therapist and would come back to her each week with new milestones. 

I thought seeing this new therapist would be a renewal of that progress and it'd kickstart me back on the path of improvement but it really hasn't been the case.

I go to this therapist and I bring up a lot of old issues and get riled up and upset and then the session ends and I go home and I'm massively depressed for the next few days and spend time laying in bed feeling low instead of doing anything constructive.

I've brought this up to the therapist and I've even tried to avoid getting upset but it keeps happening. I know I sound like an idiot - oh yeah I don't want to get upset during therapy. But it's not that. . I've had therapy in the past. I've gone over these things. They're not repressed emotions or anything. And even then back when I talked about this stuff I don't recall the same depressive state resulting from it.

I feel like I'm hurting myself rather than healing. I've been very depressed since the anniversary of my mother's death and I've been focusing on self care just to lift myself out of depression and do constructive things. Last week I actually went into therapy feeling happy and positive and excited about some stuff that was happening. I told all of this to my therapist at the start of the session and she commented on my good mood. Then I don't know what happened but the therapy took a negative turn and I got so incredibly upset I couldn't even sit still in the chair and was balling my eyes out.

And I feel like that was the last straw. What's the point if it makes you miserable and has no positive effects and even ruins good days for you?",19Nov2019,1
140,"So, about a year ago, my mom started caring for her dad. He's on dialysis, and he has maybe mid stages dementia. My mom has him on a good schedule, for changing and all that, and it's common knowledge that sometimes he calls out (a lot at night), and that all he needs is some reassurance that someone is there. 

Now, my dad hasn't been helping at all, to the point where he outright said he wouldn't help my mom with anything. My dad is repeatedly rude under his breath about my grandpa, keeps offering food and drinks (grandpa can't have a lot of things), and acts high and mighty because he took time out of his computer time to ask him what was wrong when he calls out. He also refuses to prepare any of his medications or dinner, something me and my brother do when my mom's working. 

This frustrates me to no end, because I know how hard my mom works to take care of him all while waiting for the state to compensate for her time. Should I talk to my mom about this? I had asked her before and she told me to let it alone, that ""he's doing what he thinks is the right thing"".",19Nov2019,1
141,"Best friend/roommate has a gold digger mom and a lucky life

I am a good person/friend and rarely speak rudely of people I care about. I am pissed,frustrated, stressed, annoying and any other synonyms to those words to say the least. My best friend of a couple years now and I recently moved in together. Of course when you move in with someone you learn a lot about them. Angie always came off as a rich but scummy stoner chick who gets white girl wasted and prefers fancy cheese. That describes her pretty well and sounds like a fun person to be friends with right? 

Ok short story long, Angie is blind in one eye- this might be the reason that she has been the at-fault driver in 7 car accidents now besides the fact that Angie says that she “daydreams while I drive”.... Anyways she recently totaled her car and her gold digging mama bought her a brand new Toyota RAV4 deluxe edition. Mind you that her mom thinks this is a shitty car to give her shitty driving daughter  -given she is rich af and drives a rover.  COOL. 

I barely make month to month bills and recently got in a fender bender and haven’t had the money to fix my car so I ride my bike to work. (Winters coming soon so wish your girl luck). 

I found out that Angie pays NO bills. Here’s her bills by month...Rent is $700. Utilities $100. Groceries including fancy cheese (nearly) $200 a month for just herself-most gets thrown away due to eating meals out. Car insurance $600 (7 at fault accidents). Medical bills $150. Phone bill/payment plan (due to too drunk and lost phone at a bar) $400.  OKAY. WOO. You add that up because I can’t even count that high....(roughly $2100 a mo??)) plus the new car that’s 25 grand probably paid in full..oh oh and college tuition is paid for. No debt. YAY

EVERYTHING is paid for. But the thing is is Angie likes to tell people that she’s independent and likes a simple living. She’s a sweet sweet girl but a lot of trauma- thanks to gold digging bitch mom (3rd marriage- 12 times moving to new rich daddies in a 20 year span). 

I am so stressed about money and bills and maybe one day having a decent car and a house and my best friend sits there throwing unused expired groceries away. 

How can I make this situation feel better in my head? I am losing my mind and I think it might interfere with our friendship at some point which SUCKS.. any advice? i don’t know if I can stand watching all this If you’ve read this far thank you, and please don’t be a gold digging sack of shit because you people suck",19Nov2019,1

143,"I'm a sophomore currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Environmental Science. I just joined reddit specifically for advice on this topic, because I'm in an unusual situation where my family and friends are too distant to help me in this situation.

I'm in college and I hate it. I'm lonely all the time and yet am surrounded by people and never get any privacy or time to myself. I live with a roomate who is usually in the room as often as I am. I dont have any true friends, except for my boyfriend who I have known since high school. I am not good at making friends, and every person I try to get close to slips away. I have a job on campus, and its genuinely the only thing that makes me happy. I prefer working over academia so much, but my family has always emphasized school as the most important and valuable thing in life. My dad and older graduated sibling always say how they wish they could go back to college. I just dont feel the same and would much rather be working in an industry for the rest of my life instead of studying. Unfortunately, being in a scientific field, I need a degree to get any basic job. I know I have to finish school, but I feel so strongly that if I were just working already I would be so much h happier. Being away from home hurts me too, as I will never be able to think of a dorm as my home, not even temporarily. 

The last issue is that I do have a history with mental illness. I think counseling might help in this situation, but being that I'm far from home and dont have easy access to off campus resources it's not really a convenient option right now (my school offers free counseling for short periods, bit eventually they sell you off to a licensed counselor somewhere else, and they typically only prioritize dire situations). I just dont know what to do really. Like I could make friends, get counseling, or move back home/drop out, but in reality, none of those are easy or even good options. I just want to hear other people's experiences in college or any advice people might have for someone who is trapped on a path that makes them unhappy, even if it's only temporary.",19Nov2019,1
145,"I’m a girl in high school. In the past, I used to have a handful of friends I was really close to, but we faded away due to various circumstances. As I’ve matured, I stopped dealing with bs that my past self would’ve dealt with, and with this matured mindset (I guess) came less friends. Nowadays, I’m to myself and don’t socialize much like I did before; for example, going to lunch alone and chilling in my car, going straight home after school, etc.,  which also made it easy for me to avoid drama. At first I never felt bad about being to myself; I enjoyed my own company. But I’ve been feeling lonely lately, especially after receiving news that my favorite YoungLife leader would be leaving our school— the only person I was vulnerable with.

I’m usually introverted but this year I’ve been trying to be more outgoing and talking to others to make new friends, and that hasn’t been going well either. I get blown off a lot in text when I try to carry conversation, so either they aren’t a texting person, they’re not interested, or I’m really annoying them... It’s tiring and feels like I’m talking to a brick wall. (I’ve just stopped texting them altogether because I got tired of mugging myself off. We talk well in class, though. Just aren’t very close, at least yet.)

More and more people get closer in their little circles around me and even when I’m surrounded by others, I feel really alone. It didn’t help that most of the people I grew familiar with graduated. There are so many times where I want to remove myself from a social situation and just crawl into a hole. 

How can I get over this and make some friends without forcing it? Should I just stop trying? I’ve never struggled with this before.

153,"You guys are going to need to do better. I'll go through advice in the other thread and why it isn't helpful. Remember, **the goal is to at least have regular good casual sex, but really aiming for a long term relationship, so anything on that spectrum will be better than nothing.**

I'm in my 30s.

&gt; When people tell you to find hobbies ... How about joining a class instead? Something you will do with others that will let you meet new people.

There just aren't any, not that I'm actually interested in or would actually help me reach my goal. It is up to you to make an argument for how X hobby will get me a relationship, not on my to slave away at one pointless thing or another--enjoying none of it because it isn't want I actually want to do--until I die.

&gt; But a toxic mindset can keep you single. 

What mindset will get my what I want/need? 

&gt; If I'd given up...well, I'd still be single. It's that simple. Doesn't mean that sticking with it will definitely work, but you know what means it definitely won't work? Giving up on it.

But that isn't a solution. I don't need to not do what won't work I need to do what will work. There will always be more things that don't work so that isn't a good strategy. ""Sticking with it"" and it never working out isn't good enough. Let's focus on actually achieving my goal.

&gt; You don't approach girls. How do you expect to go on dates if not by meeting and talking to them?

How do they expect to go on dates? It's the same. Which girls to approach? Where? How? How many until it works? I try to meet and talk with them but none will allow me to be around them in a setting where it would be appropriate to try to be anything more than friends / colleagues / strangers. Either I risk accidentally harassing women or I'm too shy. Where's the middle ground? I need specific details. Give me a plan. You can't? OK, then how do we get my to my goal?

Let's get one thing out of the way: I have other things in life good enough. I'm not obsessed, I just know what I want and all my other interests are reasonably satisfied. This is the one area that isn't. So, let's not shame me for having healthy sexual/romantic/relationship interests, ok?

I think I'm a good enough person already, I don't need to ""work on myself,"" or another way to put it, I'm already working on myself as much as is possible. I'm already the kind of person I'd date. I already know what kind of girl I'd date, and I'm also not that picky. I don't want to get into specifics because someone will try to use that against me.

&gt; Learn to enjoy your own company. Be happy with yourself.

I already can and do, but that isn't a substitute for my goals. Would any happily married person be just as well of with separating from their spouse and spending the rest of their life as single and enjoying their own company / being happy with themselves? If you want to apply a rule to me then also apply it to yourself and to the people you love: if it isn't good enough for others then it isn't good enough for me.

I don't need a relationship to ""fix"" my life, I just know what I want.

I have a healthy sense of self confidence: not low confidence, not arrogant.

I don't believe in the idea of ""leagues.""

&gt; The point of improving yourself and getting new hobbies is to meet new people and strike up a conversation with them about your shared activity. 

There just isn't anything like that which will also get me what I want. You tell me what will get me sex and / or a relationship with sex. I've already considered everything available to me. If I hadn't I wouldn't be asking for advice in the first place. 

I've already tried therapy, several therapists, I've given it time, tried several kinds.

If you tell me to improve myself then you need to also tell me what specifically it is and convince me it will lead to me actually achieving my goals. If you can't do that then you just aren't giving useful advice.

&gt; And while you'll likely face more rejection than acceptances, there WILL be acceptances as well. You just have to do the hard part and start.

I *did* the hard part, I started and kept at it for years, and all I got was rejection. Where's the acceptance? Who? How do you know it will happen? I've already lost out of so much time that even if it ""eventually"" happens it will be far less good than 40+ years of acceptance. I've lost, I'm losing and no one will help me.

&gt; Maybe meet some of the people in your yoga class? Go to church? Take some of the classes at your gym to meet people? Maybe try clubsport like Ultimate Frisbee or something?

But which one will get me sex or a sexual relationship? I've already tried those things and they didn't work. There aren't any like that where I live that I genuinely enjoy AND will get me to my goal.

Now 2 months ago is when it started getting bad she got her first dab pen and started getting high most days including at school. I was tryna tell her to stop doing that at school like prioritize the thing that is important and party after. Then she tried shrooms honestly I was on board with this I'm a somewhat of a psychonaut so I made sure she knew how to do it safely and the correct dose she had a great time. But then since then it's just been down shes gonna try ecstasy next month she basically has her mind set on it and last weekend she did Pam's percs and xans at the same time. She has an addictive personality and loves it she doesnt see what's wrong. She likes to compare herself to other people and thinks that just cauze she knows people that have done things that she will be fine to. I think that's a dumb way of looking at things.
The way I look at drugs is they're tools and there is a right and wrong way to use them I think she doesnt know how to use them and I just wanted her to research and know what shes doing. 
So I need advice I will be showing her the replies so you can address things right to her if you want if you think she will be fine tell her if you have gone through things like that what did you go through and how did it turn out. If it went good what did it do to go good please be detailed

I guess I lived a sheltered college life because this is a recent problem with work/grad social life. My closest friend there didn’t drink either along with some others, or so I thought.

These anxiety issues only started after I learned that a friend of mine might have been drinking throughout college. I’m not super in touch with them, but the fact that I thought they were in a similar boat to me and definitely aren’t now is driving me crazy. This person is also really secretive at times so I don’t even know how I would confront them directly about it.

Anyway, at work everyone will have lunch and almost everyone will order something alcoholic, except me. I get really quiet and anxious and now if I even see a red solo cup i kinda freak out a little bit. I guess the advice I’m looking for is: 

Should I confront the friend that may have started this? I feel like understanding their perspective might help calm me down. But how would I even text/call them out of the blue to start asking a personal question like that?

Long post

TLDR: male friend is too close even though he says he’s not interested in me. Boyfriend doesn’t like he gets this close and ask me to stop. Friend held my hand and I shut down and didn’t tell him to stop. How do I tell my friend he needs to stop?

For detail, I have a male friend who I’ve known for 3-4 years now. He has always been a bit too friendly but in the past when I or other people have asked if he wanted to date me he always said no. I always bought it was a friend thing and   But it is a bit weird. My boyfriend noticed this at a party, expressed his discomfort and asked me to tell my friend to stop. This causes my boyfriend a bit of stress and I don’t want to upset him because I really love him.

We discussed this last night as I was gonna hang out with him the next day. I finally understood (I have a processing issue do it takes me a few times to understand something) and agreed that I wouldn’t hold his hand or let him kiss me in the cheek and tell him to stop, but I was nervous. I have anxiety, i suffered neglect and verbal abuse at the hands of my father ever since I was young. When he would yell at me I would get extremely anxious and learned the best way to get him to stop yelling and humiliating me/keep him from yelling and humiliate me was to keep my head down and go along with whatever he said. My anxiety is better now but I still tend to shut down in distressing situations that I find hard to keep up with. 

I hung out with my male friend today, we were in his car and he was dropping me off at the train station, he kept holding my hand. I tried to tell him that he needed to stop but i didn’t know what to say and I got so anxious that my mouth got so dry and I couldn’t open my mouth to speak, I could feel my brain shut off. Then we were at the train station, he hugged me and kissed my cheek. 

I feel so guilty and ashamed. I told my boyfriend I would tell my friend to stop but i panicked. I don’t want to upset or lose my boyfriend. How do I tell my male friend to stop? What should I say to my boyfriend? Please help",19Nov2019,1

My brother is an uninsured driver so he's been expecting he'll have to pay for whatever damages the other car ended up with. Today, the other driver texts him the message above--""the car was totaled and my parents are claiming it on their insurance.""

My question is simply, what does this mean for my brother? Will he still have to pay? Will the other driver's insurance company charge him? None of us have ever gotten into a situation like this before so we have zero experience and I thought I'd ask here.

173,"I graduated with a bachelor degree in education and wanted to be a teacher. I volunteered at multiple schools most of my teenage years and I loved working with children; however, teaching is a different story. I can’t imagine myself as an elementary school teacher anymore, especially with finding a decent paying job with a bachelor degree. The pay is so horrible and I’m living paycheck to paycheck. 

I’ve been applying for jobs and my new work place offered the highest pay so far ($20/hr - teaching); however, it’s impossible to get a day off and the environment is toxic. Everyone makes a big deal out of everything and if they have a problem with you, they don’t tell you. They would tell another teacher to tell you and my boss is the same way. All the teachers go directly to the boss and I’ve been told “you’re not doing your job” when I asked for help. 

I’m thinking of leaving the educational field completely, but all of my experiences are teaching/children related. What’s a good way to get out of this situation and figured out another way/career choice for me? When I got hired, they request that I stay for at least a year before I go because they want it to be consistent for the children.

the second I walked into work, on the other end of the store about 100 feet away from where she is, she instantly noticed and looked over at me.. and sure enough, she was wearing a pink hoodie very similar to the one I wore a few days ago..

i've never seen her wear this hoodie in the year I've been working here.. coincidence?

I mean to notice me within like literally two seconds of walking in a busy store from about 100 feet away, wearing this hoodie.. it may be a subtle hint?

175,"Currently I am a film student and the moment I started the class I felt something incredibly off. I have always heard of the film industry being incredibly sexist towards actors and actresses; but I never thought about it happening behind the scenes.  Wanting to become a director in the future is a bit of a far fetched career path to grasp fully; but I want to be able to go into this strong. 

My problem is that I find it baffling that I am only in my first semester of college and I have been turned down to edit for someone else's film and it was obvious that it was because I am a female. Then when a guy says they edit although it is just imovie editing; they are suddenly gods and get asked to edit for people constantly. The moment that my short film for class was presented,  people who rejected me wanted me to edit for them all of a sudden. I declined since I have multiple other projects to do for myself. 

I can't believe that this is actually happening ao early into the career path I've chosen and I'm not too sure how to deal with most of these guys.  I literally acted in someone's film recently with a male co-star whom I helped get the part in the first place.

After those months, we stopped talking. I couldn’t get him out of my head. like at all. a week or so would go by and i’d keep thinking about him and I never officially got over him. a couple months ago he started to talk to me again and I realized that I still feel for him.

he always cancels on our plans but always tries to reconnect, he makes plans and then bails. I make plans and then he bails. he does a variety of drugs (pills, bud, wax, etc) and usually is really disconnected, but told me earlier that he can always come to me and is always snapping me when he’s on his phone and that he loves talking to me, and cares about me even if it doesn’t come off like that

Today she yelled so loud it hurt my ears (kind of an exxageracitiifjsnbsjehion, can’t spell it) Mrs m had to yell at her so much it got to the point where Grill was about to be sent to the office. She doesn’t realize what a normal inside voice is. Instead of going up to talk to people she yells across the room. She also does this sometimes when the teacher is talking. I’ve told her to be quiet sometimes but she never listens. Sometimes I tell her nobody cares when she shouts across the room but she doesn’t listen. I told my parents about how annoying she was but my mom said “maybe she has problems at home so she wants to be a teachers pet”. But I’m not sure what problems at home would cause her to be a teachers pet. One time she said she was going to kill someone. I couldn’t tell if she was serious because the girl Grill said she was going to kill is her good friend. I’m not sure if she was serious and Idk if she got into any trouble for it.

We've told each other and other people in the band that we don't have crushes on each other. This kid knows that even if he did have a crush on me, I like someone else and (sort of) have a boyfriend anyway. 

I sat with this kid on the band bus on Saturday, and two of my friends sat behind me. One of them will absolutely not stop teasing me and him for sitting together on the bus. She keeps saying that ""we would make a cute couple,"" I'm ""cheating on my boyfriend,"" ""when's the wedding,"" and other stuff like that. We told her several times to stop, because neither of us found it funny or liked it.  Even though I told her to stop , she still continued, but still thinks she has the right to pull my hat off of my head for ""saying something mean to her.""

This morning in the band room, she told me that she ""didn't have enough energy to tell me off."" What did I possibly do that gives her the right to ""tell me off"" besides stand up for myself when I was being teased and clearly had enough of it?

I feel like she's going to try and blame me for ""being rude to her"" or something like that because I'm actually standing up for myself, then play the victim and force me to apologize for the entire situation, which neither me or my other friend started. Just because two people of the opposite gender are friends doesn't make them a romantic couple. I also know that for a fact, she wouldn't like it either if she was in my place. 

She has manipulated people into thinking she is the victim before, even though she was the cause of the problem, and directed the blame onto someone else (me). She did this last year. As a result, it severed my friendship with one of my closest and dearest friends, and her mom will forever (or for a very long time) hate me for something I didn't start.

204,"Hello.

Here's a fun one. Midway through the year, me and my long-time roommate lost our apartment. She is part of what I consider my chosen family, having lived together for the better part of a decade. While we save up and look for a new place, I've been staying with her parents who have been happy to have me around, especially as I help around the house and get along well with the father, who's happy to have someone who'll listen to him. I've also taken an active part in helping take care of my friend's daughter who they have custody of and they recognize me as extended family at this point. My roommate is staying elsewhere, with mutual friends. 

Here's the problem. I also come with a dog, a giant sweetheart American bulldog (10 years old), who while not officially registered as a service dog has very much been an emotional support animal for me for the last 10 years, as I've dealt with the stress of living as an immigrant in the US and struggling with depression and mental health issues. There are days I wouldn't have gotten out of bed if I didn't know I had to take care of him or out of the house if I didn't have to walk him, there are times he's been my only companion through some real, real chaotic, stressful periods of my life, I've learned so much about patience and discipline and love from having him in my life. I wouldn't still be here without him making me go on at some of my lowest times. Only problem is he doesn't get along with other dogs and isn't good at sharing toys. My friend's parents offered to take care of him during the day so I could go work, and I left them with explicit instructions to keep him and their pug separated, only interacting outside or while supervised by me, a strong, healthy 35 year old. We try integrating them little by little, but I can tell my dog is getting frustrated since the pug won't leave him alone, and I restate my wish to keep them separated because they're not getting along. They agree and I think that's the end of it. 

What happens next is that while I'm at work for the day is that they decide to not keep them separated and they get into a fight for the first time in the three months I've been staying there. My friend's mother reacts instinctively and sticks her arm between them to stop them and gets caught by my dog's set of two front teeth (top and bottom), who pierces the skin but immediately stops when he realizes what happened. She acknowledges to both me and the doctor that she knows how to stop a dog fight properly and just stupidly reacted instead of grabbing the neck/collar and that's why she got caught, and that it was a completely accidental bite. The pug is okay, my friend's mother's arm is bruised and she's going to have to wear a bandage for a week or two, but otherwise fine. But they want the dog out. They're fine with me staying, but they want the dog to leave. And even though they offered to take care of my pet in my absence and then went against my explicit instructions for his well-being and put him in a situation he couldn't win, she still got bit and I'm still a guest in their house. 

My roommate can't take the dog, because she's staying with two dog aggressive dogs already. We don't have enough money for a new apartment at this point, and can't afford anything but extremely short-term solutions which will burn through our funds before Christmas. I'm not prepared to give up my dog because they didn't follow the given instructions and set him up to fail. To make the situation even worse, my friend's father is having heart issues and they absolutely need the help around the house I provide, whether he ends up having surgery or not.

I think that's about it. I'm still on good terms with them, my dog is not. They're effectively making me choose between him and them, him means a month or two of expensive, short term solutions, them means unending sorrow and never forgiving myself. 

What the fuck do I do? I don't want to be homeless, I don't want to blow all our money on a motel. I can't give up my dog. Is there anywhere I can turn? Any advice or suggestion would be cool. I have zero ideas, nowhere to go longterm, my anxiety is spiking and I can't lose my dog. 2019 has been a real shit show and I really kind of blame myself for thinking it had stopped being a shit show for a minute there. I'm in Massachussets, if it matters.

208,"The sexual acts that are appealing to me are performing oral and being pegged. The latter is considered very kinky by many people but because I am only attracted to women and my sexuality is centered around being penetrated it is a vanilla as it gets in my mind. My dysphoria is severe enough that any sort of intentional touching of my penis by a partner is a massive trigger/ turn off so obviously I will never use my actual penis to penetrate a woman but would be happy use a strap-on to do so.

I know this makes me incompatible with the majority of women but I know for a fact that some women would not have a problem with this (I have had conversations with women here on reddit who have said what I desire would be very appealing to them but of course they live very far from me). I just want to know how I can communicate this and find a compatible partner without people thinking that I am pervert.",19Nov2019,1

210,"About month ago, I was home during lunch and heard my boyfriend's ""second phone"" go off. I happened to glance at it, and it was from a female. I didn't look at the messages. Later, that day I asked who she was. He stated ""she was an old friend, she is just a really super nice girl who messages me sometimes"". I asked ""if there was anything I needed to worry about?"" He said no and we were fine.

About a week later, she tries to add me on Facebook. I had a gut wrenching feeling so I went through his messages. It turns out they talked pretty regularly. They even called each other at one point. Talked about hanging out, she invited him to her place. He had been messaging her first and did it while I was at my parent's house. To me, it looks like they never hung out but were definitely making plans.

I called him out on it. I didn't tell him I went through the messages. I asked what was going on and that the situation was weird. Eventually, it comes out that they are exs. That he thought it was ""no big deal"". That he thought she and I could be good friends and wanted us all to hangout (with her boyfriend, too). I was still unhappy, but he claimed nothing happened, apologized, and stated he would make his intentions clear.

He told her that I wasnt comfortable with the situation, and she said she understood. Next day, he adds her on Snapchat and they talked for a few days. I look now about a month later and all of these messages are gone. Including pictures she sent of him in a bra. (for ""weight loss tips"").

212,"I’ve gotten myself in to kind of a weird position, and I have no idea what to do. I think my best friend is toxic. We’re complete opposites and just sort of fell in to being friends, but because my first 2 1/2 years of high school I had no friends (moving to a new state where I don’t fit in at all) so I sort of stuck with her and we got really really close. She has this “holier than thou” mindset and it fucks with me a lot considering I’m a extremely compassionate almost to a fault. I always bend over backwards for her when she’s upset which happens a lot, then says that I’m the sensitive one and I overreact. Obviously we do have really good times, but more often than not we usually leave from hanging out annoyed or upset with each other. So, I don’t know what to do. If i cut her off and stopped being friends with her, i would go back to really having nobody which I did for over two years and threw me in to a deep depression. I only have 6 months left of high school so I’m trying to decide if it’s worth it to cut her off and be a longer for my senior year, or become a stronger person and just deal with it so I can make high school memories.

213,"About a month ago, I [F19] met a guy on Tinder and we really hit it off. We were talking every day and hanging out multiple times a week. We had sex and I’d spend the night at his place and we’d literally just cuddle the whole time. He even gave me a stick and poke tattoo. We were just sitting at home, and he offered to do it. For the most part it sounds unimportant but it made me feel kind of special I guess. I really enjoy his company and I’ve developed feelings for him. It’s been forever since I’ve felt this way about another person. Unfortunately, he all of a sudden no longer has time for me. He doesn’t want to hang out anymore and we don’t talk unless I contact him first. I’ve asked if anything happened but he says he just wants time to myself. Normally if someone ignores me, I’m pretty content moving on but being ignored by him just makes me sad and I feel so pathetic. Should I just move on?",19Nov2019,1

I know I am on him about his driving but I try so hard not to say anything , I'm just genuinely scared. He is always saying he is tired of me, and I see why. I can be pretty annoying and nag a lot.

219,"I’m a senior in college and am having some trouble dealing with one of my friends who is also my roommate (L). We met freshman year, and have lived together since. L is fun to be around most of the time, but when she gets upset or is not having a good time, it makes everyone uncomfortable and brings the mood down. This year, we moved in with two friends in our friend group, and all 4 of us primarily hang out with each other. Three of us are go-with-the-flow type of people, and don’t really have any issues with each other. However, we run into conflicts with L because she is very privileged, judgmental/negative, and has high expectations (and gets frustrated when things don’t go her way). Often, we feel like we’re walking on eggshells around her because we don’t want to set her off. She comes from a very wealthy family, and we recognize these traits stem from the way she was brought up. She has other friends, but they can be flaky and aren’t always there for her. The four of us have been close since freshman year, and have experienced a lot together. Despite her flaws, she has been supportive and good friend when any of us went through bad breakups/hard times.

A few weeks ago we tried to address some of these issues by bringing up how some of her behaviors made us feel. She felt attacked even though we were just calmly explaining the situation and our feelings. She took responsibility for some behaviors but also tried to manipulate some situations in order to minimize her actions. A recurring theme in some of the situations is she makes critical/judgmental comments about us individually, but couldn’t handle it when we tried to have a productive discussion about how we felt. 

L needs positive people in her life, and we feel like if we abandon her it would severely impact her mental health. She hasn’t seen a professional, but I feel like she has some symptoms of depression and anxiety (especially about feeling excluded from the group). If the three of us want to go somewhere, and she didn’t particularly want to, she would still come (and complain a little bit) because she has serious FOMO. She considers us her closest friends, and would be very hurt if we ended the friendship. I know if this happened that she’d see herself as the victim and not see how her actions prompted it. 

Recently, the three of us have brought up going on a trip together after graduation, but we feel like going on a trip with L will cause more issues and it would be easier if we went without her. However, if we tried to plan a trip without her, she would definitely find out and I know that would cause a big rift in the apartment and I don’t want to end my senior year like that. After graduation, L will definitely move out of state so there will be distance between us - I could see us catching up every so often and I would be comfortable with that type of friendship. It’s just hard right now as a roommate. 

Questions I have:

Can anyone relate to this?
Is there anything I could do to make the situation better?
Do we go on the trip?

TLDR: Honestly just want to know if other people have had experiences with a close friend who can be toxic sometimes and have any suggestions on how to deal with this situation",19Nov2019,1

223,"Okay so this might be a bit of a mess, and if it’s confusing I apologize. 
First, we will start off with this; my ex came back into my life after 3 months when he broke up with me. Now he wants to be all cuddly and make it seem like we’re in a relationship, but we aren’t. And I no longer want to be. I’m scared of hurting him and losing him because I still want him in my life. I still get jealous sometimes too but that’s unfair to him. He deserves to move on, and so do I. I need help figuring out how to tell him that I just want to be friends, not friends with benefits, and I don’t want to get back together. 

Second, I have a situation with this guy I’m friends with. Him and I have kind of been flirting for a bit and he’s become extremely attached. I don’t really feel the same way and the more attached he becomes the less I like him in that way. I care about him a lot but I really want him to move on. Every time I try to reject him, though, he threatens to leave my life and stop being friends, or he threatens to hurt himself. It scares me each time so I say nice things, calm him down, and this issue just keeps getting worse. I’m honestly so lost on what to do about it. I really care about him and I want his friendship in my life but he wants more. I need to figure out a way to make him lose feelings for me in the romantic way. 

And lastly, I really like the last guys best friend. Me and this guy used to flirt and it was fun, I got a bit tired because when my ex came back into my life that’s all I could focus on. It made me see this other guy in a more negative way. Don’t get me wrong, I care about this person a lot, I was just finding reasons to leave so that I could justify talking to my ex again. Long story short, this guy moved on, and now has a girlfriend. I like this guy again, a lot. I obviously will not try to interfere with him current relationship, but how can I make him think less badly of me? He knows about the drama of the first two people I spoke about and he thinks that I don’t try to solve my problems. He’s right, and this is me trying to figure out a way to solve them, so he will be fond of me again. So him and I can be close friends again. Then maybe, in the future, I could have a second chance to work at a relationship with this boy, if that time ever comes. I just need to learn how to be interesting enough for him to want to talk to me, and to show him I’m solving my problems, that I’m not the cause of drama all of the time.

It feels like I'm never allowed to be angry at her for anything, even when she's being unfair or awful to me.

Most of the time, I just let things go, but we've gotten into a fight about how she is often condescending ""without noticing"" and that her apologizing for acting that way doesn't give her a free pass to continue acting that way.

243,"Hello.

A quick description of me and a quick profile of me: 

I am a junior in high school, I'm Asian-American and in the upper 1% of kids in my grade in terms of GPA. I'm not terribly ugly, and I do sports all year round; Soccer, Swimming and Baseball . I don't have amazing social skills, and it's compounded by the fact that I have a stutter that I am getting therapy for. I am also a conservative politically (very vocal as well), and this is in stark contrast to nearly half of my class. People do see me as smart, but also as a really quirky and pretty brash at times. However, I act this way because I'm actually really insecure about how people view me, but I also am trying to forget about what people think about me. Additionally, I don't really have a lot of friends, I'm kind of between many groups of people, but not solidly in one particular group. 

I've asked out a number of girls before (rejected every time, obviously), and it hasn't gone well. So many kids in my grade get to hook up and go to parties and while I know that studying and being hard-working will get me that in the long term, I also am an extremely lonely person. I'm pretty bad with girls, but I am really willing to date someone and be good to them in ways that other dating couples aren't in my school. People also don't text me and put me in group chats because I have a Google Pixel. 

I just want to get invited to parties sometimes so I can maybe hookup with someone and maybe even get a girlfriend after multiple run-ins. What do I have to change in order to get this?",19Nov2019,1
245,"Sooo not sure where to start, might be rambling but here we go 

I am currently an Accounting major, considering minoring in Management Systems. I also have a job as an accounting clerk in the accounts payable department in an oil and gas company. I enjoy accounting in the sense that sometimes it a puzzle and you have to solve it by putting numbers in the right places and sorting and knowing what to do with them. I also enjoy my job although it very very simple tasks, although I think I’m much more interested in public accounting as I’ve been to countless office visits and events on campus and talk to many professionals. Possibly tax or consulting, to incorporate my MIS minor (which I enjoy because of the data analytics aspect in the same way I like accounting, the challenge and satisfaction of solving)

But I am going to fail the Frameworks course. We have a week left of school and then the final, I need an 80 to pass but on the last tests I’ve received a 71,61,64 and don’t think it’s possible for me to get an 80. Many other people are excelling and getting high A’s, while others are doing much worse than me (but many of them dropped before the cut off date) the teacher teaches by saying things once and intimidating us, which ..... Almost works for me but not quit. I always ALMOST understand something, but I think my main problem is my anxiety and specifically test anxiety. I’m not seeing anyone for it and am so overwhelmed with everything (just moved out on my own this year, bought a car, dealing with stress and depression and anxiety) I just can’t get myself to see someone. Also not even sure if that’s the problem or if accounting is just not for me. But when I take tests all I hear in my head is “I don’t know” “oh my god” over and over the. Whole time and I can’t think and i can’t focus and I get jittery. But some how I don’t get a total 0, while other people have. This is a class many people take twice. 
I’ve always been a mostly A, couple B+ student with the exception of economics lol. I’m not used to failing and that’s why I guess I thought I didn’t need to drop and id pull through somehow. 

I’m not sure if I should chnage my major or swallow my pride and take it again. I’ve also worked very hard to put myself in front of recruiters and have gone on leadership events with some and made personal connections rooms with employees and am in a program that’s an extra class just learning about other companies and it strongly implies to employers I will get my masters in accounting and get my CPA. 

My passions are dance (still a dance teacher) and English and psychology but I stress about job availability in those. I’ve only taken the intro MIS class so idek if I like it.And the embarrassment of telling all my family and friends how wrong I was and that I failed and have to start all over and completely  wasted two years makes me want to scream. 

I’m really so scared I have no idea what to do. I have an appointment with the accounting advisor, but I think she’ll just say take the class again. 

Any advice helps I’m so stressed",19Nov2019,1

Now, I don't feel that I have a right to feel resentful or hurt because after all doing something like that is a super kind, nice gesture, it's really going above and beyond, it's not really something that can be expected. However, deep down I do feel somewhat disappointed and I would love some advice on how to proceed. Should I just continue on, continue to consider this girl a best friend, and pretend it never happened? Should I not say anything but accept that maybe she isn't as close of a friend as I assumed, and stop making so much effort to stay in touch? Does anyone have any words of wisdom that can help me stop feeling secretly hurt?",19Nov2019,1
248,"TL;DR at the end.

Background: I'm 24, I'm in college, I'm married to a husband with a stable 40/hr a week IT job that pays meh but he's in the national guard so we get more stability from that. I'm one year away from completing my bachelors in Psychology, two years if I decide to take some extra time to be more appealing to psychology grad schools.  Then if I want to become a therapist I have to go through grad school.

I always sang and played piano as a child, but didn't get super focused on music until junior high. Then I played french horn, trumpet, and sang, and practiced for hours every day.  I spent my first year of college as a vocal performance major, though I was almost a french horn performance major.  I was in the top of my class. Music was my life and I believed it was going to be my career.

Then a year later, almost six years ago now, I put down music ""Forever"" for a really stupid reason. I thought my then-fiance (now husband) would be going active duty military (he didn't, and it wasn't even a sure deal at all back then) so I made the rash decision to completely give up the thing that had been my whole identity since I was a little child -- music -- because I thought I couldn't stay with him and do music at the same time. Stupid, stupid stupid.

In the years since then I've struggled to find my identity. After a couple years, once I realized giving up music had been completely pointless, I didn't let myself think about it and just pushed it all down.  I've wasted tons of money pursuing degrees I didn't want in computer science and graphic design.  I finally settled on psychology with the eventual goal of becoming a therapist, which I definitely like better than anything else I've tried....but not as much as music, still.  I wouldn't even let myself listen to classical music outside movie scores *during* the movie.  Every time I went to my young friend's band performances I would cry.

Today my therapist convinced me to try playing music again. I imagined walking into a music store again, and I burst into tears.  Then I got in my car and actually listened to some classical music for the first time in years, and again burst into tears. Today has involved a lot of crying.

I want to start seriously playing french horn and singing again.  I'm not sure what this means for my future.  I would love to make a career out of teaching and playing music but I don't know if that's even possible for me now.  I wish I could have the last six years of my life back.

Should I finish my psych degree? Should I get my masters in therapy?  Should I drop everything and just work a part time job and practice music? Should I try to get a degree in music someday? I'm so confused.

TL;DR: I was on a trajectory to have a career in music, until I swore off music for 6 years for a really stupid reason.  Now I'm a year away from getting a bachelors in psychology and I want to start seriously playing music again. Am I too old to get back into it?  Will I ever be able to teach or play at a decently professional level?",19Nov2019,1
249,"suppose there is a guy who love someone really really much, they were together for like 6 years, he wanted to get married, girl wanted to be together officially (by law) but not actually married. They finally decided to break up. Although they still together like couple but no intimacy for 2 years. The guy was there in illness and everything. 
Then something really tragic happened in guy life which indirectly effected the girl. So guy thought no one loves him and tries to move on. But then he knew that girl loves him since the beginning he tried to come back but one day said that he is confused and he love someone else. Then he came back asking to be together. Then he cried and said to girl that she wont love him in 5 years . And officially broke up(some day before that he told her that he had gay experience) 

Now girl is going to different country and guy is also following her. He put on their dp and everything. Left his job. And now officially going to different country although didn’t told girl about her. 
What the hell is happening? I mean is it possible that he is doing it becoz he loves her madly? Like he lost 20 kg after breaking up with her. Wanted to commit suicide. Although got helped. And in therapy only they didn’t talk for momths and now he made such a big gesture. He not using her right? I mean he can go on and date anyone else. But even after momths of counselling and therapist. He decided to take such a big action. Is it true love or a game?",19Nov2019,1
250,"Alright, so my coworker (this new 21 year old at the store), immediately added me on Facebook the first night we met at work.  We have a few mutual friends, so I didn’t think much of it.  All during the day, he kept calling me “new best friend.”  As a 26 year old, I thought it was lame and cheesy, but that’s okay hah.  

After that,  I messaged him first on Facebook and said “Oh man, now we’re actually friends!”  The conversation didn’t go much further.  

Well, after a few days of him randomly messaging me with the classic, “Hey, wyd?”  He started getting extra friendly.  Eventually, he ended up telling me that if I wasn’t a manager, then he wondered if I’d be interested in dating him.  I expressed that the feeling was mutual.  We talked in detail that night about our feelings, and other such things.  I saw him in person a couple of days after that and he was still super flirty.  Then, a couple of days after that, he stopped doing the whole, “Hey, wyd?” thing, and will leave my messages unread (which are truly not that frequent or weird...sometimes even a joke about work).  

I’m just super confused.  He reached out to me, and was extremely flirty and blunt and clear about his intentions, but now, it’s basically radio silence and he used work as an excuse of being busy (I mean, he has two jobs, but he’s still posting on Facebook...just leaving my messages).  

I’m just really confused.",19Nov2019,1

I’ve said it’s my time to change and have been half hearted more times than I’ve crossed a road, took a breath or are a meal, but this time it’s different,

I’ve never genuinely believed I’m about to change my self destructive life style until now, now that I’ve realised the amount of damage that I’ve caused in my life, and realised how lucky I am to still be engaged, to still have a few members of my family, (all the ones I have are the nice ones, the rest are life myself),

Anyway tangent aside the advice that I am seeking shall follow,

I’m a 22 year old British guy, with under mediocre grades despite the fact that I always graded higher than my age, my laziness got the better of me,

I now need to know if it’s still feasible for me to go back and retake my GCSE English grade, to afterwards take a access to higher edification course and eventually go for a degree within conjoined science,

256,"I'm a male in my early twenties and work an entry-level white collar job, non-exempt, paid hourly. To give you a better idea, in a hierarchy of positions at our company, I am at the very bottom along with around 50 other people. Everyone else is management / administration which consists of maybe 10 employees total.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Someone in the marketing department had left on bad terms, so they came to me and asked if I'd fill in as the ""social media coordinator"" when there's downtime (I would still be doing everything I normally do, this would be an additional responsibility.) To sum it up, I would be in full control of the social media accounts and expected to come up with content to post a few times a week. This is very unusual for someone in my position at this company and is far beyond what is asked of us in our job descriptions. I have no experience or education in social media marketing, I'm just one of the youngest people in the company which (I assume) is why they approached me for this.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I thought it would be fun and would break up some of the monotony of my current duties so I agreed. It was never made super clear off the bat, but I figured they'd simply allow me to access social media sites from my computer at my cubicle and when there was downtime I could come up with fun and interesting content to post every once in a while.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It didn't quite turn out that way. For whatever reason, IT is reluctant to give me access to these sites and I assume it's because they think either 1) my co-workers will get jealous and upset that I have unrestricted internet access and they don't or 2) they think I'll browse social media instead of actually doing my work. There is also a strict policy that we can't use our cell phones at work or even have them visible, so that is out of the question.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So instead, they have setup a standing desk in the PR manager's office with a slow, tiny laptop for me to work on when there's downtime. (For the record, they did not buy the laptop or standing desk just for me, these existed long before I was in the picture) I absolutely hate the idea of this, as I hardly know the guy and there's a big age difference between us. I also love the co-workers in my department and value the downtime I have with them, which would become a lot less frequent with this new arrangement. There has also been no discussion of additional pay for taking on this responsibility. Despite all of this, I still agreed when they explained the new setup to me last week, probably because I am a people-pleaser and have a difficult time saying no to people, even when it's in my best interest to do so. But now that I've thought about it, I have absolutely no desire to proceed with this and I need to find a way to politely and professionally say ""hey, I know I already agreed to this but I want to back out now.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an introvert and dread the idea of awkwardly standing in this guy's silent office for extended periods of time while he watches over my shoulder, and I get the sense that I'm being used unfairly - if they were smart they knew I'd agree to doing this without extra pay. I know it was irresponsible of me to agree to do this in the first place, and if I could go back and decline I would. I'd have no problem if I could do this from the comfort of my own desk but it is simply not an option. If anyone could give me some advice on how to approach this conversation I'd greatly appreciate it. It is causing me an irrational amount of anxiety. Many thanks in advance.",19Nov2019,1

259,"So my boyfriend is ""renting"" from his sister for about 2 years now.  I say renting like that because there's no contract and he pays with cash so she doesn't have to pay taxes. There are two other renters in the house with the same arrangement. 

She does this because she is low on money. She was fired from her teaching job when her work found out she married a man who was convicted of raping his 14 year old daughter. Yep. She knew about it before she married him, too. 

One of the renters is a charity case. I think she let's him stay for dirt cheap while my bf and the other guy pays $400 a month. The other guy is about to move on December 31st. So what does she do? Sends him a text telling him he has to move out by the 31st. She has done this before. Threatening him and then making him pay more money for rent when he asks why he has to leave. I've told him to move out before, but he didn't want the inconvenience of moving. This time was the last straw for him. 

So he has a month to move out, and we live in a small town. All the houses for rent don't allow pets. He has a dog, that has been with him ever since he got out of the Army. She has helped him so much with transitioning back into civilian life. He doesn't want to get rid of her. 

We found an apartment, its affordable and two blocks from his work. It's too good to be true. It just doesn't allow pets. I don't know what to do. This is all just so overwhelming to me. His sister has fucked him over so many times and the rest of his family lives a thousand miles away. Should he get rid of the dog? Should he stay and pay more? We are going to look at the apartment tomorrow, she just dropped all of this on us tonight. Hopefully we can make an arrangement with the owner of this new apartment, maybe a pet deposit on top of the regular deposit.",19Nov2019,1

267,"I (29m), after a lifetime of failures, bad habits, and regrets, finally have a chance to go out into the adult world and make something of myself.

The one thing I did right is that I did go to college.  But let's start from the beginning..

I was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age and only made it through elementary school because of medication.  I stopped taking it in high school because I didn't like how it made me feel.  In turn, I did horribly.  Most of the classes I passed were with a 50% grade because the teachers felt bad for me.

Eventually I got so depressed I dropped out like 8 credits short and went into a deep hole where I did nothing for 2 years.  I got a job washing dishes at a restaurant for a year and a half and hated my life.  I quit that job.  Did nothing for another year, then decided that I'd had enough and that I wanted to go to college.  I enrolled in adult education and got the required credits for my program.  Got into college, did that for 2 years and got out at 26.  I couldn't find a job so I took a job working at a coffee shop -which once again, I hated.  Felt like I just sucked at everything there.  I didn't stay too long and eventually just quit with a promise to get my shit together going into 2018.

Well, that didn't happen.  I've been just treading water.  I'm like $35,000 in debt, can't drive, don't have any direction or any idea where I want to get to in life.

Fast forward to today.  A job opportunity came up for a position where the average salary is $79,000/year with insane incentives.  From everything I've read, it sounds like my fucking dream job.  I'm qualified to get hired and they provide training.  This is everything I've ever dreamed of.

This is too good to be true.

I'm terrified.  Terrified to fail.  Terrified that I won't be able to learn the required material to be successful and last (thanks ADHD and fucking awful genetics).

If i got this job, even after a year I'd be debt free and living in my dream apartment.  Everything would just be solved.  I'd be happy.  I'd be tears of joy happy for the first time in my life.

I'm so scared.  I want this so bad.  I want to succeed and I just want everything.  

But I don't want to fail.  I've failed so much in my life.  I finally have a chance to just be something good.",19Nov2019,1

272,"Hi guys, I'm fuming, upset, angry, and overall very disgruntled over the situation with this coworker and am wondering if going to HR is the best bet, or if I should just handle this in house.

A few weeks ago, there was a Halloween party, and a coworker of mine was wearing a light up Halloween skull necklace worth about 15 bucks on Amazon. I took it off jokingly and tried it on and we both laughed about it. I then decided to take it off and give it back to him, but he told me to keep it. I said ""are you sure?"" He said ""Yeah, go ahead and keep it."" So I did. Fast forward a couple days and I end up losing it at another party. No Biggy. However, it turns out a week later, he had text some coworkers calling me a b**ch, saying he needed my number and was gonna call me immedietely to get his neckalce back, etc. etc. I was told this through one of his friends, and I told him I didn't have the necklace anymore, and that if it was a big deal I wouldn't have taken it in the first place. I thought he would be over it, but 3 weeks later he is still telling people that I ""Stole"" this necklace and even threatened to go to HR lol. It's sad to me that such a tiny thing could turn into a huge scandal, and now he refuses to even acknowledge me, which I find hilarious but so disgustingly sad. He also used a threatening voice with me when asking where it was, almost like a cop as he is prior military. Luckily so am I, so this little scare tactic did nothing. I really did lose it, and no I'm not going to compensate him for this necklace that he GAVE to me. Is there any way to take this to HR and will it be taken seriously? I truly just want him to stop telling people I ""Stole"" this. On a side note, I have another issue with a coworkers, a 50 year old woman who used to hug me and give me relationship advice and was very kind. It turns out she has spread false rumors about me to 3 different people 3 seperate times all while keeping the faceade of being nice to me. The first time, she claimed that I had been moved work stations because of my behavior, although this was not true, as I was moved because another employee quit suddenly. A second time, she said I smelled like alcohol and told people that I should really watch how I come to work after a night of partying. As a full time worker and college student I never party, so this is laughable. The third time 2 days ago, she asked ANOTHER coworker about the necklace situation and claimed that I stole it and I'm a thief. I have never said anything negative about this person, and therefore it makes me extremely uncomfortable and uneasy as to why she continues to mention me to coworkers negatively, all of which like me enough to relay this information comically. Any help on these 2 situations would be of great assistance. I keep my interactions with her minimal now, though she continued to insist on being friendly towards me, I simply ignore her now. Thanks again! For the record, I've never spoken ill about these 2 people and quite frankly am just FED UP with this BS.

276,"Hi all,

So I've been in a very rough patch in my college life currently, where I'm struggling to get anything done. I don't have good grades, and will most likely struggle once I get out. It's been really difficult for me, as a person who shies away from challenges, because I feel I'm not up to the task, and avoid due to a fear of being exposed. I have been like this for quite sometime, but I know that everyday I procrastinate due to this reason, and ultimately when I look back at the amount of time I wasted away in college, I feel really depressed. It also does not help that I am a very slow learner who has less than average intelligence. I have always preferred doing extremely simple stuff because if I try to do a minutely complex task, I know that someone will do it much better than me, and I know that I'm not good enough. Even though I ""know"" things superficially (I bullshit a lot frequently, and sometimes I get exposed), and all the things to do and not to do, I am not good enough to apply them properly. How can I change myself? It also does not help that I do not have any friends in college whom I can rely upon at any time of need. So the question is : Am I fucked in life? The worst part is that I have anticipated that this would happen. I would see others get way past me, while I just idle around, running away from my life. How can I start changes so that I change who I fundamentally am? Because at present, I don't want to be me. And is it even possible to change yourself from a person like me? I have tried to change it in the past, but I have reverted to the same person as before. Can I even do it, or is everything futile, because I do not understand the game of life? I know all the patterns of life which I should and should not do, but I'm not able to do this, because I'm not a smart person. This is the worst feeling ever to me; Knowing stuff but not able to do anything about it. I feel very helpless and depressed. How do I change?

Summary: 

I want to be more productive, but I shy away from challenges due to an inferiority complex because I am not a good learner and as a result, do not end up learning much and I have been facing large consequences in my life as a result, and I feel like a failure. Others are way too ahead in life, and I'm playing catch up and bullshitting my way to mediocrity and lifelessness. Want to change myself, even though I know it's going to be almost impossible by myself. Steps to start with this?",19Nov2019,1
277,"So I have liked this girl for a while now (I am also a girl so that makes things a little more complicated sadly) and I just recently found out that she likes me too. I will start from the beginning and tell this whole story because idk what is going on. 

She came out to me earlier this year and then I came out to her right after that. We are both only out to like one other person because neither of our families would be accepting of us and most of the people that I know wouldn’t be accepting either. 

So about a week ago I was on facetime with her and one of my other friends and we started taking all of these online quizzes about whether our crush likes us back or not. Eventually we all realized that we had a crush on someone that was in our friend group so we all started to vaguely describe reasons why we like our crush or cute moments that we have had with them. My crush started describing all of these moments that happened with me and eventually she told me that she liked me and I told her that I liked her, all while my other friend was on facetime too. Then my crush started saying all of these cute things and describing moments that she thought were cute between us. Also, at the beginning of this facetime call before we told each other anything she said that she was going to write her crushes name on a sheet of paper and put it in the back of her phone case, and I looked at the paper the next day and it had my name on it with a heart next to it 💕🥰💘🥰💘❤️😔. Anyway, my other friend eventually hung up and I was on facetime with my crush til like 4am just talking about random stuff. 

So it’s been like a week since this happened and I feel like nothing has changed between us. She still treats me like we are just friends and she calls me “bro” and stuff like that ✋😔. I feel like I try to flirt with her but idk if it is reciprocated. She still has the paper with my name on it in her phone case, but I don’t think she is giving off any vibes that she likes me as more than a friend. I am just really confused and I don’t know what to do. Maybe she doesn’t want to make anything obvious because we are both still closeted. Also, we never really hang out alone because we are always with at least one other person, and she hasn’t texted me about how we both like each other or anything. 

Did her crush go away or did she lie about having a crush on me or something? What should I do?",19Nov2019,1

When starting my application for the assistance I came to the section of ""Taxes"" where my family has to give me the paperwork from their recent taxes. However, I can't get any information on my parents income tax because dad (white) hasn't done them since 2017 (at least what I was told). Now in the state I reside in, the only way to fully complete the financial aid paperwork is to have the most recent tax paperwork as in 2018 income tax or currently. My mother (Hispanic asian mix) and I (Mix) have begged this lazy man to do it, but at this point he doesn't care. My mother has taken the liberty on herself to attempt to do but she can't afford to pay for another individual to do it for her ($500). I've been trying to earn scholarships and grants for college but so far I'm at a dead end. My mom is telling me that if she can't do it, then I'll have a better chance of getting my education through the military, something I don't want to do. Ive made up my mind on what I want with my life and set up my goals to go with it. I want to help myself out so, Is there a way I can get my college education without having to wait for paperwork that will most likely not be done with?

Still feeling no benefits from it, but I realize it’s still early into taking them. Decided to go no contact with my parents this summer because they refuse to get help and there was a lot of childhood physical, emotional, and sexual abuse growing up they refuse to acknowledge. I left my 8 year relationship because I’m tired of feeling like the only one putting in the work to change emotionally and work on improving our communication. My long term best friend has been a raging alcoholic for years and I’m tired of being the codependent and trying to help him when he doesn’t want the help. He’s drunk or high 90% of the time and I’m tired of being called names or controlling because I’m sick of never having a sober friend. All while this summer I dropped out of nursing school (almost a year before becoming an RN) because I feel like I’m utterly overwhelmed and can’t take anymore pressure right now. I’m grieving, angry, and feel lost. 

I just want a healthy relationship. I’ve been crying daily and barely leaving my home anymore (work from home). I know I need the therapy, but I literally feel too lost to even know where to begin. I feel so stuck. I’m so emotional, yet feeling utterly depleted. I’m really upset right now because this will be the first holiday I’ll be spending without my parents.

I’m literally alone now, besides my dogs and occasionally seeing my sister.

The only thing that makes me hesitant to wear them even more often is the fact that they are a pain to wash – specifically, I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. Because I wear them as underwear, they need to be cleaned thoroughly after each use, but I also don't want them to felt.

296," I always wanted to be a Soldier. Based on my circumstances I ended up joining the Army through ROTC and commissioning. I needed a waiver for a symptom of a behavioral health condition in order to get it. Though it took a while I did get it on time to commission with my peers. 

My first 2.5 years in the Army went well. I got great evaluations and overall loved my job. Was helping people along the way. There were bumps in the road and I went to see behavioral health on and off, with a couple of flair ups on my behavioral health symptom. I still hadn't been diagnosed with anything at the time. 

A friend of mine killed herself, while visiting me in July. I came to her hotel room to find her. My BC gave me a 4 day to get myself together and collect myself. And when I went back to work I seamed fine. I felt fine. But I was basically just ignoring my greif. I asked for help exactly the day that I needed it and not a second more, but I did ask for a program. This was a Friday

I ended up calling my behavioral health provider Monday morning, because it was my friends birthday and her birthday present was on my doorstep and I wasn't handling it well. He ended up sending me to the inpatient mental health unit because I was crying to much and didn't want to deal with it. After I was released, the provider who sent me there diagnosed me with an anxiety disorder and informed me that he was going to recommend a medboard for me. 

I was approved for my medboard while in a the outpatient program. Unfortunately when I met with the medboard lawyer she said that in order to beat my medboard and be found fit for duty I would need behavioral health to say that I have been making sustained progress. My provider says that though she sees progress she can't say that I won't relapse into my old habits without having two years stable. Obviously the medboard won't let me chill for two years so get their approval.

297,"Sorry about any formatting issues or typos, I'm on mobile. Also this may be a book because I haven't really had anyone to talk about this stuff with, and I thank anyone for commenting in advance.

So to start things off, I'm a 15 year old male in my sophomore year of high school in the US. I've been having issues with productivity ever since I started high school. I never had a problem with school, I'm currently all honors and AP with a 3.2 weighted GPA, but can't seem to maintain any high grades at all.

I'm a very avid gamer, and own a fairly expensive desktop that I built myself.  I aspire to be a computer science major and go into software development. I find myself on my computer on any given day from when I get home to when I go to sleep. Whether this is spent playing vidya with friends or my brother (22, also huge gamer lol), coding / developing something for myself, perusing reddit or 4chan, or online work. I just never get any actual homework done really, and I can't bring myself to do it no matter how much effort I put into it. I always find a way to get sidetracked or just go to bed, even at an early time. I'm not a straight A student, as I mentioned before, but I test high enough to get by. I'm constantly told that what I'm doing isn't good enough, whether it be from my oldest brother (29, med school grad), or my mother who is a bachelor in math and teaching. I want to be able to go to college and get a degree, but I don't think I'm doing enough as it stands to do so.

It has gotten to the point where my mother is offering to let me drive (learners permit) on any night as long as I don't continue to be on my computer, I get anxiety when thinking about starting a relationship with a girl for fear they won't want to be in a relationship with someone who can't keep on top of their own schoolwork, let alone be committed to them, and I get constant anxiety about my grades and school. I have been to counseling before to help with getting work done, but I just couldn't bring myself to implement any of the changes into the long term. Like I said before, I always seem to get distracted by anything, as long as I'm not doing something I'm actually supposed to be doing :p. I don't really know if I'm ADD or ADHD or have any disorders of the like, but my oldest brother is ADD, but not prescribed anything (although he should be). 

I guess the obvious answer would be to cut the computer from my life, but that just seems like something of a harsh punishment to myself and my enjoyment. I really am just in constant fear that if I keep this up, I won't be able to get a good education after HS and end up in the place I want to be in. My brother (22) has the same dream of being a computer science major, but was much worse in school than I am. Coupled with some domestic and drug charges, he eventually dropped out of community college and went into the trades. 

I don't really know what to do. I'm not feeling depressed (at least I don't think so) and I just don't know where my life is going to end up if I continue like this. I'm stuck without any motivation to do much of anything, and I don't know if it's because I have a lack of focus or because maybe the prospect of not getting into college doesn't scare me deep down. My mother always tells me that it seems like I just don't care about my schoolwork, but my head always wants to scream back that I really do, but every time I try and show it, I just can't bring myself get my grades up or do anything really.

Again I apologize for the long spaghetti story, but on the off chance someone reads this whole thing, I hope you have a good day.",19Nov2019,1
298,"Throwaway account because I think some of my friends use reddit, might have to keep some details vague as well lol

So, my girlfriend and I have been together for a few years now, and things have always been great. We’re trusting and comfortable enough with each other to try new things and experiment, and lately we have been looking into threesomes just to try it out. We wanted to pick someone we knew but weren’t super close with in case anything went wrong, so we wouldn’t lose any good friends we’ve known our whole lives. 

We know of this one girl who’s mutual friends with our friends, pretty cute, never met her in person. We invited her to go out sometime, she came, we had a great time just hanging out. 

Shortly after, my girlfriend confessed she had a bit of a crush on this girl, and she asked me if she could talk to the girl about it and also see if she’d be down for a threesome sometime, no pressure at all. I had no problem with it, and even if she said no, we were still getting to be good friends with this girl, she was a sweetheart.

What we didn’t know is that she has a boyfriend. Of course, I know my girlfriend is not the type of person to interfere with another’s relationship like that and she wouldn’t have asked if she knew. The girl politely declined and that was that, we were still friends and everything was cool. 

Just a couple days ago, the girl texted my girlfriend and told her they could no longer have contact. She had mentioned to her boyfriend the conversation between her and my girlfriend, and it caused an argument between the two of them. Out of respect for him, she didn’t want to speak to my girlfriend anymore (and she mentioned me somewhere in the paragraph she sent, but I’m not quite sure if she wants no contact with me as well). My girlfriend apologized to her and told her she understood, she didn’t mean to cause an argument between them. 

Now, a group of my friends are hosting a Friendsgiving, and i was told today that this girl was also invited and will be there. I feel really embarrassed about the whole situation, and I’d honestly rather avoid an awkward moment at dinner (my girlfriend was invited as well). My friends have hosted Friendsgiving every year for the last few years and this is the first time I am able to attend, so I’d feel a little shitty for missing it a third or fourth year in a row. 

What should I do? Stay home and avoid the possibility of an uncomfortable encounter or attend the dinner and just try to be friendly, or even avoid the girl completely?",19Nov2019,1

306,"Its taken me forever to write this and I really just hope it makes sense and doesnt sound like the writing of the zodiac killer rambling.

I have been alone for 23 years now. I was briefly allowed to go to school when I was very young but my memories of being around other children are extremely vague and frankly unpleasant.
My mother and father wanted to build an independent community from the outside world for me and my brother and our foster sister. For years we had no internet, no television, we never attended church and we never attended school except for a brief period of time.

I'm not sure if it would be an exaggeration to say, that I'm probably one of the loneliest people on earth haha. About four years ago my parents lives started falling apart after my mother went crazy and left my father, blaming the suffocating environment he had created for her, and my father became an alcoholic and left us for long periods of time to ""Go Whoring"" in his words.

I only learned to drive this year and I mostly taught myself, and I recently tried getting a job in town, but the nearest city is 30 minutes away and it only has a population of ~600 people but I quit it because I was being severely bullied at it. My communication skills have never really developed verbally no matter how much I begged to do stocking the manager always put me on the register with an assistant manager who resolved every issue with a customer by humiliating me in front of them or threatening my job (She would threaten to report my ""attitude"" to our boss to get me fired every single day that I worked there. I could vent forever about every instance of abuse i was given but it's not worth focusing on, the biggest even was when her boyfriend threatened me in the parking lot one night and started called me stupid and accused me of fucking).

I shouldn't have quit the job, I realize, but i was treated so bad there, even violently threatened by customers one who told me that somebody would ""hurt"" me if I kept disrespecting customers like I did (I put a receipt in a bag instead of their hand.) I just couldnt handle the overwhelming negativity of the place and I was only making $7.50 an hour.

I have never had any friends, although I do remember playing with other children as a very young child, I remember playing in a sandbox filled with Rice with a boy named Bryce in preschool I think and I remember being confused about his name sounding like rice, but this is my only pleasant memory of dealing with someone my age.

I've never met a girl my age and at this point I dont know where to start. But the truth is, making progress in friends, careers and love is so far out of my reach until I can leave my father but i dont know how to do that.

My father has also set himself up as the only authority figure in my life and to go against him feels like I'm facing off against God himself, and I dont mean to sound dramatic but I've cried myself to sleep at the thought of opposing him. He recently found out from a text in my phone to my mother that I've been planning to leave home and he lectured me for hours about how iys I'll impossible to leave home and if I do I will just become homeless and then I will be raped.

Honestly I dont even know where I would go if I left or how to leave, and no matter what I'm going to be alone when I do and im just in a really bad place right now, and please, if anyone can read this and knows what to do, im absolutely willing to put everything I have into changing my life. I don't want to kill myself but lately I've been having thoughts about commiting suicide if I'm in this same position this time next year and when I told my father about being suicidal he told me it was normal.

I dont know if it is normal or not, but I dont want to die. I just want to make friends and be happy. I've even accepted a lifetime of celibacy, because I dont believe any woman would want to be with someone like me (on top of being very socially awkward I'm also very physically small, which I think might be a result of growing up on a vegetarian diet).

310,"So it’s almost thanksgiving and I’m going to see my sister again for the first time in a while. She’s 26, I’m 19 (m). No other siblings. She’s very aggressive and high energy, while I’m more timid/laid back. We never got along and have no real relationship because our narcissist father treated me as the “golden child” and her the “scapegoat” (even tho once she stopped seeing him at 16 I became the scapegoat). She thinks my life has been easy (relative to her upbringing, it kinda was) and I think she harbors jealousy towards me based on some false idea that my dad didn’t hurt me like he did her (to be fair, he probably did hurt her more). 

She’s hypercritical of me. Everything she does is putting me down, disguised as a joke but actually really hurtful. She will latch on to a criticism of me and “jokingly” repeat it ad nauseam. I defend myself, but since it’s not in my nature to be rude, I usually just try to let it roll off. However, since she basically regresses to age 16 every time she returns home, she always finds some little thing I do to freak out over and throws an actual temper tantrum. There will probably be at least 2 freak outs and a day of not speaking to me over the holiday minimum. 

Last time, she was being really hurtful about something and I repeatedly asked her to stop, but she wouldn’t let it go. It was getting under my skin, and I accidentally said “you’re acting like a bitch right now” out of frustration. Lots of tears and 3 days of silent treatment for that one. I had to apologize. 

Here’s the thing though. She’s a really cool person. Hilarious and extremely intelligent. I respect her ambition a lot. Even though we mostly argue, when it’s not about something personal (e.g. ethical questions, our theory of how the murderer did it, etc.) she is 100% my favorite person to argue with. I know we can get along, but she’s just not willing to let the past go. And I kinda get that because I know she’s been damaged and feels the need to put up this facade so she doesn’t get hurt again.

So here’s my question: should I try to set boundaries by telling her that she needs to be respectful to me, and just not get engage with her criticism at all? Or should I try and approach her by extending an olive branch and expressing my desire to have a real relationship? I’ve been leaning towards the latter because she doesn’t react well to being told what to do. Also, it could help if I first made myself vulnerable so she knows it’s okay to let her guard down. Let me know what you think. (Also, sorry for the length. Part of me just wanted to vent this.)

TLDR; My adult sister whom I’ve never gotten along with is hypercritical of me. I want to actually have a relationship with her. Should I set boundaries by demanding her respect, or be open and honest about wanting to make amends?",19Nov2019,1

313,"I’m a high school junior with split parents (switch house every two weeks) that both love me unconditionally and want whats best for me. 

I’ve played basketball for 3 years and am pretty decent, enough to be on varsity. I’ve lost my passion for the game, have terrible anxiety, and have major confidence issues. It’s gotten to where I even dread going to practice. 

I’m very open to this with my mother, who supports whatever my decision is. My dad however, is adamant about me playing basketball. He’s a very passive aggressive person and likes to make remarks that put me down if I try to speak out to him or try to make my own decisions.

Me and my father are very close to the coach (also coaches XC so I’m with him for half a year). My coach said he sees a future in me playing at a high level and wants me in his program. I don’t want to disappoint either of them. 

I’m just very conflicted right now. Deep down I know I want to quit and that’s the best for me. I don’t want to disappoint anyone.",19Nov2019,1

315,"I have had a really rough time these last few months. In May I was in a pretty bad accident and needed surgery to repair my eye socket. My eye was pretty much out of the socket for two weeks and it was pretty touch and go whether I would lose the eye or not. I didn’t lose the eye but after being in the hospital for two weeks with round the clock care I was a little messed up. I recuperated over the rest of the summer (I’m a college student) and returned back to school for the Fall. I had some damage to my vision but nothing that can’t be worked around and it’s actually been getting much better with time. There is hope that my vision will repair itself on its own and I am refusing any more treatment or corrective surgeries to fix my vision as I really just don’t care enough to put myself through anymore shit. 

Then in September my SO and I got t boned on our  way home from dinner. My seatbelt must have come off and so my injuries were pretty extensive. I broke my leg, my eye had glass all around it, my eyelid actually got torn off,  two shards of glass had gone through both my arms like bullets and my skull was fractured. This was in addition to the whiplash, and burns all over from the seatbelt snapping and the airbags. They actually did surgery to reattach the lid and remove any glass in my face/arms while I was awake and watching. It’s seriously messed me up. 

Well I’m finally walking without support and I’m getting back to my old self and then I got an eye infection from using a new face wash (I have very sensitive eyes from when I was a little kid so any major changes in the oil on my face and I get chalazions or styes). Well now I need to start taking eye drops to heal the infection but whenever I take the drops I get super nervous and have major anxiety attacks. I feel like my throats closing up and I start shaking and it lasts about an hour each time. I can’t stop the medicine but I can’t keep having these panic attacks either.

319,"Her name is Cali and I don’t know what’s going on. I’m a junior in high School, 17, decent grades and play Varsity soccer and snowboard.

My previous relationship in Massachusetts was a very amazing one that ended horribly. I dated a girl named nichole, she was beautiful and I loved her with everything, we dated for two years and some of the best years of my life. It ended after one night she slept with my best friend and tried to lie to me about it. This destroyed me, I didn’t know what to do, how to feel, what is going on, my grades were slipping and it was terrible.
       Fast forward about a month, my dad (he’s in the Coast Guard) got orders to Oregon. We moved across the country several months later, and honestly it was nice to let go of my feelings about her. It was weird at first, it defiantly wasn’t my first move, but it was one during my mid teens. A year went by and I have friends now, I’m playing soccer for the school and snowboarding. I didn’t think of nichole much, and I think that was due to me not having any relationships with girls there that were more than friends.
        This year I started hanging out a lot with Cali and became very good friends with her. FaceTiming her every night, talking for hours, hanging out during and after school. And we decided to go to homecoming together. It was amazing. I felt attracted to her and just about everyone told me she felt the same. This was during homecoming when we basically forged this feelings to each other. 
     This relationship I was making with her started to make me scared, and second guess just about everything. Cali was also deeply hurt by someone she loved, and I understood that about her.  I was becoming scared of being hurt again, I still FaceTimed her every night talked to her all the time, but she wanted someone that would cuddle with her, tell her that she’s loved and hold her hand. I’m just not ready for that yet. I am so scared of getting attached again and getting broken once more. I’m scared of making a relationship with someone again, just because of the fear It.
        What hurts the most is, she’s recently seemed to be pulling away, due to me not being the person to love on her, and I’m just trying to tell her that I just can’t yet. It hurts, it really does. There’s more to this, but just reading this honestly makes my heart ache. She’s pulling away from me, and no matter what I try now it doesn’t seem to stop it. 
      I swore to myself, after nichole I wouldn’t get into another relationship until after high school because of her. And I did exactly what I told myself not to do. And I’m feeling just the same as when the girl that meant everything to me, gave it all to someone I called a friend.

321,"Honestly, it hurts me when I hear people talking calling kids ""Spoiled Brats"" here. I think the kids who are being called ""spoiled"" gets so much anger and jealousy from other people. It's not the 'kids' who are doing wrong, it's their 'parents' who did not educate them properly. I grew up in a posh area where ppl call it, went to an art school at 19 to figure out own life. I admit, that spoiled part of me didn't go anyway because I was constantly lost and didn't actually have much passion at art itself, but I desperately wanted to find my own voice. I was in that helpless state where I felt like I can't do things by my own without confirmations. And I still try to get out of it. Although I was often class leaders growing up, I always helped bullied kids in our classes. Because I was the bullied child once from other girls who were jealous of me. I moved away from my parents to a foreign country, was going through therapies, and I was totally lost, didn't belong to classmates, even some therapists took advantages of me, because I was that ""Young Spoiled Child with money in the background"" looking for help. Also the professors didn't care about me even, I'm not saying that I am perfect to be loved, but it seemed to me that they were offended of my background and didn't understand what I was going through. People who wanted the 'revolution' with art or activism, bullied me in reverse, because I was an evil for them. But that's what I meant by my heart and if I were that evil, I wouldn't go to that art school even..

&amp;#x200B;

Growing with really strict parents, it is really traumatising. A lot of those authoritative jobs which people admire and ditch at the back, they are clever or brilliant in some ways to handle those jobs. But I feel like a lot of people get jealous because they can't get that much higher.

&amp;#x200B;

But from my point of view,

It is really not about getting ""higher"". It's about the satisfaction in your own skin with people around you. It's about that happiness one finds in their own life. And happy people can find that happiness anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

And normally, high-status people can't get out of that rank cycle because it is the pattern. Like me, a kid who wanted to meet other people frankly, not me, but other people will block the barrier towards me because I look ""posh"". People hate those with money and class, but be honest to yourself before ditching posh people in the back. Are you really not jealous of them? I saw quite a lot of people once they actually get the chance to be like one, they find their ambitions. Which I found disappointing. That's what I think. I do believe that happiness doesn't come with money or class. It's just one's lifestyle. If you want that lifestyle, then work on it to get it, don't blame others. Especially kids.",19Nov2019,1
322,"Hello,

I am a 19-year-old female who just found out tonight that I need to move out by the end of the month. My parents and I are having relationship difficulties and I think it would be best if we get some space from each other. I'm honestly really stressed and scared. I have no idea what I need to do to make this successful. I currently have $3500 in my savings account and $500 in my checking account. I have my own car and 2 part-time jobs so that's good! Income wise, I make about $300-400 a week depending on how many hours I get scheduled for so it's definitely not ideal, but I will be looking for other ways to make money.

Any advice or tips would be GREATLY appreciated. I'm sure I can't be the only one who has gone through this. I know I'm probably in a better financial place than many people who are kicked out of their homes, but I really wish I could have saved up more money first.

324,"I am new to reddit but I came for some advice from anybody on the outside looking in. Idk if this is the best place to post, but I tried to post on some other subreddits and I guess I don’t have enough time and karma to do so.

So I’m going to try and share this story the best that I can. I was pretty drunk all night but I remember a bunch of bits and pieces. Sorry that it’s also pretty lengthy. I tried to be as detailed as possible.

So I am a straight black male (I would say I’m pretty attractive overall). I have a girlfriend whom I love and care for very much. But she is currently in military bootcamp so I’m not able to tell her the current situation.

this past Saturday night on NOV 16th, I was invited to go out to a club downtown with a friend of mine from school (she is a girl, I’ll call her Jin for the sake of the story, Also Keep in mind i will not be saying any real names, as I respect them enough to not do so). I told her that I was willing to go out with them cuz I hadn’t been out in a while. Since my girlfriend isn’t here right now and I can’t hang with her, I figured I would just go out and try to enjoy myself and get my mind off of everything I got going on.

So It was me, Jin, Jin’s wife (we’ll call her Monica), Jin’s sister (we’ll call her Jessica), Jin’s sister’s friend (we’ll call her Tess), and another dude (we’ll call him Jake). So there was 6 of us total. Jin told me we were all gonna meet at Tess’ step dad’s house so we could all pregame before going out cuz alcohol gets so expensive. I arrived over there not too long after I received the info from her. It was my first time meeting everybody (besides Jin). everybody seemed cool and down to earth so I didn’t think much of anything and was just gonna have a good night.

I drank two Lagunitas IPAs and two shots before we all left the house. I was already feelin pretty good and I was ready to have a good night dancin my ass off. Our DD for the night was Monica because she told us she doesn’t like drinking. About 30 minutes later we got to the club. It was about 10:00 If I remember correctly, and we all had another shot as soon as we got there. About 15 minutes in, Monica said she was tryna leave (party pooping I guess you could say, but she doesn’t usually go out much so it’s understandable). Jin decided that she was just gonna go home with her wife and then come back later that same night. I said okay cool and told her I would see her again later. So now it’s just me, Jessica, Tess and Jake there.

We were all having a good time. Tess was dancin with a bunch of different people, Jake was chillin for most of the night, and I was dancing by myself for most of the night. Jessica kept trying to dance with me all night and was giving me these googly eyes. She also kept trying to kiss me. You could definitely tell she was into me and trying to get something going. It was obvious on my face that i wasn’t trying to do anything with her and she knew that, but she stayed persistent the whole night trying to make it seem like “we were together”. I made it VERY CLEAR to her that I already had a girlfriend that I loved and cared about but it seemed like it just went in one ear and out the other. She kept grabbing me and trying to go dance but I kept resisting. I wasn’t trying to make a scene or be rude because I didn’t want to embarrass anybody. Usually whenever I go out, I’m the type of guy that likes to take care of the group and make sure everybody gets home safe. That’s just how I am. I think I adopted that trait from being in the military and always taking care of my people whenever we go out. So even though I wasn’t interested in her, doesn’t mean I wasn’t gonna take care of her and make sure she got home safe like I was planning to do with everybody else.

About an hour later Jin comes back. I’m assuming her wife dropped her back off or she grabbed an Uber back because she didn’t have the car with her. We all were just having a good time. Keep in mind Jessica is still trying to hook up with me all night. Around 12:30am or so we all grabbed another shot And we went on to dance till about 1:30. Club closes at 2 so we got out of there a bit early so we didn’t have to deal with traffic. At this point we were waiting outside for the Uber driver, everybody seemed pretty drunk, especially me. I should have controlled my liquor intake a bit better that night but this had been my first time drinking in a while, and it was also my first time drinking on a vegan diet. I believe the alcohol got to me quicker than it usually does because of that. Usually I’m able to handle the amount of alcohol I had pretty easily. But that night it was definitely hitting me.

Our Uber driver finally comes and we all hop in the car and head back to Tess’ step dad’s house so we could all crash. I was in the front seat and everybody else got in the back. I was up for like the first 10 minutes then I blacked out and fell asleep the rest of the ride. I think everybody pretty much drunk off their ass except for Jin who wasn’t that drunk to begin with. 

Last thing I remember from that point on was that I woke up in a pitch dark room, (still drunk out of my mind) and I couldn’t see jack shit. My shoes were off, my phone was nowhere to be found, and my pants were around my knees and Somebody was sucking me off. I didn’t even know who it was, but I made an educated enough guess to say it was Jessica that was doing it. Especially after I heard her moan. I could tell by the tone of her moan that it was her voice. I was in and out of consciousness while all this was happening, I don’t remember if I said anything or if I was hard or not, or if i nutted or if I touched her or any of that shit. All I remember was that I woke up with Jessica literally sucking me off. It was pitch dark, I didn’t know where tf I was, I was drunk off my ass, and I didn’t know what to do. So I froze up and just let it happen. I wasn’t even sure if it was real or not. I couldn’t believe what was happening.

I remember at some point that same night, I got up to use the restroom, still in the pitch black darkness, I literally had to walk with my hands out like a blind man because my phone was nowhere to be found so I couldn’t use the flashlight. The only way I was able to find out where I was going was when somebody else got up to use the restroom and I could see a faint bathroom light. I followed the light and when they came out, it was Jake, who then just went straight to another room and closed the door. After I used the restroom I was still wayyyyy entirely too drunk, so I found a carpet floor and slept on it. 

Next thing I knew, I was woken up  by Jin. I was on the floor (it was around 7:30 in the morning so the sunrise bright enough to where I could see everything) and I had a MASSIVE hangover. Jin, Jessica, and Jake were all up, I don’t remember where everybody slept but I know me, Jin, and Jessica left, but Jake stayed and locked the door behind us. I said bye to Jin, but Jessica didn’t even look my way at all during the whole interaction. It was like she was guilty about something. So from that point I knew that I wasn’t trippin and something happened that night.

Later that morning, as I was trying to piece everything together still, I decided to confront Jessica about it through Jin (because I didn’t have her number, thank god) and told Jin to pass the word on. Jessica basically admitted that she was a bit drunk and did what she did last night. I told Jessica that i could go to the cops about it but i wasn’t going to because I didn’t want to ruin her life. I got Jessica to admit it to Jin and then Jin told me that Jessica said, “apologizes deeply but didn’t remember what she did” I mentioned when I confronted her that she didn’t have my consent do any of what she did. And I even told her all night, VERY CLEARLY, that I have a girlfriend and was not interested in any way shape or form in her. Jin mentioned that Jessica said, “she remembered that apparently i kept pushing her head down to keep going.”  But there is NO WAY out of my own willingness to do so, that after all I said to her that night, I wake super extremely drunk in pitch darkness, not knowing where tf I am, and having my pants around my ankles getting my dick sucked by a somebody I was CLEARLY not interested in ALL NIGHT. I feel like I was clearly taken advantage of in this situation.

I was extremely upset on my way home that morning because I had nobody to talk to, and I couldn’t believe wtf happened. I want to tell my girlfriend but idk how to tell her, and more importantly I can’t even tell her anything till she graduates bootcamp. She graduates later this week and I’m flying over to see her graduate. But I don’t know whether I should tell her on her big graduation day or if I should just wait until a better time. I don’t even know what her reaction is gonna be. It’s all just extremely bad timing.....It makes me feel like I can’t trust anybody now like that. Especially if I drink, And Especially if I don’t know who I’m going out with. 

Sorry the story is so long, I just tried to make the story as clear as possible. 

So based on all of this information, was I raped by this girl? Did I cheat? And what should I do in this situation?

I think I’m handling the situation very well, better than most people. It’s just hard to believe that me as a male was taken advantage of like that. I also feel like a lot of my masculinity has been taken from me.

Anything helps! Thank you!",19Nov2019,1
325,"For the last year i have been thinking intensively about drawing to the point that i want to start living thanks to it. By this i mean thinking obsessively. Every time i am in social group i think "" I should be drawing right now and not wasting time on pointless conversations"". When i play a game i think "" This is such a waste of time, you need to draw"". Every day, more than 20 times a day i have thought's like this. This became my some sort of obsession to make art work in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

 You may say""then start already"", yes i do it already. So what's the problem ? 

&amp;#x200B;

When i am drawing, lately after like 1 or 2 hours i fell extremely bored or tired or disappointed of my art. Don't know which of it is really. It feels like it really bores me. Can't stand continuing my art and I escape to watching something or just playing games. Yet every once in a while after this it keeps popping in my brain ""WORK MORE"" "" YOU NEED TO DRAW"". Every time i think about keep drawing and progressing. It's not giving me a break. 

The weird thing is that i really LOVE THIS. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love this because it reminds me of my important goal. I really want to be an artist. I want to keep putting more hours.

Then you will say to me. You lack discipline!

The one discipline that works on me is FORCING MYSELF. When i do it i put more overall hours but i feel like shit, even more than before. I've tried every method i found on the internet. Tried exercise, diet, timing techniques, learning techniques, planning, goal setting. Literally everything... even methods like rewarding system where I draw for food or starve today because i didn't do my work. Basically it starts like this day1 works, day2 works less, day3 doesn't work. Almost every method is the same, like my brain is finding loop holes and logical explanations why i would be better off without this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even more HILARIOUS thing is that after my brain figures out a loop hole, this loop hole works just like another method... Starts of good and ends in same shit beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think there is so much in like ""discipline"" that i don't have. There must be somewhere else going what i don't understand. Here is why. Looking 1 year back (Now i am 21) i have had important exams in school, the ones you learn long time for. In this time i was able to WORK IN A COMPANY and even when i hated studying for those exams I could spend some time on learning.  So basically i sleep 4-5 hours everyday and no time for any other thing. At first i actually enjoyed the job it was IT job i was learning and didn't really mind it. After some time i was really annoyed at the job. The ""art thoughts"" were more present then at the start. But even when i could quit anytime, i still could DISCIPLINE myself into keep going.

&amp;#x200B;

So HOW THE F... i can't be disciplined when it comes to art. I know i love it... or do i love it? One thing i know is that i want to become good at art and be actually an artist. So what is wrong with me? I am so tired of not 'satisfying' myself with this whole situation. I sleep for long hours and just don't want to get up, sometimes i fell like i just want to end this. But then i think i really love art and want to be an artist. And the loop starts again and again.

&amp;#x200B;

 If this continues it's more likely i will become traumatized ...instead of solving this...",19Nov2019,1
327,"My sister (17) got bullied today at school by these 3 boys. It was picture day and they kept making fun of her, to the point where my sister was about to cry. The one comment that got to her was “I feel sorry for you because you have to live the rest of your life with how you look like”

Guys, my sister was bullied in middle school so bad to where it got her to a really dark place, she had been planning to go through with ending it all. Luckily, a friend told a counselor and we found the letters and the cuts (new and old). My sister is the most sweetest, loving and purest souls. She’s so creative and expressive!! She’s so strong now too, if she was still in the same place she was in middle school, shit like those boys comments would have seriously pushed her to literally end her life.

It pains me knowing these boys made her feel worthless. 
What gets me even more angry is that a teacher heard everything and NOT ONCE did he step in or defend my sister.

I want to go to the school and report this but I’ve never done anything like that, who do I speak to? How do I make sure something gets done and that the boys get addressed?? And that the teacher gets addressed as well??

It’s been about a month since we last spoke, and we left it on a bad note. He just reached out asking if we can call or get coffee to end on a better note. He says he’s in therapy.

If he genuinely is in therapy, I don’t think it’s any skin off my teeth to help him along in his personal journey. However, it’s not my job to give in to his needs, and I may even be doing him a disservice if I do.

Thoughts? Should I make time for this phone call?",19Nov2019,1

335,"I'm not friends with this person, but just good acquaintances. I've known him for 4 years now. He is known throughout the school as having a massive ego, being extremely arrogant and always thinking he is the best and smartest in any room. I only started really talking to him last year because I felt pity for him. Everyone likes his younger sister (who is the complete opposite of him) much better than him, and it is clear that many people do not think highly of him as his ego holds. He is entirely aware of this. Even though the fact that no one likes him is entirely his ego's fault, I still started talking to him more because he didn't have many friends and I wanted to make sure that he felt included especially during tournaments/competitions (academic team). 

Recently, I found out that when talking to someone else about girls, he said that he's gonna go for me because I'm ""easy. At first, when I heard it I was a bit shocked and gave him the benefit of the doubt. After all, he is a debater and he should know the impact of words. But I started thinking about it more and his history with my friends and I am currently pissed. He has had problems and created toxic environments with my friend after she rejected him and he couldn't handle it. Currently, he's been creating false accusations behind another one of friend's back who also is a good acquaintance of his saying that she's only using him to get with another one of my friends.

Saying a girl is ""easy"" is often used to address girls who sleep around, have no standards and are - basically - sluts. Even if he didn't mean it that way when addressing me, in the best case scenario I can imagine he meant that he's above my standards and that I'm an easy catch for him. I'm really mad right now at his words, but am I overreacting or misunderstanding?",19Nov2019,1

337," I've been working both of my counselor for months. I was used to be  in better condition for months when I was with my first counselor. But  due to limited available schedule and she had limited working days on  campus because she had a newborn baby a few months ago, so she transferred me to another one. But up until last month, I've broken up with my girlfriend after being together for 11 months. I've been passive-aggressive, smoke and drink for weeks. I've been increasingly been hostile, It was hard for me to go through this period.

I   don't like to schedule counseling services on campus, because of limited time to chose and it's on a biweekly basis. I feel like I obviously need more than that. Furthermore, it only limits every student to have a maximum of 10 appointments per academic year. Only 10   sessions per year are obviously not enough. And group counseling doesn't work on me either, as the locations and the schedules are not working out for me. I'm on the North campus, and most of the group sessions are on the south campus, and I couldn't be able to make it in time.

I tried to look for online services such as 7cups. However, it's too expensive. $150 per month. I don't have a campus job or a car or whatsoever. And the free version isn't just as good. There a do not have a certified listener for the free version.

Any recommendations? I don't mind to pay for services, as long as it does not break my bank.",19Nov2019,1
338,"Ok let me get the elephant out of the room first. My dad met my mother when she was 13 and had me around that time. He was around 18-20 years old at the time and was a police officer at the time (ironic I know).  They’ve been separated since because he cheated on her with another women who’s his wife now. ( he cheated around a year into the relationship with my mom). I’ve talked to him about how met my mom and he told me he thought she was older and honestly seeing photos of my mom at the time I can believe him, my mom looked surprisingly mature for her age. Even still the fact he had sex with a fucking teenager just ruins my image of him and I don’t like to think about it too much because it makes me feel like shit because it pushes thoughts about how my existence fucked up my mom’s career dreams. Any way besides that my mom would send me over to his place in Pennsylvania as a kid and he’d mentally and physically abuse me for being sentimental and home sick. Despite all of the negatives he’s a changed man. I remember he and I had a heart to heart and he explained his upcoming and how his father would beat and starve him and his brothers if they didn’t help him with manual labor. He’s taken anger therapy courses and that’s helped a lot with his anger issues and he’s never hit me since then. He always tried his best to establish himself as a father figure in my life but I honestly feel like it’s too late. For the past 3 years he always complains to me about how I never reach out to him and he says that I hate him and my sisters (his daughters with his wife) when in reality I don’t. I try my best to ignore everything and look at him as a father but he literally wasn’t a part of my life until I was 8. I had to stop visiting him because of fear when I was 10. But for the last 3-4 years he’s changed a lot and I’m trying to see him as someone to look up to but I just can’t.

And I personally know people who'd I'd consider much higher iq or intelligent than myself. My grades are even lower than I'd want because of my limited effort and bad habits. But that's beyond the point.

My point is I've never felt like I can connect with anyone. I've never met anyone that really understands me. Even very smart people. They can make me question myself and stimulate my thinking but they don't actually seem to see the world the way I do. I feel this way even with my own family and wife.

I don't want to be this way. The only time I ever feel connected is when I'm under the influence. When I get high I actually connect and feel like I process information and thoughts at the same level of my peers. As soon as I'm sober it disappears.

I'm not some neckbeard. I'm one of the most social outgoing people that I can be. It's not who I am. I am not trying to be a whiny teenager who says ""no one understands me"" out of angst. But I really mean it. Is it normal to feel as if nobody gets you?

So about 2 years ago I moved across country for a job while he was finishing up college. It was a location we both agreed on and he would come after graduation, and he did. When he moved out here he looked for a full time job and could not find one, so I supported him with mine for a year prior to him finding one. 

He has been training for this new job for what will be 6ish months in a different state. He came home to visit recently and was less affectionate and barely touched me. In our text conversation (sounds goofy) but he hasnt sent any memes or gif and we used to have whole conversations just with them. He has only only said I love or miss you a couple times unless I prompt him by texting it first.

I’ve started to notice some bad habits beginning and I’m worried I’m about to enter a deep depression. I’ve never really dealt with this feeling before and I’m not quite sure how to categorize it. I’ve been making excuses to not go to work, eating extremely unhealthy foods in excessive amounts, smoking weed almost every day, and feeling overwhelmed to the point I don’t want to do anything. I know what those habits can signify and be symptoms of. I’m getting my masters degree in psychology so the symptoms of depression are ingrained in my mind, I just don’t feel the sadness I would have expected from having depression. I know it sounds naive, but while I can notice symptoms externally, I don’t know how it feels internally and I’m not sure if what I’m feeling is correct.

I’m not just trying to “skate by,” and my reasons for wanting to do this are complicated. The language classes require slightly less work at the community college, and after having changed my major several times between a BFA and a few different BAs, language was pushed to my junior and senior years. 

I have always had a difficult time learning language and in order to graduate on time I had to take 4, 8-week courses of Spanish. It’s not nearly enough time for me to comprehend anything.

368,"My relationship with my mother is complex. She did not spend much of her time raising me, though when she did, she would use this time to police my diet and behavior, to guilt me, etc. I do love her, though oftentimes in a caregiver/care receiver way, as I listen to her during more emotional periods of her life while she does not give the same in return. This dynamic has existed for as long as I can remember. 

So about a week ago, it was her birthday. I texted her at 10AM her time (we live in different states) with the intent to call after I had finished my errand for the morning. 

She responded with, “I’m surprised you even remember my bday... did Facebook remind you?” which immediately escalated into “You’ll remember each year when I’m dead.” The convo got worse from here as I tried to explain that I’ve been having a hard time in my personal/school life lately. After this, I shut down and still haven’t called her (which is ensuring the severity of our next call).

Now, I know this looks pretty bad on her part. However, she is in an emotionally abusive relationship that has clouded her judgment for quite some time. She has been having a hard time as of late (I know this because of my aunt), asking me, my sister, and her sister for money, losing a lot of weight, etc. She has struggled with multiple addictions, so we are thinking this might be contributing.

I don’t want to simply ignore her, but I’m having issues establishing boundaries that get through to her. Severing ties is not an option, as I care about my family too much to do so. I am not going to lie, I am also worried that she will revoke my health insurance if I don’t speak to her soon.

372,"So I heard about this lady who got injured or something, and it put her in a state of confusion. The house that she had lived in since she got married (which she could normally navigate through with her eyes closed) stopped feeling familiar. She didn't recognize her husband.

Anyway, the experience was disturbing to her, which makes sense, I mean no one wants to be in that state... except for me. This is where I'm starting to think I'm crazy.

374,"i like a depressed boy

i’ve known this boy since freshman year, he’s always been cute to me but also cringey but i love how he isn’t afraid to be himself, but let me not get off track. i always knew he liked me the back of his head but i was oblivious until last year. during our freshman year together he was really fucked up, made jokes about killing himself and sharing TOO much too the point where it was just so fucking awkward. but sophomore year it seemed like he got better but in reality i think it just got worst in my opinion, he stopped sharing so much, he always put up this tough boy front whenever he’d be going through shit and left his friend group and befriended older kids, i didn’t know what was going on his life anymore, we weren’t close anymore. since sophomore year he dated two girls (that i know of), hooked up with one (that i know of) and liked two of my friends (that i know of). the bad thing is that that spring the feeling for him sank in. we kinda talked over the summer and apparently he had a girl that summer too which i found out about yesterday.  any who, the crush anxiety kicked in on the first day of junior year which is this year, i walked into the gym for the announcement and from my peripheral view i saw him make eye contact with me and i immediately looked the other way and turned to some other friends. for two years he was always at the back of my mind and in the span of six months he’s migrated to become the person i want to dream about when i got sleep every single day. a couple weeks ago i had my friend tell him that i like him so he would know that i liked him but he wouldn’t know that i knew. he told my friends that he’d be up for a relationship with me but he doesn’t want to ruin our friendship because he tends to bring his depression on to other girls. when my friends told me this i was happy but the part that hit me was that he said he’d be open to it as if i never crossed his mind before. that day he sat next to me during lunch and i hated every single second of it because i was nervous and sweating and didn’t know what to say.  the next week my friend updates me and tells me that basically he’d rather be friends. that shut me down and turned on my defense mechanism of me acting like i don’t gaf and when i do this, it’s so mind penetrating like i actually feel this way. i told one of my other friends about this who is closer to him and she talks to him again, he tells her that he’s like me for a really long time but he values me too much to ever put me through a relationship where he just wasn’t happy with himself. this made me the happiest person on earth, not only does he like me but he values me as well. days not even weeks go by and im impatient. i want him to make a move, i want him to be ready to be with me.  these feelings made me so selfish and disrespectful but im human right ? right now im completely infatuated with him i love almost everything about him and i accept him completely! two days ago we had the choice of being partnered up in our english class and i was so nervous, i wanted to work alone but he turned his head with the cutest and durpiest smirk asking me if i wanted to work with him. the most nerve wrecking fifteen minutes of my life! my brain just couldn’t function and i couldn’t interpret the sentences we were doing so the whole time i was like “uhhhhh uhmmm” and it just didn’t go well. fast toward to today, there’s a halloween party and i’m not going but he is, i think it’s partially just the fact that he’d be there and if i was the teeniest bit of drunk i’d fuck everything up. im planning on telling him my feelings in like two weeks, i want to get things on the table. idk what im expecting from this other than the contentment of being direct... i just don’t know what to do, this was really long and im severely sorry",19Nov2019,1

376,"Throwaway because my HS friends know my main

Over the past few months as a freshman, I've started to realize that I'm pretty bad at being a student. I thought I'd be fine with the transition to college as I took much harder classes in high school - which I did okay in I guess - but nooo, it's difficult. Or at least I make it difficult.

I also wasn't a good student in high school. I didn’t study much and barely did the minimum to get through, for the most part. This really sucks as even though I want to do better in university, I have almost no foundation to start from. I don’t really have study habits, my work ethic is awful. In fact, while I wasn’t as close or unlucky as some others, I feel like if I didn’t put in the minimal effort I did in high school, especially towards the end, I probably would have gotten rescinded.

But I’m fortunate enough to have gotten into my state’s flagship university, and then not rescinded, and still kept my scholarships. Currently, I barely get by with my calendar. But that’s not enough. I’ve dropped a math class, luckily without much consequence, because I sometimes skipped it - it was an 8AM class and I didn’t like it, I barely did the homework, and I didn’t study it, because honestly I don’t know ‘how to study’. Thankfully I did take a higher credit load to begin with, otherwise my scholarship = gone. And then after dropping that class everything feels like it spiraled out of control, even though I have much more time now. And then my main major class, computer sci, which I find really difficult to catch up with, because I got credit for the introductory class and now I’m with mostly sophomores. And I’m extremely behind in it. And I don’t practice it. I have little motivation to do anything usually, and somehow procrastinate or find something else to do and somehow waste a LOT of time. I get distracted easily and can't focus outside of class. I spend way too much time in my room. I ocassionally feel overwhelmed and I don’t know if college is for me, but I really want to think I can do it.

My hygiene is also awful, or at least not ideal - I occasionally don’t shower every day and I just feel like I always smell bad even when I do. I sleep late often, and still feel tired and exhausted after my classes are done. I don’t excercise besides walking. I’m okay with eating but ocassionally skip meals or binge eat. At least I haven’t gotten into any party culture though.

383,"What do you do when nothing works? How to know when to quit? And how do you even quit?

ill tell my story in short. Or at least I’ll try .   
I moved to the USA when I was 19 with $500 in my pocked and big dreams. I didn’t care if I’m making the right move, or if I have enough money to do it. I just knew I want to make a living of of making music and I will somewhow make it happen .

i know this sounds like a beginning of a lot of ambitious success stories right? Well, long story short, I’m almost 27 and I achieved nothing. In any field or aspect of my life. And especially not in my grand plan .   
there has been a few years that I been doing pretty good financially in sales, but that has required me to focus hard on making money and keeping that mindset . Which ultimately keeps me AWAY from my dream .   
i always told myself that Id give it a chance until I reach 25. That I’m definitely supposed to somehow see progress or some kind of success until I’m 25 or I’m gonna lose it.

i had some sort of a breakdown when I reached 26 years old . I realized that I pretty much failed so far, I’m getting older, people are building Careers Around me. Parents are pressuring me to succeed .   
i was doing pretty well financially, but it didnt allow me to focus on my grand plans and dreams at all. I decided at 26 years old to try and quit BS jobs, fuck the money, live below my means and make my dreams happen .   
long story short, I’m in debt and at the worst financial situation of my life. It’s so bad, that I can’t even focus on making my dream come true or let alone focus on anything besides keeping afloat.  
im exhausted, mentally and physically. I worked hard in 8 years on business and on my art, with no success to show for in neither. I’m so tired, so discouraged.   


on top of that, nothing works in other fields of my life as well. I have visa problems, and the trump laws in the US don't make it easier. I can’t leave the country until it gets sorted out. Haven’t seen most of my family in years. Haven’t had a real vacation in years.

i did get married a couple years ago, my wife is my best friend which is great. our relationship started out rough, she was a little childish and I always tried to mature her so it created this weird father-daghther dynamic .   
however our relationship did mature and now it is really great, better than ever.   
i don’t know if it’s love, but she definitely makes me happy when everything else is really not working .

&amp;#x200B;

I have also become overweight in the last few years. I eat super healthy and have good habits. For some reason I just stay very chubby. This is mentally exhausting . Eating super healthy, living life correctly, and still staying Overweight. Super discouraging .

when I focus on business and making money, my dreams got pushed aside and I felt that I’m getting older without living my passion and dream life.   
but when I did try to focus on my passions, financial stress got to me and made everything worse. How do I win?

&amp;#x200B;

im an intelligent man, great people skills, intuitive, innovative, could always get jobs easily. People like me. People assume I’m successful just because of how I carry myself. and Despite situation, I am not depressed. I barely have an ounce of motivation in me, but still have some.   
just so, so, tired . How am I so unsuccseful? I have all the skills . People always tell me that I’m so smart and inspiring/motivating. Really? So How am I still so unsuccessful? Not just with my big dreams, but with ANY aspect of life so far?

what do I do? How do I regain strength?   
cant even describe how exauhsted I am . Do I quit? How do i quit? NOTHING works.   
money, my dreams, my weight, even my residency. I’m so lost.   
I know for fucking sure that I’m trying my best and working so hard. But I’m just TIRED. Years of no success. In anything .   
   
I know this is probably a super hard situation to give advice for. Just really don’t know what do.

385,"This is a fairly long post.

I recently had a friend block me on Instagram and Facebook out of the blue, it’s a pretty shitty feeling and it’s the first time that I’m aware it’s happened. They kept me on Snapchat and some online game accounts.

Anyways I’m male (22) and she’s female (20), both university students. We matched on Tinder back at the end of July and played video games as our first interaction together, hit it off fairly well, she gives me her Snapchat and we talk and play games more. She asks me what I was looking for on Tinder and I tell her it’s to meet new people, try new things, and really get out of my comfort zone as I tend to keep to myself and stick to things I know I enjoy. This was the truth for me at the time. She says she’s pretty much looking for the same thing.

Fast forward to September when classes start we decide to meet in person over lunch, and again, hit it off fairly well. We talk and hangout on campus frequently. On busy days, which had become common, we were spending anywhere between 5-8 hours around each other a day. While apart we also messaged each other often, just talking about nothing in particular. We both go try a few new things together, getting out of our comfort zones together (we have quite a few shared interests, as well as differences). Move to the end of September, we do this event together (which she invited me to), it’s a late night outdoor art exhibit type of thing spread around downtown and broadway in our city, with a bunch of different things being shown off (it’s called Nuit Blanche). This night, at least from my perspective, felt like a date, though neither of us actually called it that. Towards the end of the night (a little past midnight) I’ve gotta pee, and nothings open so she says she’ll let me use her washroom, so we head to her place. On the way there she says “there’s the bus depot” which has me thinking “okay this was just a friends thing”, but then she immediately goes “I don’t know why I said that”. Anyways we get to her apartment, I use the washroom, then she shows me the nice view from her balcony. I had a chance to make a move on her and didn’t, because I really didn’t want to jeopardize our friendship (I really like this girl, and would’ve been totally happy to just be friends), and I’m awful at reading things like this, like clueless. She gives me her phone to look up when the next bus route is to go home (no data or wifi) and I do exactly that, go home. She checks on me when I get home, says she had a nice night and that was that.

After that night I caught feelings, but I’m the type of person that needs to communicate out of fear of misreading something. I try to let things go on as normal for a while, but just can’t keep the fact that I caught feelings to myself anymore, Thursday before thanksgiving weekend I go to talk to her a pussy out, and think “oh well I’ll try see her tomorrow and try again”. Friday doesn’t work because she’s already heading to her hometown to visit family, and I just can’t wait. She texts me just to have one of our usually chats, and I drop on her “so I’m not gonna lie, I’m like super into you”, she says that she appreciates me telling her, but my timing is ass telling right before she goes to visit family. Things get kinda awkward at this point, we hardly text all weekend, which hasn’t been normal to this point. After the long weekend I ask if we can meet up over coffee and have a chat, so we do that Wednesday. The conversation really boils down to me telling her I liked her enough to open up about things I haven’t shared with anyone else before, that I feel like I can be vulnerable with her, and her saying she likes me, but is emotionally unavailable and not looking for a relationship and that she never meant to lead me on (which she never did, I’d just naturally grown to like her for who she is and from the time we spent together). I acknowledge that things have been kinda awkward over the weekend after I had come clean, but that after this talk I hope things can go back to normal, she agrees saying she hopes we can both move past this like adults; I’m all for this, I respect what she wants. She did show me that I want more than a friendship, though not with her, as I said previously I was more than happy to just be friends. So I get back at it on Tinder of all places, but that’s not super relevant.

After this it’s basically radio silence from her (as well as physical tbh, I haven’t seen her in person since the Friday after we talked) I occasionally try to get a conversation going, but it feels like I need to end every message with a question to get a reply. I ask if any plans we made before our talk will still happen, she says they will but not anytime soon, as she wouldn’t feel comfortable. I tell her that’s okay, and that I respect that she’s got to work at whatever pace feels right to her. The absence of communication continues, with my occasional attempt at sending a meme or something. I go on a couple dates with a couple different people. Midway through November we’ve said like 30 words total to each other since that talk, and I really want to maintain this friendship, I had been trying to, but I didn’t feel like she was reciprocating, and not talking is what hurt the most. 

This last weekend (November 15th), she sends me a snap video showing off her new laptop she had just bought, it’s cool, but I use this snap to try start a conversation about it, trying to get back to our talks about nothing and particular, that didn’t happen. The next day she blocks me out of the blue of Instagram and Facebook, and I’m sort of shell shocked by this. I’m not blocked on Snapchat, as soon as I realized I was blocked I asked her about it and if things between us are cool (this is around 11:45ish at night), I don’t get a reply right away and go to bed. I have a really shitty sleep as my mind is focused on what would’ve made her block me, I wake up at around 5:30am still stuck in thought and she replies at around 5:45 or something, saying she’s taking a break from Instagram and Facebook, and if things weren’t cool between us she’d have removed me on everything already. I call her out on it, saying she could deactivate her accounts if she needed a break, and that I feel singled out and like I did something. She replies that I’m not the only one, a few people have “been bothering” her lately and she’s blocked them too, and that she’s doing it for herself. I say “sorry for doing whatever it was that bothered you enough to block me”, as I genuinely don’t know what I’ve done, we’ve hardly spoke in the past 30 days. We both followed a couple of the same pages on Instagram, maybe she didn’t like seeing the posts I liked on those pages? 

Anyways, full transparency I do still like her, it’s not like I can flip an off switch, but I truly am moving past it, as I said I’ve been on a couple dates, the most recent being last Friday (after the date finding out my friend blocked me). I respect her enough to pursue nothing more than a friendship, but I’ve honestly been obsessing about how I can try maintain this friendship; and now what to do since she’s blocked me. It’s gotten to a really bad point, where I’ve let myself get distracted with thoughts about the situation with her to the point that’s it’s affecting my studies and grades. I’m debating about just blocking her on what she has yet to block me on, just make it easier for the both of us if we’re just gone from each other’s lives (I’ve also gone ahead and blocked her back on Instagram and Facebook, is that petty? Idk). She said she’d talk to me later, do I wait for her to message me? Maybe she explains herself better? Do I keep trying to maintain a friendship? I’m not sure I’d even call us friends or even friendly at this point. I really don’t know what to think or do at this point, I genuinely care for this person and wish them the best, but maybe it’s best for both of us to just not exist to each other anymore. Idk, I need advice, but also to get that off my chest as there’s nobody I feel comfortable sharing this with.

He has sort of passive-arrogance that I can’t stand, and somewhat of an attitude problem. He’s nice, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t particularly like him enough to be a friend. Definitely not enough to like him romantically.

Here’s the thing though— he is, objectively, a handsome guy physically. I identify as asexual so I /very rarely/ feel physical attraction towards another person. Usually when I do it’s towards someone I’m close to and is very short-lived. This is also the first time it’s been towards a guy (the past times were all girls). So the fact that I feel this way towards a guy I can’t really stand, that sometimes really gets on my nerves, this sort of arrogant guy, this guy I don’t really even like, really pisses me off. I look at him and instantly I’m annoyed. Like really, this guy? But the feeling won’t go away and I literally don’t know what to do, I’ve never had this problem before. It’s even worse because we do have to work together daily, in sort of close proximity, but I have this strange and infuriating mixture of attraction and rage towards him. How do I stop being physically attracted to this guy?? I haven’t told anyone in my friend circle this because I know they’re just going to make this a huge deal/make fun of me.

So basically to make a long story short I've been working for my dad at his small company since I graduated high school. I'm now 24 years old and live with him because he cant pay me because the company is not doing so well since my mom left him 6 years ago. 

I quit working for him three months ago but still live with him because I'm too scared to get another job. It's very depressing, I only leave my room in the middle of the night to find food and this had been going on since I quit. I dont like my dad at all, hes a drunk and very manipulative. 

So heres my problem, I need to move out but I'm super scared to get a job because I've never actually had a real one before. And I live in colorado so it's super expensive to live here and I have no friends I can roommate with. 

I was also given another option that I could move in with my mom who lives in a very small town in south Dakota. Now it's much more affordable to live in south Dakota and I'll be far from my dad which is nice BUT I hate the idea of living in a town of only 300 people. I love the city and I love colorado so much I'd hate to move. 

So that's what I need advice on. Should i go move to a small town? Is it possible to live on my own in colorado? How do I get a job without having a panic attack?

Hi everyone,

I've been working on my first podcast. I'm hoping to become a producer and/or editor. So I figured the best way to get the experience I need is to start creating. I've been working on my podcast, Recollections for a few weeks now. I've basically finishied 2 episodes. I'm hoping to get 3 episodes done as a cushion before I start releasing weekly episodes. It's a weekly podcast where a guest explores nostalgic memories and they get in touch with a sense of curiosity of the world from their youth. It's a bit abstract in that it's like a memory poem with sound design, music, etc. And you don't hear an interviewer asking questions more like internal monologues put together into a montage it's placed together based on its own internal logic. I'm hoping to evoke a contemplative mood and get audiences to relate to universal themes of early memories and growing up. Some of my feedback has been good. But mostly I've been getting a lot of ""it's boring, tedious and uninteresting."" I'm all for constructive criticism but when someone just says it's bad it really hurts my feelings. It makes me want to give up. But part of me is saying to just keep moving forward and keep creating to get the experience. What is everyone else's experience of this? Any suggestions? Posting here because I feel a bit sad about the whole thing. Thanks for your time... &lt;3 &lt;3",19Nov2019,1

414,"Hi, I (20F) recently got into a little heated conflict with my best friend (20F), she’ll be given the fake name Mel. 

For context, I’ve been under a lot of stress from having recently having to go back to a job after being unemployed for six months when an offer fell through. When I get stressed I tend to want to be alone, and I already hate talking on the phone to begin with as it spikes my social anxiety.

I’ve not answered her calls for the past few weeks, but whenever she texts I try my hardest to remember to text back (when I’m not at work). But I really hate talking like that, so I ignore the calls and am open to text her. She tries to call multiple times a day (like five). 

Each time we’ve talked recently, all Mel really talks about is a man she’s interested in, her Ex, and her issues at home or with her work. I decided I don’t need her stress on top of mine, but she’s one of only two friends I have.

Tonight she texted me saying she’s ready to cut ties because she’s tired of putting in all the effort, even though when we normally hung out before (I have no problems hanging out, it’s my favorite way to communicate), I would end up paying for our food and being the one to ask her if she wants to try and plan something. She’s mad that I’m not answering her calls. When I said I was going through something personal, she got angrier asking how is she supposed to help when I won’t answer, and got passive aggressive when I said I just need to be alone.

419,"Hi all, I'm 18/F. I post here alot. 

When I was 16, I was very depressed and lonely. I had trouble making friends in high school, so I took to the internet to try and make friends. This includes boyfriends. Sadly, my life situation is already fucked up. As in, I was adopted by my grandparents because my own parents are addicts. I was neglected as an infant and nearly died as a result. My grandpa did not want to take me in, and has had a chip on his shoulder for years about it. Lots of people have told me the best thing to do might be to get away. 

But when I was 16, I met a guy. However, he was a lot older. Like 38 at the time. I have *always* had a thing for older guys, and I knew better, but I went for it anyway. And I swear to God, he really did seem like he loved me. I mean, obviously not at first, but the love came around. It was all online.. 

But shortly after we met and, my friend reported it. And when police got involved, I felt like my world was falling apart. I really loved him, and I didn't think he deserved to go to jail. So I used some function way back called ""find my device"" with Google plus, and remotely hard reset my phone to delete all the evidence. I did eventually tell him about it, but it took awhile. I could've gone to jail for deleting all that stuff, and he got away Scott free. I was happy then, and really thought it would be worth it, bu. I know I fucked up though. 
But the thing is, we've been together long distance for the past two years. I even flew to see him when I turned 18, but it was only for a really short time. It was awesome to meet him, and the way he acted in real life really showed he loved me. But he works two jobs, and as a result apparently doesn't even have time to call. Which I know that's not entirely true. But idk what I was thinking. We recently broke up, and he wants to stay friends. But I'm so mad at him, because he's the one who stopped trying. I keep telling him I hate him, and using all this stuff against him which makes me feel terrible but he doesn't value me anymore is all I feel.

Breakups, new jobs, family drama, you name it we've probably been through it. We've gone through all this and gotten so close as people. But this past year it's like he's changed into a completely different person. We talk atleast once every day but lately it's just gotten to the point where he either leaves me on read or shoots me down anytime I try to talk about something I have intrest in. The only time we have a real conversation is when it's about something he wants to talk about. I try to get into the topics he likes, but he won't even respond if I don't say or do something in the way he wanted me to do it. We hardly ever see each other anymore and even when we do I have to be the one to initiate it. Most of my attempts at trying to start a conversation with him are met with an ""I just got off work and I'm going to bed"", though I know he's lying because I see him playing games on pc/console. I've tried to confront him about it before and he always says that he values my friendship and that he just has trouble showing it. I just don't know anymore though.

I’m living with two friends of mine in a flat and everything goes well, but my upper neighbors are often super noisy in the morning (and trough the rest of the day), it wakes me up like one day out of two.
I hear loud steps, things falling on the ground violently, furniture being moved and dragged, metal clanging (??) and sometimes hammering on the wall. All that from 8am (one time it was 7) to 10pm, I mean it can get silent for 1 or 2 hours but then it comes back and doesn’t stop for a long long time, the worst is when they begin their show in the morning though. 

I believe it’s a retired couple, we’ve never talked to them about this but I’m wondering how to make them understand that it bothers us and be polite and respectful.

425,"Hi, so....this is my first time really posting here I honestly apologize if I miss any details due to nervousness.

So I started dating my boyfriend about 7 months ago. Everything was fine! Met on tinder, we wanted to date each other after a month, etc etc. 

A few months ago, my boyfriend calls me on the phone (since I went home over summer break from college), and we begin to talk dirty. I never truly asked him what he enjoyed and got his rocks off too. I was curious.

And so he told me. And it...kinda freaked me out.

See, my boyfriend is into ABDL (Adult Baby/Diaper Lover). Huge into the DL side of it. He said it makes him feel safe.

He said during the call, his parents were away for the week and he was wearing at that moment. I couldn’t speak. I felt grossed out, and weirdly betrayed.

I told him straight up that I wasn’t comfortable with it and that if he loved me, he would stop. I didn’t care if he jerked off to it. Just....not wear. And he promised me he would stop. He threw all of the stuff away. 

Something about me, I have a brother who is handicapped (cannot move his legs at all) and can’t use the bathroom by himself. Growing up, I had to change his pull ups all the time, even now when he was 16. I’m used to it, however I HATED doing it. I moved away from home to get away from that. To NOT have to take care of someone like that again.

So....

For the rest of the summer, I couldn’t get it off my head. I couldn’t even think about kissing him again when I got back. Let alone have sex with him.

But I soon forgot about it after a week I got back because I missed his company too much.

Today, after a dinner get together with my friends and such at our new apartment (we just moved in with each other a week ago), we crawled into our bed and cuddled for a bit because we were tired. 

He brought up his fetish again, wanting to wear because he would be home off for the next few days. I of course denied it again, said I was uncomfortable. But he said I really should reconsider it, but he said he wouldn’t do it unless I was okay with it. I’m starting to slowly realize how he’s been slipping by me with it these past two months.

- I bought a bear onesie because I wanted one and he constantly wants me to wear it, even claimed to want to fuck me in it

- Um...when he plays with my chest during sex, he like...*really* goes at it with his mouth? I can’t describe it any other way, I’m sorry. 

- And he’s kinda calling me “mommy” now, but that was a joke on the play daddy because yeah. But I don’t know if it’s a joke anymore.

- also probably should mention that he wanted me to try it. Which I politely declined. But he was very adamant that I do, just so I know what it felt like.

I love him to death, but I can’t do this. I need to know if I’m the asshole for not letting him enjoy his fetish. I don’t want to be mean to him, but it freaks me out.",19Nov2019,1

There is a situation with a couple of my managers where they are making false accusations about me and questioning my work conduct when I try and stand up for myself.

I have currently signed myself off as it’s causing me to verge on panic attacks just thinking about going into work.

436,"I run a small Warframe clan/discord with some friends. One friend, the one letting everyone use the clan space, M, feels that everyone who joins needs to contribute all spare items to the clan. I felt this is an unrealistic goal, as some members are new or people just don't grind out resources as much as others. This upset M, and he said those people are leeches and need to be kicked from the clan. He has already removed two members from our 7-person clan. He makes a lot of impulse decisions, and I only tried to disagree a couple of times. This time it was worse than the other times. 

As far as the discord goes, he interrogates every new member that joins the discord I pay premium for. This often makes the person feel uncomfortable, and the questions can easily be asked by a bot for the person to answer in their own time. My biggest concern is that his questions about the initiates ""intentions with the clan"" will discourage members from wanting to get involved. To me, he is gatekeeping his own clan and only wanting people in who are as hard-core dedicated as he is. Meanwhile, I just want everyone to join regardless of rank or experience so that way I can help them as any clan leader should.

439,"Me and my friend are both about the same age in our early 30s (I am M/33, he is M/34) and we've known each other since 6th Grade so half our lives. When I pulled out of public school and began being home-schooled in 9th Grade he was the only friend I really kept in contact with and for our teenage years we were pretty inseparable. We would often spend our weekends together playing games or just hanging out, going for walks, etc.

As adults we kinda grew apart, we still have a lot of fondness for each other but just life in general has kept us pretty busy and I moved to a different town (still close but not see-each-other-all-the-time close) and he's never been very sociable so getting in touch with him is always a bit difficult.

Going back to how our lives separated. I was home-schooled through high-school and basically the end result there is I got my GED (High School equivalency diploma for you non-Americans), my friend stayed in public school until 11th grade and dropped out. I briefly attended college in my early 20s but ultimately dropped out myself, but during this time I kept trying to help him get his GED as well. He's fairly intelligent and I know he could easily pass the test, and I encouraged him to do the same thing I did and take free adult education courses and pre-testing at the local community college to help him prepare. He just kept putting it off though or claimed he was doing it but this went on for like a year and I eventually gave up on trying to push him towards it.

I've since gone on to have my own family (wife and kids), my own house, a decent-paying career and even recently been working my way up through promotions. Meanwhile my friend has stayed in the same town he grew up in, still living with his parents (who are very co-dependent on him which is stifling his ability to grow out on his own). He's worked just about every entry level job out there and it seems like every time I talked to him for years he had a new or different job, that ultimately didn't last for some reason or another. He's expressed his desire to move out of his parent's house but feels like he needs to support them and as rough a shape as he is in, his parents still use him like a crutch.

The last time he contacted me he basically asked if I knew anyone who was interested in buying pot. I've never been a smoker myself and while I have no issues personally with the substance, the whole thing just kinda sent alarm bells off in my head. My friend has kinda skimmed through life so far but he's done so more-or-less on the right side of the law. I am sure he thinks he's probably good enough to avoid getting caught but I have seen the way drug dealing, even something as basic as pot can quickly get you in trouble and spiral you into a really bad place that is very hard to get out of. I fear that one bad stint in jail would be enough to close the book on his potential for good.

So now I am in a situation where I really desperately want to help my friend. I know I can get him a good paying job that doesn't require a GED, I've already discussed with my family about letting him live with my in my house, I have room, and I trust him enough to know he would respect my family, my home, and my possessions. If he lived with me I could help provide him a room to stay, a ride to work, and I could help him to get his GED and work towards getting a good financial plan in place to one day have his own house and a stable career, and really take control of his life. 

The biggest issue I have is simply convincing him to do it, I haven't bridged the subject with him yet because I don't quite know how I'd go about it. I feel like a part of him really wants to jump at that opportunity and go for it, I mean we always talked about being roommates before so I don't think living with me would be bad for him. However I feel the biggest obstacle is that he is very dedicated to his family and he probably feels in some way obligated to support them (though he is very resentful towards them for using him as a crutch).

I would just like some general advice on this whole situation, I can answer questions as well if that would help. I want to help him out and I feel like I am in a position to help him but I think convincing him is going to be the hardest part, and I'm not even completely sure if my plan is the best one for him, but I truly feel that if I don't step up and help him become better that nobody else will.",19Nov2019,1

441,"   The basic idea behind losing weight is obviously to burn calories. Here are some steps to help you out. Start today with these 4 *tips* to help you get motivated!  These  easy *weight loss tips* you can slip into your everyday life. 

1. Eat soup 

 You must tame your appetite on special occasions and days when you will be hungry more than usual  .Soup is the dish that will satisfy you the most, so always have an assortment of low sodium broths on hand. Add vegetables for more taste and nutrients. 

2.  Keep a food diary    

  Keeping track of your food choices (food, time and quantity) is a proven strategy.  Keeps track of your intake of carbohydrates, protein and fat with graphs, and gives you a breakdown of some macronutrients in the summary logs for each day.   For example, did skipping a snack make you nibble all night? Better still, download and print the food  journal of Plaisirs Santé ; you can fill it at any time even when you are in a hurry. Store the pages as you measure in a ring binder. 

3.Do not skip meals or snacks  

Breakfast is often called the most important meal of the day.  It helps contain cravings and maintain energy levels during the day . Skipping the morning meal can throw off your body’s rhythm of fasting and eating. When you wake up, the blood sugar your body needs to make your muscles and brain work their best is usually low. Breakfast helps replenish it.If your body doesn’t get that fuel from food, you may feel zapped of energy -- and you'll be more likely to overeat later in the day

4. Exercise regularly. 

Physical activity such as brisk walking not only increases the number of calories burned, but also allows you to lose fat and not muscle mass.",19Nov2019,1

445,"Hey guy's,

So i've been having this issue for a long time where I keep getting into some career path, but I keep falling out of love with it later on. I've done this for everything I ever wanted to be(artist, chef, video game developer, youtuber/influincer, film maker, politician, entrepreneur). I'm back on the entrepreneurship train. The event that started this was me contacting potential clients for a business I am starting for a school project(i'm in uni for economics and entrepreneurship rn). I sent out a bunch of emails to some potential clients, didn't hear back from anyone, asked around on etsy's forums where I was informed the business model my business has is seen as incredibly spammy and sleazy by that community. I think differently, but hey... I'm just the snake oil salesman. It opened my eyes and showed me I do not want to run the business  I thought I did. It also showed me how little I know about running a business. It hurts because i've been telling myself since classes have started back up that if this business is not sustainable by the time I graduate, I would be forced to work in food service(a job I hate and is my biggest fear right now). I also told myself I would be rich one day and that I wouldn't be struggling to eat every day and that I would be at a point I don't think about rent. I still think that that's true but not really. It just feels like I don't know anything and that I am going to be in this perpetual loop of getting really inspired, but when I reach just a little bit of resistance, all passion is gone and I quickly latch onto something else. I'm also horrible when it comes to procrastination and getting things done.

I know 3 things. I hate working jobs, I feel I closed a lot of doors thinking that this was going to be what I was going to do for a career, and I graduate and am going into the real world in May(and we are most likely going to be in a recession at that time).

I feel kind of hopeless now. Like i'm always going to keep getting in this cycle and I'm nog going to go anywhere in my life. I feel like a failure. Even just rereading this message over makes me feel under classed and cringe.

I don't know. I'm just ranting. If any of you guy's want to give your two cents, i'm open...",19Nov2019,1
446,"     I always look past males liking my gf’s post because she’s beautiful, but as for my closer friends it seems a little weird. My gf not only post pictures, but also makes posts of her dj’ing gigs. Some of my closer friends like all of her posts no matter what. I personally dont like any of my closer friends gf post due to my own morals, but i understand to that i shouldnt expect “me” from other people. Usually would look past these seemingly minor situations but im in search of the bigger pictures. 

       I am an inspiring Musician that constantly posts my music &amp; pictures on the same platform. I get an immense amount of support from onlookers which ive never met &amp; barely get support from some of the same closer friends that fully support all of my gf’s post. 

        It would be more understanding to me if it was just one of my close friends that maybe i should shy away from him, but weirdly enough it seems to be more than 10 of my closer friends doing this. 

        I wouldnt call my closer friends my best friends but i could say that i share an extreme amount of experiences with these people and formed “closer” relationships with them that seem timeless no matter if we lack communication at times

         My question is it what am i overlooking? I usually get in my feelings about it &amp; want to cut them off due to suspicion but maybe it is something about our relationship that differs from their relationship with my gf that makes them more susceptible to supporting her &amp; more reluctant to supporting me.",19Nov2019,1

Anyway, there's this cafe that I go into to get some work done most days (I work for myself, so it's a nice luxury), and there's a waiter in there who often comes over and says hello. He notices little things like if I change my hairstyle, or if I'm not there for a while and he's always very friendly. Today he came over and pretended to clean the tables nearby so he could chat for a bit.

From what I gather there's lots of smiles and eye contact when we talk; I honestly get the feeling that if he didn't have to work, he'd just sit down and we'd talk for ages. But in the past I've been horribly wrong about the situation and it got awkward, so I'm reluctant to just say 'hey here's my number'.

I really looked up to this guy , I had a bit of a shit childhood , my parents hated each other,  dad drank and took drugs , she was in and out the mental hospital , she didn't take hard drugs but all her friends and boyfriends seemed to be  junkies and alcoholics. Anyway long story short this step brother used to come down and visit and stay with us , and he seemed to Make everything better , when I was 14 he was married with a kid , he came down and when my mum was out he asked if he could touch my boobs, out of the blue when we was watching TV,  I was shocked , said no and he said sorry.i told my mum the next day and she told me he must of been messing about and not to worry about it and she didnt say anything to him about it. The next time he came to stay I was 15 , he was 25 , my mum went out again , I had a futon bed in my room my mum told him he could sleep there , he asked if he could lay on my bed as it was uncomfortable of the futon , i had a double bed , i said yes thinking nothing of it , he then got into bed and told me he liked me and basically tried to pressure me to have sex with him , I kept saying no , he wanted to be my first he kept saying , I held him in such high regard before then that I didnt really know what to do. He made me touch him then My mum came home and he jumped up and told me to pretend to be asleep and not say anything,  I felt sick and  scared to say anything , he left the next day and my mum asked straight after he left as she knew I wasn't ok,  I told her and she confronted him and disowned him . I dont know why she never reported him. Now he's been in touch with her saying he misses him mum . She told me she doesn't really remember what happened as shes bipolar.  She's come round and asked me about what he did and I think basically to see how I feel about him being in touch, I basically told her I dont want him in our lives , she has agreed that he is wrong but i know she feels bad for him, she said his just out the mental hospital, hes schizophrenic , I can tell she wants to forgive him. Iv always felt like she cared about me the least over my two brothers , but knowing that she would want him back after what's happened Makes me feel like I dont really matter atall . My partner thinks I should cut ties with her if she had him back . I feel like I cant give her that ultimatum, like I'd be in the wrong for cutting her off.

I have a problem with laziness (My GPA is ok (about 2.8/4.0), but I don't want to attend class, so I missed so many final exams ( if ur score is F or worse they won't add it to ur GPA, that's how it's work in my university, so yeah that's why I got 2.8 GPA)

I don't remember having amy sperm or pre-ejaculation on my fingers or hands. She says that the period might be late cause of stress from school. She has breast soreness and distinct discharge (a bit more frequent and she doesn't feel it coming unlike before), no apetite, in fact she actually barely drinks or eats anything throughout the day. She says that she feels tired from school and wants to stay at home and has cried a lot lately because of her period being late, which also has had me stressed for the past couple of days too. Should I buy her a pregnancy test or is it too early? I know this might sound a bit stupid or too early but we're both scared and we don't want to tell our parents.

The new car was a present to himself and the monthly payments of that car would not jeopardize us financially.Up to this point I can say we were a very happy couple.

489,"Hi guys, hopefully this is the right sub for this:  
I work for a startup with 7 employees total. In short, my boss apparently has been overpaying myself and 4 others about $100 each pay since we all started (at different times). For me it has been for the past 7-8 months. None of us ever realized because for most of us it's our first job with a salarie, we never calculated what we were suppose to get after taxes and our pay has just been e-transfered to us every second friday with no pay stub.   
Last thursday (one day before pay) my boss emailed me a form with calculations from his accountant basically saying he overpaid us and I have to pay it back before the end of 2019. This means a cut of about $300 off of each paycheque for the next 2 months. This wasn't something that I had obviously budgeted for, I make only 30K a year. It leaves me with about $50 after all my bills are paid for 2 weeks.   
It also equates to being paid under minimum wage where I live in Canada. I'm not sure if that's important.  
I'm wondering if there's anything I can do about this, anything I can say, or just any advice you have. What would you do?

This year though I’ve been thinking. If I maintain good grades then I’m expected to get into a good college and if I get into a good college I’m expected to get a good job... etc. 




So what happens if in can’t do that? Then I’m seen as the guy who messed everything up and can’t do anything right.




On the other hand. If I stay with B’s and C’s then everyone sees me as an average guy and when I inevitably mess up everyone will think “oh, he’s only human, people mess up.”




And I’ll be honest, there has been times when I know the answer and get it wrong on purpose. the sad thing is I enjoy school I really do, it’s just that I am deeply afraid of what people expect of me.




To close, I have asked my dad about this and he told me,” do you really wanna look in the mirror every morning and think, eh good enough, or do you want to be better?”  “I know what you’ll be happier with.”

To start, we are both girls and have been friends for about 4 years. I kind of sensed that she may have wanted to do something with me throughout the course of our friendship but I wasn't a 100% certain and I was still dangling with my sexuality. Fast forward a couple years, she gets with this guy we both worked with and I was happy for her because he's good to her. Well in February of 2019, I went to her apartment and we had the usual watch YouTube videos and drink IPA. Well one thing led to the other and we started to have sex.. The next day we kind of pretended like nothing happened and I was fine. Fast forward a couple of days, i couldn't understand why I couldn't stop thinking about that night and her touching me and holding me. I started to think about her boyfriend and the guilt just kept piling up. I also thought about them together and I would just cringe. I started to sink deep into a vulnerable state. I texted her more and she texted less. We eventually ended up doing it two more times and after we were finished the third time, she told me she just sees me as a friend. I knew that but it hurt like hell to hear it. I ended it that night and decided maybe we could still be friends. Fast forward to March, we go to her moms because she wanted to cook for my birthday and buy me a cake. Well once I get to the door she tells me her boyfriend is there. The whole time they were just kissing and hugging. And I know I sound selfish but it was eating at me so bad that I kept going to the bathroom to bawl my eyes out. I made an excuse and left early because I couldn't take it. A couple months later she begs me to go to her cinco de mayo party. I asked who would be there and she told me it would just be family. I get there and he's there again and of course she was sitting on his lap right in front of me making out the whole time. This time I left without notice because it was eating me up. I texted her a couple days later to confess how I felt. All she said was that she was sorry and she didn't want things to be awkward. I told her we should probably keep our distance for now. I ended up impulsively blocking her because as long as she was in my life I felt miserable. But down the road I started to miss her again and impulsively texted her while I was in a drunken state. She responded just asking how I was but I haven't messaged back yet. I don't really know what to do.. I have extreme social anxiety so I'm consumed by loneliness so all I do is think of her because I don't have anyone else.

Some back story (not essential to read, the question is stated in the title).

I grew up on a farm in South Africa on the edge of Lesotho, there were no nearby schools and my father was strongly against sending us (My brothers and me) off to a boarding schools and was not so keen on schools in general, that being said my brothers did attend kindergarten for a period of time if memory serves me well.

My mother did do a magnificent job at schooling us, especially in our younger years even though we weren't the most willing students but it is really tough trying to teach three boys. She continued to teach us throughout the years but we just wanted to run outside and explore the mountainside and slide down its slopes on cardboard in winter or go on walks in the Veld and swim in the reservoirs in spring and summer or one of the other countless adventures we went on. Hence the schooling was pushed to the side and was quite minimal, despite my mother's best efforts, that being said she happily participated in our adventures and made our childhood truly wonderful.

For the previous five years, I have been making knives and trying my hand out at various other crafty things but my main interest has been knifemaking. More recently my parents have (kinda) treated knifemaking and my other endeavors (E.g CAD) as my 'self' schooling.

In short, we did do some form of schooling throughout the years but it was quite minimal.

I suffer with depression and anxiety and I am currently not working and I feel like it is the ideal time to figure out what career path I want in life and to work towards it.   
I have a higher diploma in Criminology and Sociology and didn't complete my degree as I was struggling with my mental health.   
I'm turning 30 in a few months so I feel like I'm getting too old to not have settled down in a career and I don't feel like I'm young enough for extensive training or studying.   
I'm a very caring, thoughtful person, I like to work within a lot of structure and I can't stand any form of retail or customer facing job. I like to be organised and I really enjoy figuring out why people do things, for example what happened in a persons childhood to shape them in that way and motivate them towards that behaviour etc.  
I also have previous voluntary experience working as an offender mentor, helping released prisoners reintegrate back into society and a helpline and drop in volunteer for female survivors of sexual abuse. I enjoyed both of these positions at the time but feel the sexual abuse route is too heavy for my own mental wellbeing and that former prisoners don't necessarily want help so it's not fulfilling.   
I would like a meaningful job but also something I am capable of handling. I struggle with feeling good enough and like I have the skills to actually help anyone and it stresses me out to think someone is relying on me to help them, because what if I get it wrong.   
I have a miniature dachshund and I love him to pieces and he has really helped me with my social anxiety and depression so I would love a job where I could bring him in a couple of days a week or work with animals in a therapeutic sense.   
I was considering becoming a psychologist but that would require further studying and I'm not sure.   
Care work, social work, working for the police, governmental institutions, corporate jobs - none of these type of jobs interest me.   
I would like to work somewhere where they understand the importance of mental health and wellbeing.

510," 

I don’t know how to deal with what I realize is an extremely minor problem in my life. But it's like that water droplet torture method, it’s such a small problem but since it happens every day, I’m being driven insane by it. 

I’m a repair technician who also happens to be a female, a female who wishes daily I had been born a man. I'm technically trans, but I'm not going to transition because I feel like I'm too short, among a handful of other reasons, mostly money and health. I really didn’t think female technicians were uncommon these days, but it still seems like it is where I’m from. I go into peoples houses alone to fix whatever needs repair, and every day, sometimes more than once a day, I get locked into a conversation that usually starts like, “I didn’t expect a woman! Wow! I’m so surprised. Good job! It’s good to see women doing these things. Women can do what men can do too! Girl power!” I’ve had this job for nearly 10 years, and the occurrence and frequency of these conversations have not stopped. So when people constantly point out I’m a woman and say “Wow congrats” it’s extremely hard to not want to flat out tell them to drop it. I have a lot of opinions about why congratulating me for simply having female anatomy and having a specific job paired together with the anatomy isn’t worth a compliment either, but I’ll shelf that, basically humans are capable beings.

People say it so much that I just go, “Oh yeah, haha, everyone says that,” Then I'm surprised that they're surprised that they’re not the first one to notice. I used to be really good at putting on a performance and really engaging in these conversations, but now I'm at the end of my rope. I can only really reply with one to two word sentences and forced smiles. People keep going on about it regardless, it's like I have no hope.

I realize this doesn't seem like a big issue. All my friends shrug when I complain. Everyone always expects me to complain about sexists or something, not the people who are supportive. It reminds me of when a friend who delivered pizzas would complain about how people who would see him carrying a pizza would have a list of annoying reoccurring phrases they’d say almost like they were NPCs, like “Oh hey is that for me?” or something. So I realize this problem doesn’t seem like a problem except for those who experience it, so all I can really say is imagine your job, but every day, you’re distracted from your work to have the same conversation about something about yourself you hate. And then you’re congratulated for it. How the fuck do I manage this? Even just opinions on it, negative or positive, or maybe tell me I’m complaining over nothing. Since I’m the only person I know with this annoying problem it would really help just to get out of my own echo chamber of a head.

513,"So I’ve had this best friend since 8th grade and we’ve always been pretty close and never had any arguments or hurt each other’s feelings. Like honestly I’ve never met such a peaceful and rewarding friendship as ours. I always trust what she says and vice versa because we want the best and success for each other.
She moved over the summer abroad to start college. We were fine up until a few months ago.
She started to like this guy and I started to like this guy and we would talk about it. Point is, her guy got a girlfriend and so did mine so rip. Whenever I talk about it, she turns it negatively, despite him being a good person. However, I understand that. She might’ve been bothered that we both had to go through that. That one didn’t really bother me, it just surprised me she was negative for once.
Then.. I uploaded a picture on my Instagram. My friends seemed to like it and so did I. I was kind of self-conscious because I never really upload pics. My guy best friend said I looked fine. However she texted me out of the blue to tell me to delete it and that I looked weird while the other people in the pic with me looked so good. This is when I started doubting myself. Because as a best friend, she has never ever said anything like that, so I figured she’s being honest and telling me the truth. Maybe I did look weird. Obviously I ended up deleting it and it kinda hurt honestly.
The same guy and a few of his friends asked why it was deleted because I looked very pretty to them, but then again. My confidence was already bust down by the person who I appreciate the most. 
Lastly, I’ve been working on something for the past 4 years, and there’s been a bump on the road. So obviously I’ve been set back. She’s always been supportive and believed in me, but lately she’s told me to stop being stubborn and look for other options. Again, like every other time, I said “you’re right.” I feel like somehow she doesn’t mean to hurt me intentionally, but look out for me. However I feel like those things affect my overall mood and I’m scared of talking to her about my life or new things now without being judged.
She’s my best friend and I don’t want to lose her. Please, please give me advice. Should I talk to her? Should I just toughen up? Follow her advice as a friend? Or mine? I’m very stupid when it comes to this because a part of me says to follow my instincts, but another says that a best friend always knows best.",19Nov2019,1

I don’t know what happened because at the being of the quarter I didn’t get anything less then a 90 and was the smartest person in my class. After I got these grades I can’t stop crying thinking about them and I keep getting random panic attacks, I really don’t know what happened and I feel hopeless. As I’m taking more tests in school I can’t seem to remember anything and I lose focus so fast.

516,"So I’m in a group chat for the party me and all my friends are going to this weekend and the girl that’s throwing it said that one person is gonna have to get naked for a game we’re playing andd apparently everyone decided that I’m gonna do it lmao 
I thought it was funny so I told them I would do it cause the party was supposed to only be like 6 girls but they keep inviting people so it got up to like 20 something people in the group chat(mostly guys) and they were all expecting me to do it.im an idiot though and I hate disappointing people so I only told them that I’m excited to do it.

I was at my friends house yesterday so I got to talk to them privately(3 of the original 6 girls+the girl throwing the party) about being nervous and wanting to back out but they basically said it was to late to back out now and that I should have said something earlier.they just kept trying to talk me back into it then it turned into if I don’t do it shes gonna cancel the party completely...so I just said okay I’ll do it,just forget I even said anything lol.but I guess they didn’t believe me anymore cause one of my friends suggested that I let them take naked pictures of me to prove that I’m gonna do it...I was really surprised she would even say that but  they all thought it was a good idea so I let them do it.i won’t go into detail but it was embarrassing af but somehow sort of hot 🤷🏼‍♀️ they didn’t want to give me my clothes back until they got like every picture they could think of,the only reason I got them back was because my mom showed up to pick me up so I had to get dressed really fast and lie to my mom about why my face was bright red.
On the way home my phone was blowing up so I looked and it was the group chat,they were posting all those pictures of me in it. ALL of them like 100 almost.i think I had a panic attack because I was freaking out but I couldn’t show it cause then my mom would know so I just turned my phone off. I didn’t turn it back on until I made it to my room and by that point I was so turned on that I just touched myself and read what people were saying.

My question is,why is this situation turning me on? Like nothing about this should be hot but I can’t stop thinking about it.there has to be something wrong with me.

I sort of think the best thing I can do at this point is to just got to the party and do what they want so they don’t use the pictures against me,what do you think??",19Nov2019,1

518,"It\`s a bit of a mess tbh. Everything was awesome, util I let my emotions kick in. Started acting needy and jealous, not because I usually am like that, but because I was scared. I\`m a guy, who is good looking, confident. But I got emotionally attached pretty quick, since I just used to hook up, party and drink. Didn\`t have a real relationship with anyone. Therefore I haven\`t ever been dealing with this in my life. She was going through a rough time. And I got so scared that I will lose her to the point of me being a bit desperate and needy. We used to be in a long distance relationship, so most of our communication is done via text. I interpret text messages very bad, and my insecurities came to light. I\`m aware why I lost her, we continued vaguely texting. I fucked up big time now, because I said that I\`m leaving and not coming back. I don\`t know if she really just needed space and i wasn\`t giving it, or was it just a mask. Keep in mind, we had a real click, I am the first guy who she let to touch her. I don\`t know what to do at this point. I feel like going there and calling her. I just don\`t know if she cares anymore.

525," My \[21F\] relationship with my mother is complicated.  I grew up being raised primarily by my father, seeing her on the weekends. While I do love her, she was emotionally neglectful towards me and my sister growing up so I do not feel any sort of bond with my mom.  She has long believed that we only choose our dad over her because he is more financially successful, but this choice has more to do with the fact that she was an on-and-off addict while we were growing up and the fact that our stepdad takes out his insecurities on the family.  

About a week ago, it was her birthday. I texted her at 10AM her time (we live in different states) with the intent to call after I had finished my errand for the morning.

She responded with, “I’m surprised you even remember my bday... did Facebook remind you?” which immediately escalated into “You’ll remember each year when I’m dead.” The convo got worse from here as I tried to explain that I’ve been having a hard time in my personal/school life lately. After this, I shut down and still haven’t called her (which is ensuring the severity of our next call).

Now, I know this looks pretty bad on her part. However, she is in an emotionally abusive relationship that has clouded her judgment for quite some time. She has been having a hard time as of late (I know this because of my aunt), asking me, my sister, and her sister for money, losing a lot of weight, etc. She has struggled with multiple addictions, so we are thinking this might be contributing.

I don’t want to simply ignore her, but I’m having issues establishing boundaries that get through to her. Severing ties is not an option, as I care about my family too much to do so. I am not going to lie, I am also worried that she will revoke my health insurance if I don’t speak to her soon.

They get mad at everything they don't understand or agree with, and treat me like a baby, to the point they'll force me to take a nap every single evening. I don't understand some of their reasoning to things like shooter games make me a violent person, or how studying for 3 hours one night is ""nothing,"" etc. you get it. And on top of that, my dad drives me fucking insane, I just hate him so much at times. He gets angry at everything, just shouting at me for no reason, thinking that's meant to help.

528,"Maybe its gonna be a long one, maybe not. The last year, i've been feeling quite lost, and I stopped being creative almost entirely.

I am a student at a music conservatory in Denmark, 26, studying music production. I was born in somewhere in the Balkans(privacy), life was not easy at all, family was below middle class, sometimes struggling about the most basic needs. But I went to school and also managed to get my way thru it well. Things got better later. I left that place when I was 18, to find a job in Denmark, and I also began studying. When I first started studying, I did a bachelors in something related to Media and Marketing, and part of me liked, part of me hated it.  I always enjoyed making music, or singing, or filming stupid shit, or playing games etc.

In the same time I also worked(for 4 years or so) in a restaurant, and then I decided to quit, and to get into the music conservatory. Thru out these years I was also an avid consumer of weed. I stopped for 4 years now. and alcohol for 2 years. 

To my surprise, I got in, and in the same time I managed to get something called SU(state school support or something like this), which is an amount of around 800euros a month you get when you are a student. It became very easy to just be at school, no need to work, also I live in a dorm where the rent is super cheap. 

But in the same time, I kind of become too comfortable, and I kind of lost myself on the way. My creativity has been down low, always questioning why the heck am I still doing this, not feeling enjoyment lately about anything than just going out for long walks and playing games. It seems like im trying to avoid any responsiblity or work on purpose, and I don't know why. I don't understand why I don't seem to enjoy making music anymore.

532,"So like the title says, my GF (22) and I (22m) decided to move out from our homes together, and find a place of our own.

I love her dearly and really want to move out, but I'm beginning to become scared of the money situation. 

She's still in college, and working part time.

I'm a whole different story. Due to a family... let's say tragedy, I was forced to move countries (to the one I'm at today, Poland) and go to college majoring in an English degree that I have ZERO interest in. I've since finished that degree but have no interest in pursuing a job in it. 

My passion is film making, and films in general. 

As of now I have money saved up for about three months rent + other expenses. I'm working in transport/spedition as a freight forwarder with my Dad because where I'm at it's a very good field to get into with little experience and he has been doing this for 30+ years, but I worry that once I move and without my Dad helping me, I won't do as well as I would like, in terms of making the same amount of money. 

This month has also been really shitty in terms of work, and I feel like I'm stalling and standing in place, so that's not helping much neither. 

I have never lived on my own before. However I know that life will be frugal for a while. Budgets will have to be strictly followed. That sort of thing.

534,"hi so like a few months ago i started to get close to this girl lets call her D and like one time after like our third conversation we sat together for lunch and then she suddenly started rubbing her hand on my thighs and then my inner thighs and i was very  uncomfortable so after that incident i decided to stay away from her. but then we got assigned as chair-mates at school so i had no choice but to talk to her. she was actually a pretty cool person and she stopped the whole thigh touching thing so i forgot about it and we became close friends because we do have similar interests in music, movies etc. 
but then like a week ago she started being really really touchy again like rubbing her hand on my thighs and once i had this soccer accident and my knee was bruised up pretty bad and then she was like “can i touch it?” and then i said yes and then when she touched it, i felt ticklish because the bruise was half dry already and then seeing that i felt ticklish, she started to rub her hand on my fucking bruise like what the fuck but then i was too scared to say stop so i just put her hand back. she has started to like put her hand on my thigh when we are sitting down or like massaging my shoulder suddenly (literally out of nowhere) and i feel very uncomfortable about this. i started to stay away from her again but then she just wont leave me the fuck alone. i told my friend about this and she says that D has a crush on me. i have heard some rumors about D being a lesbian but i didnt really believe them but it makes sense now i guess. i really dont think of her that way and i just see her as a good friend of mine. im just so confused because i dont want to lose this friendship. shes a really great friend and all but i just feel really uncomfortable around her when she becomes all touchy and stuff. idk if i have the courage to tell her i dont like it when she does it though. what should i doooo??",19Nov2019,1

Basically comes down to the desicion of whether to settle down or not.

So I met my GF on a night out. Both of us were people that didn't really enjoy clubbing at the time but were dragged out for seperate events, hers was rugby social and mine was a mates b'day party. Now I've never been good at the whole flirting game while out. I'd brought someone home before but I have no idea how I did it and it didn't go well because of how drunk I got. Anyway on this particular night I was also very drunk and thought I'd try my luck with the ladies once again  and asked my friends how to approach this. Their suggestion was to just go up to the girl and kiss them. They push you away, they don't like you. They kiss you back, you could be in there. Long story short, me and GF woke up next to eachother and didn't even know eachothers name or what we had done (obvs we could imply). I only learnt her name when I unlocked my phone to see her Facebook page open as I'd clearly added her. We spoke for a few days to figure out what happened which turned into a date. (This is just to illustrate that we didn't meet throu mutual interests or friend, we just kinda met)

The date went well and we get on great. Both were awkward and nervous. But here is where a couple of incompatibilities came. I'm a huge stoner, like ""smoke weed everyday"" kinda guy. She's asthmatic. I'm a meat eater, she's a vegiterian. These were thing we shrugged off as minor at the time as we both began to crush on eachother properly. These things became more of an issue for me later down the line as was restricted in where I wanted to go n what I wanted to do. We got together officially like a month later we started studying at library together, helped eachother through Uni. Looking back, I'd probably have failed if not for her getting me to join her in the library (I passed) and we pretty much began to live together in our student accomadation.

Fast forward to recent (3 years later). We have both finished University, got jobs and moved back in with parents. We live an hour and a half from eachother so we are restricted to weekends to see eachother which strains our relationship sometimes but we deal with it. Her parents don't know I smoke so I'm restricted when I go see her which we deal with. We have a good thing going and I love and adore the person she is. I've actually imagined marrying this girl, even thought of a plan on how to propose and everything. My job is a 9 month contract and we have plans to get a house together when I finish this contract and I'll look for work near where she works as she's tied in to her work for a while now.

The other day we were in the car having a long drive and got talking about sexual fantasies and we both have the clique one of a threesome each with the numbers favouring us (hers, me and another guy. Mine, her and another girl) but then both agreed that we couldn't live with the image of us having sex with someone else. Which lead to the realisation that we could only fulfil these fantasies while single or another willing partner. 

After this, I've started to think, this is the youngest I'm ever going to be. This is the most energy I'm ever going to have. The most free I'm ever going to feel. I've mentioned these revelations to her but she seemed unphased by it. I thinks she is picking up on these feelings which brings us to last night when while saying night on FaceTime, she asked me about the whole thing id said about been the youngest I'm ever going to be and asked if I still wanted to settle down and everything that comes with. I paused, then tried to avoid the question cause I couldn't think of my answer then said night and struggled to get to sleep. Pretty sure she did too. We have kept our Snapchat streak going this morning but haven't spoken.

I never imagined myself settling down so soon after my education finished I'd always wanted to live the care free bachelor role for a while. I feel like I need time to figure ME out and what I want out of the short time we have in life. But on the other hand I have a really lovely, beautiful, kind, kinky women who wants to settle down with me and it feels like my only chance. But then I don't want to move in to a house n have to tear it apart cause either one isn't happy.

So all that in mind, what do I say when it comes to the conversation later (currently at work), I'm really confused about this and don't know where else to turn. 

TLTR: basically deciding whether to move in with University GF but unsure due to few incompatibilities and feeling like I haven't lived my own life yet.",19Nov2019,1

I have worked so hard to see myself as independent, valuable and strong, and I’m ready to share myself with someone who will only add more to my life, not take anything away.

He responds to every text, seems appreciative that I’m just there, never pressures me for anything, and let’s me set the pace of our interactions.

He’s emotionally mature, doesn’t want mind games or bullshit, and I appreciate this very much (considering that’s all my ex consisted of).

543,"Threatened is a big word and I might be overexaggerating, but here's the story (I won't specify my age, grade, or any names for privacy reasons). So a couple of days ago, my friends and I we're talking shit about the guy mentioned in the title. We'll name him Felix. We called him a fuckboy and a player because prior to that conversation, he had broken up with his girlfriend of 2 months because apparently he was flirting with another girl at a party he was at all night long and posted a bunch of pictures of them cuddling and getting pretty close on his ig. So a couple of days later (today actually), one my friends (we'll name her Daisy) came up to me and said that Felix overheard us talking shit about him, and that ""if our stupid group kept talking shit about him it wouldn't end well"".  I didn't think much of it and laughed because I thought it was just an empty threat, but then Daisy tells me that Felix can spread a rumor about us and literally ruin our lives. I still didn't give a fuck honestly until she talked to one of his best friends and they genuinely said to be careful around Felix and to not talk shit about him. Later today at school, Daisy mentioned how everyone was looking at us with weird looks because apparently, Felix told a bunch of people that we we're not only talking shit about him, but about everyone else in the school. And of course everyone believed him because he's popular. And thats when I started to take shit seriously, it even came to the point where I was having an anxiety attack. My friends ended up apologizing to him because they felt bad that they made an assumption about his character when in reality, he's only ever dated 2 girls in his entire life. I was the only one to have not apologized but I wanted to because I made a shitty assumption about him and genuinely felt sorry. But during my lunch break, I tried calling him, he heard me, turned his head, then proceeded to completely ignore me. It definitely rubbed in the wrong way. My friends and I are actually kind off really fucking scared because keep in mind that Felix is a 6'2 guy and then theres me who's like 5'6 and weighs 113 pounds and my friend over here is a whole 4'10 and 83 pounds.

Its been a few months and i now have no social life other than texting a few people, I've tryed diffrent courses and sixth forms but they all say its too late. An apprenticeship just doesnt seem like the thing for me.

Ive got a job but they barely ever need me in so all my time is just spent led in my bed or playing my xbox and its fucking with my mental health I'm a lot more self conscious and depressed. I NEED SOMETHING TO DO. i know that trying to be grouped up with friends was a stupid idea now and i need to wait for next September to get into college again.

It sounds crazy but how do I slow down? I have this intense sense of urgency about everything. 

I rush a lot, especially with work. I feel I have to hurry and get things done. I rush through everything -- tasks, chores, driving, hanging out with my friends, even *me time* seem to be overly detailed. It's beginning to hurt my personal life. I'm not sure why I'm like this. Is this normal? Lol

How do I tame this sense of urgency? I want to enjoy life. What are some tips you have?

547,"So I previously posted an incomplete version of this Advice post and i sincerely apologize but here's the story. 

During my college years me (now 29M) and my girl, ill call her Lee, (32F), dated for roughly 2 years. We were very close and it was a very passionate, albeit turbulent relationship. Lee was struggling and dealing with a variety of anxiety issues and I bore the brunt of it.

After graduation I joined the Army and while we stayed together during the initial part of my Army career, during my deployment, however, she ended up caving due to anxiety and I received a ""Dear John"" letter. 

I attempted, upon returning home, to reunite with Lee but she told me she was seeing someone else. I ended things there and with a broken heart moved on. 5 years go by and we both go through several serious/non serious relationships with other people and both ended up in successful corporate positions. 

About 2 months ago, after suffering from my most recent LTR breakup, I connected with Lee on social media and after exchanging texts and messages and a few phone calls and decided to meet up for coffee. 

One thing led to another and after several nights of passion, I've been staying at her place for the past week with amazing chemistry. We both have dogs and they also get along great and have been staying together while we go to work. We've had several conversations about the past and while she still suffers from anxiety, she has been doing a lot better. 

During this past week, we've both re-met with our parents who we were both VERY close with and it almost seems like a flashback to when we were dating. My lease on my place is up next month and she even suggested moving in within the next few months. 

During my lulls in work, I'm torn in two: 

One part of me feels like this is right. I've dated a good amount of women for numerous lengths and no one since Lee has made me feel this way towards the future. A good part of me feels comfortable moving at this speed and wants to move in with her and on top of that both my parents and her parents have given us their blessing.

However, another part of my is nervous that I could be abandoned again by her. My deployment was stressful and she didnt support me during the most hectic time of my life and I still feel pain from that letter I received. I also did break up with a serious girlfriend 2 months ago. 

What should I do Reddit? Has anyone had a similar experience both good and bad? Is this a common occurrence? Any help I would truly appreciate

548,"We aren't sure yet because we haven't gotten a pregnancy test yet but she has a few signs of pregnancy including frequent urination, food craving, and cramps.

Now on to the big problem, her parents are very mentally abusive to the point where they're the reason she used to be suicidal. If she got pregnant that would be the breaking point and both her mom (who has only been verbally abusive in the past) and her stepfather (who has layed hands on her in the past) would start physically abusing her without a doubt.

I'm pro choice but my girlfriend is very pro life and we decided together that if she is pregnant, we would keep the baby and run away to Montana because I have rich extended family out there who would help us get on our feet.

I'd do anything for her, she literally saved my life. And I need to keep her safe from her family, another problem is that we are both broke and I haven't been able to get a job yet.

A run through of our plan is, on a weekend she's with her dad (used to be an abusive alcoholic but is now sober) she'd pack everything she wants to bring, then take a Lyft over to my house to pick me up, then we'd stay at my friend's house until we gather the funds to get to Montana, get a lyft to the airport in Minneapolis to the airport in Miles City.

But then again we don't know if she's pregnant or not

Study    for long or short doesn't matter, what matters most is how much you    know or retain of what you study. This needs concentration and    dedication. One should study smartly. Lot many techniques are available,    but we must understand how to practically apply those. To concentrate    we must avoid all possible distraction. Present century is plenty of    distraction right from smartphone, socializing sites, online games and    what not. We spend hours in smartphone. Initially find out what    distracts you most. Make a list. Allot a time for distracting factors,    like for socializing. Develop a stringent timetable. Follow rigorously.    Don't compromise on that. Concentrate on one task at a time. Stop  being   multitasking.

Follow  the   thumbrule 45+15 principle. Study for 45–50 minutes and take a break  of   10–15 minutes. This will increase your output. Revise everything    multiple times with a strategy. Dr Ebbinghaus propounded the forgetting    curve. Thats how our memory system works.

553,"My wife and I just moved in to a new house two weeks ago. Met all the neighbors except the folks behind us (they are on a private drive, behind a large fence, we are in a subdivision that backs up to their property)

5 days ago, their husky has been moved to a back porch which has been blocked off so that the dog basically has nowhere to go except the 10x10’ area he’s enclosed in. The patio area has a sliding door that goes into the house. They just aren’t letting the dog inside. We’ve gotten 3-6” of snow. It’s sub-30s temps. Last couple days however have been warmer.

The husky is howling. Like, sad, LOUD howling as soon as the sun comes up, for 10-20 second howls, all day long. Other neighbors in our subdivision have not heard this dog like this before. They assumed since we are new that it was our dog making the noise. (Nope.)

They could have the dog outside for a million reasons, maybe it’s destroying the house, maybe they have a new dog or new baby that it’s not getting along with, but the husky seems uncomfortable. My wife is getting extremely frustrated (she’s very pregnant and needs her sleep) and before I do anything, I figured why not ask reddit?? 

TL;DR Husky locked outside 5 days straight, loud constant howling, don’t want to get police involved or start a feud. Figured I’d ask you guys first!",19Nov2019,1

A few weeks ago we decided to play a video game without him and our friend cried in his room for four hours. When we talked to him we came to the point that his happiness depends solely on whether or not he is hanging out with my fiance. I told him that it may be beneficial to talk to someone and he agreed. He also said that he would branch out and try to make new friends. However, he has not done this.

565,"I meet some of my dearest friends in a very awkward way: she was the girl that my former boyfriend was cheating on me with. He was lying to her too, and they have been friends for many years (like a decade ou so), and she was outraged when she discovered what he was doing to both of us. We bounded and became real close, and I ended the thing that I had with the cheating bastard. I never spoke to him again.

My friend could never really totally cut him from her life. like I said, they know each other for many years, and she has (or at least she says so) terrible thoughts about him since all that drama, but since he is a loner who is pretty much without friends right now (dude is REALLY a terrible person and managed to burn ALL his bridges by being an asshole), she feels kinda sorry for him and they talk eventually. They are def not super close, but there still is some kind of lingering friendship.

I know she is not lying to me when she says that she knows he's awful but can't get away completely, especially because she already had romantic feeling for him as well. She is not a backstabbing person, to be honest she is a huge empath and one of the sweetest girls I ever met. She likes to help people, she is always there when someone needs her and so on.

But here is the thing: he was an abusive jerk to me (he was sexually abusive sometimes and he is basically a huge huge liar who fucked with my head) and she knows it. she knows everything he did. And she still talks to him. I know I can't control who she talks to, but knowing of the terrible things he made me go through and his awful behaviors in general... Why she keeps this friendship?

566,"So this is kind of long, it's also my first post. I'm on a bus so please forgive any spelling issues. 

So my first year of college I met her. (we will call her Ally). We were quick friends, spent almost every waking hour together. We partied, ate, spent the night, etc. We were rarely apart. She had a key to my place, came and went as she please, she even hung out there when I was out of town. She knew she could walk in and do whatever she please as that was how our friendship was. 

The summer after first year she and another one of our friends moved in with me while they were between leases. It was a lot of fun but they were way more into the party life than I was (let's face it I'm a bit of a hermit) so they went out a /lot/. She occasionally stepped over some boundaries I set (like giving said other roommate a hj in my kitchen...) So I tried to cut back the alcohol consumption in the house. Not that it worked but I tried. 

Into our second year, they moved into their own places and she got with the dude (our other friend) and turned into a bit of a sloppy alcoholic. She was never happy because he would never commit and was kinda a Playboy but she was adamant that he was the one. I supported her as best as I could. 

At the end of the second year we noticed my dad's health starting to slip and come the next February he was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer and passed that March. Ally stayed with me through it as much as she could. She knew every doctor date and everything. She was there for the funeral. Things were a little strained between us because I needed more alone time to grieve than she was comfortable with. 

As the months passed she started to act weird, she never wanted to go out to eat with our friend group, was always ""busy"" (but then I'd see her on snap at home playing videogames asking if anyone wanted to hang out ) I was a little hurt but I know everyone needs space sometimes. She kept dodging me and dodging me. 

We had a class together and since she didn't have a class before our class together she'd always go early and get us seats (the class was a couple kids over the seat count). Well one morning she sent out her daily snap saying she was hungover and not feeling the day. I got to class and she wasn't there so I assumed she wasn't coming (which wasn't uncommon, let's be honest). Literally half a minute before class started she walked into the class and saw I didn't save a seat for her, scoffed, and walked to a seat. As she passed me I tried to apologise bc I didn't think she was coming. She completely ignored me. Okay that's fine class is starting I guess I'd see her after class when we go to get lunch. Nope. She walked off before I could get to her after class. 

She's drinking even more now. She even got into trouble on our campus for showing up to class drunk... She tells me ""we need to talk "" and then walks off. I have really bad anxiety so that shot my nerves until she decided it was time. 

A couple weeks later, I know I'll be moving soon so I start to pack things around my apartment. My grandmother is helping me and thinks we should put all of Ally's stuff together so if she needs it we won't have to dig through all of my stuff to find her stuff. I'm fine with that it's smart since I have a lot of stuff and an ungodly amount of books. 

Me and two of our guy friends are going to meet another one of my friends for a late lunch (Ally has class and doesn't like the food we're eating anyways so I didn't invite her). Well my friend cancelled so me and the boys eat and go back to my apartment. I'd told Ally about how I have all her stuff if she'd want to get it before I moved or after since if it was after it'd be harder to find. Well the boys decided that today was the day we should have our talk. Summoned Ally. She came it, said nothing, ""sup?"" I call towards the door, *silence* *stuff jingles in box* *door closes*, me and the boys look at each other and they go outside while I'm cleaning the kitchen. 

(Side note, it's a week away from my father's death date so I'm kind of a basket case)

She comes in and is drunk. I never have time for her, I never invite her over, I'm always with the boys, I never go out drinking anymore, etc anything I try to say to defend myself she shuts down. I gave up arguing. She leaves. 

A few days later she texts me and basically says that I need to be a better friend or I can come and get my stuff because she's done. I'm too tired to fight. I'm depressed, tired, and I've been crying. I'm not fighting for her anymore. I send someone to get my stuff she had of mine and I cut all communication. 

Cut to this month. She's started drunk messaging and calling me trying to chat like nothing is wrong and we're chill. I'm more mentally stable now that I've been away from her and don't want to backslide. What should I do?",19Nov2019,1

570,"I don't know what's wrong with me. I guess it's depression when I can't find a good reason to get out of bed and live my life. I suppose it's why I sometimes want to just stop thinking, even if that would mean I would stop breathing. I would be lying if I said I never had thoughts of suicide. And there were a couple of times where I came a bit too close to doing something reckless because I just couldn't bear it anymore. People say they snap out of these things by thinking about how devastated their family would feel, but honestly my family is a part of the reason why I don't want to keep living. And honestly, who really cares about me at school. Everyone acts nice and friendly but they're all just so pretentious and superficial.

But I've managed this far by keeping myself busy doing stuff; school work especially. Everyone I know would agree that I am a nerd, deeply passionate in science, literature and math. Some people wonder how I have such an incredible work ethic but it's really all because I can't live if I don't do something productive with myself. Or else the self-hatred kicks in and I find myself wondering why I should even stay alive.

But now the holidays are coming and the thing is I can't imagine myself alive by the end of the holidays. I can't imagine myself surviving 5 weeks of doing nothing at home but lie in bed all day and waste time on the internet. I would also be quite distant from my friends since I won't be seeing them at school anymore. I only have friends from school.

My boyfriend (who is having his 18th birthday in three weeks) knows now about what she's done and he is horrified at everything she's done and everything she said and he told me he wants me out of that house as soon as possible. he told me that once I'm 18, I can just walk out and they're not allowed to do anything other than take me off their phone plan and my boyfriend talked to his parents and they said that if I need a place to go until I can get my own house/flat then I am more than welcome to move in with them while I work. Would it be such a bad thing if I took that chance and I just moved out this Christmas and I finished high school in his town? They said the only expense for living there would be that I would have to put part of my paycheck towards the bills, which I understand completely. That's only fair. I'm just worried about going to a new place, and what if my boyfriend and I don't last until my second semester ends? I believe that it's worth it to get away from my mother but I just want another opinion on this other than my boyfriend's.",19Nov2019,1

I'm pregnant. About 3 months, so I don't know what I'm having yet. My nephew's name was Shane. That can be a unisex name. I want to give my baby Shane as a middle name. However, I want to ask my sister for permission first. 

When is it appropriate to ask? I feel like it should be done in person, but she moved her family 4 hours away to be closer to the hospital for treatment. Ol be seeing her at his memorial service, but other than that, I don't know when. Would it be appropriate to ask then?

I picked up a girl at a bar about two months ago and it was all very physical and not at all serious. So this resulted in us sharing a lot about our past sexual encounters because it was mainly just sex at that point. One of these said encounters was a drunken threesome that she had on schoolies (spring break equivalent) with two guys and she even showed me a photo of the encounter. 

Fast forward two months and we're now dating as we realised we both caught the feels and really enjoy each others company. But for some reason (that my usually logical brain can't tie logic to) I keep thinking about the fact that she had a threesome with two dudes and the picture is seared in my brain. I get a sinking feeling in my chest when I think of it, and I dont know if it's just dumb human emotions that I can't control or if there's a way to progress past it?? 

Literally any advice or perspective on this matter would be great, I really like her and I don't judge her for it, I just don't like this feeling I get when I think of it.

I don't have anything to be really excited about. I don't hate it but I also don't love my major. I spend time with my friends cuz I like them and it's fun but it isn't really something that gets me excited. 

I get up in the morning because I have to not because I have anything to really get up for.

I think some people get up and are excited for the day because they like their job, or they can't wait to get home from work and practice the guitar, or because they have a tennis match that night they're excited about. Things like that

I realized that I don't really do anything, if I have schoolwork to do I do it, if I have class to go to I go, and if I want to I go out and hang with some friends. But in my free time I don't DO anything. I listen to music and browse the internet. 

I think that's why I get attached so easily and breakups hurt so bad. Because the relationship becomes my hobby, my hobby became waiting for that facetime or that text, or waiting till it's time for us to hangout that night. I know I need to fix this so that

Wrong. I have accepted a dream position with a fortune 300 company, however, I was honest about my situation and they said I will lose the offer if I’m not graduated by the 1/13/2020 training start (the class would end 1/22/2020 so it is literally a nine day difference they are refusing to work with).  Obviously I’m hoping this course will be accepted and I can just laugh about it and move on. 

However, should I have to take a class online to finish my program I don’t know what to do. Part of me wants to just lie to the recruiter and say that everything was good to go and I’m set to graduate as planned but I’m not sure if they’ll ask for verification.

592,"Sorry in advance this might be long. 
I used to be a happy kid. Carefree, had lots of friends, was great at hockey, and I was genuinely happy. At age 9, my parents split up, and I moved to the city. I went a week at my dads and a week at my moms. My dad changed a lot, seemed to not care about my brother and I, never did anything with us. My step-mom was verbally abusive, and she was there a month after the divorce. I hated her, she told me I was worthless, stupid, won't go anywhere in life, and that I should kill myself because no one would care. That was nailed into my head at age 9 through 13 by my step-mom and step-dad. Once I turned 13, I technically had the choice to say no to going to my dad's house, so I stopped going there. I didn't like either house, but my mom's was easier to live in because she still cared about me. Every weekend for 3 years, I was at my friends house. Friday right after school until 9pm Sunday. I did not want to be at home and see my step-dad. He nailed the ""you're worthless, kill yourself"" in my head even more from 13-16. My mom finally found out after not believing me for years, and he was kicked out. I'm 17 now. From age 9-16, I changed a lot. I started becoming isolated, I never wanted to see anyone, never wanted to leave my room, thought all I was was worthless, stupid, and I had no friends. At all. I got bullied at school, learned everything like tying my shoes and shaving way too late in my life. I had to ask my mom all my puberty questions growing up. That's embarassing and humiliating as a male. I've not changed, I am still isolated all the time, find it way too hard to go do things, and talk to people. I have 1 single friend. It's the friend I've had since grade 9, the one I went to every weekend. I'd say I'm above most 17 year olds in terms of IQ, I'm usually not cocky but this I'm sure of. I do well in school without trying, 80s-90s only, and I am very smart with most decisions I make.
Lately, I've been so, so depressed. 100 times more than usual. I've tried so many things to help that all fall through or don't work in the end. The past few weeks we had a lot of snow, and with seasonal depression, everything has been hitting me harder than ever. All I can think is that I really am way too shy, a pussy, unhealthy, almost underweight, a goodie two shoes, have no friends, no one to support me other then my mother, and no real talents. I dread waking up each morning and going to school, I try to get out of going almost every single day. I get anxious about every little thing, beat myself up mentally over every mistake I make, and I don't know what to do. Every day the weight on my shoulders feels 10 times heavier and all I can think is negative and sad thoughts. I don't know what to do. I've tried counselling, talking to family, my friend, coping strategies, and nothing seems to work... I need help and I don't know how to get the right help.",19Nov2019,1

- He stares at me sometimes. Other times he doesn't directly stare at me, but in my direction. I notice this quite often.

- He teases me sometimes. Example: I like to wear a lot of skater clothing (Shirts with sweatshirts underneath, Vans, that kind of stuff) but I don't skate and he called me poser, which we both laughed about (he does skate)

- He tries to be around me (sitting as close to me as possible in class, trying to stand or sit next me in the cafeteria etc.)

- He accidentally touches me (shoulder-to-shoulder, leg to leg) sometimes

611,"Wasn't expecting the post to be this long but here we go. Title pretty much says it all. So I am a college student that switched to an all online program this semester (after 4 years of ""traditional"" schooling), currently searching for a job, and whose friends all recently got into or are seeking relationships. I'll elaborate more. 

I went to a large college for my first 2 years. I met my best friends and current roommates through my freshman dorm. I realized that I didn't enjoy my major in chemical engineering and wanted to do nursing. Long story short if I wanted to get into a program within 2 years I was going to have to transfer schools, so I did. My new school was smaller than my high school and I had a hard time adjusting. At the same time I had to move back home because of my financial situation. As you can imagine being in a new school and moving back home within 4 days of each other can be very isolating. Eventually met some people at my nursing school and everything was going well. I got a scholarship and was making really good grades. However, I knew that it was not what I wanted to do by the end of my second year. I took the summer to just work, relax, and move back towards campus with roommates mentioned above. Fast forward to September. I had just finished my first week of my ""junior"" year (really 5th year) and I had a complete breakdown about what I wanted to do with my life. I still don't know, but what I knew was that I needed to switch majors before the 100% refund deadline passed. Spoke with my advisor, switched degrees, but now all my classes are online. 

So as the same time I'm switching majors my job is coming to an end as it's a seasonal position. I've decided that I'm old enough now I want more of a ""real job"" instead of doing customer service and retail like I have since  I was 16. Turns out getting a big girl job is harder than I expected. I'm still searching and applying but nothing has worked out yet. So money is a little tight right now. 

At the beginning of this year I got dumped. First guy I had ever dated and I took the breakup really hard. I've been on a few dates and had casual flings over the course of the year, but nothing has really come of it. I recently tried to actually get back in the dating game and that blew up in my face. The guy I like and I decided that due to life circumstances we need to put a pause on seeing each other, so if we do decide to give dating a second chance it won't be until mid to late December. I don't really want to date in the meantime and I'm over hooking up or casual flings. I want something more meaningful but I am an emotional person and I've been through just about as much as I can take. So I'm taking a break basically. (Any advice on how to not take dating so personally is also accepted!!) However, all of my friends have found themselves in relationships. My best friend, who I used to spend around 3-4 days with a week, recently had a man confess his love and now spends every night with him and brings him to every hangout, dinner, party, night in, etc. She knows it bothers not just me, but her roommate and our other friends, but doesn't seem to care. Do I sound bitter or lonely to you? Lol, anyway. My other best friend spends a lot of time with a coworker she likes and everyone else in my friend group also has a significant other. I currently only have 1 single friend so we spend a good amount of time together, but we can't be together every waking moment. Everyone just seems to be busy and prioritize their SOs which I understand, but for the first time in awhile I am feeling extremely lonely and a bit left out. Due to these and other reasons the dynamic has changed with most of my friends. It can be hard to open up because they're all doing well and I don't want them to worry about me or pity me. That's also hard though because then I feel like I have no one to turn to. 

School, work, and life just has me feeling isolated and I can feel my depression quickly coming back, especially as winter and the holidays approach. I don't have much going on to get me out of my apartment. I used to go to the gym a lot, so I've been trying to get back into those old habits. It hasn't been easy but I am consistently going 4 times a week. I don't know if anyone out there has been in a similar situation but if you have what have you done to motivate yourself? There are days when I find it hard to do anything except lay in bed. What are things that people have done to get themselves out of the house? Maybe clubs you found enjoyable? I sometimes find it hard to get back into my old interests like painting and reading. I used to be passionate but I just can't bring myself to take the time. Literally any advice is appreciated. Are there websites or resources I can use? I've lived in the same city my whole life so I don't know how a person typically goes about meeting new friends or finding things to do. Sorry this was so long winded but it feels like my life has done a 180 since fall semester started and I need ways to cope. 

&amp;#x200B;

My bf of six years wants to get back together. We just took a two month, noncommittal break. I didn't want it to be non-committal but I agreed to it, because I could tell he really wanted it. I found out a coworker made out with him during our time a part. I didn't do anything. Went on Hinge for a few days, but innocent convos - then deleted the app. Should I get back together with him?

I know he didn't cheat, and I appreciate his honesty. He's a great guy, I really love him but I feel heartbroken. I guess because we had some problems in college.

Maybe I'm a prude, but I feel so sad. I'm not sure I can get over it. Idk I feel like during our time a part I made sure not to put myself in any sticky situation - because I love him that much. I don't feel like he reciprocated that.

He keeps saying ""it was only three seconds"" ""I didn't initiate it"" ""I didn't seek this out.""

But let's be honest - no woman, kisses a man if she doesn't feel like she CAN. He must've given her some inkling during our time a part - that we would at least be willing to engage.

And I guess I also feel so sad, because half way through the non-committal break he told me ""I haven't even kissed a girl"" ""I haven't done anything.""

I'll try to make this as brief as I can, but in order to get the most effective advice I feel I must tell a bit of a story on our life.

My wife is a recent BBA graduate in a family that didn't even get their high school diplomas. We come from a poor town and poor families. She worked her ass off and got a good job and is already a manager of a car agency 10 months out of school. She work 50-60 hours every single week while I finish MY schooling (finishing in December) and take care of our two little ones (2 and 4). She (and me to a lesser degree) NEVER buys anything for herself. She just goes and goes without looking back. She takes pride in everything she does and tries to do it right. She's a wonderful mom and wife that just wants awesome things for our kids and family.

A couple of other things to consider: We can't really go out, as a babysitter is a pretty significant cost. We don't have any family that really would be willing to watch our kids, and even if they did agree they live an hour away in the middle of nowhere. She likes cute movies (not really chick flicks, but ANYTHING magical. Harry Potter fan etc) Any advice on anything I can gift to her, or an experience idea would be awesome.

I'm wondering if I am the only person on Earth who lives that way.

I'm 25 years old guy. I've never had a girlfriend or any female friends. Mostly because of shyness and because I was waiting for women to take the first step.

I've never had my driver's license. 
I've a job to pay my bills.

All I do in life is to watch TV shows.

I've no goals, no plan, no dreams.
It's nature that is in control of my life.

Even when I was in school, I never study. I did exams by chance. 
I just did it.

That's why I was always an average to below average student. I always pass with the minimum grade required.

I'm living from day to day, by just surviving and letting fate decide what will happen today.

My life sucks. I didn't understand my issue since few days.

All I do in life is watching TV shows, soccer, porn and go to my job to pay bills.

I don't even go to college since 4 semesters. 

I went to see 3 psychologist, but they couldn't understand what was wrong with me.
Reddit helped me much more better than those people that I paid a lot.

I let fate, nature, chance, control my life.
I wait for things to happen. I pray God to make things happen.
I don't know what's wrong with me.",19Nov2019,1

I switched classes to a different time with a similar subject and the textbook for that class was the same. Cool, I don’t have to buy another. What I didn’t realize is that there was an online portion attached to each book and I couldn’t access the course of my new class. Because I didn’t get any notifications and my teacher never talked about it, I didn’t even know that stuff existed. That’s my fault, I’ll take that on me, it was a stupid and avoidable mistake but I am a freshman in my first semester of college so I wasn’t too hard on myself at first. I was able to safely drop the class and preserve my GPA. 

Now, I forgot about my scholarship. I think I need 15 credit hours to keep it. Dropping the class at this point in the semester, I have 14 credit hours. I have potentially just lost a huge chunk of money. 

My mom is rightfully pissed. She was helping me along the way and telling me what to do and to talk to my advisor about dropping the class, but now I may have costed us a bunch of money. My dad had expressed uncertainty that I would be able to handle college before I even came here and now I’m proving him right. 

I’m going home next week and I am so ashamed and embarrassed. How could I possibly face my family after costing them a huuuuuuge chunk of money??? What can I do to show them I just made a mistake and that I can handle things?? I will definitely try to pay them back but I don’t think that will buy back their image of me.

625,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, and the title pretty much summarized what happened. I don’t live with my parents, but I was in town visiting them as my dad’s dad passed away a few weeks ago. My grandfather was not a nice man...he was an alcoholic for 50+ years and suffered from Alzheimer’s for the past 10. His death was not a surprise, but my dad is understandably upset about it. 

My dad is nice 95% of the time, but when he becomes angry, he is prone to yell and say nasty things. Over the years, I’ve learned to deal with this and refrain from saying things that would escalate his anger. Last night, we were discussing politics and he became angry that I didn’t agree with him. All of a sudden, he turned the argument from politics to saying “You are disrespectful for speaking to me in the way you do. You know what I’ve done for the past six weeks? Work and take care of my dying father who is now dead!” I simply say “I’m sorry that your dad died, and I’m sorry I was unable to come see him (I was out of the country for work and only returned a few days ago).” I truly don’t remember what was said after that, but I was sitting on our couch, and he jumped up from the chair he was sitting in and stood over me yelling and in a position as if he was ready to fight. Instinctively, I stood up and said “what are you doing?!” He pushed me hard, and before I know it, he punched (not full force, but hard enough to hurt) me in the jaw. My mom was between us yelling to stop, and he went outside for a walk.

When he came back inside after 20 minutes or so, it took him a long time to come around and realize what he did. He said he doesn’t even remember pushing or hitting me, and I believe him. He has profusely apologized and has already set up an appointment with a family therapist. My mother is completely in agreement that what he did was wrong.

I don’t know what to do. I’m so angry and disappointed, but on the other hand...he’s my dad. I know he loves me, but I’m still in shock that he actually hit me. No, I’m not going to call the police or press charges, and I don’t feel in danger. I asked my mom if he ever hit her and she said no. I told her that I would support her leaving the 30+ years marriage if she wanted to leave. She doesn’t want to leave, and I respect that. I don’t know where to go from here.

I've been dating a guy for a few weeks now, and it has been quite nice so far.

630,"Hey guys.

I'm 26 y/o and live in Austria. I'm currently still in my bachelor's programme for English and History. In in my tenth semester, which stresses me the FUCK out. Nearly all my friends are conventionally more successful than me - and younger. I feel like my time is running out, too, to succeed in our toxic, materialistic society. I don't look too become a teacher, by the way.

A big problem of mine is that I'm way too hung up on my past decision, I just can't let go because it feels like whatever decision I make is the wrong one in the long run. This and other things have led me to have crippling anxiety about the future, little to no self confidence and self love and so on, as well as depression and hints of borderline disorder. I'm also extremely envious of people who are/seem to be conventionally more successful in life than I am. I am on the lookout for a new therapist, before you ask.

The main thing I know about myself is that I don't know what to do with my life. I just know that i DON'T want to end up as a corporate slave. My dad is a manager for the federal post office and it destroyed him.

I just want to enjoy life, make some solid income and spend time doing what I live most. When I say solid, I don't mean rich. Food on my table, a couple of troops or small vacations every now and then and a comfy apartment.

But I feel like I'm lost. My dad keeps telling me to finish my studies with a master's degree, but I'm sick of university and studying; I just wanna come home in the evening, drop down with a beer and do stuff with my girlfriend. My best friends tell me to do what I love, but what I would like to do would NEVER pay the bills. But I also don't want to just enter any ol' office job cause I didn't spend my years at university for nothing. The only thing I learned at uni is that I don't know myself. I realized that I'd maybe try to have a sidegig as an heraldic artist (you know, those guys who paint family coats of arms, often mislabeled as crests). I can also imagine myself as a translator. Or as a librarian. Or in an archive. Or a tour guide etc. Etc. I'm just spoiled for choice but I never fit fully and where I might fit fully, there's no jobs or just no demand (especially true for the heraldry thingy as Austria forbids them from actually being carried...). I mainly just want to make my folks proud because they believe in me; someone has to, right?

I'd really appreciate some help finding a direction I'd like.

What I do like... I'm heavily into video games and drawing / coming up with designs for things; I'm only really good when it comes to heraldry, though. I like fantasy and used to like reading books a lot - I'm rebuilding that habit though, one page at a time. Usually, I'm a very supportive and emphatic person, I also tend to have a lot more patience with others than with myself. I'm pretty good with English and maybe other languages, too. Also, I like writing when I finally can get my ass up and actually do it. Cooking is also one of my hobbies.",19Nov2019,1

we don't talk much, I keep to myself in general but I'm attracted to her and am not sure if she is as well.. 

over the summer I found her on facebook and began messaging her... 
we had good conversations early on, and she enjoyed the conversations, we even met up on break at work to talk...

long story short, I kinda came on too strong with sharing a lot about my life and trials etc until one day she politely asked to stop messaging her, and then she blocked me.

that was about 6 weeks ago and I've been super respectful at work, never show any frustration or confrontation.. 
it's been normal and recently something unexpected happened:

this could be nothing, but I recently bought this new pink hoodie and wore it to work, and then the next time we worked together, a few days later, this happened....

the literal second I walked into work, on the other end of the store at least 100 feet away from where she is, she instantly noticed and looked over at me.. and sure enough, she was wearing a pink hoodie very similar to the one I wore a few days ago..
The thing is, I have never seen her wear this hoodie in the year I've been working here.. coincidence?

I mean to notice me within like literally two seconds of walking in a busy store from about 100 feet away, wearing this hoodie.. it's like she was hoping/expecting to see me walk through that door..

and then one other time at work a few days later, i was helping a customer and glanced over and saw her smiling while looking at me from afar.. then she looked away as she saw me noticing her... it seemed like she was admiring me.

I have BPD and depression. I finally found a wonderful psychologist who is working through some issues with me. She is helping me identify feelings within myself and how to cope with them.

At the end of our session, I asked her our of curiousity, ""Have you ever had a patient who broke your heart?""

I'm not sure if I had some motive that I don't know of but I thought it was curiosity in who she was and what it was like on her end. She seemed very taken aback and uncomfortable. She kind of abruptly ended the call (It was about time to end it anyway) and I'm scared that she will not want to continue because I made her feel uncomfortable. Maybe I should have waited, but I sent her an e-mail right after the session. I usually do it to reflect on our session. Here's what I wrote.

As always, thank you for your time today. I'm sorry to always take much of your time, as you are very busy setting up your new life in \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*! 

I'm sorry if my question made you feel uncomfortable at the end of our session. After our conversations I often try to go over my thoughts and process them (often because I have a hard time retaining information.) Please allow me to explain myself a bit.

I just thought that you were very personable and compassionate and I thought that it might be hard for you to hear some things from patients who have experienced traumatic events, It was a logical part of me that began to wonder if even professionals like yourself feel heartbroken when they witness the experiences that some people have gone through. It was inappropriate for me to ask especially considering that we had no time left. 

I will try hard to identify the source of my panic, as well as look into things that may help my sleep hygiene.

638,"Basically, my (21F) best friend (20F) has put on about 80 pounds in the past 2 years. She’s very aware of it and self-conscious about it and I can see that it affects many aspects of her day to day life and her self image. Her body and her ‘fat’ is something she talks about all.the.time. 

She used to be extremely athletic and was very competitively involved in a high intensity sport up until about 3 years ago. She was super slim girl.

The thing is, it seems like she’s in major denial about her weight gain. She constantly buys clothing that is way too small/tight (to the point where countless seams and zippers have busted apart), edits her photos to the point where she is unrecognizable (I have had friends gently comment to me about how skinny she looks on Instagram)... 
and the thing is, I think it’s because she still sees herself as a skinny girl and she can’t accept the fact that she’s overweight now and it’s due to her own accord.

She is an extremely pretty girl by the way. Even just a year ago (when she was a lot smaller) she used to get so much attention from guys when we would go out and whatnot, and now not at all. 
I’m a very supportive friend and I always compliment her, hype up her confidence etc. When she says something negative about herself or about her body I always contradict it and reassure her that it’s not true. However, lately I’ve stopped reacting to her comments about her weight because it’s starting to piss me off a little bit. I don’t agree nor disagree, I either laugh it off or say something stupid like “same” (which is very very apparent to not be the case btw). 
I just want to help her get back on track and become more aware and responsible about the path she’s been taking herself down. 
She seems in denial about it and seems to think that this is something that is happening TO her rather than something she is doing to herself and not realizing the reality of changes needing to be made on her part. 

She’s also a very easily offended/defensive person so I don’t really know how to go about helping her. For example - I subtly tried to encourage healthier eating by joking about how picky she is for never eating veggies. She got super defensive and said she eats vegetables alllllll the time (NOT true - we’re roommates and I see exactly what she eats). 
Once I said that I feel like I gained 10 pounds in the past week because we’ve been eating fast food all the time - she freaked out and said that she has not been eating fast food (she had been - every time I get it I’m with her).
I’ve tried asking her if she wants to come to the gym with me and her excuse is that she prefers her parents’ private home gym down the road (I also seriously doubt that she actually goes). 

Anyways. I just need some advice here. I am a good friend and I want what is best for my friends always. I know that her life will dramatically improve with some changes but I don’t know how to help her see that. I don’t want to be too blunt because I don’t want to risk creating resentment but I’m done playing into her denial. And quite frankly it’s getting exhausting listening to her complain all the time and having to bite my tongue in fear of hurting her feelings",19Nov2019,1

I’ve even played him on Fifa online before because at times he can be normal and I can talk to him. But other times he is so moody and proper starts on everybody. Like yesterday in front of like 5 people he started on me saying I don’t do anything and neither does my dad. I don’t bite and just agree with him, knowing that annoys him even more than an argument. Plus he is the main one who doesn’t do anything anyway. Then he started on my dad today for no reason at all. I hate when people start on my family. He also thinks he’s gods gift. He’s got more kids than teeth is the running joke and he looks like he’s just crawled out of a dumpster. 

Then he treats this woman so weirdly, like nipping her bum and stuff. To be fair she goes along with it sometimes so it’s not just him to blame. But at times you can tell she’s had enough. Anywhere else he would be sacked. But the biggest problem with him is he gets everybody who works with him sacked. They keep getting people from the agency to work with him. Then he moans and moans about them until the main manager sacks them. Even though the problem is actually him. Everybody knows it’s him I don’t get why the main manager doesn’t sack him, he likes him for some reason. Then he doesn’t show these agency people what to do properly so no surprise they struggle on what is a really easy job. 

He also keeps shouting your a pussy towards me, and just acting so immature and he’s 32. I’m at work I can’t be bothered with immature things, I just laugh it off. He acts like a baby if he doesn't get his way, he needs to man up. He gets really aggressive with people sometimes. I feel like really showing him up because I could. I mean I’m 6 foot 2 and pretty muscular and he’s a coward and soft. It’s just gone over the top now. This guy who works with him now he’s completely harmless and wouldn’t hurt a fly. I can see it coming he’s starting on him now and it’s not fair. Yet the main boss will sack him once he tells him to. He made all 3 past people cry as well. Then if they complain about him they get sacked.

By the way I actually worked with him before my promotion. I just bit my lip knowing I was getting a promotion. I did stick up for myself though. Two times he just walked away from me because I confronted him. But sacking people and making them cry then starting on my 60 year old dad for no reason. He’s a bully and I’m sick of it. The other managers hate him and know it’s him. Yet the main manager won’t touch him it’s like he holds something other him.

Anyway, at this party he acted strange when he was around her. Like he’d try to initiate contact with her and there were times she would brush him off but he wouldn’t get the hint. He never did anything that bad, but it gave me weird vibes. I’m confident he wouldn’t take advantage of someone though, and he had been drinking.

There was another party recently, and while I wasn’t around him much during it I heard things. Apparently he had been talking up this girl for a while who had a girlfriend, and was getting very close and not taking hints that she wasn’t interested. At one point apparently my other friend had to go over to the girl to get her away from him. I can’t remember if it was my friend or another who told their side of the story, saying they were just talking.

Regardless, it makes me uncomfortable to know my friend acts like this when he’s drinking or at parties. I don’t know if I should bring something up though. I don’t completely know his side of the story and I feel like he might get defensive or claim I’m being too uptight. I think what he’s doing is wrong though

TL;DR: Found out my best friend has been acting kind of creepy at parties and I don’t know what to do",19Nov2019,1
647,"So I (M20) have been working my current job since May and I've been invited on the HR Christmas party/drinks but their doing secret Santa. Because most of the people in our HR team are regional this means they don't come up to Head Office alot so my interactions with them are pretty limited. Unfortunately for me the person I got to be Santa for I've never met in person and I've spoken to her twice on the phone.

The budget is £10 (roughly $15) so if you've got any gift ideas that would work for a woman who's about 23 and that would still be appropriate for an office setting I'll be very grateful.

Every so often in the past few weeks, I have a specific type of dream where I’m with my family and something happens and I’m trying to help them and it turns... sexual. 
Last week, I dreamed my brother was threatening me to have sex with him or else he would release incriminating footage of me. I went to my mom for help and she told me to get over it. I screamed and sobbed in my room for the rest of the nightmare till I woke up and couldn’t look anyone in the eye for the rest of the day. 
Last night, I dreamed that I was on vacation with my mom and my dad when I was MUCH younger and while it never actually played out in my dream, it was heavily implied that we all had sex. Eventually, my brother joined in too. I woke up sweaty, shaking, and in tears, and I feel so ashamed and disgusted. 
I’ve NEVER had any sort of trauma, especially not the sexual kind, and I love my family to pieces but god not like that. I don’t know where these dreams are coming from but they’re ruining my life. I wake up feeling sick to my stomach and for days afterwards. I’m nervous, scared, and can’t look anyone in the eye because I’m terrified they’ll be able to tell that I’m having these kinds of dreams and immediately be disgusted and run away. 
I don’t want these nightmares, I don’t want anything to do with them, but this is the fourth time this kind of dream has happened and I don’t know how to stop them. I’m just so tired of it- it’s driving me crazy. 
Please- I’m not perverted or reliving past traumas or anything. I just want it to stop. ANY advice on how to make these awful nightmares stop would be so appreciated. 
I don’t know where to turn to that won’t judge me and call me a freak or result in me getting private messages about it all.

So I've had anxiety most of my life even as a kid because of something that happened to me when I was younger that made it very hard to trust and be around other people. 

So anyways onto the story

On a Tuesday I go to a connect group youth (jesus  stuff) I was telling my leader let's call her amelia about how I had to get Jeremy (my bf) to order my food because I couldn't and she told me that ""your anxiety isnt real"" , she said "" your anxiety isnt real your controlling it""  I asked how and she said "" you're controlling whether you feel anxious or not so it's your fault  you have anxiety, just do it 5 times and it'll be gone"" everyone else just sat there didn't agree or disagree so I just kinda sat there

So is it really my fault I have anxiety / or was my youth leader just being a bitch?",19Nov2019,1

Then his mother was like “oh maybe he’s gay!.” Excuse me? Wtf. I’m not gay just because I choose to limit myself from female attention. It’s less dramatic and I have an excuse to be away.

654,"My friend and I have been having a lot of issues lately and it’s putting a strain on things.

She says she’s tired of me attacking her personality when I bring up comments she says that are hurtful to me. She feels like I’m being unreasonable and I feel like I deserve tact and respect. On her end, she thinks I don’t value her as a friend and that I’m dismissive and condescending at times when I’m trying to get a point across. 

I admit I have been dismissive toward everyone in my life right now because of my personal struggles and I can’t be as present as I used to be. I’ve communicated this to her but I don’t think she’s being clear about what she wants out of our friendship. 

When I confront her about the comments she makes she says I’m not “sharing my feelings” but I’m being defamatory and that I’m not acting like a friend because of this. 

For example (this happened with one other person present):

“Wow, you came back to Massachusetts so modest!”

Since I didn’t want to make a scene, I asked her about it the next day: “Why would you say that?” “Are you implying that I was thot before?”

Her argument is I was dressed extremely modest and she was curious about it. But I was embarrassed and offended because her boyfriend that I don’t know at all was there. It felt like a sneak diss, but she said it wasn’t.

Now I’m the bad guy because she thinks I’m attacking her personality and says I don’t know her or support her at all. I admit that the delivery wasn’t the best but I was emotional and upset. I want to be her friend but I feel like if I can’t bring up these comments freely than what? 

She’s going through many changes in her life and she feels like she can’t rely on me for support, but I live in a different state and I’m married with my own life and a full plate of problems, that I have communicated. 

And it’s not exactly clear what kind of support she’s looking for and why she feels undervalued which makes it difficult.

Instead of people being more attentive, the students turned on me. Siding with the bullies. Even telling them that i went to administrators. These two girls even ignored me and said they ""felt bad"" later.  These kids would go as far as recording me walking down hallways, into bathrooms, while im working. Kids from my bus telling people where i live. and since im not doing anything. They wont stop.

656,"Hi,
My boyfriend has had a rocky relationship with his parents for a while. It's not my place to say but from what I've heard, it was emotionally and physically abusive with some sexual trauma. I have given him support and have been someone he talks to about these issues, and have recommended him therapy. 


Recently, his parents threatened to cut off all contact with him after he replied to their text of ""get better soon"" late (due to being in class). They then proceeded to text him at midnight when he was asleep, and after he didn't reply for a few minutes, told him he was no longer welcome in their lives if he wasn't going to respond. 


We both know his parents aren't the best people. He's hurt (like anyone would be) by their actions and I'm at a loss on how to help. I have offered to give him time, support, and to be a person to vent to as long as he needs to. What else can I do to help him 1. Get through this without going back into depression and 2. Make him feel loved, valued, and wanted?",19Nov2019,1

658,"This is my first post on Reddit so be good.

So I have a friend who is almost 30 who lives with her mom and she has really bad habits regarding her cats. I thought it would be best to share this with all you cat experts out there.I want to help her out as much as I can for her place to be comfortable to even visit. Her mom works all the time and she's too busy to clean up but her daughter, on the other hand, has time to do these things.

Here are the details:

The area is a carpeted, studio apartment that they have been living in for about 4 years now.

She has three cats (two of them are about 19 years old and one is 2 years old)

She often shares her meals with them such as eating cereal or soup and having them lick her silverware while she's still eating, lets them lick her sandwich while it's still in her hand and it goes right back in her mouth.

She feeds them things that they aren't supposed to eat (ice cream, hot cheetos, whipped cream and even tries to give them coffee.

There's cat hair on everywhere you could imagine - on her bed, the toothbrushes, on the floor, on her clothes, the silverware, in the kitchen (including the inside of the oven). She kisses her cats on the mouth for like 10 seconds straight.

She allows her cats to go on top of the toilet seat, in the bathroom sink drinking the water from it, and for them to defecate in the bathtub as well.

And yes, she thinks all of this behavior is normal.

When her cats throw up, urinate or defecate, she cleans it up and only pats it with a wet paper towel and uses Febreeze to solve the problem. As a result, there has been much odor and bacteria buildup. One time she told me she tried cleaning up her room but contracted pinkeye.

I have had many plans to stay with her for a week, but it's hard to stay for even a day and I end up packing all of my things and going home the same day that I arrive. That's how bad it is.

The smell is unbearable and the place is so contaminated that I have to take breaks to go outside and breathe.

So with all of the information given, I am planning to go there to clean her whole place as a nice favor. What I have in mind is generally cleaning up (wiping surfaces with cleaning product, removing cat hair, and other basics). The main challenge is the carpet. I'm planning to first vacuum the carpet, and finish it off with a deep carpet remover that involves a mixture of hot water and detergent. Due to the circumstances, however, I'm not sure if all of this work is worth doing since there has been over 4 years of buildup from cat excretions.

She also has a foldable mattress that is just as bad. Does anyone know any method or products that would make this project successful or would removing the carpet be more beneficial? Also is this more of a mental or behavioral problem or just someone being lazy?

Some ideas are: getting her a new mattress, buying new silverware, and new sheets.

Her mother is going on a business trip and I wanted to surprise her when she got back with a decent and comfortable home that's super clean, bacteria and disease free, and little to no odor.

A friend of mine who recently won a stack of money from a lawsuit is proposing that we go to a trip in January. It would be my dream trip essentially, staying for two weeks in a ryokan in Japan, sipping sake and soaking in hot springs. My dilemma is that I've been mostly unemployed for the past couple of months and in the midst of a job search. I'm looking for a full time position that can keep me afloat while I'm teaching myself web development. My dream is to learn programming and graphic design, and find a position with flexibility so I can travel/work remotely.

I'm not sure what to do? If I get offered any of these jobs, it seems unreasonable to push my start date until February. Should I just go whole hog into teaching myself until my trip, and maybe worry about finding a full time position when I'm back? I have some savings but not much.

I said yeah and agreed a price with him, I checked and it looked all good. Got home and there's a massive crack in the bottom corner (the one I didn't check), rang the guy and he sounded genuine saying he would replace it tomorrow. 

I feel sick, I used money I shouldn't have to buy it and feel like I've let my young family down. I'm praying this guy is genuine and will replace it but I severely doubt it. Looking back there are plenty of red flags and all signs point to it being a scam. 

As I said I got a phone number from him but I assume if he's running a scam he just uses cheap sims and replaces them every few days or something.

I attend a private school, one with about 30 people. So I know everyone by name, and I see them every day. Theres this one girl, though. Let's call her Julie, who gets on my nerves and makes me wildly uncomfortable. 

Julie is a year younger than I am, but about 6 years less mature. She is super annoying, is singing all of the time and is really rude and disrespectful because she thinks it's funny. More of her behaviors include, forcing relationships on people (She told me we were dating even after I told her we were not.), calling people gay (Not as an insult, like trying to convince other people that these two boys are gay), forcing physical contact (Hugs, hand holding), and guilt tripping you into doing what she wants. She is overall manipulative and a pain to be around. There are many more things I could say, many more actions of hers. however, that is not the point. 

I've told staff about her, she is one of their daughters though, so I haven't spoken to her mom about it. However, the adult I did speak to said that she was a very manipulative person and that she did talk to her, but she doesn't stop.

666,"There are two guys at work, both about 50 years old, who I think keep flirting with me. I feel like I make it obvious I don't want to talk to them, but alas. One is the president of the company's son, who has some form of retardation (I'm 100% serious, not mocking) and doesn't understand social boundaries. He doesn't leave even if I tell him I'm busy, stares at me for several minutes straight, has (I think accidentally) shown me pornographic images he has of women being tortured sexually, and talks often about how he finds young woman hot. The other guy tells me daily he should call me so he can take me out, and today got irritated when I said I wouldn't date an older man &amp; kept pressuring me to answer if I would date him if he was younger. They both compliment my appearance a lot &amp; keep bringing up my recent breakup.

I have a history of being physically/emotionally abused, so when a man gets aggressive with me in any way I get anxious that something bad will happen. I know this is affecting my judgment. But I also know all men aren't like that man, and this may all just be harmless flirting/attraction from them. I'm not accusing them of anything. I also realize the one guy clearly has a mental disability and may appear more unsettling than he really is.

667,"hey!

so i may seem like an asshole, but I'm just not happy with my job. its a kosher bakery (I'm not jewish but were all cool) and i make minimum wage. I am 22 and in university. My friend landed me the job and it was fun at first, but there is a noticeable hierarchy for jewish (modern orthodox) workers than non jewish workers and it has been kind of getting to me and heres why:

\- our tips are used for jewish functions (customers think they go to the workers lol)

\- my manager blames me for mistakes they make

\- a lot of random people (bosses or coworkers friends) will come behind counter and they'll do a show and tell/make your own pastries when I'm working. so ill be alone battling little counter space with random people making instagram stories

\- my manager doesn't make eye contact with me when talking to me

\- jewish employees can come to the bakery and be on the clock just to make pastries for my manager's family/own families (even if were busy so ill be the only one working). then not clean up, manager will tell me to clean after them 

\- 4-6 people just quit so my managers giving me ungodly hours. (its nice to make money, but i haven't been properly trained so when i work alone its a lot of guessing on my end..which is kinda bad). plus i have 6 classes as a senior so its hard working till 12 am and go to class at 8 am some days.

\- manager micro-manages me

\- manager makes schedule sundays. so i know what I'm working a day in advance.

\- manager and other coworkers partake in Shabbat (no working fri-sat essentially) so cant contact her friday/saturday...noone else we can talk to about work, besides amongst ourselves

 I've only been there for a couple months and i just am genuinely unhappy. i work thursday, friday, sat, and sunday of this week and want sunday to be my last shift.

how would i go about quitting? is it best to call or drop off a letter to the store? i would feel awkward calling and i hate letting people down, but i would like to spend thanksgiving with my parents rather than alone at the bakery.

668,"I've read ""Faust"" recently and I can't stop thinking about it. I've stopped reading the book after a few pages because it was overwhelming. Goethe put so much knowledge in there and I only realised it a few pages in. The book gave me different kinds of feelings:

\- I felt completely ridiculed by Goethe once it became clear how smart he is. And that was a big shock, because I'm not a poetry guy. I always thought they are just idiots that are good with words, but this book contains knowledge that was only given a name a century later. It hurts me to say it but I feel like Goethes genius even overshadows people like Freud and Einstein. It completely turned my worldview around.

\- I then felt amazed at how smart one human being can become.

\- I also felt really close to Faust, in the first part of the story. It might sound weird, but I understand this fictional character desire extremely well and one verse resonated so much with me that, and I'm ashamed to admit it, I had to cry because of it, for hours.

It's been a little bit of time, but I'm scared to pick up the book again and I also feel completely confused. I tried talking to people about it, but they don't understand me and I don't want them to think I'm crazy. I tried talking about it with my professor because I thought he would get it, but I had to leave the conversation because I would have started to cry otherwise.

Am I crazy? I feel like I'm being a complete nutjob, but everytime I think about this book I have to cry. It resonates so well with my deepest feelings, that I wasn't even that aware of until now.

Financially the condo is a much bigger stretch, but it seems totally manageable and fits all the housing guidelines (i.e. 30% of take home pay to mortgage/tax/HOA/insurance). We're also hoping to have a kid next year. 

So what's my issue? Every time I think about signing an offer letter, I feel literally sick. I also feel a lesser version of that when I think about moving at all, even to another rental.

675,"My ex was extremely abusive and in general a very bad person. I know he deserves a lot of bad things but I can't bring myself to hate him or wish anything bad onto him. As a result, when he left a voicemail for me saying that he was going to kill himself, I totally panicked and I'm still quite upset from it.

I'm not going to make any effort to stop him, I know he's doing this to try and pull me back into contact with him, he's done this quite a lot when we were together and I wanted to leave him. I don't know if that makes me a bad person.

But I want to know how I can stop caring about him, so what he says and does doesn't affect me anymore?",19Nov2019,1

Yes this sounds fine however we both purchase many personal things on our account and I’d rather her cousin not see that stuff. Yes he’s only using to stream movies but having our logging info gives him access to our purchase history.

682,"My sister is 16 and we come from a sober home. She started dating this boy  \~9 months ago who struggles a lot with drug use. He smokes weed every single day and comes to my house high. He also drives high with her in the car and she doesn't know. When he gets the munchies, he asks her to go to gas stations in the middle of the night/early morning and get him food (shes a 16 yr old girl). When him and my sister go to parties, which is a couple times a month, he takes xanax. They went to a concert together and he did acid. All this while she is completely sober and uncomfortable. Sometimes he does acid and xanax on his own with his friends and she gets phone calls that he is blacked out and his friends are too scared to call the ambulance and so they go to her. I've seen her gradually become a more depressed person because of this kid. She is 16 and has never touched anything besides alcohol in her life and has no clue how to cope with this. She is always sad because of him and has lost her fun, outgoing personality. 

It's getting very out of hand, so my parents are basically demanding that she breaks up with him. I don't know what to advise her. Of course, I agree she should not be dating him. Although I completely respect his decisions to do drugs, it is not good for my sister to be around him. She's too young to understand the risks and it is really dangerous for her to be in a car with him. Also, as I said before, this relationship has literally sucked the life out of her. 

On the flip side, I know you can't force someone to stop loving someone. I know you can't tear someone out of a relationship. I know she is going to resent all of us if she is forced to leave him. I don't know what to do.",19Nov2019,2
683,"Hello, I will try to keep this as concise as I can - just need some advice. 

My MIL has cancer, she has a double mastectomy back in Feb 2017. Since then the cancer has appeared in lungs, her shoulders, and now her brain. 

My girlfriend is an incredible person who has quit her job to attend to her mother as much as she can and since the brain cancer has stumped her mobility and speech we have taken in her 2 younger siblings. I am not perfect but i have tried to support financially when i can and emotionally always. Covering all the bills / cleaning / being a pillow to cry on. 

On to the not so welcomed guest. At a fundraiser we had at a relatives house for my MIL she fell sick. The mass in her head often swells and requires a drainage at her hospital. I ask my family to take the kids, my FIL borrows my car to get to the hospital and I help my fiancé wrap up her booth. We clean up and head home. 

On our way to the hospital that night everything is great, I’m tired from work (5am shift) and helping out, my fiancé is tired of well everything. 

We are bedside her mother who is 1/2 asleep not responding when my girlfriend’s ex comes barging in. I am confused and shocked to the say the least. She asks for time with my MIL and before i can even figure out what is going on my fiancé agrees and walks out with me. We leave and get in the car I’m quiet and my fiancé knows I’m not happy. She is “as confused as you are” 

We get back and she’s gone I ask if anyone wants food, take their orders and head out. On our way back we see her ex again raging in with a huge bouquet of flowers. 

My mother in law wasn’t feeling well because the mass in her brain is swelling. They drain out the fluid and send her on her way. Her lung cancer has also grown in size. That was Sunday night / Monday morning. Today she is back with shortness of breath / headache. I’m getting ready for work when my Fiancé calls me and tells me her ex was at her sisters house and helped load my MIL in the car. Turns out she’s been asking around since she heard about MILs condition and someone told her. My fiancé hasn’t had contact with her as far as i know with the exception of an email from her about a month ago saying she’s sorry to hear and offering to give my fiancé drugs “for free” 

I don’t know much about them together just that it was a very bad place and she was a drug user / abusive cheater. 

I am level headed most of the time but I have no idea how to approach this situation. Thanks for reading, any advice is welcomed",19Nov2019,2

687,"We are both postgrad students and on the same group project. We are both in relationships with other people.

For context, we were making casual conversation when she mentioned that she had been to an anime screening the previous night. I asked if she was in the anime society. She confirmed this and continued that she was into a specific type of sub-genre erotica/porn anime and how she sees guys in real life and imagines them in gay scenarios. I said 'to each their own' and changed the subject. I can cope with this, bit odd to be so open about it, but I can leave that conversation.

Later that night, she texted me this:

""Hey,

I had a strong urge to send you this. It's the first BL anime I've ever watched. It just said romance, but 5 episodes in I realised it was something more.

[Link to BL anime]

I am hoping you don't block me, but I am prepared for it.""

I responded with:

""Thank you, but not my cup of tea.""  



To which she responded with:

""Ah it's the anime problem, well if you ever feel otherwise :3

[GIF of man raising eyebrows]
""

I don't feel that it is appropriate to send erotica/porn (I'm not really clear on the distinction) to someone you effectively work with, especially since we are acquaintances at best. The problem now is that it is quite awkward in the group and I don't know whether to discuss with the faculty in case it happens again or if I'm just overreacting and and should just ignore it and hope it goes away.

Any insight is appreciated and if anything is not clear, let me know and I'll try and clear it up. Thanks in advance!",19Nov2019,1
688,"So at school we were playing bench ball and we played against this team that were super violent. Like they were getting on top of people on the floor trying to wrestle the the ball off of people and you are allowed to hit the ball out of people’s hand but not that. This got to the point where by the end of  the lesson my finger was bleeding because they cut the bottom of my nail and my ankle was bleeding because at some point they had scraped a cut I already had. One of my friends was on the team who we’ll call Laura, I went up to Laura and told her that her team had hurt a lot of people on my team because also, random people on my team had scratches up their arms, and she said ‘well you shouldn’t have joined in the 1v1s then’ which is true but I didn’t get hurt during that. So I was angry and I was ranting about it to people on my team and then Laura just started ignoring me. I sit next to Laura in English and at the start of the lesson her and another girl on her team had their back to me and were glancing back at me and laughing, lets call this girl Jane. So I was pissed but I ignored it and then at lunch this girl who was one of Laura’s friends comes up to me and says ‘people are going round saying that you are really bad a bench ball and that you make up rules.’ So when I got home I texted Laura saying ‘Just letting you know that I don’t appreciate you and Jane talking crap about me and making up lies about me. Your team were the ones causing trouble and being violent, there is a difference between making up rules and making a few mistakes.’ Then it just turns into a huge argument with her saying that she didn’t do anything Like that. We were arguing so we were both saying rude stuff and after something I said she said ‘you really wanna say that hun’ and I replied ‘I just did?’ To which she replied with ‘ Can u not I rlly don’t want u to have no friends’ I was and still am confused but she blocked me and won’t tell me what she meant.

716,"Hello redditors; I am sorta new to reddit (less than a year) so sorry if this post breaks any thread rules or whatever and this is a very long read. TLDR at bottom
but my situation is basically I’m a 20 year old male, currently still living under my moms roof. I graduated from HS in 2017 and at that time everything seemed really promising; I was a somewhat ok baseball player and I ended up getting lucky and snagging a spot on a really good JuCo baseball program. The plan was to study cyber defense so if baseball didn’t work out I had a fall back plan B. I had the option at that time to move out of my moms / step dads house and go live at the Apartments aforementioned. That was around June 2017. The baseball coach said that if I moved into the apartments I could room with baseball players and build chemistry. Dad was on board with that, but mom sure as hell WAS not having that shit, for whatever reason.
So with baseball coming up in August I was really wanting to go live at the apartments. I’d never been the best at connecting with people, so building that chemistry / cameraderie up sounded really appealing. Unfortunately, even though I only had lived with my mom for 2 months that summer; she ended up convincing my dad that I “wasn’t ready” for all that. So I live with her until baseball starts. I go to the first meeting and there’s a ton of guys there, with huge attitudes and egos, or so it seemed, at the time. We met at the coaches house for a bar-b-q and to sign all the NJCBA or whatever it’s called’s no PED / injury waivers. I left about 5 minutes after we sign those, barely after eating just cause I showed up there feeling like a fish outta water. Everyone already knows each other, they’re all crackin jokes having a blast, and I’m just sitting there, an anxious bundle of nerves; feeling inferior to just about every guy there. So fast-forward say three-or-so weeks, I’m still living at home, doing my program and getting up every morning at 5 just to go lift, go to class, hit field for first practice of day, go back to class, go home and sleep for 2 hours then back to field for another 2 1/2 hour practice. Yeah Issa grind and it wasn’t easy getting myself used to that tight schedule, but I somewhat acclimated. But not socially. Like at all. It got to the point that I felt so fucking disconnected from them all that I just kinda let my lifelong dream die because I thought the baseball team was just full of judgmental dickheads, when in reality, that couldn’t have been more untrue. I got kicked off / quit the baseball team because the coach thought I wasn’t “serious” enough about it. He wouldn’t even give me the fuckin blue hat that was standard issue for the rest of the team man. So for those two to three weeks that I’m on the team, I just kinda tried my hardest to stay positive about things.
Anyways so long story short I fall off, no longer on the baseball team. everything kinda started to fall apart and way too quickly for my liking. I started taking Adderall, Benzos, psychedelics, and whatever else I could get my hands on at the time. Really hitting all that shit hard, cuz it’s a stressful time, right? I end up having to go to rehab for 12 days in Indiana. Which was fine. I needed it. I guess what I’m so hung up on is that when I finally got back into my classes, I could literally feel the compassion the I thought “dickhead” baseball players had for me. They actually gave me such a warm welcome back into school, even tho the coach thought I was a lost cause or whatever. The second day I’m back in classes one of them asks me if I smoke weed ( a standard “in” for awkward druggies lol ) but anyways he asks me if I smoke and if I wanna come to the apartments and hang out with him and a couple other of the players and smoke a b with them. I thought he was just fucking with me at first, making fun of me or something, as in “inside joke” to the rest of the baseball players. I’ll never know why I was so paranoid at that time. Maybe it was just the harder-than-weed drugs I was doing. But I go over to these apartments and man, they made me really feel like I was one of them. I ended up making a few friends off that team that I still have today. And Creator I am thankful for them. I just kinda felt “at home” in a way. So that kinda gets me back on the wagon for a while. I stop doing everything but weed and alc for the most part. I go into the coaches office and tell him my situation and that I’m very sorry he thought I wasn’t JuCo baseball material but I wasn’t trying to act like I didn’t give a shit about baseball when I was on the field; I just kinda felt like an outsider to all of them.  It kinda feels like a heart to heart. He says that I’m looking way better than I was when I was playing, and that if I really want it, I can maybe get on the next year “in some capacity”. Grasping at straws for some positivity, I take this the best way I can think is possible. It makes me hopeful
Then it’s next year, I had been over at the apartments almost every weekend, just chillin and drinking with these guys who actually didn’t turn out to be all that bad at all. Actually some of the most genuine people I’ve ever met tbh. But sadly, the coach isn’t convinced that I’m ready to take on that college athlete life again, because he’d heard some stories about me drinking and smoking weed, which he literally knew ALL the other players did. I go to the showcase after getting on my own hard workout / training grind that whole summer before. I go on the mound and throw. My strike zone consistency is still not bad, but my curveball just wasn’t dropping in right that day. Probably cause I wasn’t used to throwing that specific pitch. I’m a leftie and speed isn’t quite as important as it is for righties due to physics or something. Either way, I had added on 3 mph to my fastball (84-85) can’t remember. But the JuCo pitching coach that is watching me doesn’t look impressed at all as I’m throwing. He actually tried as hard as he could not to look at me it seemed like. So I start worrying like shit I’m not gonna make this team. So I go up to the head coach at the near-end of the showcase and basically get hysterical pleading for another chance. “We’ll see, bud there’s this thing about open slots this year we’re really bogged down”. Okay, fine. Maybe this guy just thinks I’m not worth his time. A week goes by with no phone call from him or anyone else, and then I decide to text him and ask what’s going on with the slots and stuff. He texts me back and says “Sorry pal, no space this year, but if you wanna get on any other JuCo’s I will put in a good word for you”. So fine, maybe this guy is an ego-maniac or perhaps there were some pretty bad rumors circulating about.. so listen to this shit.. I find another college, smaller, more manageable program. The coach for that one had originally shown interest at an IHSA sponsored all-star game, but I wanted to go for it that first year and go for it big time. So I get in contact with this guy, briefly explain that I’m just trying to get my life back on track after some struggles and he seems to understand. Seemed like a really great guy. But, maybe this was stupid of me, but I called first JuCo maybe ego-head coach, and tell him I found another option so no worries if he can’t get me back on the team. He says alright where are you going? I told him cause I figured, you know, he’ll probably explain the situation to the other coach and that way 2nd JuCo head coach. Put in a good word for me, right? Wrong. I never hear from the 2nd JuCo coach ever again. After that day I tried calling him 3-4 times in next week. Nothing. Text? Nothing. Messenger pigeon? Nothing. Fuckin Apaché Smoke Signals? Nothing. This guy ghosted me harder than tindr bro. Coincidentally, it started right after that phone call with JuCo coach 1. God dammit man. Why? Like what did I do to make this guy act so fuckin vindictive? But TL;DR I’m 20 now. I don’t really lift anymore. I definitely don’t do workouts for baseball any more. That would be pointless. It’s probably just not for me ig. But it’s hard cause like this was my fuckin dream at the time man. 
In the year and a half since that I’ve just been doing a whole fuck ton of nothing but drugs and other substance. I quit everything ‘cept good ole pot around 2 months ago though. And I’ve just been wondering about some stuff since then ig. My question’s to anyone who read this whole thing are: 
1. Do you guys think if I had moved into the apartments over the summer, say, I would’ve had a diff experience with baseball?. 2. Do you guy/s think that coach is just an asshole, or was he justified in doing all those things? Just to save that other coach the time of messing with a lost cause ? Like I get I fucked up, but don’t second chances exist? Maybe not an elite JuCo school. 3. Is there any reason I still keep pursuing baseball? It’s kinda like that shit just lit a fire in me that no other passion / 9-5, except eSports has been able to match. And I wasn’t the best, but I was good. Maybe good enough for minor leagues or a frontier team. Idk. Maybe never will. 4 (last one srry) now that I’m 20 and feel like I’m ready again, should I try to move out again or wait? Things have been pretty tense with my mom rn. She’s got this weird thing going on where she wakes up and feels the need to make me feel like absolutely nothing. Some mornings she’ll wake me up with, “get the fuck out of my house, burnout” like ok mom I’m gonna move out then, I got some money saved up, and I can get a good place with one of my friends for around 400$ a month rent. But when I say that she freaks out on me and says I’m not ready for that, what “drugs” am I on today. Like I’m just tryna move past the past but it’s like she has this weird inferiority complex or something. I love her to death; don’t get me wrong. She’s been there so many times when my dad wasn’t. I know no one is perfect, and maybe she just has an attachment or whatever because we lost my brother a while back. But like, I’ve been doing good lately, like I said no drugs but pot and ginkgo biloba for the past two months. I don’t feel as much to escape from anymore except the tension of home life. (Mom works from home btw). Because of this, j really feel like if I move out and keep a positive headspace I can do this but she tells me every day that I’m a loser / failure / burnout / whatever. Like I just hate negativity man. It’s so hard not to feed into; so most times lately I’ve just been keeping my headphones jamming on high and my handy bowl ( thanks molly ❤️ ) next to me. I just feel like yes you’re my mom but who are you to call your only son, who’s just trying to turn his life into something good, a failure? Like what does that accomplish for her? Especially when she’s sitting there sipping her 2nd morning Bloody Mary as she’s screaming at me? I just want a good life guys, I don’t need much but Mary to stay happy on my own I just feel like in a way she’s holding me down, playing head games with me to keep me from moving out. She’s really been making me jump through all the hoops lately. I’m not trying to abandon her or anything, I tell her. Our relationship will never be like me and dads turned out. I promise. Nothing. “Ummm okay, but what drugs are you doing now? None, mom. So I go buy a drug test to end this bullshit, I take it and pop pot obviously but nothing else. I try to show my mom this, as I am pretty proud of myself for kicking that stuff, and she slams her room door in my face, almost breaking my nose. What do I do guys? this is getting more batshit every day. Thank you to anyone who replies. ( Your advice means a lot, cause honestlyidk what tf to do.)",19Nov2019,1

I got closer with this girl who we’ll refer to as J, she’s in my band class and We also work together at the local ski mountain. This is part of my “other” group of friends who my gf does not see at all. We hang out exclusively at school, and since my gf doesn’t go to my school, she knows very little about J.

Now for the problem, whenever she sees J on my phone there’s a problem, sometimes she’ll just bring her up out of the blue and say things like “if your too busy fucking J to text me it’s fine” and things along those lines. I get that she’s insecure and cares about me, but it’s gotten to a point where it comes up multiple times a day, wether I’m with her or she’s texting me. To be honest it gets kind of redundant and annoying. Any ideas on how to make my girlfriend not as uncomfortable with J without having to upset her or anyone else for that matter?",19Nov2019,1

720,"Hello, 

I'm currently doing a voluntary year in Israel.
I'm living now 3 months in Israel and I don't enjoy it. 
The work I'm doing is physically and mentally stressing, I can't get friends with my roommates (they are also volunteers, but I just don't like them), and I don't find a way to cope with the culture and the way of living here in Israel, it's just not my cup of tea. 
As a result I'm currently just being in my room, being sad and tired. 
My only escape right now is thinking what is happening after the year. It motivates me and kinda keeps me going. 

I just cannot think of a way to enjoy this year. I even thought about going home early, but that is really the last option because it is connected to a lot of trouble. 

I gave up very much to be here (relationship etc) and know I think it was the wrong decision.

Maybe you have had a similar experience or just have an idea which could help me. 


Thank you in advance!",19Nov2019,1

723," So there's this girl in my class at uni and I've liked her for around a month now and I'm not sure how she feels. I always get along with her and can have a laugh with her when I talk to her, but when messaging her the replies are sometimes long waited and she didn't always message me first making me think she wasn't too bothered. More recently about two weeks ago for around 5 days the replies were quick and she was even messaging me first sometimes. I also met her on a night out during the 5 day period and she was dancing with me and holding my hand whenever we went anywhere all night. We went back to her friends house and when she went for a cig her mate said to me she's mentioned you about 4 times you know I think she might be interested so that gave me a bit of hope. I then went back to the girls house because I was going to make sure she got to sleep okay so she didn't sleep on her back and choke incase she was sick but she just put the tv on so we sat and watched that. Me and her friend decided that she shouldn't have anymore to drink so Everytime she'd get up to grab some I'd pick her up and drop her back on the bed and once she knew I was going to do it she'd push me back onto her bed and straddle me. She was literally sat on my dick at some point and she was wearing a skirt. She also put her hands up my top but I jumped back because her hands were freezing and it tickled (I know, smooth) and there was about 3 times where we got real close to each other, you know those moments were you're thinking if this going ok any longer were going to kiss, but we didn't. Later on her ex graft said can we meet for a cig so she said yeah, he ended up staying for hours. Me and the girl later on met my mate for a cig and she was saying to is both that he was being an arsehole and didn't want him there and that he forced himself in and I said to her no you said you'd meet him but she was that drunk she couldn't even remember. I left at about 10am and her ex graft stayed so instantly started thinking they're going to have sex, but my mate later pointed out to me, they could've have watched TV just like you both did. I know she was drunk whilst everything happened that night, but everyone always says even when you're drunk, you know what you're doing. More recently she hasn't been talking to me much, only over message because it's reading week so we can't actually speak in person, I've not done anything for her to just randomly stop so I'm confused and sad because I thought it was going so well and was beginning to think she might like me back. I'm just writing this because I don't know what to do and want other people's input.sthank you and in sorry to those who read it I know it was a long read.

726,"Just for the record, I really don't want to give out personal info on the Internet so I'm doing the best I can not to while still giving out what you need to know to help me.

Hi, so I'm a mentally ill grown up under guardianship of my mom.

I have been looking for a therapist for some time to help treat my psychosis because I hear from mental illness support groups and other places that it is a necessity for me to have a therapist. And I know that the responsible thing to do for someone who can incidentally make others uncomfortable at times would be to get a therapist to work on my social skills.

The other reason is because I have anxiety and depression. And I need someone to help me manage my psychosis.

My mom is conservative and wants me to do meditation instead. I am doing meditation and I acknowledge that meditation helps. The problem is I know that doesn't negate the need for a therapist.

I don't have a job due to my disability and in order to treat my disability I need a therapist. End of story.

My mom thinks I am being selfish and doesn't want to pay for one.

Now I have insurance so I called my insurance provider and they gave me a list. But I'm not getting replies from anyone in the list of people I called. And the replies I do get tend to say that they are out of network. In network therapists don't reply easily.

So I asked my mom to help me look and she said yes but never gets around to it.

I asked my mom if she had found a therapist and she said ""no. busy."" She then told me to check my school's portal for changes.

I then told her it would help me do my work for me to have a therapist.

My mom doesn't care about the therapist emotionally for some reason.

I love my mom but I feel like she is being very stubborn. She's a wonderful person but doesn't seem to think a therapist is really an important priority.

I would literally be willing to pay for therapist with Medicare. I don't care. My mom said ""that's not a healthy way to pay for a therapist.""

What do I do? I need one to treat my illness. And I need to treat my illness to get a job successfully.

I asked my Dad and he said he is going to talk to her tonight.

But if that doesn't work, what do I do?",19Nov2019,1
727,"So I currently rent a house from my boss. I started renting the house from him under the agreement that I would try to purchase it within a year or so if the bank was able to loan me the money. I was unable to buy it from the start due to having an old bankruptcy on my credit. The bankruptcy should fall off by the beginning of next year, which is when I was going to try to discuss a home loan with my bank again. I signed a year lease with my boss that will end in May. 

There have been several changes in my life, one of which is that I am going to have to start working less hours. So paying rent and all of the other expenses that come with that house will be really tough to manage, but not impossible. I have had an opportunity come up to move into an old family home that has come available and not pay any rent, only pay utilities and the necessities. The only thing I will have to do would be to just fix it up a little, maybe redo the carpeting and repaint the inside and outside walls. I know in the long run that it would be better financially for me to move into the family home. It would take A LOT of stress off of me as well. I know we don't have anything legally binding saying I HAVE to buy the house, but I'm just scared. I know that there would be nothing I could do if the bank still decided not to loan me the money anyways, but how do I bring this up with my boss? He is NOT easy to talk to at all and will probably pitch a fit about it because it is losing him money to not get a rent check from me every month. He is super young and not very understanding about a lot of things.

Doesn't that seem like the best decision? How do I bring this up? I'm freaking myself out way too much. I know there isn't really anything he can do, and I would pay the rent until the lease is up. My anxiety is making me sick.

So I am studying abroad currently and will go back to the states in December after the semester ends. Right now I’m thinking about leaving my current university and transferring to a school closer to home. Before I left my 10 month relationship ended and I don’t really have any close friends at my current school. Transferring would give me a fresh start and force me to put myself out there to try and make new, better friends.

Somehow his gf found out and still accepted to stay with him (he is really good at manipulating people trust me). Now fast forward couple of months, he is jobless and they take a flat together (female has her name on the contract) and the F almost pays everything. He is being a total scum to her (preferred spending his money on weed rather than on her birthday gift or dinner) while on the other hand she is the best person to him (payed him london holidays for his bday). 

But the problem is even if the girl gave him a chance of redemption, he is legit talking about going back to London to go “girl hunting”, when he said that something in my brain just snapped and I started calling him out for his bs. But the answer he gave me was “what has my gf to do with this ?”. And now I just feel like I can’t keep that lie any longer, it’s literally been bothering me all day (I was bothered before but thought he wouldn’t do it again).

But we dont want them to find out until after christmas. The furniture is set to he delivered december 27th.
Her dad has a good job but he is the only income in the household, his truck hasn't been driveable for as long as they have lived in their home, and her mom babysits my fiances brothers kid for free. So with trying to get his truck running again they couldn't afford a new set but complain its broken down and uncomfortable ect. 

We are trying to find the best way to tell them.

Put pictures of the furniture in an envelope and just give it to them? Put then in a box that is wrapped inside another box ect.. do you have a better idea? Please help",19Nov2019,2

I’m still extremely alone, never had a gf, my job is part time so I look like a loser. I have nobody cheering me on. No family or friends who would care if I dropped dead or became a superstar tomorrow. It wounds me. There’s no motivation because there’s no support. I don’t have anyone to bounce ideas off of, ask if I’m doing things right, no mentors.

759,"So my lifelong friend of 14 years recently (about 2 months ago) freaked out at me because I don't reciprocate the same romantic feelings for him that he has for me. That's the story in a nut shell. We are adults - I am 26/F and he is 28/M. My question/thing I want to vent about is that we are sort of part of a mutual friend group (not by any means a very tight group of friends, but just a handful of people who hang out together every once in a while), and my female friend keeps inviting him and I to the same group gatherings. My female friend is completely aware of everything between him and I, and even told me her thoughts on everything a few months ago - that she thinks I should not reach out to him and leave him alone so he can come to grips with his feelings and move on. So, I thought her and I were on the same page, but she continues to invite him to every gathering. Now when I bring it up, she acts like her and I never had an in-depth discussion about it, and states that he is her friend and she can't exclude him from the friend group. I do understand that, but I also find it kind of blood-boiling because of the nature of the fight. Essentially, him and I were platonic friends forever and never had anything between us other than friendship, or so I thought. Over the years, I guess his jealousy towards me talking to other guys built up inside him and when we had the fight he told me how much he resents and even hates me for how I've ""wronged"" him. He said it really hurts him when we are out with our group of friends and I talk to other guys (literally, these are usually just guy friends I happen to run into, and everyone else in the group is mixing and mingling as well). He told me he finds himself turning down potential partners because in his mind he sees us as a couple - despite us having a completely platonic friendship (and I even was seeing different guys over the years!). It was just completely lousy, and I think he is a selfish piece of shit and want nothing to do with him. So, what are my options? Remove myself from this friend group? Ask my friend to stop inviting him to every get together? There is no way that I want to even be in the same room as him, but for some reason he doesn't seem to mind attending events that I am invited to.

I just don't know what to do. My intuition tells me that I should just stop associating with these people period because a host of other reasons that point towards them not being great friends (drugs being one factor). The part that is the most hurtful is that my own female friend, who I introduced to all these other people, is seemingly unable to be supportive towards me right now. Just a few months ago she was telling me how she doesn't understand him (the male friend who hurt me), how she doesn't relate to him at all. And now she's casually dropping lines like ""\_\_\_\_\_ called me to hangout, I have to call him back."" It hurts me that she doesn't seem to be respectful or mindful about the situation from my perspective. Like, maybe don't send me pics of you guys hanging out. I don't know. What do you think? Am I overreacting? What should I do to handle this maturely?

Edit: Just want to add that I'm sorry if I sound really selfish and immature. I feel blinded right now by my negative emotions and I'm having a hard time thinking clearly/rationally.",19Nov2019,3
760,"So, just a little bit about me and my household. My boyfriend and I live together and we have one roommate (his friend). We have one dog and our roommate has one dog. I am currently thinking about adopting another dog whom I saw online is waiting to be adopted near us. He's a Great Dane, which I have a lot of experience with as I've had them all my life, and I miss having one, but I know their size is something that takes extra consideration. I'm a vet assistant and studying to become a vet myself, so I have a huge amount of experience with dogs and rescues. 

I'm a full time student and work saturday mornings, and my boyfriend works full time. One of us is almost always home due to our schedules (he works nights). We spend almost every evening and weekend at home as we are homebodies for the most part. My boyfriend is okay with the adoption as long as I take on most of the care and responsibilities (fine by me), but when I was discussing it with friends they reacted negatively and said I shouldn't get another dog, that I would have no time for it, etc. While being a full time student is difficult and I work very hard, i feel hurt at the implication that I'm not being a good pet owner.

Our dog is happy and healthy, and very well loved. He gets loads of attention and trips to the park to work off energy. Our roommate takes care of his own dog as well. So am I just being biased here? I feel a bit judged and get a sense of disapproval, but the friends in question are long distance and are not well acquainted with my day to day routine. I am confident in what I can handle, but would this make me an irresponsible pet owner? Should I just brush it off, or do they have a point?",19Nov2019,2

763,"TL;DR at bottom

...

Basically .. I grew up and always wanted to be a vet. I never questioned it, it was just something I “knew”. Started pre vet program out of HS and realized I absolutely did not want this (wasn’t the saving kittens under rainbows and delivering unicorn calfs or whatever I thought it was) 

After a depression and overwhelmed phase, I got myself back out there and enrolled in school. 

To be a journalist...
.. a wildlife conservationist 
.. a high school English teacher

And have had thoughts of many more and different options. 

When I get bored or find things I don’t like out about the field, or if i find something new, I find a million reasons to pursue it.. go back to school.. change majors.. etc etc. I’ve even impulsively moved very far from my family/friends to attend a school for the wildlife conservation degree, just to find out that wasn’t all kittens and rainbows either. 

I don’t want to toot my own horn.. but I don’t struggle with much as far as learning/understanding goes. I actually love college and school. I love to learn, discuss, and debate. I’m fortunate enough to have felt like a “natural” at many things I’ve attempted. 

I’ve been lucky to have supportive family, friends, coworkers, bosses, and teachers  who sincerely insist that I’m the type of person who “can do anything they put their mind to.. anything”....

But that’s part of the problem.. if I can do anything I put my mind to... what do I put my mind to? 

I know I’m far from an elderly woman, but I feel like I would really like to at least be on the path to my “dream job” or even dream lifestyle.. but my dreams seem to change so often it’s crushing. 

The reason I’ve been interested in most of the fields I’ve considered was to help animals, people, and/or the planet. I *know* my path involves helping something progress in compassionate ways... but there’s so many things I could do... 

My new thought is to become some kind of life coach or therapist (my friends. Coworkers. Family. Lovingly calm me the therapist of the group/family/store, and I find it hard to not try to help people sometimes) ... I just know there’s a lot of schooling involved, as well, and I’m very hesitant to start up a whole new fresh start to something, that is likely to change priorities again before I finish the degree ... 

Like I said. I do love school. But. School is the opposite of a career. I’m already in debt from the colleges I’ve attended/had to start a new program where a lot of my previous credits don’t count, and I don’t want to make that debt bigger if it’s not going to amount to the ever important piece of paper that somehow says I’m qualified for whatever. 

I’m also a full time employee at a demanding sales job. I’ve always worked full time while in school full time, but this job takes a lot out of me and I feel spread thin when I’m doing both, so I want to make it worth it if that’s what I choose to do. 

I’m sorry this is so long, but it’s been a while that I’ve put off discussing this again, and I felt the motivation today to reach out for some help. If you’ve read this, thank you so much and I appreciate you trying to help me out !

... 

TL;DR

I’ve got a lot of passions and I find I do well in most things I try. I’ve changed career goals and college majors many times, and now all the options for a career/life path feel overwhelming but I want to start making my way, I just don’t know how to decide and know I’m certain this time.",19Nov2019,2

If i had the drive to do any of my work i would be passing all of my classes but I don’t want to do any of that. It seems to tedious and unnecessary. My current job is a Supervisor at a shoe store called Finish Line. I could work for awhile and probably be a salaried Store Manager(main manager) here in a year. My parents basically said if i quit college and that was my plan then I have to start paying for everything I own, which I will do but I won’t fully be able to support myself until I get that job. Then by my mid 20s i wanted to start a business. But that has no path according to my parents and i’m basically being forced back into college because i don’t want to do public service or a trade. I absolutely hate the current college structure of taking all these filler classes wasting my time and money. I hate the fact that I am working harder to pass rather than to learn. I feel it is a waste of life and money and that I won’t need it to move up if i stick with my current job unless I want to go corporate. Which I may want to do if my own business falls through.

She picked me up by the collar of my shirt and yelled at me more. I did not physically touch her, and said, ""Let go of me.""

784,"Buckle in for a long story friends: 

My (19F) best friend (19F) has been with her boyfriend (19M) on and off for the past three years. The beginning of their relationship was good. They treated each well and were very happy. He was a nice guy. Towards the end of the 12th grade, he started to suffer severely from mental health issues. He got super closed off and wouldn’t communicate to her about anything. He began to be less nice. Another big issue was that he expected her to become part of his family. Not in a normal way, like a weird culty vibes way. He would get furious over the fact that she didn’t wish his sister in law a happy birthday on time and small stuff like that. He also started to become more controlling at this stage: he would get furious if she went to a party and had a drink. He broke up with her right before the prom, and she was heartbroken and alone. 

A few months go by and she’d been trying to get over him. We all started our first years at uni. She seemed to be doing well, going on dates and moving on. Unfortunately they went to the same school in the same program. She ran into him and they decided to get back together for a week. He gave her some sob story about how much he had decline mentally after their breakup, and threatened to kill himself. Obviously that didn’t work out long term, and he cut her out completely, telling her to never contact him again. The cycle of trying to get over him restarts. 

Flash forward a few months, they get back together. Big red flag: she didn’t tell anyone. She knew her friends and family would not approve. She finally told me after about a month, which I found odd because she tells me everything. 

Here’s where it gets really toxic. Over the past few months, he has been very manipulative. When her friends confess their worries about her relationship, he convinced her to cut them out of her life. She has now cut out basically our entire friend group except for me. 

Obviously I have tried to tell her to break it off, but I am not as blunt about it as some of my friends. I more try to tell her how a good relationship should feel.  She has even confessed to me that she thinks about it daily. It breaks my heart because she’s slowly been turning into a totally different person. She used to be filled with ambition, and goals.  She wanted to go to law school and make a life for herself. His family as showered her with their wealth, and has now made her goal to be a trophy wife. 

This is what I ask: I want to get her out of this relationship, but if I tell her to do that, she will just cut me out. I feel like this is something she’ll have to realize on her own. She’s already not fully happy in the relationship as is. Do I just hope she comes to that conclusion? I want to say something but I love her and don’t want her to turn on me.

785,"Hi all!

I would love some advice as this is a bit of a complicated situation. I live in a house with my good friend (B), and we had a roommate move out at the beginning of the year so we found a replacement for her (G). When we interviewed her, she seemed cool enough, a bit weird but nothing alarming. We welcomed her, were genuinely very excited to have her, and it started out decently well. 

However, since then, it has become less than an ideal situation. G isn't doing anything horrible, illegal, or evictable as far as I can tell. She is just passive-aggressive, unpleasant, and to be honest when B and I were looking for a roommate we tried to be as intentional as we could to find someone who would be a good complement to our homey cozy vibe. We worked really hard and spent a lot of money furnishing the house, are very respectful, clean, etc. And she just... ain't it. She does small things that are unnecessary and passive-aggressive, makes sure to wash her own dishes so she never has to unload the dishwasher, only locks herself in her room so we never can expect her to contribute to cleaning anything, fights with me over $8 worth of household supplies, and never reaches out unless it is to complain or tersely request that someone be quiet or that she isn't going to pay for such and such... it's just all-around more stressful than what we wanted. She also made a big show a few weeks ago of changing her doorknobs to her room to be able to lock them despite us never having any interest in entering her room. The thought was just laughable! And again, if you don't trust us or something, then why are you here? The communication is strained. B and I are both very busy with work and school. The feeling that I have is, why do you live here if you have made it so abundantly clear that you don't really like us or WANT to? 

The kicker in this situation is, we are month-to-month without a lease. My proposed plan was to potentially speak to the landlord, have B and I sign a lease at the beginning of the year, and ask her to leave (how long is appropriate in this situation?), allowing us to sublet the space to the next person with some documentation to avoid this kind of thing in the future. We do not want to move, we have a great deal, a wonderful house that we have invested a lot in, and that isn't really in the cards at this time. The advice that I need is how to have this conversation and what steps we need to take to make sure we are in as good a position as we possibly can be.",19Nov2019,1

788,"I have been working at my job for a little over a year. When I first started there was a female coworker that seemed really cool, we hung out a few times and at one point kissed but that was the extent of anything between us. I started to realize she was overly dramatic and clingy as all hell. A few months go by and I start dating a different girl. She FLIPPED when this happened. She texts me saying I led her on, I lied to her, etc. Mind you I never mentioned getting together with her at all and established multiple times that I realized it may be best not to date a coworker, especially only being at my job for a couple months. 

Fast forward to me dating my new gf and my coworker will not leave us alone. She is constantly glaring at me, causing drama/arguments between us at work and telling new hires that I was this oh so evil human being that broke her heart. After a few more months she finally quit it and left me alone. 

My girlfriend and I just recently split up and she caught wind of it. She has been texting me constantly, regardless if I reply or not, sending me pictures of her in her underwear without me asking and apparently has been talking about how I’m single non stop at work. I’ve even heard she’s concerned about one of our new hires being attracted to me and I’m worried she’s going to try to assert some sort of ownership over me and make things awkward between myself and my coworkers. 

I know I should probably go to upper management and discuss the issue but I’m worried about the backlash and drama it may cause. My workplace can be like a high school locker room and word/rumors spread fast. I’m trying to avoid conflict at all costs but I’m unsure what else I can really do. Being straight with her hasn’t really worked in the past and she can’t seem to get the hint when I leave her on read every day. Help lol",19Nov2019,1

Unfortunately she got stuck at work and missed the appointment ( we work in the same field and there was nothing she could have done to make the appointment unfortunately) here comes last week I get a lil ichy spot down there and go to he Dr. A quick test later and it's HSV 2. She has been my only partner for over a month and the Dr said due to me having a fever, swollen glands, and no prior symptoms that it is very very likely I came in contact with the virus in the past three weeks. This being said I don't blame her in the slightest bit. We made the decision together as adults to have unprotected sex. Also I don't even know if she gave it to me.

790,"I’m exhausted so I’ll keep this somewhat brief. 

20F, I am currently taking a semester off from my university. Not sure if I am going to take a gap year or go back / transfer somewhere else next semester. I’m local but there are a lot of great colleges in my area. I live at home. 

I’m taking off because of my anxiety (it’s at its worst point), and because I do not know what I want to do yet. I have ideas in mind for a major but I need anxiety under control first as I can’t focus with it. Also, I’m not a school person whatsoever and it’s hard for me to do the work when I don’t have a clear goal in mind. 

I live at home. I currently am getting over mono so I have almost no energy, a lot of headaches, etc. I do not have a job because of how bad my anxiety is. I am going to therapy so that is helping a bit. 

I have a very loving boyfriend, and some close friends. I do go out on weekends. 

This is somewhat irrelevant, but I hate the winter. It’s bleak, boring, and I love the outdoors so it’s hard once winter rolls around on the east coast because summer is so lively and I love being outside. I could ski and stuff but it’s expensive and like I said I don’t have a job. 

As of right now, I am afraid my energy will never come back. I’m scared I’ll never want to work because I’ve been living such a lazy lifestyle. I have health anxiety so that’s making being sick harder. I need to work, or go to school, or something. I hate being so lazy and feeling like a total bum but I also don’t know what to do that will make me happy right now / my energy come back. 

I have a passion for photography but I don’t know. Maybe I have some seasonal depression too. 

I see everyone I know at universities far from home (I am not ready to go away nor do I really care to right now), in their sororities, with lots of new friends, succeeding in school, etc. 

I just feel like I’m wasting life and I’m scared because I don’t know how to pick myself back up.",19Nov2019,2

So after a few months of waiting, I gave up and decided to go for further education for a Masters on a more well-known, prestigious college in the states.

When I went and took a tour at the State and the College itself, I really fell in love with the City and everything about that place made me happy. I enjoyed every single thing about it, and the college really felt amazing and I was truly excited to see where my future would hold in such a place.

After working hard and trying to get all my documents ready to send it all to the college, I got a call from the Company that I applied and I was given an Interview for next week.

Right now I'm stuck on what to do now. I really want to go to the states and learn more and getting a masters and have a better opportunity, but I can stay in my country and work for the small company and earn actual money.

818,"TL;DR: 69 year old Mother in law refusing to do physical therapy, nonstop complaining, and thinking we're stealing her money. Needs to be in nursing home, but cant afford it. Lives in Missouri and makes $700/month.  Do we have any alternatives?

Sorry in advance for length and way too many details but i feel its important to know the whole story of what we've sacrificed for her. (I also want to say that I have put myself in her shoes and can understand her frustrations but it has been more and more excessive recently)
So I was born, raised, and lived in Louisiana for my entire life except 3 months ago when I moved to Missouri due to financial and family issues (long story.) But my husbands mom has been ungrateful from day one. Even when moving I tried to make sure we took care of her needs and comfort first and she waited til last minute to yell at my husband to take her everywhere the day I was supposed to go say bye to my family (who all live in Louisiana btw) so I of course was upset by this and thankfully I worked out something to visit at least one of my grandmothers before I left. When we got to Missouri the home we moved into was a little on the run down side due to us not able to drive 10 hrs to look at it before renting but needing a place to stay. She immediately was hospitalized the next couple months for x, y, and z. Has lost all muscle because she refuses to do workouts that her physical therapist  who visits home wants her to do, and complains that me and my husband are taking all her money when weve only paid for bills and moving with her money with her permission. I found a decent job that takes care of my needs and my husband works for lyft/uber/etc. to have a flexible schedule for her but she constantly keeps him from going out to make money so he has to continue using her money to buy food for the house amd various bills he cant pay due to her keeping him in the house with little things like going to the bathroom or fixing a meal when she is capable of doing it when I'm here by myself trying to sleep during the day (i work nights). I'm frustrated seeing and hearing my husband being constantly yelled at for waiting on his mother hand and foot while trying his hardest to make money and get her to understand that he has to leave to make money. She went so far as to tell his grandparents during a visit that she wasnt eating bc we had no food when my husband went to the store the day before specifically for food she wanted. She then yelled at him when he got home because she was ""tired of all these damn sandwiches."" Well how are we supposed to make money, not spend your money, get you taken care of, and make you home meals at your convenience??? Insurance only covers a few weeks in a nursing home and she only gets $700/month income so thats out the question. She also has an in home nurse and social worker that come by during the week and I never agreed to this or anything like this when we were thinking of moving and its just putting a huge emotional toll on me bc i suffer from a bunch of anxieties and having people in and out the house all day with my pet dog and cat is stressful. We have no idea what to do anymore now because everything we try to do for her ends up making her more mad or it isnt enough. She's 69 years old and looks like a skeleton. Husband is an only child and he lost his dad (parents werent married) earlier this year so he really doesnt want to lose his mom but even he is getting so stressed that he's starting to resent her and he doesn't want to. Is there any idea or any resources we could possibly look into to help her get better mentally and physically?? Even the nurses that come here are saying they are going to have to cancel the services if she keeps refusing to not do anything but sit in bed and complain because we all are trying to help her but she seems to think we all want her money. We really dont, and even if we did we wouldn't be working this hard to try to keep her alive and happy. The nurses and I really think a nursing home would be good because she has so many medical needs, a nursing staff would be good and she also is super lonely as I am introverted and work nights so other residents could keep her company.",19Nov2019,1

I work closing shifts at work and I have quite a bit of say so with how things run even with the other managers although anything I do bring forward always comes a crossed politely.. Not much reason to be upset when people value you and I simply don't know how to receive a compliment and tend to change the subject whenever it happens. I'm 25, have kept a good job for 6 years and always make sure to keep peace no matter where I am or who I'm with. Back to the point, I slowly start to feel like in social situations I can't even breathe or try to come off how I usually would in a normal conversation at work. As I said earlier, I seem like someone people love to be around, I just can't seem to allow myself to grow any relationships because of this underlying fear I might disappoint them and no one wants to do that.. I'm really looking for an answer to why this has happened lately to me. How can I avoid feeling this way or try better at being a friend to everyone I used to spend time with easily? I really have no one else to really ask. Has anyone else had a similar problem?",19Nov2019,1

824,"I thought my last story about shit in college was fun...this one’s an absolutely FUCKING DOOZY! To those that read the whole thing, HUGE kudos to you! 

It starts out with me (20M) and my roommate (we’ll call him Marty) playing DnD with a guy friend of ours. We end up being loud and it somehow gets the attention of this random girl from next door. Let’s just call her...Barbara. Barbara comes in and tells us we’re singing like Phantom of the Opera (me and Marty were singing for a “music video” in the campaign...I’m a weird DM). Somehow we persuade her to join us in our game and had an absolute blast. 

Fucking immediately my brainiac roommate picks up on the fact I have feelings for her, and so does my third roommate’s girlfriend. 

Anyhow, we hang out more and more as a group of friends, turns out she has a boyfriend. Boohoo, whatever. Could always use a new friend. In time, her boyfriend started hating Marty because he got dumb drunk and decided “let’s text her boyfriend while in a drunken stupor.” More time passed and that hatred turned its head to me more than Marty. Eventually it was centered at me and me only. 

Now, every time I heard of her boyfriend it was always in a negative connotation. Always some new argument in the making. So, I assumed that he’s just shit. I was originally asking around for signs of toxicity in a relationship to see if this was the case...

And then they immediately broke up. Little shithead decided “let’s also tell her everything wrong with her,” fucking prick. 

I found out that one of the arguments towards the end of the relationship was actually centered around me. I figured this because she usually always tells me what’s happening, but talked to Marty considering he was a “neutral party”...like Switzerland. So...was I a part of her boyfriends rantings that day? Was some sort of ultimatum presented and I wasn’t allowed to know of it? Who the fuck knows honestly!

Now, for the longest time, I’ve held my truest feelings for obvious reasons that told my brain to shut the fuck up about it...but now I feel less of a reason and it really scares me. I don’t want to anger anyone in my actions. Barbara’s been extremely friendly towards me though. I’m even playing with a little jar of glitter and water she let me have after I saw it in her room as we speak. She already got me a Christmas present (which last I recall almost no one has ever done outside family). She’s also been a tad extra touchy to me from what I can tell (before and after the breakup). She’s literally one of those people who takes care of everyone else before dealing with her own shit cause she worries so much for others. Sometimes she worries for me cause I worry for her. 

Another problem arises because Marty is being extra flirty with her now that she’s newly single...despite having a girlfriend. His whole cheating nonsense is a whole fucking nother tale to tell for another day. Now, I have talked to her before for advice in Marty, so she knows his behaviors and told me she’d never do anything with him because if that weeks ago. 

So, what the fuck do I do? If I should try to ask her out, when is it right? What do I do while I wait? Could Marty still be an issue? Why do I have choir at 5? Why is there a movie about a stupid fucking toaster that goes to Mars?!?",19Nov2019,1

827,"Hello!

So, I've (18F) had this problem for around a year. I started school last year and this one guy I've never talked with before waited for me to be alone and gave me a gift out of nowhere. It doesn't sound like much, but it made me feel extremely uncomfortable. After this, he tried talking to me a few times, always waiting for me to be alone. I felt very trapped. He tried inviting me out many times, but I always turned him down.

After that, he started talking to my friends and forced himself to be in our group, always following us and always sitting next to me. 

This year it turned out that my friends didn't like him that much either, so we got further from each other. Or so I thought.

He continued giving me gifts, even though I told him it made me feel uncomfortable, he keeps messaging me on different social media and I've become paranoid about anyone I don't know following me somewhere and liking my posts. If I sneaze even once in class, he would get up and give me tissues, without even asking me if I need them. 

He'd also go through a whole day without talking to me and after the classes end, he would message me that I ""looked sad"". That makes me feel like I'm being watched all the time and I'm so scared and uncomfortable. 

Every time I'm at school I feel like I need to watch my every step, I'm careful not to walk too fast or too slow, so that he wouldn't be able to catch me when I'm alone.

Honestly, I hope he was aggresive... because then I would be able to tell him to leave me alone without any regrets. But everyone sees him as an angel and it makes me wonder if I'm the bad one here...

I realize he is very self consious and definitely has some problems with himself, but I have severe anxiety myself and I'm really scared of this situation getting out of control.

&amp;#x200B;

Some friends told me to tell him that I don't wanna be friends with him, because just ignoring him is rude. But what is more rude? Ignoring someone or telling someone I don't wan't to be friends with them?

What should I do? I feel like no matter what I do, I will hurt someone and I will be seen as a bad person.",19Nov2019,1

I think I genuinely enjoy university, but I have a weird feeling that this is *not* what I’m supposed to be doing. 

If I continue my current degree, I’m almost guaranteed a job upon graduation and I can finally be stable in a good country (going back home isn’t a good option).

I could be jobless and lack the funds to continue studying since my parents won’t be supporting me for much longer (med/dentistry is 5+ yrs compared to 3 yrs in my current degree).

P.S My brother has ADHD, but I still feel like its  not an excuse for the actions hes doing. (+ We dont live in the US. Our mental care here is basically ""just read the quran and you'll get better"").

My little brother tried to kill me yesterday. Hes 14 and I'm 16. My older brother is 19. And my little sister is 12. I'm contemplating calling the cops if he ever goes on this big of a tantrum again. It started with him cursing me, telling me that I'll die alone and that I'm fat. I tried replying to him in a logical way but he would just shout and shut my voice out. So he tried cursing me again and I gave him a taste of his own medicine and shouted while he was cursing me.  That happened for a straight 15 minutes until he started breaking shit. He got this glass mug and threw it across the stairs aiming for my head, if that would've been an inch to the left I could almost gaurentee you that I'd be in the hospital now getting treated for a broken nose. I was directly behind the TV as well so that also broke. My little brother has been a danger to my family and I for 2 years now
. He also broke chairs that we had in the family for years . As he grows older he grows more violent. I told my dad that I'll give him half a year to do something about this because I won't stand for this.

A little bit sleepy as I was I answered it the usual way, saying my name etc (sometimes my dad and some friends call me with an suppressed number). On the other side I hear some moaning and just assumed, my girlfriend called me (we are in a long distance relationship, and this sort of thing isn’t new) and I participated. I think the person asked me how I was feeling and I answered something like this is really turning me on etc. Nothing to sexual for sure. After 2 minutes, the other person suddenly hung up.

In the beginning I was just thinking my gf wanted to tease me but than I got worried because she didn’t seem to know what my textmessages referred to. Also I was really sleepy at the time when the call happened so I thought maybe I just dreamed it but wrong, the call is clearly in my history with an unknown ID with 2min calling time and my girlfriend knows nothing about it.

What the hell should I do? I feel shitty as hell, I feel really disgusted by myself because I had light phone sex with a probably strange person.

My worst fear so far is that I mistook the moaning as something sexy what was in reality somebody crying and I basically just assaulted her/him.....

My father has a big alcohol problem,even so,that he doesn't care about it. 

Everyday, he drink at morning, noon and evening. I don't remember last time I saw him sober if im being honest..When sober, he is really pleasant, good man, very very lovable and a person you could always count on. But when drunk, he becomes verbally abusive. He begins saying things he normally wouldn't say.He used to watch a live streamer on facebook,that became very popular because he would just make fun of people and I guess he sees him as an some sort of an authority figure,so he began acting like him too. He never was as emotionally abusive,as he is right now. 

I have no problem going to another house, but I don't want to leave my mom. She literally cries every day, because my father comes home drunk and starts verbally abusing her..I told her,that if she would be happier is she left him, but she can't do it,because she loves him so much. 

Today we had an argument with him and he just simply didn't care what we said, I even taped him and thinking of showing him the video in the morning,but I am hesitating for some reason.

859,"This is some backstory, which is important. I am 24 years old. I am probably still technically virgin. I masturbate almost daily. When I was 19, I was dating one girl and I did oral to her and she did a handjob to me. My dick was hard at that time as far as I can remember. 

Over the last month. I have tried to have sex for the first time. First I met a bigger girl that weighted more than me. We spent some time together. Later we tried to have sex and I just couldn't get hard.... 

I thought it was because she was big and maybe because I masturbated a day before. Either way it traumatized me a bit. I decided to find a good looking girl that would sleep with me for money. 

So today I tried it (haven't masturbated in three days) - I met her, but my dick didn't get hard again, we tried so many things with her.... Sometimes it got a bit hard but not much and not for long. At least she was kind and understanding and seemed like a really nice person. The girl didn't laugh at me or anything like that and was supportive. 

Honestly I don't know what to do... I am not a hot looking guy, I am short and now it turns out my dick can't even get hard during sex. This just breaks me. I feel so hopeless and worthless. Now even if I meet a wonderful girl that I would love, I wouldn't even be able to have sex with her......

Should i see a doctor? Is something completely wrong with me? I don't like to share such details in real life with other people.......  Did any of you had a situation like this happen to you? The only thing I can think of is to try and not masturbate for a month and try with this girl again but I doubt this would do any good. Am I just impotent literally destined to not be able to have sex....?

In the morning when I wake up the first thing I do is let the cat in because he will wait outside the door. Then he spends his day inside and at night he goes out again.

We are going to be moving to the city, and I am a little worried that he will not adapt. We will have a small garden, but he will not have the space he used to have and I also fear that he will get lost in this big new place.

Does anyone have advice on how to move him? Or experience with moving a cat? And how to make it easier on him? I really worry about it.

872,"My girlfriend recently told me she’s realising one of her main insecurities is being stupid, one of the biggest things that makes her feel stupid is the fact that she is super forgetful and oblivious.

Her forgetting stuff has caused very negative things in our relationship sometimes. For example, a few days ago we were out with some friends, eventually we had a choice between two things, I wanted to do one thing and I was trying to tell her, she was too oblivious to realise I was talking to her as she quickly went to do what she wanted to do, then she still didn’t think to ask me what I wanted.

This is a small example but there’s a lot of things she has done in the past to make me feel like she doesn’t care about me, what I have to say, or what I care about. It really is tough considering with how anxious I already am.

Sometimes she’ll also forget to bring something or to do something which is very disappointing sometimes, sometimes I try to joke about it but sometimes it really bugs me.

She cried twice now about how stupid she feels and i feel like it’s my fault, I’m afraid of being toxic. I’m not sure what to do though, some of these things really bug me or disappoint me, but I don’t want to tear her down. I should be making her feel loved, not stupid.

Not too long ago I wanted to give her a great day to relax her after days of stress, I wanted her to feel cherished. Although she did overall enjoy the day, she did feel stupid again because of a few things she did that bothered me, she felt like all she did was disappoint me, which again, there are things that have made me feel disappointed, but I don’t want her to feel like this.

I need advice because I don’t want to just accept it whenever she does something that upsets me, but I also don’t want to call her out in a way that makes her feel just as bad as I do, can someone help?  I’ll give more details if necessary.

TL:DR
Girlfriend is very oblivious and forgetful, this causes me to be upset about things very often, which causes her to feel stupid. Don’t want to be toxic and tear her down when she does something “wrong,” but I don’t want to just ignore it and never speak up.",19Nov2019,3
873,"Throwaway account because it’s kind of a weird deal involving BAD FAMILY MEMBER HOUSEGUESTS!

Long story short, my mom and her bf spun a story about needing a place to stay for them to get on their feet.

It’s been almost two months, and I was naive enough to let it happen.

I had been breaking up their fights every day, and my mom has physically attacked him. I’ve felt so railroaded, and unfortunately, I was dumb enough to have no paper proof or pictures or recordings of her abuse towards her bf.

Anyway, it goes on an on—my narcissistic mother has a tornado wake, and I want to see about getting them out ASAP by way of being as annoying as possible.

They’re saying they’re leaving on Thursday after having asked my boyfriend and me for money to leave earlier.

But I honestly have no guarantee that they’ll actually leave on Thursday—they gambled their fixed income away and had $35 after the first week of this month.

I want this nightmare to end.

My bf and I have been staying at his parents’ house for peace, and there’s just nothing legally I can do right now to get them the fuck out of my house.

However, it occurred to me today that I could change the WiFi password. So, I did, and now she can’t just sit around streaming tv all day.

It got me wondering if there’s more I can do.

I’m wondering if I can make it as annoying as possible without crossing any personal or legal or physical boundaries.

So, Reddit, I’m here to ask you how I can be the most annoying without being legally problematic to make them WANT to leave so that I can have my fuckin house back.

I’ve been too accommodating! Made it too comfortable! Been too nice! And it’s been so miserable for me.

Changing the WiFi password has given me a taste of power, and I want more. Any ideas for being as annoying and uncomfortable as possible? I’ve felt like a door mat, and I want relief.

880,"This is sort of a complicated thing for me. I am a junior in college(transferred from a community college to my recent school). I am studying engineering. I have never done particularly bad in any classes. I am struggling a bit this semester with a few lower grades and am afraid I might get a C or D in my linear algebra class as our professor is a tough grader. I am not sure how this will affect grad school, as I am thinking I want to go. I also am paying a lot of money for school and taking extra credits each semester because I am a bit behind. In order to keep my academic scholarship I need to be a full time student. 

What I am debating is at my part time job at a fast food place, there has been a lot of management turnover lately. As a result my boss has put a lot of responsibility on me(past what is expected from my job description). I have been doing orders and a lot more office work then my coworkers. I have enjoyed this increase in responsibility, but am unable to take full advantage of it because I don't work that much with school. If it was an option, I would like to go to school part time and work full time, or take some time off from school and try to work there. I have no intention of working their for the rest of my life but feel like it is something I would like to attempt to do. 

It is a hard decision because I feel like I could just finish my degree and go into my masters so I can get into managerial roles but I have a  pretty strong urge to start now. I feel like school is too stressful and I am completely unsure what I want to do with my life and if engineering is actually it. What I usually tell people is I am not sure if I want to be an engineer but I want to have the mindset of an engineer in anything I do. I enjoy and feel like school limits me from learning what I want to learn, but I also want to have a successful career not working in lower level managerial roles the rest of my life.  

Should I just finish the last three semesters of my engineering degree and then try something else? Would it be dumb to cut down to part time at risk of not being able to pay for school? Or maybe I should just take a year off and work?",19Nov2019,1

So this morning before school started my friends and I(17F) where talking, I had just bought coffee from my school's coffee shop and my friends, we will call him X(17M), made the usual ""You're addicted to coffee"" joke I've gotten used to my friends making. I went along and say, ""Oh yeah I jse it to escape my depression"". 

Bad joke ik but I guess ""cope"" like that. Now I haven't been diagnosed do to my parents not quite understanding how mental health works . X doesn't know this but he says anyways:

""You don't have depression"" and this is how the rest of our dialogue goes.
""Well, I haven't been diagnosed....""
""So you're self diagnosed"" He says with a smile
""Well guess technically, but I'm suicidal and I doubt that is normal""(I really don't like saying that but he was starting to get under my skin.)
""Oh, you are?"" The smile goes away
""Uh yeah, don't you pay attention to the Discord"". My friends have a Discord with a channel to talk about our feeling and stuff with the others because a bunch of us have issues. 
""No, but how could you be? You have C(My boyfriend and his best friend). 

That kinda set me off an I told him that that's not how mental health works but part of me thinks he didn't get it. I want to talk to him about it tomorrow but have no idea what to say without being aggressive. 

He struck a nerve when he said that but he is just being ignorant not to triyng to be mean I'm sure but if he will say that to me then he will say it to someone who won't take it well.

884,"I recently had a friend block me on Instagram and Facebook out of the blue, it’s a pretty shitty feeling and it’s the first time that I’m aware it’s happened. They kept me on Snapchat and some online game accounts.

Anyways I’m 22M and she’s 20F, both university students. We matched on Tinder back at the end of July and played video games as our first interaction together, hit it off fairly well, she gives me her Snapchat and we talk and play games more. She asks me what I was looking for on Tinder and I tell her it’s to meet new people, try new things, and really get out of my comfort zone as I tend to keep to myself and stick to things I know I enjoy. This was the truth for me at the time. She says she’s pretty much looking for the same thing.

Fast forward to September when classes start we decide to meet in person over lunch, and again, hit it off fairly well. We talk and hangout on campus frequently. On busy days, which had become common, we were spending anywhere between 5-8 hours around each other a day. While apart we also messaged each other often, just talking about nothing in particular. We both go try a few new things together, getting out of our comfort zones together (we have quite a few shared interests, as well as differences). Move to the end of September, we do this event together (which she invited me to), it’s a late night outdoor art exhibit type of thing spread around downtown and broadway in our city, with a bunch of different things being shown off (it’s called Nuit Blanche). This night, at least from my perspective, felt like a date, though neither of us actually called it that. Towards the end of the night (a little past midnight) I’ve gotta pee, and nothings open so she says she’ll let me use her washroom, so we head to her place. On the way there she says “there’s the bus depot” which has me thinking “okay this was just a friends thing”, but then she immediately goes “I don’t know why I said that”. Anyways we get to her apartment, I use the washroom, then she shows me the nice view from her balcony. I had a chance to make a move on her and didn’t, because I really didn’t want to jeopardize our friendship (I really like this girl, and would’ve been totally happy to just be friends), and I’m awful at reading things like this, like clueless. She gives me her phone to look up when the next bus route is to go home (no data or wifi) and I do exactly that, go home. She checks on me when I get home, says she had a nice night and that was that.

After that night I caught feelings, but I’m the type of person that needs to communicate out of fear of misreading something. I try to let things go on as normal for a while, but just can’t keep the fact that I caught feelings to myself anymore, Thursday before thanksgiving weekend I go to talk to her a pussy out, and think “oh well I’ll try see her tomorrow and try again”. Friday doesn’t work because she’s already heading to her hometown to visit family, and I just can’t wait. She texts me just to have one of our usually chats, and I drop on her “so I’m not gonna lie, I’m like super into you”, she says that she appreciates me telling her, but my timing is ass telling right before she goes to visit family. Things get kinda awkward at this point, we hardly text all weekend, which hasn’t been normal to this point. After the long weekend I ask if we can meet up over coffee and have a chat, so we do that Wednesday. The conversation really boils down to me telling her I liked her enough to open up about things I haven’t shared with anyone else before, that I feel like I can be vulnerable with her, and her saying she likes me, but is emotionally unavailable and not looking for a relationship and that she never meant to lead me on (which she never did, I’d just naturally grown to like her for who she is and from the time we spent together). I acknowledge that things have been kinda awkward over the weekend after I had come clean, but that after this talk I hope things can go back to normal, she agrees saying she hopes we can both move past this like adults; I’m all for this, I respect what she wants. She did show me that I want more than a friendship, though not with her, as I said previously I was more than happy to just be friends. So I get back at it on Tinder of all places, but that’s not super relevant.

After this it’s basically radio silence from her (as well as physical tbh, I haven’t seen her in person since the Friday after we talked) I occasionally try to get a conversation going, but it feels like I need to end every message with a question to get a reply. I ask if any plans we made before our talk will still happen, she says they will but not anytime soon, as she wouldn’t feel comfortable. I tell her that’s okay, and that I respect that she’s got to work at whatever pace feels right to her. The absence of communication continues, with my occasional attempt at sending a meme or something. I go on a couple dates with a couple different people. Midway through November we’ve said like 30 words total to each other since that talk, and I really want to maintain this friendship, I had been trying to, but I didn’t feel like she was reciprocating, and not talking is what hurt the most. 

This last weekend (November 15th), she sends me a snap video showing off her new laptop she had just bought, it’s cool, but I use this snap to try start a conversation about it, trying to get back to our talks about nothing and particular, that didn’t happen. The next day she blocks me out of the blue of Instagram and Facebook, and I’m sort of shell shocked by this. I’m not blocked on Snapchat, as soon as I realized I was blocked I asked her about it and if things between us are cool (this is around 11:45ish at night), I don’t get a reply right away and go to bed. I have a really shitty sleep as my mind is focused on what would’ve made her block me, I wake up at around 5:30am still stuck in thought and she replies at around 5:45 or something, saying she’s taking a break from Instagram and Facebook, and if things weren’t cool between us she’d have removed me on everything already. I call her out on it, saying she could deactivate her accounts if she needed a break, and that I feel singled out and like I did something. She replies that I’m not the only one, a few people have “been bothering” her lately and she’s blocked them too, and that she’s doing it for herself. I say “sorry for doing whatever it was that bothered you enough to block me”, as I genuinely don’t know what I’ve done, we’ve hardly spoke in the past 30 days. We both followed a couple of the same pages on Instagram, maybe she didn’t like seeing the posts I liked on those pages? 

Anyways, full transparency I do still like her, it’s not like I can flip an off switch, but I truly am moving past it, as I said I’ve been on a couple dates, the most recent being last Friday (after the date finding out my friend blocked me). I respect her enough to pursue nothing more than a friendship, but I’ve honestly been obsessing about how I can try maintain this friendship; and now what to do since she’s blocked me. It’s gotten to a really bad point, where I’ve let myself get distracted with thoughts about the situation with her to the point that’s it’s affecting my studies and grades. I’m debating about just blocking her on what she has yet to block me on, just make it easier for the both of us if we’re just gone from each other’s lives (I’ve also gone ahead and blocked her back on Instagram and Facebook, is that petty? Idk). She said she’d talk to me later, do I wait for her to message me? Maybe she explains herself better? Do I keep trying to maintain a friendship? I’m not sure I’d even call us friends or even friendly at this point. I really don’t know what to think or do at this point, I genuinely care for this person and wish them the best, but maybe it’s best for both of us to just not exist to each other anymore. Idk, I need advice, but also to get that off my chest as there’s nobody I feel comfortable sharing this with.

887,"Hi All,

I could do with some advice on this as it's causing some animosity between myself and my ex over the costs surrounding our child.

The situation seems somewhat simple - we have 50/50 shared custody, taking him one week at a time. I never wanted to be a weekend dad and this arrangement has worked well for a few years now.

In my simple mind, we can pretty much share costs 50/50 as well. So if he needs a new pair of shoes, we split the cost. To facilitate this, I set up a Google spreadsheet some time ago and very simply any expenses we put on the sheet. One column for her, one for me with a running tally at the bottom and a difference.

That way we don't have to worry about getting trivial sums of money from each other, it can just go on the spreadsheet and it'll eventually balance out, i.e. if I am ahead of her by a couple of hundred, she'll just pay the next childcare invoice or vice versa. For things that he only has at mine or her house (like clothes and such) we don't bother with the spreadsheet.

This has worked pretty well for a couple of years now.

There's two issues we can't seem to come to an agreement on. The first is child benefit - this currently goes into her account and is worth about £80/month. I used to add this to the spreadsheet as a negative, essentially as a way of saying ""The first £80 you spend this month comes from the child benefit, after that costs are split"". To me, that's fair but she didn't agree and she had a valid point as to why, which I'll elaborate on further:

I am unable to drive due to medical reasons and I commute fairly far away. She does drive and picks him up from after school club 4 days a week (I work from home 1 day and pick him up from school myself). On my weeks with him she drops him off at mine. Occasionally she can't do it and I'll get a taxi or whatever, but I put that on the spreadseet. 

The agreement we came to with the child benefit was that this instead goes towards the costs of her picking him up and dropping him off. The distance isn't far, about a 5 mile round trip. I agreed to this and figured it was fair.

However in my mind that says to me when I pay for a taxi or a bus to take him some place, I should put the costs onto the spreadsheet. She doesn't think so and argues that the cost of her running her car is far more than £80/month - by her estimates it's closer to £500 and she claims she only really uses her car for this (I don't believe that's true, but this is the crux of the issue). £500/month seems like a lot to ""run"" a car.

We're at an impasse here, can anyone offer advice? Am I being unfair or am I being taken for a ride?",19Nov2019,1
888,"So it's holiday season and I've spoken to my parents about how family orientated holidays are never great for me just because I have a very strained relationship with my two oldest siblings. I'm the youngest of 5 and I have 2 brothers, 2 sisters and I'm the youngest girl. My brother's went to college and ended up graduating and both are in the military, the oldest sister is in the navy but was not able to finish school and the my middle sister works at a temp right now but also no college education. 

I tend to be viewed as the spoiled, golden child along with my second oldest brother (he went to westpoint) and so everytime I try and correct someone or try to educate it always seems like I'm being condescending or talking down, for example I try to think that we should use rather inclusive language and eliminating the ""r"" word in our vocab. My other siblings always call me uppity or make a comment on my corporate job and when it comes to family dinners I feel excluded whenever military is brought up. I don't mind them talking about it, but it's like there are other things to talk about that can include other, but then they get hurt whenever I decide to leave the room or table cause I'm obviously not interested. I get roasted, which it's apart of being the youngest, but my oldest brother for example is lame as hell, sorry but it's true. One thanksgiving he tried to roast me and then I kind of did the same back but everyone claimed I was too harsh because they made fun that I was a college student who still needed help with my fundings and I said, ""I mean I'm getting a degree in a few months and NOT living in my parent's parents"" which is true cause I got a job and moved out of state. Some laughed and my sisters felt that I was being elitist because he went through a hard break up. Holiday season is coming up and I haven't been to a family holiday since 2017 and kind of dreading it cause it seems like he's only gotten worse, not only that, he scammed my other siblings out of $750 and spent it all on something claiming, ""It's for our parent's cruise"" and it wasn't.

(Our deal was he would pay electric bill, and I would pay Water and Internet) I told both the landlord and him to resolve it together at least 3 times. He failed to resolve it, and now the security deposit is coming back $400 lighter because of it. However, the landlord will be dropping it off with me, and has not spoken to him (on account of him never replying to anything she sends him). I am at an impasse, as I want to split it as though the $400 is only taken from him, but I also don’t want to be an asshole as he and I are still very close. I have tried talking to him about this before and he said he would take care of it, even though he clearly did not.

Im not one to post sappy crap so this alone embarrassed me.

I then after things going from bad to total dumpster fire in a split second decision deactivated my account After adding to my story a text 
Something like : giving up social media, listed my number &amp; said it would be great to stay in touch but I need to do what is best for me 

I fucking regret this so much &amp; feel so embarrassed I even did this. Do you think it is ok to come back from that? What do I say when I reactivate?

896,"Hey! Thanks for coming to the party. 

So let's fill you in on the details.

I'm currently working in a trade towords my apprenticeship. The current place I'm at I'd say I'm moderately unhappy. It's droning repetitive work with no room for advancement.

Current pay, 16/h
Mon - Fri    8-5
Holidays off
Health, dental, optical benifits (Canada)

Pros.
Working towords my red seal
Highly likely for an upcoming raise
Highly likely for an upcoming Christmas bonus

Con
Repetitive, boring
No/little job satisfaction
Hearing damage
Very unsocial due to noise levels
No room for advancement... Ever





The new job is a complete new career in a completely unrelated field. It's in the cannabis industry (Canada) and has plenty of room for industry growth and career growth. The entry level position I would be doing would also likely be repetitive but in a more social setting.

Starting pay 15/h
Rotating weekends, which means working 6 days in a row between weekends.
Extra pay for working holidays (not necessarily having it off..)
Health and dental
+corporate gym membership
(other stuff maybe down the road?)


My current job isn't great, but it's above average pay for my area. I'm not happy right now and this cannabis job may offer me some job satisfaction. I'm worried that it's a ""grass is greener"" case and I'll be just as miserable with less money.

There is lots of room for advancement as it's a rather large company, so I do plan to bust ass to try and move up. I have overlapping skills in management from previous jobs along with some things that can help me get noticed. 

It's also a new company in a new industry which would only help me out. 

Hopefully I'm not forgetting somthing.. Any questions please ask away. 

Thanks for your imput!",19Nov2019,1
897,"The breakup happened around a month ago. My girlfriend and I spent 7 fantastic years together. We were happy and genuinely made each other better people. She would go through a time of depression and I’d help her through and visa versa. I recently have had some difficult things happen ( death of a family member, many friends going separate ways) and I felt like she was all I have. She decided that we should take an extended break without certainty we would get back together. She said I treated her right and we just have to work on ourselves for awhile. We’ve decided to stay friends and I’ve been trying to collect myself and move forward but everything I do takes me back to her. I don’t want to be over bearing and bother her with messaging all the time like we used to, but I just can’t help caring about her and loving her. I know I need to work on myself and I’ve been taking steps but it’s so difficult because I genuinely believe I’ve lost my soulmate and may never get a chance to prove myself again.

So, today was any normal day and I came home from school and see my mom getting ready for a doctors appointment, skip forward an hour or 2 and I'm on my computer doing my thing when my dad says that my mom texted him to say that I had to do my homework, but there was something else.... **My friends mom had no idea where he was**. I wasn't surprised because my friends mom and dad were going through a divorce and my friend frequently visited his dad by himself (I'm not sure if his mom knew when he went to see his dad.) so I don't mind it. Skip forward again by a maybe 30 minutes and I wanna go hang with my other friends, who lived in the same house as him, and when I get some different clothes on and go outside, I see one of my other friends with her mom, walking by. They stop to ask me if I'd seen my friend (My other friends were like sisters to him.) or if he was at my house and I said no and that his mom called my mom asking if he was at my house, so they walked along. This is everything that has happened so far today and he may have been kidnapped, as he is very weak and hard for people to give him attention, but basically I'm asking is anybody has advice on what I should do.

I thought that I was being strong. The closer and closer that it has gotten to this two year mark, the more I feel enslaved by anxiety, depression, and pain.

I look in the mirror and I don't recognize myself. I don't recognize my body. It feels like being trapped in someone else's skin. My weight is the only issue that can be seen from the outside, but it is a reflection of all of the deep scars within. No matter how hard I try, I can't get it to go away. I am very active, I eat well, but every time I step on the scale the number increases. - I have began to feel so much pain from all of the emotions I have held in for two years. It feels like a storm that crushes me. I have questioned almost every day for six months why I am alive... what is my purpose. I look at the sky and feel humbled - I am so small.

906,"My current boyfriend and I have been officially together since August, but we started hanging out and spending time together casually in mid-May of this year. At the time I met my current boyfriend I did not think I wanted to be in a committed and exclusive relationship. I told my now-boyfriend this and he said to see what happened through the course of the summer and then we would reassess everything in August. A couple of weeks after my boyfriend and I started hanging out a friend of mine set me up with one of her coworkers on a blind date, but the guy my friend set me up with was just looking for a hookup. I ended up going out with the guy because I was curious and at the time was not completely certain of what I wanted in terms of relationships and sex.

I went out with my friend’s coworker and ended up hooking up with him. I only ever saw him that one time and declined the few times after that he asked if we could hook up again. My now-boyfriend and I were not officially dating at this time (the hookup was in early June) which we both explicitly acknowledged at the time. 

I never told my boyfriend about this hook up, and now we’ve been together exclusively for 4 months. Sometimes I feel very anxious, guilty, and regretful for the random hook up and worry that somehow it will ruin my relationship with my boyfriend. 

I love and care for my boyfriend very much and wish there was some way I could go back and not go out with that other guy that time. Any advice to accept my actions and move on? Should I tell my boyfriend?

My status is that I have 3 lines of student loans open (2 gov, 1 private) I tried to refinance the private loan because I was bound to a 11% interest loan (it was the only option at the time) and was denied by multiple sources because of my past serious delinquencies.

I have 1 credit card with a $1500 limit, and I am at $1400 credit.

My delinquencies were that I settled on a car finance that I missed payments on as well as a Credit card. It was a difficult time and after rebounding, I spoke with the finance companies and settled with both. But it has destroyed my credit abilities.

I just want to start fresh and move on with my life and I would like some advice. I recently started a new job and life.  I want to work towards a good credit report so that when the 7 year ""credit refresh"" hits, i'll be in good shape.

910,"I’m using a throwaway account for safety reasons. A few years ago, I ended my relationship with my mother. It was strained to begin with. Her and my ex-step-dad neglected me pretty badly when I was a kid. I often had to beg for welfare lunch, or beg the local stores to “borrow” food until my parents had money to pay. They weren’t the ones begging, they sent me because I was the one who was hungry. I didn’t have a winter coat, or shoes that fit me until I had money to buy them on my own. My mom sent me to the store with notes to buy her cigarettes. My step-dad was a pretty bad pill popper and my mother was in bed all the time sleeping to ignore her responsibilities and left my step-dad in charge of me. I had to do everything for them. Everything. Or I’d be grounded. My life consisted of homework and chores. Homework took hours because I had no help. I woke up everyday to a dark house and came home from school to a dark house. I made myself dinner. I tried to kill myself multiple times between the ages of 13 and 17 and was even forgotten at a mental hospital at some point and not picked up. There’s a lot more to the story, but this is the gist. It hurts a lot to talk about. It wasn’t until I was in my 30’s when I began to really realize the gravity of why I endured growing up and it is currently ruining my life. I’m so sad and so angry that I don’t know what to do. I‘m in trauma therapy and group therapy currently and am trying to work through some of these issues. When I ended contact with her, I wrote her a letter telling her I wanted nothing to do with her and why and her whole new family attacked me and called me a liar and told me I need to get over it because that’s what family’s do. After the letter was sent and received they showed up a couple times and were told by my husband not to come back again and they haven’t since. However, through therapy I have realized other things that happened that I repressed and I’m really pissed off about it. I’m pissed about all of it. Then I get so mad that I cry for an entire day. I REALLY want her to know what she’s done so I wrote another letter, but don’t know if I should send it and stir the pot or just leave it alone. I’m having trouble moving on because she won’t admit her wrongdoings. She deserves to feel shitty about this and admit to her new husband that she destroyed my life and that these things are her fault so my question is, should I send it?",19Nov2019,1
911,"Not every question has to be answered to. If you could pick one thing, it’s this: “How do I not end up homeless?” or “Where do I go when I lose everything except my person, clothes, and Driver’s license?”

Here’s a background for those who are interested.

My college career has been fun, dramatic, full of learning and I was more than reaching for that Music Major degree... until this semester came along. As of now, I believe I’m very close to utter failure and it feels like at train’s about to slam into a cliff side.

The biggest cause of my circumstance is my lack of willpower to sit in front of paper and write on my homework. I have ADHD, but it’s pretty subjective as I can focus on tasks which require physical activity such as singing, theater acting, activities with friends... but I get so distracted. Medications just raise my anxiety level regardless of the type, and hurts my body to the point that focusing is a harder chore.

The logical thing to do is to put those distractions aside, get my work caught up - if allowed - and hope for the best. As if I was held at gunpoint...
Which is great, because I have the spirit and enjoy the idea of achieving my goals, but the journey isn’t there. Like my feet can stand on the path but my shoes are concrete.

So... I have a couple questions: 
How do I figure out my next step? I am not prepared for the chance of having to ditch my dorm, pay all the student loans I’ve accumulated, leave the friends that meant the most. “If you’re nothing without the suit, then you shouldn’t have it.”
I can’t go back to my parents for long. They said they’d help with finding a place to live and jobs to do but that’s it. I only have a couple thousand in my savings.

How am I gonna prove my ability to work anywhere if I have to tell the employer(s) my final semester was full of poor time management?

Finally, how can I even maintain my relationship with my girlfriend at this point?
She’s aware of everything above apart from that last question. We’ve talked about it more than once. We’ve been dating for over two months, and it was after the first month where my grades started going downhill. We absolutely care about one another and have done multiple study sessions, but I don’t want to take her time like this... And she needs to stay in school to finish her education.

A couple things to know:
I have roughly one and a half years of courses to complete after this semester. All credits are from a private college.😬


The biggest psychological issue here is that everyone I know in my family wants success from me. I’m about to disappoint them incredibly, and though they love me unconditionally, I don’t think I can face them without feeling imminent shame.
I don’t want pity, or to go house surfing... I just want to make music and give people a reason to hope. But I can’t find one for myself.

Thank you to anyone who’s finished this. The little things you do are so good.",19Nov2019,1
912,"(Tldr is at the bottom just in case)

So last Friday I met a girl on a night out and managed to bring her to my place. We ended up talking for so long about our studies, family, music we listen to, holidays weve been on, our beliefs etc.

We really clicked, and I loved every minute of it.

After about 4 hours of nonstop chatting and flirting we had sex. Unfortunately since I have been doing NoFap for about a month and a half I couldn't last very long, but tried my best to pleasure her afterwards. I suggested to try again but I couldn't get hard and felt very embarrassed and sorry, she reassured it was okay and we went back to having talks about what our favourite quote from a book was and so on.

Towards the end of the night I asked what she sees this as( bit immature now that I think of it) but essentially she said friends. 

So on  sunday evening I sent her a message at 8pm, to which i got a reply on Monday at 10, with a question back, I replied at 1pm on Monday, but have yet to get a reply.

So I'm getting mixed signals here, since the time we spent together she was really receptive and very open to, albeit flirting, arrange a meet up in the future to watch all of lord of the rings yet now I'm sending she's not very interested in me.

So my question is how can I write a message that shows I would want to meet again and rather her tell me she isnt interested than sending me messages every fortnight. I understand people change their mind, and that's perfectly fine, just would prefer to be told straight up, you know?

Tldr; met a girl on weekend we hit it off really well, both connected and had sex. Sent her a message and have been getting extremely slow replies. How do I find out if she's interested in meeting up again via msg?",19Nov2019,1
913,"I commented helped on someone’s comment, but I still want advice!!!! I’m new here lol 

Me and my boyfriend (f18, m19) are slightly, slightly in the works of moving in together. We have been dating for a couple of years now, since high school. Both sophomores in college right now. I hate to have that “we’re different” attitude. But we are both very mature and this has developed into a deep connection. At this point, we’ve grown up together in a way. We started dating when I was 15. He has taught me to be more responsible and have more self control, and I have taught him how to let loose and be more emotional and real with himself. I cherish every moment I spend with him. We really have grown this relationship so much. 

We spend a lot of time together at his apartment as it is. We cook, clean, and grocery shop together. We run errands for each other. We manage that small space well, alternating between spending time with each other and time by ourselves, while still sharing that space.  I do know that practically living together and actually doing it is not the same. We’re kind of slow moving, so the fact that this is being discussed is a big step for us. 

We would not be splitting everything 50/50. He has much more than I do, but he does want me to contribute. He’s given me a rate which is quite a lot less than half, but something that would be reasonable for me.

My question, I guess, is, as a rule, do you all think young couples shouldn’t live together? Do you think there is a bigger chance of this going wrong than going well? I understand it’s all very risky, but I don’t want us to stay stagnant forever. I love him and want this to become serious, but I don’t want to rush and ruin it. I just want to know your thoughts...

I'm an 18 year old male and I really want to start a serious relationship with a woman in her late 20's to early 30's. The reason is because I really do not enjoy relationships with people my age at all, not only do most of them not have any stability, they cheat and are very impulsive and think with their genitals. I want to find a more mature woman that can understand me and guide me to being a better person every day.

I'm a career musician (Not in college) who produces music videos for a living. I enjoy wine tasting, old horror movies and stuff of that sort. I'm really looking for something serious, I'm not wanting to experiment or party I honestly just want to settle down with kids. I have too much trauma from my past and I do not like chaos. Also if it helps, I look a lot older then 18 (More like 25-30) and have tattoos up my arms.

So yeah, thanks for reading this, any idea of where to go with this info in mind to potentially meet a beautiful mature woman entering her 30's? I've seen a lot of old young relationships between 18-21 year old girls and 40-50 year old men work out fine, so I think this could too.",19Nov2019,1

I'm not sure how to go about getting this all paid as I'm a stay-at-home mom and I really don't want to burden my husband with this he knows about the bill and how much it is but I feel like it's not his responsibility to take care of it because it's my problem.

I have been in my current town for a while and want change. Besides living close to my parents that I no longer talk to, and pretty much down the street from my abusive ex, I just simply want to move somewhere quieter.

Have any of you done a long distance move like that? what are some steps that help make the move easier? I do have a dog, how would the move be different with a dog? At what time should i start setting up a new job? A new place?

So it was a year ago today that we posted this about my coworker and I having no-strings sex, and whether or not it was a good idea. We were told to provide an update, so here we are a year later.

First of all, we were required to leave our jobs
Second of all, we got paid off for illegally being pushed out of our jobs
Thirdly, we used the money to go to Vegas
Fourthly, we got married and just celebrated our six month wedding anniversary

We moved in together too - we still aren't really romantically involved, but we're very close and still eat pizza and have great sex. Wouldn't change a thing. Lost a shitty job, gained a great husband, and we're in the process of getting a bigger flat together. 

10/10 Great adventure, my advice is to shag your coworkers and marry them if you can.",19Nov2019,1
930,"Luckily, my story isn’t that bad compared to others since it’s not that serious. But I still wanna share since it has been bothering my thoughts for a while now. 

I went to a concert to see a band. After the concert I stumbled across them at a bar and started talking with them. It was a friendly conversation but after some 10 minutes I said I had to go. I didin’t, but I didint want to come across as a creepy fan, and I wanted to leave them alone. They were surprised that I was leaving but I had already commited to my statement so I just thanked them and left. I really regret that in hindsight since like it seemed like both parties enjoyed the conversation. Who knows, maybe I woudl’ve befriended one or them. I’m stuck in that moment now, any help of ”forgetting”?

931,"Well, I mean, technically she did have a reason. I am a lesbian female, and Ive had a crush on her for quite some time. However, she is straight, but she knows about my crush. She has never minded it, and we usually act like girlfriends to be quite honest - we hold hands, we hug, we're together constantly. Shes my best friend. Today, though, she decided that I've become ""obsessive"" and she wants our friendship to be over. She didn't even tell me... she handed me a note. I get how the crush thing might give her that idea, but shes been okay with it up until now. I don't understand. She used to have suicidal idealizations, so is it possible that she is staying away from social settings because of it? The sudden decline in interaction makes me a little concerned for her.

932,"TRIGGER WARNING.........I have deep depression to were it's hard for me to get out of bed in the morning I can barely sleep, I have nightmares and wake up constantly but then some days all I do is sleep and not wake up for hours and hours.

 I had a nighttime job and worked 10 to 6 it effected me alot to were I'd sleep all day everyday. 
I had alot of problems in the past I was raped when I was younger and I was bullied alot and tried to kill myself when I was younger, I ended up in a mental hospital and then therapy but my parents took me out of therapy because we had no way to get there anymore because my dad got a new job.

 I then got older and got into a 6 year relationship with a very abusive man he sexual, emotionally and physically abused me for 6 years until finally I got out when I met my current husband who defended me and became my best friend and years later we got married and he has been the kindest most supportive person in my life. 

But that never stopped the way i feel about myself, I've gained weight due to my depression and i have a very negative outlook on life and myself. I cant even look at myself in the mirror without crying. I have cuts on my body because that's the only way i can Express my feelings towards myself without ending my life. I cant afford to see a doctor or a therapist. 

My husband got a job so I could quit mine. He didnt have one because he leaves for boot camp in a couple months and I will be staying with my parents till he gets back. He vows to take care of me and doesnt want me to stress anymore but now I feel lazy and useless as a wife and now my depression has gotten worse.

 All day I think of killing myself because of how much I hate myself and I cant get over all the trauma I've experienced. I hallucinate allot and al I do is wake up from the nightmares that I have.

 Right now I'm just venting, advice is okay. I just dont know how to help myself or what to do",19Nov2019,2
933,"It all started 4 months ago, when I was invited at a birthday party of a female colleague. At the same party was invited my bestfriend too. There I met one of my colleague friend which I found very attractive (for some reason I still can't quite explain). 



After I had talked with that girl and helped her with a problem she had, my bestfriend showed up. He introduced himself with everyone, and came and talked to me. 



After a while, he told me that this particular girl (which was the same I liked) was really nice. I was a bit shocked, as I didn't expect that my bestfriend would like the same type of girl I liked (our taste is quite different). He caught me of guard and the only thing I said to him was ""yeah, you are right"". Deep inside me I knew that this girl wouldn't be interested in him because they were completely different characters.



After a little thought, I believed that either way we wouldn't see this girl again so it's not a big deal. Bit little did I know that my colleague, her friend(which another friend of mine would date and the girl I liked would invite us to hang out few more times.



After a month or so, my bestfriend went on a date(or as  he believed it was a date with the girl I liked,and she said to him that she didn't like him that way). My friend tried a couple of times after that , but he only managed to make the girl feel uncomfortable hanging out with him  and in result with the rest of us too, as we all changed out together.



A couple of days ago, some of the group came up together again, but this time the girl came because she knew that mu bestfriend would be missing. The result was me falling even more for her.


She hasn't show any sign from her behalf that she likes me (or any that I caught at least. I am reallyt bad at this things).

936,"So I live in a very strict dorm, with around 30-40 people in it. Sometime the people who take care of the dorm (dorm police? Idk) come in and check for any violation of the rules.

One of our rules was to not using the phone for any reason other than texting/calling, and it have to stop before 10:00 PM, or they would destroy it in the spot (I live in a religious college’s dorm). Sometime a while ago, one of my best friend was forced to destroy his own phone. So I started to suspect of our roommates (I have some kind of inside-info that somebody is texting the dorm police)

I made a list of our roommates. Every time somebody got into trouble, I marked the name of anyone who is presented there. Finally, I circles one guy name.

But if I accused him, it would be immature because how would you do that. I need better proof.

So I use myself as a bait. See, I was pretended to do something that certainly violates the rule. Then suddenly stand up our of my bed, and walk past him. And voila! He is desperately trying to turn of his phone Camera.

940,"Okay, so I’ve been seeing tons and TONS of tweets about COPPA on Twitter rn and I don’t know what information is helpful or correct. From my interpretation (it could be wrong because there's so much I don't get), COPPA is implemented to prevent data being collected from kids under 13 by big companies and corporations. Since YouTube violated it, it's seeking to enforce stricter rules, which may also affect YouTubers that make content for all ages, since it's asking if their vids are for kids or adults.
I was hoping to start a YouTube channel after college but now it looks like I’ll probably do what idea I had in mind on twitch. What I hoped to be doing was movie reviews and perhaps looking at Reddit, but now I'm not so sure if YouTube is a good platform.
I just found out one of my favourite youtubers got hacked and nobody is doing anything to help them. As well as that, I feel that the new terms of service are total bullshit altogether. Plus the story of where people’s google accounts were getting disabled after using emojis in livestreams is also discouraging. It really does look like it’s going downhill with Susan Wojiocki in charge.
Twitch is known mainly for streaming but I recently found out that you can upload regular videos on the site as well. I don’t know if there’s any other alternative platforms so I’ll have to see. I also won’t be monetising the videos as I feel secure enough.

942,"Bit of background, around a week ago I got roofied while I was out with a friend. I ended off collapsing and vomiting quite a bit before beingbeing taken to hospital. My friend filmed the entire event so a lot of people who knew me were aware it had happened. When talking to a very close friend of mine I told him the situation was scary and I was afraid what could have happened if my other friend hadn't been there. He started to make fun of the situation- not in a malicious sense, he just said ""Bet you had a great time before you passed out lmao"" and ""Better watch out otherwise I'll drug you too lol"". I got really angry at this and called him insensitive and said it was fucked up that he would say that. He told me not to get offended and said it wasn't a big deal as I hadn't been raped or anything, I'd only passed out. He also suggested I would be better off laughing off the situation as getting angry or upset wouldn't help anything. I brought up very personal things he had told me about and said that I had supported him in those cases, and the fact he couldn't do the same for me was 'disgusting'.  I then decided I didn't want to talk to him for a while and told him not to contact me.

At the time I was FURIOUS and sent screenshots to several of my friends (Not including the sections where I had talked about his personal stuff), one of which asked permission to post the screenshots on [r/trashy](https://www.reddit.com/r/trashy/). I said she could as long as the names were censored, which she did. However the post was pretty negatively received, and the few people who commented said I was overreacting and my friend was completely in the right. It made me think that his comments may not have warranted the response I gave, and the comment about laughing off the situation was actually genuinely good advice. Although I made sure it wasn't included in the screenshots, bringing up cases when he had talked to me about his family and ex girlfriends and I'd helped him through it might have been inappropriate in an argument. Also the fact I spread around screenshots of our private conversation and allowed them to be posted publicly wasn't a good choice at all. My friends insist that I'm right to be mad at him, but after seeing an objective response I'm genuinely confused as to whether I reacted in the right way or not. I attempted to re-connect with him, but he continues to bring up that he believes he was right, even when talking about an unrelated topic. Is it worth trying to reconcile? I value our friendship but I feel sick everytime I talk to him, I feel like I can't trust him anymore.",19Nov2019,2

946," 

So recently I've got into a fight of sorts with my ex. We didn't break up because of this fight we broke up because she moved out of state. So she goes missing for a day while she was visiting home back in our state(note I'm no longer living in that town I'm away at college) so we had been friends after the move and had a kinda plan on getting together again when she had money to live on her own and move back.

So the story- her mom called me in the morning and left a voicemail (I was sleeping) asking if she was with me because she didn't go home that night. I called her back and asked what was going on kinda panicking inside because this girl was my first true love and I still felt for her. Her mom told me what she knew and did and I told her what I knew of what she was doing the day prior. The rest of the day I was having small panic attacks during class and walking ECT. Then her mom text me she was home and I was so relieved! So I tried calling her phone goes straight to voicemail. I try again an hour later same thing. Then I text her mom asking if she was ok. Her mom took an HOUR to text me back simply saying yes. That's it no she's alright don't worry. Nothin just... Yes. So I then called her mom's phone and asked to talk to her. We talk I told her how worried I was and that I was happy she's safe and sound.

Fast forward a few days. We end up having to email due to her phone battery being trashed. Then she hits me with something that genuinely pissed me off. She emailed me saying that her mom told her I sounded like I didn't care. And proceeded to tell me that I should have done everything I could (which I did) to see if she was alright. Infuriated but contempt I reply with I did everything I could. (At this time she got a new number) a i Called her and talked saying how heart broke I was to learn that she thought i didnt care. After that talk a day or so later she text me sorry for the email. I don’t believe she’s sorry about what she said. It sounds like she sorry for telling me. I respond with the truth that I hurt and that for someone who told me about getting all the facts she quickly believed her mom without even talking to me. She tried to twist it like I’m the one who’s at fault and that she was just trying not to get manipulated like she has with her dad(although I’m thinking her mom manipulates her more by giving the illusion of freedom) the last thing I said was that I understood (I don’t) and that it would take me a few days to get over it... it’s been almost 2 weeks. And I don’t want the last thing I said to someone whom I loved so dearly and still do a bit at the bottom of my heart is a simple answer that almost pertains no meaning. But at the same time I want to tell her how I feel about what her mom clearly tried to pull but I know for a whole fact that she will be even more pissed. What do I do? Do I leave it as it is? Talk to her and tell her what I feel? Or what? I need help...",19Nov2019,1
947,"TLDR; my suddenly dog-less neighbors don't like my dogs barking.

Hey not sure really how to handle this. me and my GF live in a town home. we've been renting here for 4 years, we've had our dogs 3 years from when they were pups. I work out of town a lot, and always have. I'm gone between a day to a week. about once a month. I give my GF's disabled brother money to come over and puppy sit and play playstation when im gone. normally i work from home and take calls, about 50/50, home and out. 

Two years ago our neighbors moved out and the older couple who owns the unit next door moved in with their two dogs. naturally my dogs bark at their dogs and all the dogs in the neighborhood bark at each other randomly during the day. They seems to keep to themselves and have never introduced them selves, but we say hi when we see them. 

both of our backyards, back up to a residential street. There are usually people walking by in the morning for a run, walk their dogs, and get to the bus stop in the morning. They have a dog door and can come and go as they please. There is a small apartment building across the street, and lately we get homeless people dumpster diving. Naturally my dogs like barking at things that go near their home. 

6-8 months ago the neighbors dogs died, we found out when they offered us their left over food. We told them we were sorry to hear that. It's always a bummer loosing a pet. 

The last 5 months they have been calling our landlord and complaining about our dogs barking when I'm away on my work trips. My GF works 7-4 she leaves about 615 and gets back at 5pm. From what im told they have been barking at 7am-9am. Sometimes for awhile, from what I'm told. My GF's brother gets there from about 9-10a and leaves about 2-3p to dog sit. They were fine with it when they had dogs. We never complained about them.

I'm a senior in high school and after a mental breakdown today I found out my school has an on site therapist.   
We have consulars for helping with scheduling and stuff so I went to the consulars office when I had my breakdown. I have depression and had a night talking with my mom about everything that made me upset, but then she continued the conversation this morning before school so I was in a bad mindset so it just took one little thing to make me burst into tears and need to leave class.   
I had looked into getting a therapist before, but my mom said she didn't think I needed one and should work out my own problems. However my Mom is also the type of person who doesn't trust doctors, last time I went to the doctors for anything was just for vaccines, nothing else, no checkups or anything.   
I had tried other things like changing my diet, working out, etc, but it never seemed to help my depression.  
I set up an appointment with the on site therapist, I think it will actually help to talk to someone who isn't involved with my life.  


I don't know if I should tell my Mom though. I originally didn't get a therapist before because I trusted her judgement, but I'm not getting better. I want to get better though.   
I don't want her to be mad with me, but I don't want to hide it from her either. My mom has anger issues and gets mad easily (even though she denies it). She was the only person I could rely on, but I never felt like I could tell her everything, because she'd talk to people she knew about my issues even after me repeatedly asking her not to, and even when I caught her doing it and confronted her after the other person had left (she always said she hated it when I tried correcting her in front of people).   


I want to tell her, but I know she'll be mad because I didn't consult her on it first. I'm not sure what to do because I want to be honest I just 1) don't want her mad and 2) telling people because I don't just want anyone knowing I have depression.",19Nov2019,1

So it all started yesterday when my friend thought someone in my math class liked a particular kpop band since that was his wallpaper. She made me go ask him, and and he ended up saying yes. I was pretty excited about that since im a pretty big fan of kpop myself. We ended up talking about it for the rest of the period.

The next day, my friend came up to me and told me that we looked super cute together and that I should get to know him. I said yes because i sort of had a crush on him before that even though he's a sophomore and im a freshman so thats kind of taboo. But anyway she told me to ask his korean name during lunch and i was like ""no thats kind of awkward"". We went to our classrooms and we were waiting for our teacher to come back from lunch and she tried to convince me to ask him his Korean name and than she said something along the lines said ""ok thats fine but i think hes staring at you so i think he might like you"" I turned my head to look but he was sort of in the process of turning it away. We didn't say his name or anything. We went inside and he didnt talk to me for the rest of the class. He's usually really loud so that kind of raised a red flag for me. However, he wasn't really talking to anyone else so maybe he was just not feeling talkative.

They insisted I find someone to cover my shift which was impossible as I didn’t know a single person that worked there and didn’t have their contact info. I got a doctors note instead and it turns out I had a really contagious stomach bug that spread to almost the whole staff from my day job.
Fast forward to today and I’m really thinking about quitting because I don’t know even I can handle 2 jobs and I told them during the interview I needed the week of thanksgiving off because I was going to be out of town and then when I started the request off slots were full for those days so it doesn’t look like I’m getting them off now. Should I stick with it or just cut my losses and bail?",19Nov2019,2
965,"I didn’t think I was much for social constructs but the decade is ending and it’s hitting me particularly hard.

In a nutshell: I’m 26 and my life is in a sort of offset where I’m unhappy with the “now” and I feel an unbearable longing for the “back then”. Also, I cant look forward to the “later on” but that’s a topic for another time.

When I really think about it, it has to do with my inability to really live in the moment. Because of subpar social skills, potential friendships pass by me in elevator rides, words go unsaid... all that fun stuff. I also have a hard time enjoying contemporary/hyped things and I revisit them once it’s been years on and everyone’s forgotten about them; it’s my most hipster tendency but I’m actually getting better about that one.

The 2010’s are drawing to a close and I’m looking back wondering how I let it all slip through my fingers. The thing is, I spent most of the 10’s reminiscing about the 00’s so I’m realizing that’s it’s basically an endless cycle from here on out (specially since the years seem to go faster and faster as time goes on) unless I make some kind of change...

How can I fix this disconnect?",19Nov2019,1
