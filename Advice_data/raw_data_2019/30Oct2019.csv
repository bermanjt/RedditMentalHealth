0,"Like, very badly. She tweets about it on a private Twitter she only gave me access to, she has a third Twitter account specifically to follow other people with eating disorders. She talks consistently about how she needs to improve her metabolism and lose weight. She weighs herself constantly.

She used to be at an average weight for her height. Now she's under the recommended average, and is still going on about how she's drinking green tea, going to the gym, going to yoga classes and signing up for ballet to lose weight.

I told her she needs to talk to her therapist about this. She won't. I'm out of the state, with no way to contact her mom or anyone else in her immediate personal life, though it sounds like her mom is aware ( she's asked why my friend needs to go to the gym, and various things like this ), but she won't bring it up after she asked my friend in high school and my friend lied saying she was fine.

On top of this, she has celiac, so her method of starving herself to lose weight is really affecting what vitamins she COULD be getting if she'd ,, eat more than a single apple in a day, and it's now causing water retention which is making her stress more about how much more weight she now needs to lose.

I'm at my wit's end. She ignores me blatantly when I give advice. When I give links. When I push. She knows she has this disorder, is fine with calling it what it is, but refuses to address trying to overcome it. There's seemingly nothing more I can do except snoop to get phone numbers and start contacting her family.

I've recently decided to just stop responding at all when she talks about it, aside from telling her this is a discussion she needs to have with her therapist — is that a bad way to go about this? She won't talk to anyone irl about it, so I feel like letting her tell me is in some way forcing her to think of it more critically, but realistically, I guess it isn't because I just don't have the authority to help.

Aaaa.

Send help. :') Thank u all just for reading, I needed some semi anonymous venting.",30Oct2019,1
1,"Throwaway cause ya know. Also sorry this is long, it's hard to explain what's going on cause I don't totally understand myself. And I was getting new updates while writing this.

Edit: TL;DR My best friend has been talking in what I can only describe as word salad for at least a week and is showing signs of some kind of psychosis. She's not living somewhere safe where the people are concerned about her well-being; if anything they're feeding the problem. I need advice on how to help her. 

I (20f) have known my best friend (20f), let's call her Abby, since we were 9. She's always been a little spacey and likes to live in her own little world but a few weeks ago she tried shrooms for the first time and she says it changed her life. She did seem to be acting more positive and confident but the last week she hasn't been making any sense. She made the decision to break up with her boyfriend of over four years to try and date this girl, ""Kara"", that I don't know very well. They've been spending all their spare time together which isn't necessarily bad, but since her dad doesn't approve of her relationship with this girl she moved out to stay with someone else, let's call her Hannah, for a while. I really don't know Hannah, all I do know is that Abby is sleeping on her floor, watching her kids, and doing a lot of psychedelics. From what my other friends have told me about Hannah is that they wouldn't be surprised if she was just using Abby. For what, I have no idea.

I spent most of last Saturday with her and she was talking a lot but not actually making sense. It was basically word salad. She says she's found her 'Brutus' which is the masculine side of her and another being (?) that is her feminine side. I can't remember the name. She's also become obsessed with certain numbers, mostly 27 or 2027. I believe she thinks she'll be her ""true self"" by 2027.

This morning she texted me at 5:30, this was our conversation:

Abby: I saw hell and they called to help me see and then i painted my witches then heaven to take \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and Hannah and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and my family but the FUCKING BLUES made me late to my home so RA left me. \_\_\_\_\_\_ (our mutual friend) why did you call the cops on my witch house...unforgivable. And i still can't sleep. Of course because i am now SERAPH NOT SERAPHIM. ABBY \*star emoji\* NOT ABIGAIL.Me: Wait, what?Abby: Its been a long 9 gates to this 10Me: I don't really know what you meanAbby: The illuminate called today, i red my book and am now sober. RAless and HIMless to my abby and seraph so i am only \*star emoji\* :( i feel dead. But kara soMe: Are you doing okay?Abby: No. But she's here so im fine

Then she texted me a few hours later:Abby: 05131999 My numbers :) I am abigail/seraphim but now i am seraph/abby \*star emoji\* You?Me: What are the numbers for?Abby: They are our birth daya Bery important only tell those u trust or they can fuck with uMe: 04021999 That would be mine thenAbby: We get to be in the same coven then love :)

Her girlfriend says she's with her right now and is doing fine. She doesn't seem as worried as me and my friends, she doesn't want to take Abby anywhere until tomorrow. I don't think she realizes how out of character this is for Abby. I'm also not sure if she has the best intentions for Abby.

Amy has said she's had some hallucinations before but only really when she's high. I'm worried that her doing shrooms and acid has flipped something in her brain and she's having some kind of break.

I want to take her to the hospital but I know with how she's acting now she won't go willingly and I feel horrible thinking about tricking her into going. One of our friends told her she's acting crazy and making no sense but all Amy said is that she ""isn't ready"" and now won't reply to her.

I haven't heard from her in a few hours. She sent our mutual friend a video where it looks like she either has red make up on or her eyes are bruised, it's hard to tell.

My ex boyfriend developed schizophrenia while we were dating and a lot of what Abby is doing is reminding me a lot of how he was acting.

Any advice about where we should take her or just how to handle the situation would be great. She doesn't have a good relationship with her parents and are honestly a last resort. My head is going a million miles a minute and I'm stuck at work for the next hour and a half.",30Oct2019,1
2,"So I’ve met this guy and we went on a date were we went to the beach, hung out and got some food. It was such a good day and we just constantly talked and laughed, felt really comfortable with him. We ended up having sex and that was great too. We constantly text each other and he’s always asking questions like my fav food, movies etc. The day after our date he told me that he’s recently gotten out of a serious relationship and now I kinda feel like a rebound cause he said he’s not really looking for anything serious atm, which is fine by me. But he’s always texting me to hang out again and that he wants to take me out. I don’t wanna catch feelings if it’s not gonna lead to anything though. Any advice?",30Oct2019,3
3,"A friend of mine who's been it for almost 4 years is going through some tough stuff right now. I know she had self-harmed previously because she told me, but something new happened... She told me she started to use sandpaper instead of blades. I don't know it that's ""better"" or ""worse"", but I just don't know how to help her dealing with her problem. 
Is there anyway I can help her getting rid of self-harm thoughts? Or should I find another way to help her ? I'd appreciate some help, she's a great girl but her circumstances aren't the best.

7,"I am currently in my father's house in Colorado and alone. I arrived and the house had no food because my father left for France (for family reasons) for two months. The car doesn't have snow tires and I'm a really inexperienced driver so I'm scared to drive on the snow. I was waiting for the road to clear so I could drive to the repair shop to install the car's winter tires. However, it has snowed today and it's expected to snow for the rest of the week. And I am running REALLY low on food. I have NO fresh food at all, just 2 packs of frozen vegetables and some dry pantry stuff.

11,"My fiance and I have been together for 13 years and got engaged 2 years ago. We had a handful of friends when we first started dating and they have dropped off left and right with no meaningful long term friendships made to replace them. At the moment we basically have my female friend and my niece for bridesmaids...that is it. He has lost all of his friends for various reasons...

Ex-friend 1. We realized he was a total dbag and we couldn't stand him anymore.

Ex-friend 2. He finally got laid and abandoned us.

Ex-friend 3. Bi-polar and said very hurtful things so he's been gone for a while too.

Ex-friend 4. We kinda talk to him but he is kind of a dick and is never there for us and we are his last resort when he wants to do something and everyone else he knows is busy.

Best-man...he is dying and may not make it to our wedding. I've considered rushing the wedding so he can be at my fiance's side, but he is at the point where doctor's are fighting to get him on the transplant list. If we set a date he could wind up being in the hospital nearly on his deathbed (again).

He does have two cousins but the one that got married didn't invite us even though we were at his house a few times prior to and even the weekend before. His other cousin RARELY showers and I'm worried he would show up looking like a grease pit. He has really thin, stringy shoulder-length hair and is balding and his lack of cleanliness makes it look really bad. We are both equally bothered by his lack of hygiene and are worried that he would show up thinking our wedding is going to be po-dunk like his brother's was but I'm actually going to put some money into it even though it will be super small. We get along with him great and enjoy his company but don't necessarily want his lack of hygiene showcased and remembered in our wedding photos.

My first maid of honor was my sister but she went off the deep end and started using meth...did a bunch of illegal shit and got married in secret to a p.o.s. I haven't had contact with her in a year (no regrets). Needless to say my friend, who screwed my 30th birthday 3 years ago, is getting bumped up to maid of honor...I love her but I don't feel like I can rely on her. She told my fiance to not plan anything 6 months before my birthday, so he didn't. Then when I called her on my birthday to see what was up, she said she was at her friend's for a girls night that was rescheduled from another night. I was so hurt...

Fiance's dad might not even be around by then because he is cheating on my fiance's mom and is saying he wants a divorce for fraudulent reasons when he actually wants a real divorce so he can be with his side chick. His mom doesn't know (yet.)

I just don't know what to do...I almost want to run away and elope with just us because the longer we are together the more it seems that it is us against the world...but it would hurt the small number of people that we ARE inviting. My parents, his mom (maybe dad...), My niece, my friend...possibly what grandparents are left and able to attend...

I feel like we are wrapped up in a soap opera!",30Oct2019,1
12, A few days ago me and my friend went to a indoor pool to hang out. I noticed her top had slipped a little revealing her nipple.

13,"I’m Australian &amp; it’s starting to get hot, I hate the heat &amp; don’t handle it well. So today I wore a crop top to my classes, now when I say crop top I mean a lose fitting shirt that finishes at about my bellybutton. I was then told by a guy I know that I looked “sl*tty” &amp; when I asked how a tiny bit of my stomach made me slutty he said “well maybe if you had a different body shape it wouldn’t look as provocative”. My body shape is something I’ve always struggled with, my tops are normally 2 sizes smaller then my pants. So a lot of my shirts are shorter because if they are longer they hug my hips like crazy or they are too big. 

This type of comment normally wouldn’t affect me but because it was said about what I wore to uni I started to worry I would look unprofessional to my teachers. Thanks in advance!",30Oct2019,1

15,"So one of my eyebrows is naturally higher than the other, and, in an attempt to fix this, I plucked the higher one so that they would be even. However, since I did this with eyebrow product on my eyebrows, I basically had 1.5 eyebrows left when I removed the eyebrow product, and the one that i had plucked got really thin. It looks really ugly and I'm honestly too scared to look into the mirror without putting eyebrow product on anymore. What should I do (other than never pluck them again because this is big yikes)?

16,"Alright this is gonna be a long post but this has been bugging me for weeks now

So I got close with this one girl I met online about a year and a half ago and after not talking much at first we got really really close and started talking and playing online all the time. I know she suffers from depression and anxiety really bad so us talking all the time was really helpful both ways. Like we clicked extremely well like neither one of us had done before. She lives with her ex since neither of them could live on their own with how much they make

 Anyways I went to visit for awhile since I saved up the money for awhile and when I first got there it was great. Anyways later on we smoked and she had a horrible panic attack which made me uncomfortable and I had ended up leaving since no one was talking and we all wanted space. Anyways she ended up getting extremely angry over something so little (I offered her a benzo since she was having a horrible panic attack)  and just randomly stopped talking to me and basically I had to ride out the next 4 or so days in my hotel room before I could fly back home

So I gave her space (shes had a couple times where shes gotten really upset over tiny things that don't make sense to get upset over and not talk for 3 or 4 days)

Anyways it's been over 10 days since we stopped talking and it's really sucked not talking. But she keeps viewing my snapchat stories even though she didn't respond to my text (I just asked her to do a quick thing for me)

    So now I'm not sure what to do
    Do I just wait and try and help?
    Cut her off because this is really toxic?

Over time she’s become just like any other house cat, only playfully bites you occasionally.

But a few months ago I got a pure bread Siberian cat. I took time to introduce them, through smell and any other methods I could find at the time.

When I felt it was appropriate, I let them see each over. It did not go well. My first cat hissed and retreated into another room, and the other just sat their looking confused about her.

As I’ve let them both around the house freely, I fear I’ve made a big mistake somewhere.

The non-stray sometimes tries to play with the first. Which always ends with her attacking and then running, she’s always cautious around him, and has never let him close. 

Don’t worry, he has been sterilised so his motivations aren’t like that. He’s a very nice kitty. 

Can I do anything to help their relationship? Or teach the other to keep away from the first cat? 

Thanks for your time",30Oct2019,1
22,"let me start from the top sooo I’ve been working at this company for 1yr and 7months. Great company. Great people until... let’s call him Carl. Carl shows up. We are a team of 5 not including supervisors. Carl shows up and we don’t talk very much in the beginning which ok fine i don’t care. Carl and I share a few of the same responsibilities. About a month ago before heading out I told Carl oh hey I didn’t refill x &amp; y but I’m heading out. He goes “why didn’t you.” 

We work in a very big science company. We are in the middle of major audits and due that have been spending time out of our daily tasks to help 5s and keep tidy, inventory so on. So I said well I was helping do this and he shrugs it off. I go home crying frustrated because he gave me so much attitude in front of my whole team and was just disrespectful. My supervisors like us both very much and had us settle it ( while settling it he snitched about things I was lagging on VERY SMALL things) and we were good. Kept our conversations minimal like normal. 

Shortly after this we get told to put our name tags up in our area. We also get told to make space for another name tag bc we will be getting a new hire. ok fine. Well Carl decides to take initiative and he leave so much space in between names there isn’t room for an extra tag. My boyfriend who is in our work group tells him hey x said to leave space for another tag. Carl starts getting hyper and dropping the f-bomb. “ x wanted it this way so bad once x sees she’s wrong we will fuckin re do it. If I put them together they’ll fuckin be like this”. My boyfriend kept his composure, but this is strike 2. ( my boyfriend also told our higher supervisor that if this happens again my boyfriend will say some things and what happens after that it is what it is). Note : higher super visor is completely oblivious very neutral. It SUCKS. 

Next, Carl was very upset that there was a lack of communication between x and teammate that he wasn’t going to be doing a task bc they were doing something different that day. We were in a meeting and He was very bold in front of high supervisor that “it’s not that hard I think I should be involved”. He said it in a really rude tone. Again high supervisor oblivious asf. We all felt bad for how he spoke to teammate. Teammate then told him hey I didn’t like the way you spoke to me or the way you speak to any of us. Guess what he said? He goes ; you’re just trying to be just like them. Trying to fucking boss me around. You’re always with them you want to be a lead.”  First of all them is myself my boyfriend and our lead who have been there for 1.7-2+yrs. we get along great and teammate is the perfect fit. She is bubbly with positive and easy going energy. She joins our check in conversations. Secondly if your goal isn’t to grow within your workplace what r u even doing there. We are all aiming for the lead position. So anyway he sends her crying as well. 

Finally today he sent a message in the group chat attacking me YET AGAIN. I have horrible memory and I know it can suck sharing tasks, but since he last snitched on me I can say I’ve improved significantly on things HE wanted me to change. Anyway I didn’t refill something again due to 5s cleaning inventory. And he goes before leaving can u tell me you didn’t do x&amp;y. Which once I remembered after I clocked out I txted chat right away. I replied that I was already in the car it was to late, but next time I’ll go back in and let him know. 

Then he says I’m not asking u to go back in I’m saying next time you choose to do something else other than your daily tasks let me know. First of all regardless I was putting work in where it needed to be. Our company is probably gonna get bought out and we have rising  projects almost everyday. He is so rude the way he comes across and literally no one in our group is comfortable working with him. We all feel like we r tip toeing around a volcano waiting for it to erupt. It’s so annoying really. 

Lastly, all the things he snitched on me about a month ago we standardized everything the way we + supervisors agreed it should be and HE began half assing everything lately. I really don’t know what to do. This is a great job, and I enjoy everyone else. I just don’t get paid enough to do the extra work we r doing and put up with him. Aside from that my whole team minus one supervisor (the neutral one) are uncomfortable with him.. what can I do. I’m ready to act out but this isn’t the job you act out at soooo. I’m screwed huh. 

TL;DR new coworker narcissist nitpicks everything i do. He makes everyone on our team uncomfortable. We are walking on egg shells when he arrives. He has started half assing shit he wanted done a certain way. Where can I go from here.",30Oct2019,1

24,"I have a ton of questions about the house we just put a security deposit down for but my girlfriend doesn’t want me to ask the landlord any of them. She’s taking a very know it all approach to this move but she’s never rented a property before when this is about to be my 3rd. 

My first question was to ask the landlord if I could wait on putting a security deposit down until I toured the house but my girlfriend told me not to wait because we might lose the house (Can’t tour it as it’s about 500 miles away). So I dropped a good 1.5k today on a house I’ve never toured just to please her. Can’t wait to find a major issue because it’s just my luck. 

My second question was if I could at least wait to sign the lease until touring the house. I already paid the deposit but at least if I find a major issue I’ll only lose the 1.5k instead of the first months rent. But again my girlfriend doesn’t think this is smart because “it makes us look unprofessional” to wait on signing a lease. 

I love my girlfriend, but some of these things she’s telling me have me concerned. I’m willing to admit that I’m wrong about this too, because it’s highly likely everything I’ve been told about renting isn’t necessarily accurate.

33,"2016 was a big year for me and my family. After I was medically retired from the US Army in 2012, I moved my wife and kids to Florida for a job that I worked until 2016. That year, my wife needed to have some discs in her neck fused, my daughter had to be hospitalized for Psychiatric reasons, and my back (the reason I was medically retired) became bad enough require a 4th surgery. Since then, I have never been able to return to work. Additionally, my wife has epilepsy and is unable to work. 
I was finally awarded Social Security Disability last month but the long wait drained my savings and resulted in my Harley and car being repossessed and being evicted from a house. To top it all off, I received assistance to get into my current house all to find out that the landlord was in foreclosure and that I will have to move again. 
Now that I have a fixed, limited income, I need to find a place to rent that will take me with an eviction (no money owed) and 2 Labrador Retrievers for less than $1,000 per month. To make things more difficult, my wife's epilepsy is responding well to medical marijuana provided it has a high THC content. It seems that my medical care is best kept with a military hospital (no copay) while my wife needs to be in a state that has legalized marijuana at least for medical use. No matter where I look, I seem to get 2 of those 3 criteria or I get all 3 but have to live in a place that no seasons (such as Florida) or a place that has too cold of a winter for my back. 
We have family in the Appalachians (Georgia and North Carolina) but most live in Florida. I feel so conflicted about trying to balance it all or just moving to the mountains and hoping that medical marijuana becomes legal there in the near future. Does anyone know any areas that can check all the boxes?

TL;DR: I need to find a low cost of living area with medical marijuana and access to military or VA healthcare preferably near mountains where the leaves change color in the fall without having to be stuck inside all winter long.",30Oct2019,1

I asked what happened and my sister said ""oh, that's just her winter coat is coming in"". I got visibly upset and said no, it's fat! We had a chow and border growing up, my sister knows better. 

When my BIL came home I saw him give her 2 bites of his Mountain Mikes cheese pizza, and then he opened a packet of Parmesan cheese and dusted it over her dog food bowl! I told him to stop and that she shouldn't eat human food, but he just laughed it off and kept feeding her pizza. 

I know it's their dog, but I love animals and have had many dogs throughout my life. I know what a healthy weight looks like for a large high energy breed. I pulled my sister aside and told her she needs to talk with him. But she doesn't want to ""nag"" him because he's aware the dog is getting fat, but continues to overfeed her. The dog gets 2 short walks throughout the day and that's it. She needs much more exercise. I'm not sure what else to do but walk and run her myself. But If he's just going to continue to overfeed her there is no point. 

My sister said the dog has a vet appointment on Thursday, and I'm hoping the doctor will recommend a diet. But if not what can I do?? The dog is going to suffer, and she's only 2! It hurts me to see it happen, and I'm trying to not let it effect my relationship with my sister and BIL, but it is.

37,"Hi guys, 

I'm a masters level intern working as a therapist in the US. I follow a certain therapist and lead/co lead sessions with her when I don't have my own clients. I've been working with this therapist since June of 2019, so about 5 months now, and she consistently smells really, really badly. 

So as a therapist in training, I'm pretty good at discussing tricky topics but I have reservations about this one as I just am not sure if it's my place, if I should say something to her, or to our supervisor. My mentor therapist has several medical issues and I don't know enough about them to be able to say for sure that they are or are not contributing to the smell. That being said, I've seen her on several occasions with big chunks of flaky skin in her hair and looking generally very greasy/dirty. 

She has mentioned before that the people who clean the office in the evening always leave her door closed ""for some reason"" when all the other doors are left open, and I honestly think it's because her smell permeates the entire floor otherwise. I'm not sure if client's have complained but I can't imagine no one has ever said anything. 

Anyway--I'm an intern and I have to work with this particular therapist for another 6 months or so (no one else is qualified to have interns) and I do eventually want to get hired on at this agency and program, so I'm super nervous to say anything and mess up my chances of being hired on. The smell is absolutely distracting, though, and it honestly makes me nauseous during our sessions. What should I do?",30Oct2019,2

51,"**Past story hugely abbreviated:**

Basically, I burned out as a teen a decade ago and lots of various phobias / panic attacks followed, took years. I dare say I am finally pretty alright and functional, having friends, enjoying hobbies, regained basic functioning etc. Right now looking for a job and to restart my education (I am mid 20s).

My biggest problem is though the clash between the person I naturally am / wanna be (= it makes me feel good being that way) conflicting with the passivity? I gained over past years (as a way to handle the disorders and having had to constantly waste energy on asserting myself while living in the negative environment = had hardly spare energy resources to give a damn about myself but mentally surviving).

---

**Main point:**

I often have sparks of energy when I get really lively and productive, I make goals, work on my skills, actively look how to fix problems etc. BUT. It usually lasts days / a couple of weeks and then I uh, burn out? forget?, basically it's almost like I can't keep my attention long enough on it, or maybe it's because of the sudden change of lifestyle? Same with habit apps like Fabulous, I follow it for weeks and then I suddenly drop everything at once. It's actually not hard for me to re-start the habits, once I start them I am at it instantly np. Maybe it's some form of a procrastination?, but not quite, it's not like I go ""oh nooo, I don't wanna do this boring activity"" (on the contrary, I get easily excitable about my future goals and stuff - it in a way feels like I can't maintain my ""focus"" on it longterm and having to start all over. When I say a focus, it's not like I have to force myself into it normally, it's more like I wake up and instantly know the ""right thing to do"", in this case it would be goal making &amp; making it happen.)

I am not even sure if I am explaining it correctly. The best way to explain how I ""just drop things dead"" is not exactly ""oh nooo, not again, I don't wanna do this anymore"" but I just... kinda... forget? refocus my attention elsewhere? (Read: to more passive activities that don't require me being constantly engaged about ""what is the next step"" lol.) Basically my point is it seems to be fully **unconscious** action, even phone reminders don't help if I enter that ""mode"", I go from someone who ticks off tasks and finds it satisfactionary to someone to mindlessly swipes it away and doesn't care at all. And this repeats in cycles all over.

It's extremely annoying. I just wanna be functional and get stuff done y'know. My therapist was pretty clueless about this lol. So maybe someone with similar experience could have an idea.",30Oct2019,1
52,"Throwaway because friends know my account. Also, I've posted this elsewhere as I am so desperate for advice/input.


My wife (34F) and I (34M) have been married 7 years and we decided from day one to not have children. I have two younger siblings 10F and 8F, my mother had me very young. Sadly, my mother got married and got into heroin and her life went downhill pretty fast. Mom ended up homeless with my two sisters and were on the streets for about 3 months when I learned about it. I went to court and was able to get temporary custody of my sisters, this was two years ago.


At the time my wife was on board with me taking my sisters in but made it clear when my mom got her shit together she wanted them to go back to my mother, understandable. The road has been rocky but my mom finally has an apartment and job. The job isn't the best and the apartment isn't in the best neighborhood but she is off the streets and has been sober for about 8 months. My wife has been pushing me to go back to court and to give my sisters back to my mom full-time. 


Problem is, I don't want to give them back.


My mother and I are in regular contact - she doesn't feel 100% stable taking them back at this time and my sister's have been doing so well since they've been with me. My mom has been unstable since my younger sister was born and I don't want to take the stability away from them. 


I told my wife I want to keep the girls and my mom is alright with it, for the time being, but my wife is 100% against this. Wife has essentially put me in a ""them or me"" situation. I love my wife more than the world and don't want to lose her but I also can't send my sisters back into a trash life with my freshly sober mother. My wife left to visit her family for three weeks and wants an answer when she returns (3 days).


tl;dr: mother gets hooked on drugs, becomes homeless and I become guardian. Childfree wife made clear she didn't want to keep the girls indefinitely and I agreed. Now my feelings have changed about the situation but my wife hasn't changed. I don't know what to do and the only option I see is to split but I don't want that. I'm so depressed.",30Oct2019,5
53,"I’m generally not a good public speaker overall, but I have a presentation where I’m going to be talking about some really real stuff, and drawing personal connections, and I’m afraid I’m gonna get really emotional and break down on the spot.

54,"A few years ago, I went through a difficult time, emotionally speaking, and, over time, unloaded some of my frustrations on friends who I made when we bonded over a mutual interest. Over time, one by one, they, understandably, said 'see ya later'. Other times, I had the foresight to realize that the relationships I had with some of these people was not productive and told them goodbye. I have carried a lot of regret for my past actions with these ex-friends. I've only kind of made amends with one of them but we aren't close to where we used to be (and, likely, never will).

There were friends-of-friends with whom I became acquainted when I was still on good terms with these ex-friends. I still talk to a few of them but have mostly distanced myself out of shame and fear.

As time has gone on, I've made peace, for the most part, with what happened. I'm much more aware of my emotions and how people make me feel; if I don't like them, I make it a point to not interact with them as little as possible.

In a few days, I am going to see some of these people face-to-face for the first time in a while. Originally, I was not going to go to the event but decided that, since there will be lots other people there, it was not productive to deny myself happiness because of past actions.

Even though there will be lots of other people there, it's those few people who I am dreading seeing. I don't want to force any kind of interaction or apology; they said goodbye for a reason. If we somehow engage in a conversation, I'll be polite.

My wound is scarred but will, most likely, never fully heal. I guess my interest will always have this twinge of sadness.

59,"Hey reddit. I’ve pondered this question for a few years and finally am posting in order to reach some sort of conclusion. 

 My dad has always been a person with an “explosive” temper. As a child I could never quite pin down what was making him mad but when he got angry it was a literal nightmare. I’ve genuinely never seen him take the blame for something, and he is always adamant that he is always the righteous one. 

Throughout high school I began to feel like I was constantly needing to walk on eggshells around him. This anxiety was eventually very hard for me to deal with. I never knew what would set him off. I would avoid going into common areas of the house because I was genuinely afraid to start a conversation with him. I gained around 40 pounds during this time due to what I now know was an eating disorder. He made occasional jokes and comments about my weight. When I started having panic attacks at school, he threatened to take things away from me, or would make comments about how it’s because I wasn’t eating right and lacked self control. 

His anger issues have continued into my adult years. I’m a university student now, graduating next year. I am still financially dependent on my parents and he is constantly reminding me of this. He temporarily disowned me a few years back over something school related but then begged for me to come home about a week later. He said that he did it because he needed to protect himself from me. He’s also screamed at my mom and my sister numerous times, threatening to do petty things, often relating to money. 

I’ve been to therapy and talked to friends who have told me that all this is textbook abuse, but it’s still very hard for me to believe. I still love my dad. Despite all of the rough patches, he has done good things. I just don’t know how to feel about him, and whenever I think about this, I get very anxious and even feel guilty. 

So I guess my question is, does this sound like abuse?",30Oct2019,1
60,"We’re pretty close and spend most of our time together in school, but when one of us gets annoyed we’ll say one little salty comment and then the other person gets annoyed from that and starts spewing even more, and then it goes back and forth for the rest of the day. This happened today when my friend told me “your baby hairs are growing out of control” and i got really fucking pissed because she’s mentioned that about 20 billion times by now and so I just jokingly(but not really) said “stop making fun of me” and then she was salty for the rest of the day, and she just kept on making little salty comments that go against everything i’m doing. 

It was her birthday a few days ago. I got her a present (even though she completely forgot when my birthday was and laughed about forgetting it. I told her i wanted a few pieces of origami paper as a gift but she never ended up giving me anything. Instead, she came to my birthday party and acted extremely salty because she was sad that she didn’t get to cut my birthday cake at MY birthday) and decided to make a humongous fucking deal out of it by hiding in my house. The day I got her a present has been the only day she hasn’t been salty towards me. 

The thing is, I know I can’t talk this out with her because she will 100% tell her other friends even though this has nothing to do with them and I hate having these personal issues spread for no reason (because she does that whenever we have a legitimate argument). 

I realize that I’m not seeing her perspective of this all and i might be doing shit to piss her off, but i’m only pissed off whenever she insults and criticizes me indirectly (or directly). Or she says something that pisses me off, regardless of whether or not it was on purpose, and it gets me really annoyed and my entire mood is ruined.

We both agree in some things. Ex. The music our science teacher makes us listen to is weird.

Person Y
Y is funny, kind, and semi-cute. We have only one class together and that is PE/health. I sometimes see Y look at me and then embarrassingly look away. On a ""fun day"" at school, I wore a hat, shirt, and socks to support my favorite sports team, Y said they liked my ""outfit"" in a cute and funny way. We had a short conversation and went back to what we were doing. We sometimes hold the door for each other, and fist bump each other in the hall. We might say hi to each other into the hall or get into a short conversation before class. We both enjoy playing basketball. Neither us play for the school, but like to play the related games in PE. We specifically like one college basketball team.

1. I can pass a note in class.
2. Ask them to walk with me

76,"Situation
&gt;We've been together 15 years and have very close relationship.  She is the most amazing person who is loving, kind, clever and I love her so much.

&gt;Her parents seperated 18 years ago when she was 16.   she feels her mother left her and has not contacted her since.

&gt;Her and her family are South Korean and we are living there for a year at the moment but usually live overseas.  I expected her to contact her father while we are here but she has not, and when I asked she replied that she has no desire to see him.

&gt;Her father has had drinking problems and is a bit of a womaniser.  He had a stroke and seperated from his 2nd wife about 3 years ago.  The daughters, including my wife, helped him recover and set him up live comfortably under new circumstances however after some time he started again with drinking, smoking, meeting new women and spending too much of the money put aside for his retirement as well as going into debt.

&gt;I'm not clear on the facts as she is reluctant to share all but something happened where he started being verbally abusive and demanding to my sister in law, who was the only daughter in Korea at the time, and from then my wife cut off all communication and said that is it

&gt;I know my wife had some concerns a few years ago about debt being transferred to her as part of her father's estate and that she believed staying seperated from her father may help.  I found legal advice that said this is not the case if you do not accept the estate with X number of days after death.  Her response was muted and it didn't seem to change her decision not to contact her

&gt;When I try to approach the subject of her father she is very reluctant to talk and is defensive.  She has made it clear that she doesn't want me involved which is pretty hurtful as we are very close in all other aspects.  She has few close friends and I do not think she discusses with them.  I fear her older sister has convinced her not to make contact

&gt; Regarding her mother, she has opened up to me a couple of times and she does not appear overly upset but instead considers her to no longer be part of her life.  She has the view that she left them and attributes some blame to her but also is understanding of context as her father was drinking, they had family business problems with her uncle, and the marriage broke down.

I don't know how to approach this with my wife in a way that is going to help without creating problems between us.  

I want to help her because I know it is causing her pain and I worry her parents will die without any reconciliation.

Perhaps it is fine to leave it but when we used to have contact with her father I could see that they were close and she loved and cared for him.  Regarding her mother, she has cried when we watch some movie with some emotional breakdown or reconciliation between daughter and mother so I'm not convinced someone that was in her life for so long can be cut off with psychology consequences.

Now I've written this all down I'm tearing up.  Any suggestions please let me know.  I've tried to get her to go to counseling but again she is reluctant.  She said she would but never follows through.  I don't want to be over bearing.

Thanks if you've read this far :)",30Oct2019,2
77,"I work as a server at a Mexican restaurant, and I recently had a bad incident with a food runner. He had only been worked there for about a month, and acted completely inappropriately at work all the time, sexually harassing female staff, loudly playing music, singing, fighting with his girlfriend over the phone, messing with/bullying employees, yelling at people, making strange and perverted comments, etc. I did not get along well with him, and he usually avoided me because of this. 

However, the other day we had some not-great interactions. He left his phone open to texts about me calling me a bitch, which I mainly ignored. Then later I called him out for bullying a staff member and we got into a confrontation which ended with him yelling at me to never speak to him again and ominously warning me to never cross his path. 

This happened Monday. Management found out about this incident, sent him home Monday, and fired him today (I didn’t work today). Normally I wouldn’t think something like this is a big deal but I am honestly a little worried he will want revenge and attack me. He is literally the most unstable and erratic person I’ve ever met, and he has bragged about killing people at work. (I quote: “I’ve killed 2 people and got away with it.”) He has randomly picked up a knife in the kitchen and flipped it around for no reason.

78,"Reddit, I need your help.

When I was 17, I had dreams of being an author. I wrote fanfiction when I wasn't coming up with weird novel ideas. Fast forward about 2 years, and I managed to catch the ol' Depression. My dreams meant nothing to me, and I went into retail work for something to do with my life. I tried this for 4 months, decided it was horrid, and went into temporary admin work roles after a few months' break. I somehow then ended up in another retail position which, as with most, started out fine but ended up being terrible. This was partially down to the company, and the role itself, but I think this was mostly down to me. I was depressed again, and had started thinking about anxiety. 

I then landed myself another admin role with a respected company, but I didn't finish my training. I'm fairly certain I didn't like the job (mundane and soul-sucking), and I wasn't a fan of the environment (open office). This led me into my first real depressive episode; I sought help and left my job. 

I had a few months to ""recover"", but that wasn't really what I was doing. I was enjoying being free, not working, and basically wasting my money and time. I was, however, feeling mentally better, so I figured I must be cured.

Was I cured, though? A few months later told me no, I most certainly was not. I joined a retail entertainment company, and was enjoying the job. I had a few ""normal"" hiccups, which I now see were signs that I was going downhill. A couple of months ago, though, I started spiralling emotionally, and I haven't stopped. Today is the nearly first good day I've had in a while.

(Sorry to make that sound like I was moaning, but I wanted to give you context.)

It's worth noting that the job I'm in now (the entertainment centre) has very changeable hours, with shifts from 10 a week to 40. I'd decided the reason I didn't want to work in an office was because I didn't want a routine, but now I seem to be missing a routine. I'm unhappy in an office environment, but I'm also unhappy in a customer-facing environment. I feel like I'm at a loss here. I know my anxiety is stopping me from doing my job properly, and I'm am currently trying to work on that. I also know that I want to save up for a place of my own, and the sort of hours I'm on now aren't enough to make a pile of savings. 

I suppose my question to you is this: what should I do? Should I move back into an office environment, or a totally different sector? I feel like I'll be unhappy in whatever I do, but, to tell you the truth, I'm a bit scared.",30Oct2019,1
79,"Summary: Im 13, Im insecure, Im atheist because of my sister, Im not popular, my house/family is fine, Im smart, I live in Brazil, I havent lost mouth virginity (very bad case in Brazil), Im most of the times apathetic towards things but the things Im empathetic towards I am really empathetic, like really, I hate being atheist, I dont have much free time, I try my best towards things I enjoy doing, I used to like school but now they changed tons of shit and it is garbage, school is on fire right now in terms of studenfs and the parents, the parents reason to be on fire at the school is bullshit, I rarely react or dance to songs, I keep EVERYTHING mostly to myself, and rarely will share my feelings, that is why Im asking you all months after the problem developed, I have no problems towards sexuality, I find it annoying to talk to my parents about sexual related things bc Im fine I already know things bc we have sex ed in school so Im good, Its a must to give good impressions to teachers,  Im very insecure. 

Note: this is the shortest summary I could make, also, I wrote the entire bible under you in my phone so it was horrible.


Ok, so Im 13 and I am atheist since I am 7-8, due to my sister, in her depression times, she would tell me lots of harsh things and that god doesnt exist etc, and as a 7 y/o, I didnt have many arguments and just fell into it. Ive had multiple existencial crisis when I was 9-10, then when I was 11-12 I simply stopped having them, most of the times it wouldnt even cross my mind...

Before I was kind of christian, but I wouldnt say Im 100% atheist, bc I kind of believe when we die we are instantly warped to another body without knowledge of anything, nothing other than that (and also as any animal not just between humans, maybe entire universe). But recently I kind of am forgetting about believing this way because I am falling into despaid.

Now, Im 13 and all, and I was actually playing this game and I was really immersed into it, and I finished this national fencing tournament, so I took a break for like 1-2 weeks, and so I was immersed into the game until I watched this other video of like symbolism in the game and I started thinking about life, and now nearly everyday I have this huge fear of death and like how it is inevitable, and I am very independent about my feelings and I tend to rarely share them to anyone, so it doesnt happen like it did to me and my sister. 

Now to clarify things: I am an above average student, I usually get mostly As and some Bs without studying.

I am a bit undatisfied with my social life, Im the only weeb in the school, though my friends are nice and all... I am trying to integrate myself with the more social people but I am very insecure, although I am doing some progress. 

Things at my house are fine, my parents are nice, they dont spoil me and they arent like overprotective.

Im very selective about things towards to have feelings on, if there is a character that I like in the show and he dies or idk, I might cry, or I just might have no reaction at all.

I live in Brazil, and there is this very competitive thing in here which is BV, BV is basically mouth virginity and in here if you are like 13 and you are still a mouth virgin its like you are at a horrible position. As you can probably guess, Im still a mouth virgin, and like many people do social parties (parties for no reason just to have em) in which most cases Im not invited. 

My sister now lives in US, california and is currently doing her university there. 

I treat atheism more as a curse, and Im actually jealous of religious people because I believe they can have their inner peace, although I believe when you die you just die, they have comfort towards it knowing about afterlife and everything.

I might have the wrong idea of existencial crisis, but many times I just have this pure despair, where I will hyperventilate and everything until I am able to distract myself to calm down... 

I dont usually have much free time, I do fencing mondays tuesdays wendsdays and thursdays, then I have a coding class on fridays and eventually a fencing class, on saturdays I also eventually have fencing, then on tuesdays and thursdays I have afterschool activities, so you can guess I dont have much free time in my hands.

In 8th grade, school changed the grading system and lots of shit and the entire school is frustrated because its just horrible and everyone hates it, from the nerds to the jocks

My sport skills are under average for most sports, as fencing is a very different sport and it is more of speed and timing rather than just pure strength and accuracy

When I like a certain topic, I like learning about it a lot and will always try my best towards it, but sometimes it depends on other variables.

I have no problems towards sexuality and those sort of things, and when my parents ask if Im interested in someone I just deny it, even though it might be false, its just that I would find it annoying to talk to them about it, bc Im completely fine towards it, I have no doubts, no questions, and have them to tell me so much stuff imo is kind of annoying (remember Im 13 its kind of hard to not annoy a teen sometimes)

I usually dont react a lot to many things, because of insecurity or because I just dont feel like it, so if I see this new game or something, I get hyped for it but I dont do much about it, Im just happy and I dont go around screaming, or if I am in a party, which actually happened, ppl would put these musics and I would dance more just like jumping in the climax of the song, keep my arms down, sometimes even keep a neutral expression, now that is cuz Im insecure I believe, so I dont want people like “dang well he is kind of overreacting” 
But not that this thing of reaction matters much.

A thing I find important to do is to give good first impressions to people, but towards teachers mainly. The thing I most hate in my entire life is being thought as stupid. This might be because I have a darker skin color than most of my schools (Im like a bit darker than tan), and because it is of a wealthier school I just, I dont know why, but I HAVE to give a good impression on teachers to be treated like one of the smarter students... I dont know Im very proud of a person...

Now Im sorry for writing the entire Bible 4 times in here... its just cause Idk I want to clarify everything now to make it easier for later...  

Is there anyone that can help me with them? I am usually not a person that likes to ask much help, and I also dont want to ask them because most of the times, I cant verbally go direct to the point or I will just start to panic and despair before I can even do anything and to me that is a horrible feeling. Recently Ive also been feeling extreme lack of motivation to go to school, kind of because we had this awesome english teacher and now we have this garbage one that the entire school hates, the new grading system, a shit ton of rules being implemented and they are basically useless, the school is on fire by students and parents basically (the parents side though, it is purely bullshit because of like “gEnDeR IdEaLiSm” that they are supposedly teaching but to me there is no influence at all from the school, it was more of this book called George though and now most parents are triggered.


Back to the main point, Im sorry I completely gave all of my life problems to you all but I dont know like, how do I get over existential crisis and all? I just cant get it... I feel this despair about death about how far, yet so close it is to me. I plan on living 100 years (Im quite determined to it, so maybe Ill get to 80 minimum hopefully) and whenever Im like having those I notice how we only live 5000 weeks, or 100 years, but how years are very fast. I am just in total despair towards that even as I write...",30Oct2019,1
80,"I'm currently in a bit of a situation, sorry if this is structured poorly. I used to live with my grandparents for most of my life. About 8 months ago I moved to my father's house a few hours away.

Since I've been here my cars tranny broke down and I was fired from my job for selling alcohol past the time it was allowed (long story, big oof). I'm looking to move back to my old town where I have friends I can stay with but only for a week or two, so I'd have to get on my feet really quickly (I can't stay with my grandparents and staying here is not an option for much longer). I have an associates degree in Computer Programming and Web Development but there aren't very many (if any) tech jobs in the area. I've managed to go to a few interviews for more basic jobs, but it's difficult. I've got to be picked up by my grandparents and driven to their house go to the interviews and so far still haven't had any luck.

I think welfare assistance would be greatly helpful to me right now but as my father makes a substantial amount of income I almost certainly will not be approved while I'm at this address.

I know a friend of mine in the area is in income based apartments but I'm not sure if I can go there before I get a job either.

84,"Yeah, I know, the language in my posts isn't very Christian-like. I'm a pretty shit Christian. But they are seriously being assholes about this and if they keep at this I'm going to literally scream in anger.

Anyway, I love this time of year because it's the time when pie pumpkins show up and I can make pie with them. I enjoy the whole process of cutting the pumpkin, disembowling it, then baking it and turning it into a pie. It's great fun. I even make my own crust! I also love sharing these pies I make with my church by bringing it to our potluck.

Well, I used to.

A couple women in our church have always voiced their disagreement with how I make my pumpkin pies (they have a very much holier-than-thou attitude about a lot of things). I like to talk recipes with everyone else in the church, and once or twice a year the fact that I use a real pumpkin to make pies comes up, and every single time the two bitches always have to comment on it. They've said things like,

""I don't know why you don't just use canned pumpkin. It's exactly the same thing, but less work.""

""I don't think this pie tastes any different than our pies with canned pumpkin  (news flash, they do, because canned pumpkin actually has squash in it)"".

Usually I just ignore it, but this year a third person (she is new) joined in and they went off on a tirade about it for a solid five minutes and it upset me so much I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to cry. They basically just repeated and agreed with each other, but it was still awful.

""I don't know why you would waste your time with all that work. You should just buy canned pumpkin.""

""Canned pumpkin is the same. You shouldn't spend your energy on that.""

""You would get the same results using a can.""

""See, I don't see why you would buy a pumpkin, cut it open, go through all that *mess* -waves hands around- when you can just go to the store and open up a can. It's so much easier and it tastes the same.""

""Just go to the store and buy canned pumpkin. Just pumpkin, not the one that already has the seasoning in it.""

""Yes, then you put in the seasoning yourself and the...milk.""

""The carnation milk.""

""Yes, it has the recipe for pie right there on the carnation milk. Just follow that.""

Even if it did taste the same, I literally get no enjoyment out of popping open a can, dumping it along with milk, eggs, and seasoning into a bowl then whisking it all together. It's like making box cake to me. It's so boring.

My problem is...I don't know how to address this. What do I do? I'm afraid they will immediately dismiss anything I say about *how* I make it is why I enjoy it, not what I am making. I'm convinced even if I tried, I would lock up the instant they started talking. I'm so upset over this that I'm considering not even bringing a pie this year. I'll just make one at home and leave it at that. I can't take any more of this verbal abuse over a stupid pie.",30Oct2019,2

89,"So my best friend is a local music artist and I just graduated with my bachelor’s in graphic design. While I majored in graphic design I am also very passionate and active in illustration and photography. So my friend and I have been working together for some time, maybe 2 years now, and I take all of her promotional photos, create her cover art that gets put out on social media to probably around 5,000 people, and most recently an illustration for her to use for cover art for her new song she’s coming out with. 

I love working with her because coming straight out of college it’s difficult to find a job right away especially within a creative field and it’s nice to work with someone where I’m able to do what I love and get so much positive feedback from her team. I went into it knowing I wouldn’t get paid monetary compensation given that she isn’t making any money from her music, but that the exposure alone was enough for me to hopefully gain some recognition and clients. 

That’s where the issue lies. It seemed in the beginning, her and her whole team were very supportive, giving me credit whenever anything of mine was posted whether in the caption or a link to my page if it was posted on a story. But lately, that hasn’t been the case. It’s begun to seem more like it’s expected of me and even then I’m not getting any recognition from anyone on her team. My friend will give me credit when she first makes a post, but after that my name is nowhere. It’s really disheartening and I was even honest with her about how the lack of recognition was starting to upset me given the work I put in and the image I’m creating for her and her brand. But I was disregarded, I had her and another guy from her team tell me I have to get used to being overlooked and to not take these things personal. But I’ve been so supportive of her and have set aside personal time to put hours into doing free work for her and it just seems I’m not getting the same support back. It seems unfair to me and really upsets me, especially after being written off so quickly. It’s leaving me feeling like I shouldn’t do any artwork for her anymore. 

I just can’t tell if I should set my pride aside and continue helping my friend or is me feeling devalued totally valid and I should stop giving her free work? 

Tl;dr - I feel my friend doesn’t support the free work I do for her the way I support her passions in pursuing her music. Not sure if I should stop creating free work for her or just keep being a friend and keep working for free and deal with being “overlooked” as a member from her team put it",30Oct2019,3
90,"For some background, I’ve been working in a dealership parts department for about 6 years now. I’ve been making the same rate of pay for about 3, but started off pretty low so it’s not that great of a wage, especially considering I’m living in the Bay Area. I recently asked my current employer about a raise or a more lucrative change of position to hear not a single word back from the service and parts director (same guy does both for clarity) and I felt pretty let down by this as I know been loyal to this company and know I’m a valuable employee.

I recently was contacted by another company as I’ve had my resume on indeed for a while. They’re a company that services and provides charter buses for Google, Facebook, Genentech, etc, I was told they’re the biggest bus company in the world. The interview I had with them on Monday went really well and the parts director I met with wants to get me onboard his team.

I’m on the fence because of the following;
-The recruiter I spoke with told me the position was paying about $4 more than what I’m making now, but when he called with an offer today it was only $2. 
-Right now I have no commute, it’s about 15 minutes, but this would probably be almost hour each way a day, San Leandro to Newark for those familiar with the area, 880.

The guy I interviewed with was surprised I’d been working so long in the same position without any advancement as he was very impressed with me as a candidate. He claimed that this position will have lots of room for advancement as the company continues to grow, and I think there is something to that, CA is a go-green state and wants cars off of the road.

I feel like this will be a big change for not really much more money with the drive and time considered, but then I’m thinking I could be shooting my self in the foot if there is more room for advancement and the $2 would only be a starting point.

Maybe I’m just comfortable, but I do feel the dealership parts world is kind of a dead end, at least where I am now.

Me and a girl met in 6th grade. We hit it off right away and for the next 2 1/2 years of my life we were supposedly inseparable. After not talking for a while I found out since the start she was faking being friends for the attention of my other friends and me. It explains why she never invited me to hangout. She never would talk to me unless I spoke to her. And most often when we would play games I was pushed aside for someone else despite being ""the almost brother."" Its been a month since we were in this mess and I dont know what to do. It hurts having to see or hear her and I'm stuck with being in the same place as her many times throughout the day. Whenever I do anything from being mad at her I get called the bad guy and she will always act victim or innocent when done so.  Now I'm on the verge of losing my mind and I need advice.( I will give any details asked for.)",30Oct2019,1
99,"my main question here is why do i feel like this !! i’m getting really frustrated because i can usually make sense of my emotions but i just don’t understand. here’s the story:
i am 16, and i have a boyfriend, i love him with all my heart and trust him and we’ve been together for well over a year now. we have not had sex. we didn’t start doing sexual activities until we had been together for 6months and even then, we took things slowly. and i was very happy with that. i’ve known his best friend (we’ll call him bob) for the same amount of time i’ve known my bf. bob recently got a girlfriend, and they started doing “sexual activities” before they were official and usually i don’t care about that. let people do what they want, right? for some reason bob and his gf bother me. and today my bf told me that bob and his gf had sex, after 2 weeks of being official. they did it 5 times in 4 days. they’re both 15 and the age of consent where we are is 16. i can’t explain why but i feel so bothered and uncomfortable. when i think about it too much i start crying. what is wrong with me ?? why do i feel like this?? i have no feelings for bob - that’s not the problem. i can say that with complete certainty. and i’ve never even met bob’s gf so i don’t think she’s the problem either. i feel like i never want to have sex after hearing this. i don’t know why ???",30Oct2019,1

101,"She's really weird and peculiar about things; for example she doesn't like YouTube for some reason. I don't know why , I just can't convince her to watch anything lmao. She claims she has no interests, and it's really hard to get her to open up about things, but when she does, we usually do connect over it. We talk all the time but theres only so much you can talk about every day. Ideas?

102,"So in May I was made redundant from my job and took a few weeks off just to relax and then start hunting. I got a couple of professional freelancing roles but that has dried up. I keep getting to the final two in interviews and not making the final cut. It’s really knocking my confidence at the moment. 

I’m trying to keep busy but for some reason I keep getting sick. When I’m feeling fit I keep active and try to get out and about as well as focus on job hunting. To make a little cash I have a bar job. It’s not ideal but it is what it is. 

My husband hasn’t been much support. He just looks at me with hate and if I’m some sort of failure. I’m trying my hardest but I just can’t seem to get a professional job. Times are tough where I live. Everyone is losing jobs and no one is creating new ones. 

I feel like I can’t talk to my husband as he just stares at me and offers me no support. I feel like he resents me as if this is my own fault. He just tells me what I should do as if it’s an easy fix and just dictates to me. I feel really low. I feel like no matter how hard I try I just find myself in the same place, with no one to turn to. I feel like my husband just thinks about his feelings and not mine.",30Oct2019,1
103,"I'm 18. I mentioned once to her that I smoked weed, because I was worried about my medicine being affected. She never did tell me whether I had anything to worry about with medicine, but she told me that it could be making my anxiety worse and to stop smoking it. She wrote down a bunch of centers that treat addiction for me, and now that I've been off for like a month - she wants me to get drug tested. 

I will admit, for a little while I lost control of my weed usage because I was drowning in depression. But I'm therapy now and working on my anxiety and depression. I want to start smoking again, and I haven't been tested yet because I haven't called to make an appointment. I just don't think it's been an issue for me, and I don't know if I should stop completely or what. I'd definitely set a bunch of rules in place for my use though, like only on weekends.

105,"I am in college and had a class with a girl my age. She laughed the hardest at stuff I say, smiles a lot at me and to stuff I say. She said hi when she saw me ask what's up. We had to do peer reviews and she came to my table sat next to me at my table. She sat between me and a woman Im friends with, talked to her she said something, smiled at me and looked deep into my eyes and didn't stop smiling and it felt awkward, if I didn't break the eye contact she probably would've continued. She was making forced eye contact and scratching her head while resting her head on her hand. One day I sat down waiting for class and sat with a woman I give a lot of attention to in class and she came in for class walked over and started waiting very close to me, hovering over standing in my personal space, she walked right in front of me and started getting close to me and I could smell her but she had her back to me. This was the closest she's been to me. There was a whole room not a lot of other people. When I talked about another girl that likes me that I don't like and asking for advice from a woman I talk to in college to not lead her on. She joined the conversation said that the other girl will continue pushing and I have to ignore all together and tell her I'm not interested. This was the biggest response I got from her and longest convrsation. She started this stuff after I asked for advice, . I told her someone said my hair looks like the clown from it and she said that's not nice. I saw her in the hall one day we stopped seeing each other in class. She saw me and stopped and asked me how my classes were this semester and she had the biggest smile on her face. I ask her stuff and it's like she has a hard time with conversation but has the biggest smile on her face talking to me. I said my advisor would kick me out bc he knows I smoke pot and she says ""awww"" I do get an awkward forced vibe from her. I asked her how her classes were and it went over her head. I crossed paths walking on a small walkway and she didn't look me in the eye was looking down and said hey very softly, unassertively. Most recently we had to go to a lecture in the biggest lecture hall on my campus. I was sitting in a spot in the front and in the middle and she came in saw me and she came in and sat 2 empty seats away from me.",30Oct2019,0
106,"I never expected life to be easy in anyway. I wouldn't want it to be because then life wouldn't have any true meaning, but fuck man.

My childhood was normal, happy, no care in the world (besides the sexual abuse that came back to haunt me later) and 1-12 grade, good as well. It had it's ups and downs, but never too bad or too good. Just okay. Back in 2014 I met a girl who'd I'd end up marrying. We went to church together as children and our relationship grew into something that seemed solid. After 3 years, which were a little rocky but again normal, I got her pregnant and we then got married. This is when things just seemed to never get better.

Wedding day, no smiles, no laughter, pretty much everyone had a poker face. I was very close with my non-immediate family at the time (cousins, aunts, etc) so this broke my heart seeing them not be happy for me. I believe myself to be a compassionate and outgoing person, and always helped my family through troubles however I could.. So it hurt. I blew it off and forgave them. I don't like holding grudges and never spoke about it. After the wedding, I give my family the news that I was going to be a dad. The first in the family to have a kid. I was nervous and excited to let them know I, however, when I told them,  there is no excitement. The first response I received was thats cool. Ouch.

A few months later I had to dropout of college to get a job to support my new family. Couldn't find a job for two months but was eventually able to find a job that was on my degree path. Cool. Even if I couldn't go to school, I could get some experience in what I want to study. Not exactly the case, I ended up getting replaced by the owner's daughter. They wanted me to train her to replace me while I was still working there. Yeah no. So there was again on the job hunt when I came across another job working for Planet Fitness. Wasn't expecting much but after 3 months of work I became the general manager of my own gym. It was pretty good,  I had a good pay, and money  was no longer a huge issue.

At this point I thought to myself that life wasn't going to be as hard anymore and now it's just a matter of progressing forward and getting educated. I was wrong once more.  I noticed my wife was becoming extremely aggressive. It progressed more and more until it became physical abuse. Never in my life did I believe that's something like this would happen. She became abusive to my son and me and felt compelled to work on this. I began to try to speak to my parents-in-law about the issue as I felt comfortable asking them for advice ( they were Christians who seemed very wise and were well off ). Their response to me was to take it as she couldn't hurt me and that eventually it would stop.

Wtf.

It got to a point where I couldn't take it anymore. I filed for divorce in 2018 and fought for my child's custody. Ex-wife proceeded to alienate my child from me, so for 3 months I knew nothing of him.  I filed for child support as soon as I filled for divorce and finally i was able to see my son. Things finally seemed like they were going to turn around as I got out of an abusive relationship and was able to draw with my son. You know what follows.

Found out ex wife was cheating on me for the last year of our marriage. While I was out working to provide for us. She would video call other men and sometimes go out to eat with them, and God knows what else... This was my first ""Fuck man"" moment.  It tore me up, things began clicking in my mind, why she wouldn't go to counseling with me, why there was money missing, why she became distant and aggressive. It sucked. After almost a straight month of sobbing and being depressed, I came to the conclusion that there's nothing I did wrong and I try to make it work and tried to keep the family together. I forgave her but never forgot and let the pain slowly fade away.

I began dating rather quickly. I found myself trying to fill the void that my ex-wife left.  I felt like I needed someone and I didn't want to be alone.  I understand that was a mistake as i didn't fully heal, but i needed a distraction.

 I dated several women and though I had some bad experiences I learned a lot about myself and what I wanted. I stopped looking at negatives as only negative and began educating myself with what occurred.  I ended up finding a girlfriend that loves me like no other and is sincerely one of the kindest Souls I've ever met.

 I was so happy, I had almost every aspect of my life moving and progressing forward. Everything seemed great. Seemed.

This year has been one of the hardest years of my life.  It began with me getting the flu twice a week apart and having to miss work. As I had fevers of 103 and above and worked in the gym, it was common sense that I was not going to go to work and contaminate others. My job agreed with me and this was no issue.  I then came back after my illness to find out I've been fired. The reasoning? Not doing my job while I was sick. They told me though I did not have to go to work I still had it answer the phone and be on top of the facility, go visit, set up schedules, payroll and so on. They also hold me liable for the staff members not cleaning the facility. This was the first time I was absent from work and was never told any of this information.  I was left speechless. I had previously received a message from one of the regional manager stating that he would be taking care of the gym in my absence and showed this to the HR.  Said nothing could be done. I guess it was time to look for a new job.

Three weeks later I was involved in a car accident.  Someone tried running a red light and T-boned my vehicle on the driver's side. I was driving.  I had my son and girlfriend with me at the time and don't remember much of what happened. I remember being pulled out of the vehicle through the passenger side and taken to an ER.  My spine was injured and had some nerve damage. Thankfully my son wasn't hurt and my girlfriend only had some bruises.  I was able to  leave the ER the same day and able to walk though I was in pain. Honestly not that bad for how the car ended up. So I started treatment almost immediately and went to a lawyer to get some medical expenses paid, however left car-less.

A week later while walking around in my home, I noticed a sharp pain in my lower back. The pain began to grow in intensity and ran up my spine. I then proceeded to lay on the ground face down. To see if it would calm down and pass. It didn't. I slowly started losing feeling in my legs and before I know it I couldn't move them.  They were numb and I immediately pissed myself. Great. After 2 weeks in ICU,  I was released on a wheelchair. My ability to walk was gone,  though some movement in my legs was possible,it was if all strength in My legs left.  This two sucked.  with my inability to work and lack of vehicle. I lost my home and moved back in with my parents. Fuck me.  it has since it has since been 5 months of continuous therapy and I've made progress.  I can once again walk but have constant pain and lose all strength in my legs every so often. But still no job. I've put in over 800 applications and nothing has come back. Nothing. I've also tried making my own meal prep company and working out of my house but have had no success.

I don't know what to do, I feel so lost, I've lost so much within the last 2 years.  I've lost my family, I can no longer see my son grow up everyday, I've lost my house my job, my car, my mobility and as of today my mother is hospitalized. Wtf is going on.  why aren't things getting better.  I've always been one to never look at the negatives and try to move forward but this is too much. Today is the first day I cried since I was a child, no joke.  I feel like there's no escape from this fall and i don't understand why it's happening.

How can I get my spirits up? How can I move forward? How can I get a job? How can I pick up this mess that has been made and call it a life once more?  I'm not going to lie and say that I haven't considered ending it myself.. but would never do it because I want to be here for my son.

 what should I do..  because I really don't know anymore.",30Oct2019,2
108,"I never take/took depression lightly and I never thought that what I feel now and have felt is something as severe as someone who is truly depressed. So I’m going to explain my story and please tell me if it’s something more severe than what make myself believe and how to get better. 

I’m 18, and 4 years ago, my friends and my dad noticed a bald spot on my head. Since then for 4 years I became obsessed with checking if I was truly balding and this has caused me to try to conceal my patch every time I’d go out. Everyday id take pictures of my crown and over time I became extremely insecure and I hated when people were behind me because I thought I looked completely bald. This has killed my self confidence and impacted my daily life in numerous ways. I stopped sitting down in front of people, I hated to turn the lights on in my room, I hated to look at myself in the mirror. Now luckily, I’ve come to realize after 4 years of daily checks that it was a cowlick all along after shaving my head. It’s fairly small but I was just never able to be objective with it. 

But even now that I understand that it’s normal, I still hate going to public places, I still worry about my hair every hour of the day and all the habit that grew up on me and all this worrying is still stuck with me. I still think that when my hair grows back longer, the bald spot will reappear or something. I stopped gymming, I stopped taking care of myself, I’m too worried to clean my room, I’m causing my mom so much trouble around the house because instead of doing chores, I’m just worried about my hair. This obsession is killing my life and after knowing with 90% certainty that it’s only a cowlick, this heartache and constant worrying that I’ve carried for the past 4 years won’t leave me behind and I behave the same way as I always have.

109,"A few months ago a coworker was very obviously flirting with me when we were both drunk. Nothing happened (even though I was interested, just didn’t want to be unprofessional). Since then, we’ve hung out a few times when we were drinking and are slightly flirty but nothing too crazy. At work, we don’t often speak to each other (our jobs don’t have anything to do with each other) and it does seem awkward when we do lightly talk. I thought perhaps he was interested but with how he treats me at work, I’m starting to think I read into it wrong. 

Thing is, I’m interested and I’m not sure what to do here. In any other circumstance, I’d just ask them but since we work together I know I need to tread very lightly to not cause any awkwardness.

112,"Ok so my husband is a year younger than me. He graduated with this girl (we'll call her Kaitlyn). He tried forever to be friends with her all through highschool and then she went and got stoner friends and a lame boyfriend and thats when my husband and I started dating. As soon as we started dating, wouldn't you know, she got all jealous and upset that he wasn't talking to her anymore. So when they graduated she was like ""so are we going to be friends after this.?"" And husband shrugged and said ""probably not"" and that pissed her off. She showed up at his grad party unannounced and uninvited and started flirting with his older brother, hoping it would make husband jealous. Next thing you know Kaitlyn and oldest brother (James) are in an on and off yet somehow committed relationship. They are both huuuge drama queens. If anyone says or jokes about *anything* that could in some way cause offense towards them, they flip shit. Like imagine that story about the girl who flipped out and got offended by seeing a rotten banana peel in a tree and called it racist. That's how ridiculous these two are as a couple. 

So anyway Kaitlyn is very competitive. And she saw me as obvious competition. It became all about who would get engaged first, married first, have kids first, etc. Of course I ""beat"" her in every category. And then my first child was a boy and she wanted a boy and ended up having a girl. So that upset her for a big while. 

Now I'm about to have my third kid and it's a girl and I have a beautiful name that I want for her but it sounds similar to Kaitlyn's daughter's name. Her daughter is Lorelei and I wanted to name my girl Lauralynne. How badly do you think this would cause problems.?",30Oct2019,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

121,"Hello everyone this might be a lengthy read so thank you for taking the time out of your day to help or even just read this post. Anyways here’s what’s going on.

My girlfriend of 3 years (23) and myself (23) have been on a break for about a week. The reason for the break was because I made her life very stressful. Which is true I did. I wasn’t the best boyfriend I could be but the reason for it was I was just so overly stressed out. 

In the 3 years we have been together we have moved to 2 different states, I have gone through 5 jobs, dropped out of school because of financial reasons and moving again, back at my parents house my grandma has cancer and is on her death bed and I can’t do anything about it, I’m low on cash and have debt, and just lots of other things. There has been just so much going on that it has stressed me out a ton these last couple months.

I realized I wasn’t doing things right and I took time to write out an apology for her and told her the things I was sorry about. I told her that I’m going to work on changing. That same day I started doing things differently trying to forget about all the stresses. Then 2 days later she tells me she wants a break. She needs time to think if she wants to be with me and she says she wants to experience other things. 

So I am now sleeping in our other bedroom, our office couch and have been for the last week. She has been doing her own thing and I have been doing mine. She’s going out all the time now with these friends she made like 3 weeks ago. 

I’ve taken this time to think of if I wanted to be with her. I hate saying it but I don’t think so. Which sucks because last month I bought an engagement ring and planned on purposing next month. In any case I looked back at our relationship and a lot of it has been arguing and unhappiness. We have had good times but ever since moving and getting in to debt things haven’t been great. 

We kept telling ourselves when we move here we will be happy. When we make this amount of money we will be happy. When we get engaged we will be happy. And have said this about other things. I don’t think we are going to be happy no matter what we do. 

It sucks because I left everything behind back in my home state for her. This last week I haven’t done anything really because for one I don’t have friends here. I’m waiting for my job to start on the 11th hopefully before then. And I just am not sure what to do anymore. 

I just don’t know what my next steps are. I don’t know what we are going to do because I’m probably going to be breaking up with her. However, we live together and have a lease until next October.  

If you have any questions or want more details let me know but any advice would be really helpful.",30Oct2019,1

I want to become a registrar or .io domain names. I want direct EPP access to the central registry (NOT API). Prior to June 2017, this was easily available if you paid a one-time fee of 300 GBP and applied on the [nic.io](https://nic.io) website. [Nic.io](https://Nic.io) was the central registry of .io domain names.

After June 2017, [nic.io](https://nic.io) (and the parent company ICB) was acquired by Affilias. After its acquisition by Affilias, you now need to be an ICANN-accredited registrar in order to get direct EPP access, which includes yearly fees of $3000 and a bunch of other requirements. Registrars accredited before June 2017. still follow the old rules, with no yearly fees and their central registry has been shifted to 101domain.com

&amp;#x200B;

I've been looking for ways on how to achieve my goal for quite some time now. I found this link, which proved to be most helpful:

 [https://web.archive.org/web/20140625050225/http://www.nic.io/registrars.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625050225/http://www.nic.io/registrars.html) 

&amp;#x200B;

This listed all the .io registrars up to June 2017. My idea was to research every single one of these, find ones that are not used and ask the owners to buy. I only found 3 with such requirements (that I know of). Only one responded and shot down my offer, even tho he had no clue he was an .io registrar. He applied just for the .ac TLD, another one which [nic.io/nic.ac](https://nic.io/nic.ac) was an owner of.

&amp;#x200B;

The two others, although I've found their personal mails and phones never responded in any way. As far as I am able to tell, all of the others are used in some way or have merged with other companies.

This is probably a desperate request as the chances of this working by now are minuscule, but if someone has an idea, I would be very happy to hear it. Thanks.",30Oct2019,1

131,"There's a girl I'm talking to who has significantly expressed her interest in me. In other words, she said she thinks I'm ""hot as fuck"" and is a great texter, but tonight we had our first phone call and when she's on the phone she gives nothing but one word answers, the majority of them being the word ""okay"". I've asked her questions and told her to tell me about herself and she gave very basic answers, literally saying ""I'm right handed"" and ""my favorite color is orange"" followed by me asking ""anything else?"" to which she responds ""there's really not much to say"".

So in short, there's no way to keep a conversation going with this girl. I have to do all of the talking, which sucks because when it comes to me and having to do all the talking I begin saying some dumb shit and potentially making a fool out of myself because of how desperate I am for there not to be awkward silences.

But if anybody here has any ideas as to how I can get a person like this to talk/open up more, that would be great. I'm a very easy person to talk to but she just refuses to, well, talk.

132,"Okay, so, as the title says I'm at a point in my life where I'm completely starting over. This might get long and multifaceted (and I've had a couple beers so it might get a bit...emotional) so sit down, buckle up, and enjoy the ride motherfuckers.  I was in a long term relationship with a girl I met in my junior year of high school. We were together for 6 years, living together, and pretty much making it work. She was my team mate, my life partner, and someone that I thought I could spend the rest of my life with. However, as we all do, she had some demons. She was dealing with pretty severe alcoholism and a mental illness that changed her completely from the person I fell in love with years ago. We broke up about 3 months ago. 

Dealing with her mental health issues and substance abuse has changed me to my core. I became the primary breadwinner for a time, in addition to doing most or all of the housework, the cooking, and the yard work. This lead to a major decrease in my social life and loss of aspirations. I really can't remember who I was before her and I don't know who I am today. I feel like a stranger living my own life. 

In college, I studied pre-med biology and had always planned on going to medical school. Due to my own mental health issues, I dropped out of school and have done a variety of odd jobs and a few potential career paths since leaving school about 3 years ago. I have lost all sense of direction and purpose in my life. I don't know what I want to do or what I would even be good at. 

About 2 months ago, my parents moved to Colorado. I have been living totally independent and on my own pretty much since I was 17, but with the breakup I lost my place to live, so I made the decision to move from Washington state into my parents basement until I can get back on my feet. So I've lost what few friends I still had left there, I'm single for the first time in my life, and I have no job or sense of direction on where to go with that. I want to go back to school but like I said I'm so lost and overwhelmed right now. 

So, with all that being said I need quite a variety of advice. If you were in my shoes, where would you begin to get back to feeling like yourself again? And how would you go about finding a passion for something? And cherry on top, how can I stop feeling so fucking pathetic?

He was an awesome friend. We never really had many arguments. I remember calling his house when we were in middle school on his “home phone” because neither of us had cellphones yet. I got to know his family really well. I knew a lot about his childhood and he confided in me that his dad left him when he was two. He always had a picture of his dad in his book bag growing up. All of this to say, we both knew so much about each other. 
There was a time in high school when I told him I had always had some feelings for him (major crush for years) which he told me he also had feelings for me but wouldn’t want to ruin the dynamic of our friendship. I agreed. We dated other people but remained friends, however we never were as close after that. After graduating, he started dating someone, moved, got a new number, and no longer uses social media. I could probably contact him through his girlfriend (who he is still with) but I don’t want to be weird and just pop up and tell her I want to talk to him. I’m married with a child. I went to high-school with his girlfriend and my husband, and my husband knows both of them well. He says I should try to talk to him, but I don’t know. I feel like if some girl contacted me after years of not talking to my husband I would be really pissed and feel disrespected, no matter how close they were.

146,"I’m a freshman biology student and in my lab class this big scientific paper has been due on a research project. The teacher made it clear that although we are covering the same topic, save for our hypothesis and a few literary articles, our papers should be different.

Last night I sent my paper to my research group so we could correct grammar and read them over (another girl did too). This morning when I get to class the third girl in the group (J, who is a junior) was going on and on about how similar her and my papers were, and how she couldn’t believe we had the same quotes, and that her paper was a complete “mixture” of mine and the other girl’s.

I thought it was weird and asked to see her paper- and she had copy and pasted huge chunks of my work into her paper, including where I had summarized the articles in my own words and did in-text citations. I got upset and told J that she copied my paper, and she said she “only copied the quotes”.
I told her that I had put the quotes into my own words with citations, and when I flipped the page she had taken the whole first part of the second chunk of my essay. I told her she literally copy and pasted MY words, and she said she didn’t and was playing it off like it wasn’t that big of a deal.

I talked to the other girl in our group and she didn’t seem to think it was a big deal either, because J said when she submits it online (through turnitin, a plagiarism checking site) that she would change it, but I doubt she will, and I still don’t know how similar our work will be.

Today in class was a peer review day so our papers were passed around and graded. I’m friends with the girl who graded J’s paper, and before I even told her what had happened she said the paper seemed like it had been copied, plus there was no works cited page.

Halfway through class I stepped out and called my mom because I was panicking: plagiarizing is serious and the teacher really likes J, she’s had her for multiple other classes. My mom said I should just wait until the teacher notices the similarities in the papers, and that it’s obvious that my work is my own, and that I don’t want to look like a tattle tale. But I want to go to her office hours tomorrow and explain what happened.

This teacher takes plagiarism really seriously, and I don’t want to sound whiny or childish when I’m talking to her about this. Even though I confronted J about it I’m still really upset, and the teacher will see our papers soon when she checks the peer review.

I put hours and hours into this paper and Im really proud of it- What should I do, and if I talk to the teacher, what should I say that sounds professional and concerned?",30Oct2019,2

148," 

A while back, my friend and I went looking for advice on my situation. We got no answers from anyone.. Bellow is his post from his perspective.

Hello,

One of my best friend for the past 3-4 years is one I have never met in person; We met online through similar interests in animation, and now we talk almost every day through discord. We are the same age (19), and although we have never met in person, we've helped each other in numerous life advice situations and hope someday things will be better for the both of us.

Recently we came to a disagreement on his situation. For this we'll call him ""V"" for ease of grammar;  
V and I were chatting through Discord direct messaging and he informed me that his parents were causing issues again. You see, V has been in a wheelchair for most of his life, with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) there are very few things at this point he is able to do on his own. He has a large, lower class family, but most of them are too caught up in their own tasks to help him with even the most mundane things. Oftentimes he's wearing an adult diaper, because his parents don't feel like stopping to help him go to the bathroom so it's easier to just do it on his own and have them take care of it ""when the time is convenient for them."" I keep telling him that the kind of shaming it sounds to me like they're putting him through is very wrong, and despite how he says his family are good people, sometimes I have a hard time agreeing.

SO this one day he got up and told them he wanted to wear a diaper for the day, and apparently they told him he ""needed to make a bowel movement or they would be pissed."" Less than an hour later he did, and called to his step-dad.

SD: already?!

V : yep

SD: If you were going to do it that soon you should of stayed in your bed

Seemingly small things like this have been building up; V's parents' double-standards and remarks putting him down about things he has no control over. This time V was making a lot of remarks about suicide and not being able to handle what they put him through. I've called around multiple times trying to get suggestions on what I can do to help, however I live in New England, and V lives in Texas; we've got different state governments and there's not much physically I can do to help.

V's dream is to start his own animation business; He dropped out of college and wanted to use what money he had saved up for online, more direct education in 3D animation, however his parents are using his benefits to pay off bills instead. V wants to get an online job working a basic animation position wherever he can find one to get more money in, however ha doesn't have control over his bank account and his parent's don't want him to get a job, as it reduces his benefits.  
(Sorry I don't have all the details on how it all works)

This all boils down to V, being 19, needing to get out of this household. He's approved and scheduled for starting spinraza, a developing medicine to help rebuild muscle, so this likely will not happen for a while, however this specific debate happened before he was scheduled, and may come up again depending on how his parents treat him in upcoming months or even after the spinraza.

I sent V my contact information on multiple platforms and told him that things like this would continue and only make his position with the family worse if he continued to not act. Note: He doesn't want to act against his family, because it will in turn change how they treat him when it comes to showering, rolling him over in bed, bathrooming, etc. So I told him that I was done hearing his suicidal remarks because they were scaring me and I needed to feel comfortable he was safe. Here's how the conversation went:

Me: I'm probably going to call the police on your family, put out a request of caution I am in fear for your safety they could likely get you out of the household and somewhere with better help for you

V: I want to be the one to deal with this i don't need you to do this ... the police will put me in a retirement center

Me: if It's serious enough for you to be considering taking your own life something needs to be done you'll have more help there than in your own family household

V: i've done that for years i'll be fine

Me: It's getting worse

V: just let me deal with it

Me: I don't know if I can let you put yourself through this, you're not safe there

He convinced me not to, for that occasion, however the argument still stands. If it comes to it, should I make the call, or should I let him try to figure it out as things have a potential for escalating every day? He thinks he can handle it, but I think he would be safer out of the house until he can find a better living option somewhere else.

149,"I work for a private mental health care organization in an Adult Foster Care division, and I have worked here for almost a year and there have been a few things that look and feel like red flags here.

The first of which that directly relates to my position is the fact that beds at the facility that I work at are not being filled, and it has been over 6 months. Speaking to more senior staff I've heard that beds are usually filled in a couple of months tops, and that isn't the only open bed either; there are 2 others that are vacant. They are using these open beds as a reason have 2 morning staff rather than 3 or 2 afternoon staff instead of 3.

Another thing that appears odd to me is the fact that they mentioned that getting pizza was too expensive at department meetings (which there are two of that happen 6 times a year). So they wanted something healthier and cheaper and hinted that they wanted employees to try and foot the bill.

With these two, it could be brushed off as them being cheap, but on a more serious note they have been cutting things on extremely short notice, as in they make announcements a week or two before pretty serious changes. One thing they did was get rid of a day program that residents could attend citing a 'free-rider problem'. This announcement was made to the families of residents 3 weeks prior, and it was made to staff only 2 weeks prior. Very short notice. We also had a manager put in a 5 day notice, which was insane. The biggest red flag however comes from the closure of a 40-bed locked unit that only had 16 patients. This announcement was made 2 weeks before its closure. The other thing that my organization has done is move case managing back to a state agency even though it was originally done in house. These are the 3 most concerning.

151,"This sounds so weird and I have a lot of problems, so this is probably another one. I’ve noticed when I don’t have a man in my life, not a boyfriend necessarily just a trustworthy guy, I don’t feel safe. I believe it’s due to the fact that I’ve been abused and don’t think women can live alone peacefully AND that I become really depressed with out physical intimacy. I don’t need them to have romantic feelings for me, but I do need to feel comfortable with them. 

I’ve been told I need to learn how to be alone. I’ve been alone for a long time, I just recently started dating when I turned 20, I’m 22. I was in two relationships the past two years. One was 6 months, about a month and half later I started sleeping with my most recent ex who became my boyfriend months later down the line. Our relationship lasted about a year. He was just supposed to be a rebound but I still care for him a lot. 

My desire for physical connection could be completely platonic, but unfortunately not many guys go for that. It’s not about them loving me, it’s about the comfort of them rubbing my back, their warm ness, the fact that I know if someone breaks in I have help, nothing put me at ease more than that.

I don’t know what path I should take for my future. My husband says he will support me as long as I’m happy. I want to have more kids but I also want a career. I got my CNA license  back in 2014 and absolutely loved my job but stopped working once I was pregnant. I know trying to conceive will take me some time as I have some fertility issues. My daughter is already 4 and we did want to be done having kids by 30. My husband is a veteran and I get benefits to go to school and if I went the Associate degree in nursing route I would have 36 months of benefits but I do have until 2037 to use them. 
So I feel like my paths can go in these ways

1. Go to the community college in the spring January 2020 and start the pre-reqs for an associate in nursing and focus on school and get my daughter a pet.  Most likely not have any more kids. 
2. Stay at home and focus on staying healthy to grow our family and start fertility medications. Worry about going to school once all our kids are in elementary school. We are blessed to where I do not need to work and live comfortably. 
3. Just dedicate my life to my husband and kids and forever be a stay at home mom. This is what my mom did her whole life and was always happy.  If you had the opportunity to be a stay at home mom for the rest of your life would you do it?

154," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me.

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

We’ve temporarily broken up before and I was able to move back to live at my mom’s place when that happened, but 4 months ago my mom moved nearly 2 hours away to the countryside, and so I permanently moved into my ex’s parents, as I have two jobs in the area and go to a therapy program 3 times a week. 

With me bringing all my furniture and clothes and getting my address changed to that house, I imagined there was an unspoken understanding that, if we broke up (again), it would be an extremely uncomfortable but necessary thing to endure living together anyway for a bit. Last week during their weekly therapy session, my ex decided they shouldn’t be in a relationship or have me specifically be around until they fix their boundary issues (which ARE extremely unhealthy), and cut it off with me that same day, telling me I had a week to get out. I said I had nowhere to go and that I would only want to stay until I had saved enough to rent a place somewhere, and their response was “go to your moms” and “it’d be unhealthy for me to make this my problem” (which IS extremely true), and that’s been their mantra since. (also, we had not explicitly talked about the unspoken rule so they weren’t on the same page. my bad!) 

Neither of us had been paying rent, and neither of us have money saved, so I can’t get a new place and us living there was just an extreme kindness from their parents anyway. The parents haven’t had an opinion because I was so quick to accept that I had to leave, and I imagine bringing them into it would make it messier. I don’t want to move 2 hours away from my entire life and have to start over, so I’m living in my car for now. By no means do I want to get back together, this occurrence has given me the perspective on how unhealthy we were, I just want to sleep in a bed. In their words, I hadn’t done anything wrong, they just personally can’t handle a relationship at the moment. I can’t tell if I have a skewed perspective or if this really is a dick move on their part. 

I have my own issues with knowing what boundaries I can set and being assertive, so I’m wondering if I should have been more stern about wanting to stay? Would it be freaky or controlling of me to demand to stay? Is housing enough of a necessity to justify knowingly making them uncomfortable? Do they deserve their space, or do I deserve my home? Do I just have to deal with the reality of starting my life over somewhere new and/or having 4 hour round trip commutes?",30Oct2019,2

159,"So a couple months ago, I asked a guy who is friends with this male friend that I have if he could help me with my college chemistry class and he said yes. 


One time we were kind of flirting and I jokingly kissed him on the cheek. He smiled and chuckled. Another time we were flirting again and I put my hand on top of his and he held it. We just kind of awkwardly kept looking at each other and chuckling. He seemed nervous and was biting his lip; he acted like he wanted to do or say something but didn't know if he should. I really wanted to kiss him but I didn't know if he wanted to kiss so I decided not to do it. 

I have kissed guys before but they always kissed me first. 

He has told me before that he likes to go hiking on trails and stuff. I remembered that there is the national park with a hiking trail and I asked him if he wants to go with me and he said yes. 


I have only been on one official date and it was so uncomfortable for me. It's like I am happy and want to go until the day comes and then I don't want to go. 


I want to hangout with him but now I am becoming a nervous wreck and don't want to go- even though I do enjoy spending time with him. Tbh I don't even really care about the hiking thing, I just want to hangout and make-out with him. 


He gets off of work in like two hours and then we are going to go meet at the park. 


Tl;dr- I want to hangout with this guy but now I am too nervous to go hangout with him. What should I do?",30Oct2019,1
160,"I just started college and met him (23M) on the first week of school. We clicked instantly and I thought I was so lucky that he walked right into my life. Everything aligned - our interests, life goals, personal values, etc. He had a girlfriend then so I never took any action. But we were inseparable in school and we were best friends. I tried my best to see him as only a friend, because this connection was valuable to me and I didn’t wanna lose it just because he couldn’t be my forever partner. Of course my feelings only grew, and the pain eventually got unbearable.

A month or so into college, he started finding flaws in his girlfriend. This was where the delusional me kicked in, always imagining a future of me and him together.  He soon initiated a break up with his girlfriend, and I supported him throughout his heartbreak to the best of my abilities. I thought he would finally see me, or at least see how valuable I could be in his life. 

Months have passed since then, my one-sided love for him has only been growing, despite numerous events that have broken my heart. From time to time, he would feel lonely and would meet/have make up sex with his ex. And then he would come running to me about how much he regrets it and that he would stop. Recently, all he talks about is how empty he feels without her in his life and how afraid he is of losing someone as perfect as she is forever. I try my best to keep a strong front, but I have a breakdown inside every time he tells me these things because they’re such concrete reality checks that he is crazily in love with her, not me.


Admittedly, he’s a good looking guy with ambition, making him someone with high expectations eg attractiveness of a girl. I am in no way a good looking girl, I have never won the likes of men nor do I feel confident in my body. So I spend every waking moment thinking about him and how I’m not enough. This is starting to affect my work and my general happiness (because I spend almost every day crying). I have also found myself doing stupid things eg disregard other friendships/my own well-being to jump at any chance to be alone with him. This has given me so many opportunities to fall into the loop of self-pity, making me not want to do anything with my life other than to be together with him. 

I know the right thing to do is to move on. Stop thinking I could ever have a future with him, and move on. I want to find someone else to devote my emotions to, but my entire social circle is him and I’m too self-conscious to put myself out there. I want to fix my low self-esteem by working out and losing weight, but it’s just been making me miserable cause all I think about is how much I hate my unattractive body. I want to focus on my own life and do my own thing instead of living my life centred around him, but everything I do in school now has him in it because of how inseparable we are. Confessing would be an efficient method to put distance between us (because he would prob give me space), but I am not ready to let my pride go knowing how it ends. 

This attachment has been largely fuelled by my fantasies that he may have feelings for me or the fact that all my friends my age are in happy relationships and I’m not. I have been trying my best to think of a healthy way out of this, but I’m truly lost. I also always find excuses for myself even though action plans seem pretty clear.

Please change my mindset and get me out of this shit. What do I do?",30Oct2019,2

163,"I went to buy the iPad Pro with a folio and pencil. I price matched as a fee different stores and ended up being able to get a decent discount.

I clearly asked him if I would be able to return the folio keyboard if I decided I didn’t like it. So the next day I did go back to get another style folio and they are saying I owe them money if I want to do that because I got a bundle deal through Apple which I obviously didn’t want. 
  I assume he didn’t know what he was doing because now I can’t exchange the keyboard w/o paying the difference between the Apple bundle deal and original price of folio.

173,"So I [F,23] went on a date with this guy [M,27] I met off the dating app Hinge. We chatted for a day before I gave him my number. The conversation has been nothing but great from the start. Actual conversation not, “so you’re hot send me nudes” hookup culture bullshit. We even had a conversation about hookup culture and we both are on the same page that’s it’s quite ridiculous. 

He asked if he could take me out on a date last Friday and I agreed. He lives about an hour away from me and I like the food more in his area so I decided to drive there. He took me out to sushi as we discussed that’s one of my favorite things. As soon as we got in the car the conversation flowed effortlessly. It didn’t stop all night. We are and he picked up the $70 bill (which I thought was reaalllllyyy nice). He asked if I wanted to get a drink at this corner brewery in downtown and I agreed. We ended up going upstairs of this bar and watching baseball for about an hour. Conversation still flowing. He then asked me if I wanted to go back to his house, but not in a douchey demeaning way. I agreed.

We went back to his house and he was showing me around and what not. We ended up having sex (which I don’t think having sex on the first date is taboo. If the attraction is there it’s there. But I don’t make a habit of sleeping with random men and am definitely not into one night stands.) He was nice about everything. 

He walked me out and before I went out the door he said, “I hope you make time for me in the future.” And gave me a kiss goodbye. I said I would. 

It’s been 2 days since I’ve heard from him but he was also with his friends and family all weekend for a celebration of some sorts.

177,"I am 28, no kids, no husband, only my dog. I got an amazing job offer (making over four times what I do now) in another state. I can't let it go and will accept it tomorrow and move within the month.

I have had my grandma live with me for the past three years. I lived with her for five, but I was paying the majority of bills then, as well as now and taking care of the housework.

I love my grandma, please don't get me wrong, but we are opposites. She talks while I am the silent type. She doesn't listen and constantly interrupts me, while I am forced to listen to everything she says. We're both hardheaded and I have trouble dealing with strong internal emotions, which causes me to lash out (not too bad) every once in awhile. She constantly treats me like a child and spreads my business to everyone, even after I've asked her not to. My whole family knows about my new job because of her, so that took the joy out of me telling who I chose to tell.

She has a lot of health issues and is a serious downer because all she does is complain and it makes me angry (I have to hear it all of the time) and sad (I can't do anything about it). I don't even enjoy being at home because I don't feel I can actually relax.

She has always had someone else taking care of her and I have always taken care of someone else since I got my first job at 15.

I feel like I am being completely selfish for leaving because it will force her to take care of herself, kind of like a sink or swim situation and I don't know if I like that. Her children won't take her in for various reasons, one of them has already taken care of her and dealt with the same things I did, years before I started living with her and won't do it again.

She lives on SSI and a lot of it goes to her car that one sibling told her he would pay for and never did. I advised her not to get that car at the time because I knew the sibling wouldn't put a dime towards it. She doesn't have the funds to live on her own because senior housing is outrageously expensive (which is fucked up imo). 

My mom is supportive and has encouraged me to live on my own and allow myself to be an actual adult. Today, she asked me to ask my grandma if she wanted to move with me. 

I don't know what to do. I want to be by myself, but I feel like I'm being completely selfish and in the wrong for basically being like ""ok, you've got three weeks, find somewhere else to go."" She knew I was interviewing for out of state jobs for the past two months, so it's not like this is a surprise.

I know this is just the internet, but I feel so conflicted about this, so why not ask people from different walks of life.

186,"So little context, when I was 17-20 I did pretty well with women in terms of many hookups, or at least many more than my friends and others I knew. Then mental illness, drug addiction and weight gain hit and basically I haven't kissed a girl since I was 21ish, and even that was a bad experience (despite her being very attractive). I don't really miss literally making out with women at all, but I feel this need to experience  sex  with at least a few women for my self esteem.

I think there might be some sort of opportunity to date a girl I know, but I am reluctant to it because I think it could be quite a long term thing and I have this need to hook up with at least a few women before I commit to someone, so that I am generally desirable.

I have about 12-14kg to lose before I'm back to  my weight when I was hooking up semi-regularly with women, but I'm confident I can do it in the next 3-6 months because my mental  health is getting pretty good and I'm finally experiencing regular feeling of genuine happiness again.

Anyway, I don't want to throw away any opportunities with this girl I may  be able to date because I think things  could go really well with her, but I want to feel desired by multiple women such that I know I am desirable once again. It's not this need to sleep with 100 women, but more this feeling that I need to sleep with at least a few so that I can feel genuinely desirable once again. 

I'm not sure if this  attitude is healthy, but I feel like because it was such  a self esteem booster when I was 17/18 especially that I feel this need to do it again to validate myself. I just don't  want to see myself as this overweight guy thats dating a hot chick that could do better if she wanted to. I want to feel desired by women in general, then commit to one particular girl. I feel like if I were to date a hot girl long term, it would just be a bit of a cop out, and be this reflection of her having low self esteem and dating a guy that she could do better than.

I’m a freshman in college, and at the beginning of the year things were fine, but recently I’ve just stopped caring.  I can’t do work, I can’t take care of myself, I keep procrastinating and end up just not doing the assignment.  It’s so frustrating that I’m ruining my future, but I just can’t care enough to do something.  Any work I get I just avoid thinking about, I can’t focus and motivate myself at all.  I just play video games and forget the problem even exists until later.  

At this point I’ve given up on trying, I can’t see myself succeeding when I can’t even do the simplest of assignments.  I have so much work overdue, and I have no motivation to fix this problem.  The only reason I haven’t given up completely is my family.  I don’t want to worry them, I’ve been enough of a burden already.  But I’m too lazy to ever succeed, and my parents should focus their efforts on my sister, rather than wasting money on me.  There’s no way I could convince my parents that though, and I don’t know what to do.

I’m terrified I’m going to give up completely.  I don’t want to hurt my family, but I’m starting to feel like there’s no other way out.

The table is super heavy and denting our wooden floors, our dog has scratched a couple times and putting hot/cold items on it is leaving white spots/rings. We both don’t like needing to be super careful with it and want it gone, the issue is... The table is an expensive designer wooden table. Probably worth around 20k when bought back then. It was given to us 2 years ago when we moved in to our house by my parents, the table was given to my mom when her mom (my grandma) passed away and probably has been in the family for over 40 years.

She mentioned going out a lot and spending $40-60 on bar tabs because she gets lonely at home and I was trying to be empathetic to that. 

She mentioned she wanted to “keep up with me” and if I ever needed to talk about anything I could do so with her. I felt kind of bad, or just weird about this whole ordeal, and ended up giving her my LinkedIn info. I regretted it pretty quickly. Shortly after connecting she sent me a message stating she wants to get our dogs together soon and hang out. I don’t have interest in this for several reasons... there’s no romantic element, she struck me as rather cynical and like a “I’d like to talk to the manager” type. She’s far older than me. It’s just not practical on really any level. I can only say I sort of felt bad for her and gave out my LinkedIn info, and definitely didn’t expect a “let’s get our dogs together and hang out” type message.

This person strikes me as lonely, but also cynical / critical. I just don’t see a connection beyond this random bar encounter. My gut says ignore, but I work in the area she was hanging out at and I’m now panicking internally about a run-in with her and the “You ignored my message” bit. 

How should I handle this? Just ignore?",30Oct2019,1
196,"i (21F) have identified as bisexual since i was 15
however now i've been thinking about how i recently fell in love with a guy friend

all the serious crushes i've had have been men and i've had sex with lots of men but NEVER a woman

when i think of women i think they're beautiful but i don't think i would have sex with one (ive kissed and dry humped women) i also don't see myself marrying one, but with guys it's no problem

There are going to be more tests that I have to go through and I’m terrified. I know it isn’t set in stone yet, but I’ve been pretty shaken up... I haven’t really told anybody in my life about all of this. I just keep saying that my appointments are for things like digestive issues (which I guess isn’t a 100% lie lol) If I end up being diagnosed, how do I tell my loved ones?

198,"Alright, so, my predicament is that I don’t really have any feelings for anyone. I sorta care for my family, but when they’re going through a hard time, I honestly can’t empathize with them. I feel like a POS because the only thing I really feel is “they provide for me, I’m thankful” and that kinda thing.

I also have a girlfriend of around 2 months. It’s honestly a one sided relationship and I’m not sure how to express that. I’ve been trying to feel something for her, but it’s come up empty. How can I express this to her? I feel like she’ll spiral if I break up with her (she just moved 5 hours away from everyone she’s friends with and  that has had a bad effect on her) so I’m afraid of breaking up with her.


On to the topic of my friends. I make friends pretty easily. I am friends with the people I want to be friends with, nobody else. The problem is that (not counting one friend) I don’t really have a problem with “losing” these friends. And I feel like that’s because I’m nobodies “best” friend. Like, nobody would “choose” to be around me if they had a choice between me and another friend of theirs. And while it kinda hurts realizing that, I feel like that’s because I haven’t found the “right” friends.


I’m explaining all of this terribly, but I don’t know how to word it better. 

My question is: is this just “in my head?” Like, do I HAVE these feelings, but just don’t realize it? Or is there something “wrong” with me? Is this some “condition?”

 (I don’t mean like *seriously* wrong but more “do I just have a problem/deficiency in this area”)",30Oct2019,1
199," 

I seriously think her life may be in danger. My girlfriend and I have been dating for the past 3 months, we've know each other for roughly 6. Recently an old ex of her's has gotten out of prison. Yes. F'ing prison... He's been contacting her through Instagram and snapchats (we have proof), creating profile after profile. Somehow calling her with different numbers. She blocks every single one. This man is an alcoholic brute, twice my size, and I'm not quite sure what he went to prison for (I never bothered to ask).

After, apparently, he called her drunk out of his mind, basically telling her he's still in love with her and that IF she doesn't say it back or if she hangs up he'll come to her apartment. She's told him bullshit, that he has no idea where she lives. This dude read her address out, and after that he forced her to... (Goddamnit it was so weird), say things back to him. Like, I miss you or I still love you, and to mean the things she was saying to him. It was... really fucking weird. Nothing rapey, just weird shit like that. She's the only one that told me about this. Hasn't told her parent or roommates because she doesn't wanna freak anyone out.

Right now. He has a warrant for his arrest, he walked out on probation. The maximum sentence he can have is 5 years. However, that is only the maximum sentence, we would have no idea how long or short his sentence will be other than around 1 - 5 years. And I highly doubt a retraining order is going to stop him.

She's usually home by her self, she has roommates, and I suggested buying a gun although she's never used one before. I have, but I don't own one.

201,"I’m sorry if this is long or confusing but it’s late and I’m tired. One of my friends works in an office within the same building as me, and she/her office is hosting a potluck lunch in 2 days. We’ve been friends for just over a year since she first started working here. I see her and talk to her regularly. I told her about a week and a half ago that I would attend, and help her set up prior to the lunch. 

Now, I just got back to work today after being on vacation for a little over a week. I find out that my office is doing a goodbye lunch for one of our employees moving to a different office in a different city. The lunch is, you guessed it, in 2 days at the exact same time as my friend’s potluck. So, I’m unable to go to both events. If I skip the potluck, I can still help my friend set up prior to the event.

I’d like to honour my commitment to my friend with the potluck lunch, but.....the employee leaving has also been here for a year and her and I have lunch together fairly regularly with a couple other people.

203,"So as a background, my mother is very cautious about medicine and doctors/etc.. When my brother was a little kid he took this allergy test at the doctor's office and they apparently said he had all of them (which was like 20+ I'm pretty sure). My mother decided this was proof doctors are full of shit and would not let me take this test. My brother was always ""faking"" illness as a kid and was so ""picky"" he ""pretended"" that certain foods made him sick. My mom also always tries to talk me out of taking my medicine, and says stuff like my doctors are over prescribing me out of greed and don't actually care if it makes me sick.
My mom tells me I have no allergies except for my allergy to cats, which she says is legit because I almost died because of it as a baby. But some foods give me weird feelings in my face that are similar to when cats get too close. It's a weird tingling sensation in my mouth and also this odd feeling like I've lost control of my eyes, like they keep crossing and I can't help it. But I don't even know the common ingredient in the foods -- it's cheeseburgers and kit Kat bars, and some other candy bars I can't remember. The candy bars don't make my eyes feel funny, but they make my throat feel dry and weird.

     So I got close with this one girl I met online about a year and a half ago and after not talking much at first we got really really close and started talking and playing online all the time. I know she suffers from depression and anxiety really bad so us talking all the time was really helpful both ways. Like we clicked extremely well like neither one of us had done before. She lives with her ex since neither of them could live on their own with how much they make

    Anyways I went to visit for awhile since I saved up the money for awhile and when I first got there it was great. Anyways later on we smoked and she had a horrible panic attack which made me uncomfortable and I had ended up leaving since no one was talking and we all wanted space. Anyways she ended up getting extremely angry over something so little (I offered her a benzo since she was having a horrible panic attack)  and just randomly stopped talking to me and basically I had to ride out the next 4 or so days in my hotel room before I could fly back home

    So I gave her space (shes had a couple times where shes gotten really upset over tiny things that don't make sense to get upset over and not talk for 3 or 4 days)

    Anyways it's been over 10 days since we stopped talking and it's really sucked not talking. But she keeps viewing my snapchat stories even though she didn't respond to my text (I just asked her to do a quick thing for me)

She was in the kitchenette and quipped, ""Oh but K-cups are sooooo easy to recycle!"" Her idea of easily recycling K-cups were to simply toss them in the recycle bin. So I responded, ""Yes, it's easy for us to toss in the blue bin, but in practicality, all the different components in a K-cup make it difficult to actually recycle. It's not as environmentally friendly as we thought it was."" My friend followed-up with ""Maybe we could look into getting reusable mesh filters.""

I've been invited to go around a friend's neighborhood with a couple other high school aged friends. This is fine, until I realized that they want to go trick or treating.

I'm kind of at a loss on what to do. I don't want to trick or treat. I don't have any interest in doing this, and I think its weird for a group of 16 year olds to be trick or treating. Being teens, we're loud, we curse like sailors, and we make innappropriate jokes. I just don't want to bring that into a neighborhood full of younger children. It also feels like I'd be stealing candy from kids.

I know that a few of my friends are only in it for the candy. But some are doing it because they've always done it, and they never outgrew it.

When I told one friend I was surprised we were going trick or treat because we're teens, she kind of paused and got quiet. And then said something along the lines of, ""Maybe we are too old."" It sounded like this was the first time she'd ever even thought of that. And she sounded really sad.

I don't know what to do. I feel really uncomfortable going trick or treating. I've long since out grown it and haven't gone since I was 12. But it looks like no one else has. They even said that they're planning to do this until they're 17.

Maybe I'm being unfair, though? I am the oldest in the group and am the only one with money and a car. So I'm also the only one who can buy candy whenever I want. Being a few months younger, they can't do that yet, which makes getting candy more of a special occasion.

They said they won't go trick or treating if I'm not. But I know they would be disappointed.

I forgot to.mention.I.felt.super.jealous of a lot of those game devs and people and shit cuz they were doing so much more than me. there was this one guy who ill call sam whos been making games.since he was 11 and he was hella funny and mature and everyone loved him, i hated him. after joining back i just tried to live as a normal fan i guess, no real hobbies, made a few jokes in class (which was meh) and around early 2019 my teacher went off on me when i was bored and told me i was not funny and never would be and y'know i was feeling okay that year. (had good friends and felt sorta cool i guess) and jt crushed me, i kept making jokes like twice as frequent and no one was laughing, just awkard glares. i know im hella sensitive. it would take me like 30 mins to get up in the morning. i kinda wasted my whole summer after that, just roblox all day, but when i got back after watching.this video.about resistance i decided i was gonna get myself out of my shit hole and accomplish my dreams. ive began trying to learn.to 3d.model and.code, and.ive been looking.really hard for ideas. however i have close.to none, only remakes.of.old games and very vague unoriginal copies of other games or games.with barely a concept. i wanna get.out.of where i am and accomplish my drram.of.being.someone.bht.i have jo idea how.",30Oct2019,1

I told her she would get caught “I’ve been bullied before, People will think I got hit first. I can get him expelled for you.”  She’s crazy, and im worried I’ll be hurt. She told me unless I can get peoples forgiveness for being a bitch to them, she will hate me. I’m afraid one of her friends, (who is much much bigger and stronger than me), will hurt me. He’s very aggressive, and my past with men dosent help lol. He’s one of the people I need to apologise to. I eat in the bathroom to avoid them.

239,"For the past three years I attended classes and workshops at a place owned by my mother's friend, let's call him John. The atmosphere wasn't bad, some stale classes and faulty equipment, nothing too serious. As time passed there were some suspicious things, such as him insisting me joining said stale classes (same material taught for over seven years), telling me that he would take care of the fact that one of the teachers, let's call this one Pete, considered an offense my request for regular lessons (which never changed) and asked the students who were on a decent level to play for free at a pre-election party for the candidate who had him in his team. He was always going on about how he's helping us and the last year asked me to take part in a class that wasn't of value to me to help them out and in return he would lower the price. My mother had been paying and I wasn't aware of the pricing at the time, but he told me plenty of times that it's for three instruments, even though I was only getting regular lessons to one. 

A few months later, my mother told Pete that she's having trouble paying and he was very surprised, since he hadn't been clocking our hours. We were left to believe that John was taking the money, which was a huge amount for one instrument and a workshop anyway, and were obviously lied to. My mother decided not to confront him, it was almost the end of the year, getting closer to my exams for university (which I passed to study music, yay!) and to not pay the last year, something she told Pete about.

Apart from my story, there were many students who were disgruntled by John's behavior, each for different reasons such as him not paying teachers or leaving students alone/being very late when they were supposed to have a lesson, but most felt obliged and every time anyone tried talking to him he would turn everything around.

It's been a few months that I'm away and no one ever said anything, but I got the urge to write a review. It was polite and mentioned only things that were obvious to anyone, stale classes and overpricing, said I wouldnt recommend, especially since there are better alternatives. Also said how part of the workshops was very good. After that one teacher was disappointed, but Pete blew up. He sent VERY offending and personal messages to my mother, told me that I should have been grateful since it was because of that friend that I'm here now (completely ignoring my own effort), that I shouldn't have said anything since I left and lots about how my mother is manipulating me, calling her a snake etc. When I tried confronting him about which particular aspect of my review he thinks is false he mostly dodged the subject and never gave a clear reply, other than that he too teaches there. 

I was quite surprised by the amount of blaming on my mother, started thinking over her behaviour and realised that maybe I should have tried talking to the friend first, even though I'm too prone to emotional manipulation (working on that). While I was at that, the issue blew up even more and I found out that Pete was convinced that this was a ploy in order to damage the relationship between him and John, as well as him and myself. He has convinced John and another teacher that this is the case and has spread obvious lies. This, along with the offending messages, got me to think that the reaction is disproportional and that I or anyone else should have every right to write a bad review on a business page and no matter the personal relationship I do believe that one should be able to express what they see as negative. 

I'm very confused and don't know how to handle this situation. Never expected it would go that far, I'm not sure whether I should stand my ground and to what extend. Reddit, please lend a hand, any advice and opinion would be immensely appreciated!

TL;DR: Realised I was paying way too much for services I wasn't getting, in a supposedly friendly environment. Wrote a review on their page not recommending (without telling them first, but not mentioning anything personal) and one of the teachers blew up and made false conspiracy theories.

247,"Hey reddit. I’m a pretty normal teenager, currently a sophomore, and I have no interests whatsoever. I literally hate any work that I have to do, and I only like playing video games and hanging out with friends. I always had a pressure to go into the pharmaceutical field as my family has worked in that field for generations. They are very well off money-wise and I can feel the pressure to try to “manipulate” me to go into that work. (They aren’t obsessive about it just an underlying feeling.) 
Anyways back to the main topic, I don’t like anything. I can’t imagine myself working at all, so when I come to think about my major and future aspirations, nothing comes to mind. With no offense to gaming and computer studies, I don’t think it would be the right fit for me. I have expensive tastes that I don’t think could be bought if I worked in that and I think working on a game would kill the magic for me when playing. While college and my major may seem far away, it really isn’t. I’ve been the same video game binging dude for the past 7 years. My life is coming by so fast and it honestly scares me. With my only interests being a no-go in college, I don’t know what to do. To add on to that, my dad is paying for all of my college bills and I don’t want to disappoint him. He’s worked hard for what he’s got and he made it in life. I don’t want to be a failure in relation to him. I know none of you know me, so this will be a difficult question to ask, but what am I supposed to do? Do I follow my family’s field and get into a great paying job, but one that I might hate?

251,"Throwaway acct

Hi, so im 25(m) and i feel like ive been betrayed by two of my closest friends/coworkers (23(m) and 22(f), they're a couple).

So ive always been extremely awkward and anxious talking to the opposite sex,  and up until earlier this year ive never tried to be in a serious relationship. However, earlier this year a friend (22f) sort of introduced me to a coworker (21f) she had been friends with for a couple of months. She could tell i was attracted to her and suggested i talked to her. Eventually the two of us started talking and hung out a couple of times, i felt pretty good, and thought this could be something. After about a month (this was late Feb.) I asked her out on an actual date, and this is where it all kind of falls apart.  

The date went terrible, we went to see a movie together and all my anxiety and nervousness caught up to me, we both showed up, watched the movie, and went home. We barely spoke to each other, we barely even looked at each other, I went home feeling like a complete loser. After this, I stopped talking to her because I'd assumed that i just scared her off with how i acted during that one night. I told my coworker friend (22f) that i still cared about (21f) and that i hate how i screwed things up, she tried to reassure me that i hadnt screwed up, and that sometimes people arent right for each other (She didnt have the heart to tell me that (21f) was already talking to other people, which i found out later). I tried to bring up my feelings less and less out of fear of being annoying but I was hurting inside for months, especially because the three of them would still hang out almost daily, and i was never invited (none of our mutual friends were invited, come to think of it, it was always just the three of them), i guess they didnt want to make things awkward.

Eventually i found out that (21f) would be moving in with (23m) and (22f) that July, which upset me because they were my closest friends that i barely got to see anymore because they were always with (21f) and then i started to worry because i knew that (22f) and (21f) are bisexual and attracted to each other, and I knew (23m) and (22f) had discussed having a threesome one day (not with (21f) specifically, just in general), and i was still trying (and failing) to move on from her. 

They never moved in together due to (23m) and (22f) having to move to a different place for unrelated reasons, and (21f) moved in with another roommate. However, recently during a drunk get together ((21f) was not present) the subject of a threesome came up, and (23m) and (22f) said that they have had a threesome. I nervously asked (22f) who the third person was, she looked at me and asked ""do you really want to know?"" to which i replied ""i think i already know..."" and she confirmed that the three of them ((22f), (23m) and (21f)), had sex while they were hanging out (i dont know exactly when, but i guess between May and June).

My heart sank, (22f) told me that this was after i had stopped talking to her, which wasnt reassuring, but i tried to be ok with it. The next day I was talking to (23m) and mentioned i had a lot on my mind, when he asked what was up I told him that finding out the three of them had slept together really hurt me, he said he was sorry, and that the threesome wasnt something they planned, that it just happened. I told him I was hurt because i feel like a friend shouldnt sleep with someone that another friend is still hurting over. He told me what they did ""was wrong"" and if i should be mad at anyone, it should be just him, not (22f), and he told me it was ok to be mad and he wanted to patch things up at one point, and that he didnt want me to keep my emotions bottled up.

I figured i should take some time to think, and sort my feelings out, but i kept asking myself ""how many times did it happen?"", and then i asked him, he told me it happened three times (threeway, three times, haha). I thought i couldnt feel any worse, but knowing that it was more than once just destroyed me. I told him as much, and again he said take as much time as i needed to process.

I appreciate that he was honest with me, and that he understands why I'm angry and upset, but I feel like something like this, from two people i wouldve considered family, im hurt that as this was happening, neither of them stopped and thought, ""this could hurt (25m), maybe we shouldnt do this"".

I know this is a rambling post, probably full of unnecessary details, and im sure ive forgotten some info, but I've spent the better part of 2 hours trying to make this coherent to read. But i really need to know, am i being petty, am i being unreasonably upset because me and (21f) were never really a couple?  Am i being selfish for feeling like my feelings werent considered when they slept together? And should I try patching things up with (23m) because i feel like they're not sorry for what they did, they're sorry that it hurt me when i found out? Idk, i think ive said all that i can, and i just feel lost and broken inside.",30Oct2019,1

255,"Hey everyone, so for clarity, I live right on the cook county line outside of Chicago. Inside the line you get paid $12/hr minimum.

Lately I've learned my roommate isn't getting paid what shes due but she's too concerned about talking to her boss about it. So I've decided I'm going to print out flyers listing the exact law and number to call if you aren't getting paid the new minimum which would force her boss to pay everyone the correct amount, and distribute them around the northern cook county area (e.g: coming into businesses and handing these flyers directly to the employees, not the bosses, and stapling them to telephone poles\bus stops\ect.)

Being a broke 20 something, I don't have a printer. But I do, however, have mad word skills. I figure I can repeat the PSA four times on a regular sheet of paper and only have to pay a ¼th of the price per flyer. Only trouble is finding a place to print them, there is no Staples or Kinko's near me, could maybe libraries have print stations?

The other thing I'm worried about is violence. The north side of Chicago isn't exactly known for violence, but if I know shitty bosses, plenty of them have a temper, and I'm thinking of carrying a knife, or pepper spray on me just in case I get confronted by a manager that isn't happy. Would this be a smart move legally? I'm definitely not looking for trouble, just defence.

The last part I need to figure out for efficiencys sake, is information. Of course I know my roommates boss is underpaying her, but I can't be sure every place is underpaying, and the more flyers I give out the more I pay out of pocket. Possibly I can start chatting up employees before I give them anything ""so hey what's your guy's hourly rate? \ect?""

I really am usually a reserved person but I hate seeing people my age being taken advantage of. I feel I need to do something.

so i am a 18 Male with way too many physical health and mental health related issues and i am constantly being attacked by everyone.

little bit About my health status height=173 cms 5 feet 8 inches, weight= 37 kg or 81.5 lbs \[it is my actual weight\] eyes pretty much blind without glasses both eyes more than 5 dioptre \[cant even write this post without glasses\] constant chest pain and pain in penis area and a weird third ball that grew up 5 years ago when doctor gave me few medicines and very weak knees and foot joint and constant heavy dizziness.

so i was born in this hell of a family on the day of 9/11 yes exact day, my father is trash and tried killing us many times so he can marry to his other gf's and kicked us out of house for few years, in this time few of his friends looted and beaten my father and then he died so we never really got any of my fathers money and were on our own but just like i said my father was trash before his death he created a lot of enemies within our relatives and neighbours and after his death i became there target, i was eight when he died few days after my fathers death our relatives captured half of our house and some money my father left. however my mom managed to create a temporary peace. things started becoming better but this was about to change as my relatives started targeting me to satisfy their anger towards my dead father they brainwashed my mother against me btw my mom is a religious idiot that anyone can easily manipulate. so after our relatives started brainwashing her she became my biggest enemy i was not getting food clothes medicines or even glasses \[i was going blind and was desperate for glasses\] and because of this i got severely malnurished but everyone refused to help but created more problems as they had problems with my mom and dead dad i was constantly brutally bullied in school and house.

however things got better for a 6 months as i got enrolled in a course and left house but my mom suddenly in mid session refused to pay the fees ***\[my mom had money but she refused to pay and laughed at me when i asked for fees\]*** they kicked me out then i was forced to live with my mom but i knew my mom will get me killed or disabled so i decided to live in a store room on roof where nobody usually no one goes and started making my own food and do everything on my own and continue my high school well she refused pay for that as well but i managed to convince my school to not kick me out on a condition that i will only come to school during exams and have to do all studies without any of their help. but i was smart enough to maintain above average grades so they dont see me as burden and kick me out. they last year when high school finals were near my family decided to give me a small food treat i was very skeptical but since i was not getting enough food i took the food they given me and started eating it but in that food there was a small peice of sharp branched copper wire in it but since i was already cautious i was able to spit it out before it reaches my throat but it did scrach my tounge and when i freaked out about it as that could've nearly kill me everyone started pretending like nothing happened and since this was second attack on me ***\[first attack was when my uncle family attacked me for property issue\]***  i decided to leave the house i begged my aunt to let me live in her house for few days she agreed but since she also hated my father she given me her storeroom to live however it was better than what i got in my house but after my exams got over she kicked me out as well and i was again forced to live with my family but i was happy as i was going to join a college and leave the house forever but again mom ruined it and i had to drop out, few months ago i had a mental breakdown and my mom took advantage of that and captured my room and forced me live like prisinor i sleep all day because i am not allowed to leave the bed not room but bed i spent atleast twenty hours out of twenty four in my bed and as i m not allowed to eat i can only eat during night when every one is asleep and because of this my health has got severely bad and my mom has created a hoax that i am being controlled by some bad powers like witches so nobody is helping me and have tried suicide two times and failed i dont know how to survive all this anymore and my mom and elder sister also told me to commit suicide multiple times. but i somehow managing to live with the help of my phone and laptop they tried to break it as well but i managed to save them.

So, I work a local government job and money is tight in our state. I graduated with a college degree in 2012 in international studies with the intention to go to graduate school but instead got stuck in retail for five years. A friend of mine suggested I apply to my current position two years ago and I was hired.

When I started with a salary of 32,000 (probably really low to a lot of people) but I was happy to take the job because of the health insurance and pension. After being in my starting position for almost a year, I was asked to train for a new department and was shortly after offered that position with a raise to 36,000.

In August, I applied to a new position within our department and was offered the job. This position is a more coveted job and most of my coworkers who have been there for a while make around 50,000 a year. I was told I would get a 2,000 raise to bump me up to 38,000 after I completed a 6 month trial period.

The city must have allocated more money to our department because I was just bumped up to the 38,000 salary after being in my position for only two months. Our salaries are public record so I decided to look my coworkers salaries up to see what kind of raises everyone received. I noticed my coworkers who have not recently received promotions, like myself, received the same raise I did. So now we are paid the same salary. I don't think that's quite fair as I have recently had to undergo a lot of new training for a position that requires more skill and knowledge. Also, a coworker in my current department who has only been there for a year longer than myself, received a 4,000 raise where mine was only 2,000.

267,"So as the title implies, I keep catching my sister cheating on her partners. She's only 17 years old and I wouldn't mind her testing the waters with various things like dating/relationship's/sex but she's doing it wrong. She's doesn't perform safe sex at all. Every sexual encounter she's had has been unprotected. She's also had sex in public places and even got caught at school by the school officer and principal. She's also cheated on multiple people but cried and tried to commit suicide after one of her boyfriends cheated on her.

We already put her on nexoplan (birth control), and expressed the need for condoms. But we just don't know how to make her understand what she's doing is unhealthy mentally and physically. Any advice helps.",30Oct2019,4

270,"I am a 24-year-old male. From the outside, I look like a man, but on the inside, I feel like a little boy. This essentially ruined my relationship with my ex-girlfriend and is taking its toll on my family. I have always been very sensitive and into music, film and that sort of thing. But in the last 3 years, it has been dialed up to 11. I will cry sometimes 2 to 3 times a day. I tried to hide it a lot by crying in the shower. I think I am depressed as well. I cried when we watched the movie ""The Little Prince"" which is about a boy who has to grow up and it made me cry and my girlfriend commented about it saying it was unattractive. I cried another day because I saw a turtle get run over by a car. I would often cry in the bathroom at work twice daily because I was so sad there. Now that she left I have been crying 2-3 hours a day for the last month. It is awful and exhausting. Sometimes I just wish I was normal and number to things but so much makes me cry it's ridiculous.",30Oct2019,1
271,"I don't usually post on Reddit unless I absolutely need something answered, so this is stepping a bit out of my comfort zone for a change. Last year was a pretty great year. I was finally gaining the confidence needed to get past my social awkwardness, and was making friends all over the place. It was great. Summer came and went, and I was more than ecstatic to come back and talk to all these people again. You probably see where this is going now.

Upon arriving, almost all people I thought I was friends with last year didn't seem interested in even talking to me. The same friends I told a lot to, the same friends who'd tell me the drama going on in theirs and all that. Now they don't even speak to me.

Out of all of that, that's the least of my problems. I only managed to keep one friend pretty much. Him and I are now best friends, which is odd considering how weird I was at the time. I'm glad I talked to him when I did. He's an important aspect of this, so we'll call him Steve. (No, that's not his real name.)

My absolute best friend of six years now has been distancing herself more and more from me lately. We'll call her Daisy. (Not her real name.) I was scared to ask her about it, but when I did, her response was.. Less than helpful. As I had asked her this a month or two ago, I won't be able to quote word for word what she said but I can try to sum up what I remember. 

For one I was hanging out with Steve too much. In many words, Daisy was jealous and didn't want to be around me if I wasn't going to hang around her. I believe her second reason was something along the lines of, ""You're acting too sad. All you ever talk about is depressing stuff, and I don't want to hear it, so I just walk away to talk to someone else."" I will admit maybe I was going a bit overboard with the topic of my issues, but when that's the only thing on my mind, what am I supposed to say? My only option then is to shut my mouth, and then I'm treated as if I'm not even there. 

At this point I've tried to tell her I want things to be how they used to be more times than I can count, and every time somehow the blame is shifted onto me. She's placing brick after brick on my shoulders as guilt does its job and weighs down on me. 

A lot of the time I'll walk into school, attempting to greet her, and before I even get a word in she asks me where another person is, or if I saw this person while walking in. Not even a hello. I'll try to make conversation, and either no one says anything and she moves onto another topic, or the other people will find what I said interesting or funny whilst she sits there looking irritated. She'll make plans with everyone else literally right in front of me, and say absolutely nothing to me. I have to ask. And half the time she doesn't have the time to hang out with me because she's hanging out with someone else. And I have no problem with that! It's perfectly fine, I'm just a little disappointed that I have to be the one to ask whether I can come over or not. I have to make plans. I have to start a conversation. I have to text first. I am always the one to apologize, writing 10+ paragraphs of how much I'm sorry for whatever I did wrong. 

If anyone has any advice or even reasons or examples of why this happening, please, tell me something. I don't want to lose her for something I don't even know I did wrong.",30Oct2019,2

274,"I [21M] can be very self-conscious about myself. Honestly it’s hard for me to imagine a girl ever being attracted to me. I have too many dealbreakers.

For starters, I’ve been balding since 18. I feel like the vast majority of girls my age don’t like bald guys. Let’s say I get extremely lucky and find a girl who doesn’t care. Then she finds out I have a 4 inch penis. What are the odds she doesn’t care about that AND my bald head. Let’s say I get unfathomably lucky and say she doesn’t care. What are the odds that she will stick around knowing I’m a virgin who never learned how to he good at oral or fingering? I feel like it is just too unlikely to find a girl (my age especially) who doesn’t care about balding AND a small penis AND virginity. I should also mention I’m also fat which is probably another dealbreaker, but that is the one thing I can change.

It just seems like I am a lost cause. I can’t even take comfort in calling these girls shallow because people are allowed preferences. The problem is me and there is nothing I can do to fix it. The likelihood of me finding a girl who overlooks these major dealbreakers is too small",30Oct2019,1

277,"My friend has had two attempted suicides in the past 6 years and is only 18 years old. He recently moved out of his parents house to a place he doesn’t know to be closer to the girl he loves. They aren’t together but he feels really seriously about her. The problem is he doesn’t have a car or his license and the city he moved to doesn’t have reliable transportation. She’s the only person he knows. 
He’s working two minimum wage jobs to cover living expenses and rent and is biking walking to work. Recently his housing situation fell completely through and he won’t have anywhere to live after this month. He can’t find any apartments within his price range near where he works. The girls parents are super strict and won’t let him stay with them. 
None of her friends are still home as they have went away for school and she has no other family in the area to try and help him out. 

He left his parents because he said the environment was too toxic and wasn’t fixable. He said he felt suicidal living at home and in his hometown and felt like he needed to get away. He refuses to consider moving back home at all. 

My issue with this is that if he moved back in with his parents, he could learn to drive, save money, attend school, have people he knows be around him. And although this isn’t his ideal situation at least he could get back on his feet and get a head start at saving up money for the next time he moves out. 
I don’t fully understand he extent of his issues with his parents, but he says they’re terrible. 

Lately with all this happening, he has talked about hanging himself , giving up, says he can’t be alive if his life isn’t progressing. I feel helpless and I don’t know what the fuck to do.",30Oct2019,1

282,"Not wanting to be too specific I'll just say that i was a ""beautician"" for a short while working from home but have recently stopped. In my line of work it was not uncommon for regular clients to disclose parts of their private life (honestly I've heard some things)

A young lady who I would see every 2 or 3 weeks  had started to date a guy and after a few months  it was evident they had become a couple. Here are some moments alarm bells started going off:


- the bf started to come to her appointments and wait outside for her in the car, sometimes texting repeatedly throughout the treatment. Nothing bad about that it just seemed she was mildly harassed perhaps by his constant texting. 
- she told me his ex was a liar and causing trouble because she was accusing the bf of doing bad things to her (didn't go into detail) but said she didn't believe it herself.
- I had a male family member around who was fixing something for me, when he left carrying his toolbox out the bf was outside in the car and messaged my client accusing her of cheating.
- she mentioned he wanted them to have a baby soon, said she wanted to as well
- she mentioned he wanted her to cut her hair, said she didn't want to
- she came to an appointment with a significant bruise on her upper arm about the size of the mouth of a cup. I asked her what had happened when she initially came in and she brushed it off saying it was an accident. Later on she let slip he had hit her, but that they were just play fighting and that he ""doesn't know his strength"" she said all of this laughing and jokingly. (I can't imagine anyone I've ever had a playfight with leaving me a bruise like that.) This is the last time I saw her due to no longer working as a beautician. 
- I log onto a social media account and see that this client has posted something along the lines of: I'm so appreciative of my bf who has been so loving and caring while I've been in pain due to my recent accident and can't believe he puts up with my moaning. .... she gave no other details but alarm bells immediately started ringing. Also, if you're in pain you're allowed to moan wth.

Would this concern you, am I reading too much into this? I asked her outright if he was abusing her when she mentioned he'd caused the bruise but she said no, laughed it of. Any advice?",30Oct2019,3

285,"Backstory: I am 17M and my step sister is 18F we have lived together since I was a newborn and she was like 14 months. So we have grown up as siblings. Hell I didn't even know she was my step sister till I was like 8 cause I just never understood that word. I play football, lacrosse and hockey. So as you can tell I'm very active, playing this many sports has its downside tho cause my body doesn't get its break and after football (where I put most of my effort into) my body is just spent so I am more likely to get injured and I do. Through 4 years of pop warner/HS I have broke my ankles twice, got 1 concussion, tore my ACL and sprained my MCL. My ankle is completely fucked and I limp from time to time and has some medical anomaly it can swell and I need to ice it to make it better. Me and my (step) sister have had an off again on again type of relationship, where we will get alone one week/month and then be enemies the other week/month.

The problem came up when we were kinda on each other's nerves and my ankle was swelling up. We were in the living room watching something and I can't really remember the argument but I think it was me wanting her to change the channel and she wouldn't. I was getting up to leave after flipping her off and that just SET. HER. OFF. She got up and started cussing me out I called her a bitch but before I could walk away she kicked me in my fucked up ankle and I feel to the floor. I was holding in tears and anger, a younger me would have shoved her down but I know better than to hit a girl. I slowly got up while she was laughing and yelled ""Fuck off, your not even real family"". I was PISSED at this, she knew that if she hit my ankle hard enough it could possibly re-injure myself and/or hurt like a MFer.

My dad heard that and came to talk to me. I was still too pissed over what happened, he didn't say much knowing that I just wanted to be alone but basically said that I went too far and that I'm grounded till he says its over. I tried to protest saying she kicked me in the ankle but he didn't want to hear it.

This happened a couple days ago and I think she's grounded too cause she hasn't left the house other than going to school either. I know I could've handled this better but I feel like it was justified cause she took a dumb argument I was walking away from and made it worse. I wouldn't have said anything when she was cussing me out but when she almost purposefully tried to hurt/injure me I had enough and said the first hurtful thing that came to mind.  I know it didn't hurt her like at all cause thats always been our banter.

I lived close to school and friends, I had good grades, nice area to live, overall just a really nice place but my father didn't have a job, his contract ended around late 2015 so we were barely holding onto our house so I picked up my first job to help out. This year around Febuary my father left for another woman supposedly somewhere in Thailand while me and my mother were looking for a new home which wasn't in the nicest part of town, we still didn't know about dad's trip across the world, but I just had the false hope that he'd find work to get us out of this hell hole.

291,"TLDR paragraph at bottom.

When I was in 6th grade, I developed a habit of biting onto my 3DS system when I was very frustrated with my games. That biting transitioned to my hands when I stopped playing 3DS games and realized I couldnt be destroying my other gaming systems like I dod woth my 3ds. The screen was so far fucked that it's hard to play without holding a flashlight to the screen. (Its not playable in the dark.)

Tonight I got very frustrated by a game and felt the compulsion to bite at my hands. My knuckles and joints of my fingers are the no.1 spot I bite, usually. 

A number of factors not only frustrated me, but hindered my gameplay: two rather achey knees (both upsetting and distracting), the room being uncomfortably cold, and achey elbows (from sitting weirdly during schoolwork earlier in the day.)

I resisted the biting urges though, despite being furious by the pathetic seeming results of my gameplay, and in my frustration, I felt compelled to smash the controller into the more distracting/more painful of my two knees. I didnt do this either, and stopped myself as I rose the controller up to sledge it down onto the knee.

For minor frustrations today, or this whole month actually, ive been biting down at my nails.... my nails, whom for more than a year ive been meticulously caring for and allowing to grow out so that they look nice when I paint them... God damn, even now I stopped typing to play a round of Persona 5 dancing on All Night mode and I stopped the game early and bit tf out of my thumb nails. (Im turning off the game for the night because I feel fucking pathetic as shit.)

Fuck. My habit's such shit, but ive had it for so long its so deeply engrained in me.  I just feel the NEED to clench my teeth on SOMETHING, ANYTHING, to relieve that anger. 

Its so fucking stupid and childish..

This biting problem has spanned 7 years, though the probablem has only been so severe three of these years.

6th, 7th grade, and now 1 year after 12th grade. 

Bottom line is the problem started 7 years ago and is resurfacing again as of late.

I know I have a problem, and I want to know of non-self-destructive ways to cool off other than ""just dont play the games if they frustrate you....."". I want to he able to enjoy these games n shit, as I do sometimes, Ive just never learned coping mechanisms for severe failures in them. 


***TLDR: Since 6th grade (almost 7 years now), ive been biting my hands very hard/angrily as a coping mechanism for extreme frustration and I NEED a healthier way to cope. Please help me.***


( I already see a therapist, but I dont trust her enough to ask.... I know she's not the right therapist for me and im looking for a new one currently, but shit takes time... She'd very likely say shit like ""Well, you'll learn how to cope with it eventually, it's just a part of growing up"" (shes said this at a problem thats brought me to tears before, and had NO further advice.) or ""Just stop playing the game if its upsetting you so much."")",30Oct2019,2

the problem with my current school is the effect/toll it has had on my mental health (if you look at my old posts, you can see all the stories/problems i have had with the people in my school,, but u don't have to !!) . im constantly being surrounded by negative people and feeling like i have nowhere else to go. i can't trust my friends, and considering my school community, it is difficult to find another friend group to squeeze into. i just want a fresh start.

i would've moved schools in a heartbeat but the only thing preventing me to do so is the school's music program. i love that music program. i've achieved so much with all of them. finally becoming first chair flute in the band, finally being a part of the leadership team, playing in mostly all of the bands and choirs, having a strong bond with my music teachers. i can't imagine what a new school would be like without the music program i already have.

my current school is an old, run down, Catholic private school and i am planning to transfer to either a nearby public school (i already know a lot of people in the school, and it is a quick commute from my house, but i heard a lot of bad things about it) or the next nearest Catholic private school (i heard lots of good things about it, they have a pretty good music program, and it is a private Catholic school, but i don't know anyone, it's a hefty commute, and it is pretty expensive)

would moving schools be a good idea? if so, which school (the private Catholic school or the nearby public school?)? and when should i do it if it is a good idea?

294,So I was at work and I decided that I wanted to ask for a schedule change cause I work at a restaurant washing dishes and they had me do the closings which was nice for a while but it's starting to get to me cause I am a morning person. I am more productive in the morning and do better quality work. So I asked my manager if they would be willing to do this for me so they would be paying me for good quality work. Well to my displeasure what they did was my work week next week is a 3 day week so not only am I getting way less hours than I already got. I still close 2 of those 3 days and have one morning shift. So after this and talking to a couple co workers I am thinking about getting another job and a job I found at a city market which is 5 minutes away from me so it would be perfect to bike to work everyday but for some reason my mom doesn't want me to work there.

Where we talk about politics and other passions, I even had a speaking slot scheduled there. Everything was going right in my life.

But then I got sick with a devastating cold. It destroyed me for a week, I did nothing but binge on junk food and watch kids TV shows. I went to work, still sick after that week. Then I realize I'm still so sick that I can't finish my shift. I go to my boyfriend's house to rest for a little. He crosses a line with me, and starts trying to make out with me when I don't want it. I kept telling him to stop until he eventually does, and we break up the following night because of his inappropriate behavior. Not to mention, I had already taken a ""Plan B"" to avoid pregnancy due to previous careless encounters with him. *So yeah, I obviously wasn't in the mood to chance it again.* 

Another week passes, mood swings come in, I'm still recovering from the cold, and I missed my opportunity to speak at the event. Symptoms flood me up and down, as I have tender breasts, I feel like a pufferfish about to explode, I'm overeating on a regular basis from all kinds of stress, and I'm left a nervous wreck thinking I'm pregnant.

300,"- I’m in a shitty financial situation. I’m about $13000 underwater in immediate debt. 

- I’m part time at my job so I don’t get paid vacation.  On top of that people with seniority are more likely to get holidays off. 

- I knew what I was signing up for when I got this job. I need the money. My parents know everything that lead me up to this point. My dad also played a small part in this financial hole I’m in. If anyone should understand why I’m not going out of town this Christmas with the family , he *should* be the main one who understands.

- my mom will be very sad if she has to spend Christmas without me. My grandma will have a fit with everyone ( especially with my dad if she found out the small part he played in money slipping through my hands ) once I break tradition.

- I’ve already asked my job multiple times for the holidays off, they expectedly said no. My parents don’t want to take no for answer.

- i *cannot* lose this job until I’m back on my feet.

- there are no other jobs out there that are better than the current one I have given my situation in life and financial predicament. I have an associate’s degree in general studies, this job pays $17/hr. 

- I’ve often asked the Internet what jobs can I get that pay well enough for me to have a financial breather , most people suggest stripper, selling drugs etc. These are not options for me.",30Oct2019,1
301,"In May of this year I had it all (or everything I could’ve wanted at the time). A beautiful girlfriend, money, steady work, friends, and a nice college I was going to attend in the fall. But that all changed late July when my girlfriend told me she wanted to breakup with me because the college I was going to go to was 1,000 miles away. I understood and didn’t take it too hard. Until not even a week later when I found out that she already had another boyfriend. Which means she was talking to him by the end of our relationship. That I have not been able to get over. We were in love for a whole year but only were officially dating for 2 months (would’ve been 2 but she broke up with me 3 days before our anniversary). 2 days later I find out that all of my money was stolen from my bank account and my bank couldn’t get me the money back right before I was supposed to leave to go to my college for orientation.  Also while I was at orientation my car back home was taken from me by my dad because he didn’t want me driving it because he had unpaid parking tickets ranging in the 1000s. While at orientation it occurred to me that my family couldn’t afford to send me there so I was forced to enroll in the community college by my house. Where my ex girlfriend attends. So on occasion I’ll run into her. We look at each other now like we’re strangers. On the second week of school just hours before my first class of the day I was told that my old friend from high school was hit by a train on his way home from work. He was 18. At his funeral his casket was open. The only body part that wasn’t totally destroyed was his head. So they put his head on a manikin body inside of the casket. I still can’t get the image out of my head. My only way of escaping my problems was through my friends, but they all go to different schools so we don’t get to see each other.  Also because of everything I went through it’s hard to pay attention in class so I’m currently failing my classes. I should’ve taken a semester off to cope with everything that’s happened but it’s too late to withdraw now, the semester is more than halfway done. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve lost a lot of weight (I joke by saying I’m doing a reverse freshman 15) and everything I had going for me. I still have family but we’re not close. They have no idea what’s going on with me, they just know I lay in bed a lot. I don’t even feel sad anymore, I don’t feel anything anymore and it scares me. I would never take things to far because I’ve seen the pain loss can cause a family. I feel like everything is completely fu**ed. Everything I’ve gone through has left me in a rut and I have no idea how to press forward. I have nowhere else to turn please give me some wise words. Thank you.",30Oct2019,2
302," As a precursor, I understand it’s my own fault and the best thing for my situation is very simple, but if anyone has any other suggestions that would actually be life saving. I do expect a few comments on my maturity though...

Over the course of the last couple of months I’ve collected a little under £10,000 due to student finance and compensation, and money from my part time job on top of that. In the same couple of months, I’ve left myself with approximately £5 in my bank currently. Some of it went to rent, a new phone, things I needed for my new place, food shops etc etc. Beyond that, it went on things that, in hindsight, I don’t even have good reasons or evidence of. 
I’ve never had a good relationship with money, or food for that matter, and my parents are well aware of it so maybe pride comes into a little, but it’s mainly embarrassment. 
My family as a whole are on the poor side. My dad has only started working this last month, and asked to borrow £300 until payday. He said he didn’t want to talk to my mother about it because of the issues it causes. I had £100 to my name and asked a friend to lend me the rest (something I’ll carry with guilt long after I pay her back). 
My job pays an average of £60 a week, most of which goes on food and any necessary extras. 

I don’t know how to ask for the money back without making it obvious I really, desperately need it. Luckily I’m not in any debts and I’m treating it, overall, as a very unfortunate learning curve, especially as I never expected anyone to borrow money from me especially such a large amount. The most urgent thing is paying the money back, and the fact there’s a birthday coming up I’ve been instructed to get a relatively expensive gift for. I have about £30 worth of bills to pay a month as my rent comes out every three months or so.

TL;DR: I spent a lot of money. Dad asked for £300 to pay for bills because he couldn’t speak to mum about it. I borrowed £200 off a friend and gave him my last £100 leaving myself essentially broke until I get the money back/get a good enough wage. Being upfront isn’t an option partially due to embarrassment/pride and general tense family relationships.",30Oct2019,1

304,"I was just listening to a random shuffle of music and Sweet Home Alabama came up. I instantly felt my body loosen up and I spent a little time enjoying the nostalgic feelings. The longer the song went on though, I thought about how much Alabama is not the right fit for me politically and it killed the ease I felt. 

I’ve had this happen with other media, Catch Me if You Can, various “chick flicks”, Disney movies. Things that used to make me laugh or feel happy make me uneasy because of the character roles or interactions.  

I know this means I’m growing in some ways and there are plenty of awesome new media options available these days, and I do enjoy them, but I’m feeling a little sad about everything I used to like being an issue for my moral compass now.

305,"For the past week or two I've been receiving calls from a number and caller ID I don't recognize on my home phone. It has a name, but not one that I knew, so I let it go to voicemail everytime. They never left a message until today. 

""Hi, this is Chuck. I'm trying to reach *my full name*. Call me back at *number*."" 

Now, I don't know a Chuck. My parents don't know anyone named Chuck. The caller id had a different name than Chuck. I suspect that Chuck isn't this guys real name. 

Well I write the number down, and google the name on the caller ID and number. Found a different name on that number than Chuck, and found a woman matching the name of the caller ID in my city on Facebook. Now this sounded like an old grizzled guy on the message so now I'm really confused. 

I decide, using a different phone, to call the guy using *67 so I would show up as a private number. He answers.

Chuck:""Hello?""
Me:""Hello.""
C: ""Who is this?""
M: ""You tell me. I keep getting calls from this number.""
C: ""Well I don't think I've been calling this number.""
M: ""Well you have.""

There is a person I am close with that has some major depression. Everyday she is constantly tired, feeling drained, sad, stressed out about her financial situation as well as her place in life. She tells me that she is doing her very best everyday to work hard and focus because she has people to take care of. She has two younger brothers (one has a disability) and a mother who is very old to work or really do anything and now a cousin that recently came over from a foreign country that she is also helping take care of. She also tells me that she is still alive because of her mom; everything she is doing is mainly for her mom. 

Anyways, she recently  (like today) tells me none of her other family members who are on her dad's side believes her; she doesnt like them anyways because the dad left them all to suffer when they were young. Even though she doesnt like them, she takes their words to heart. But now she is struggling and is getting even more depressed.

312,"My job is difficult to explain without giving too much information. But here's the gist. I started working for this company 2 years ago, I had exemplary status reports for every part of this job for two years. But this past year, I started pushing to do more and work harder for our clientele. They want and need more than we were offering at the time and I figured out how to help. This was the first time I ignored a ""bosses"" demand; we're all co-workers but there's a hierarchy and I'm on the low-end of the totem pole. Basically, if this person says no, or if I cross into their duties then I need to conform or be punished by being written up. 

After doing both ignoring their demand (which was bullshit for our client) and asking for outside help, which crossed job lines, I was chastised and written up. But then after that my ""boss"" decided I was no longer a viable employee even though the clients in both cases thanked me and sang my praise. He decided to fabricate incidents where I went against company policy, and while all were proven false the company does re-evals on me every 2 weeks to check in and make sure I'm following policy, and each re-eval I get chastised for the smallest incidents, like calling out sick. 

I would typically quit and continue on elsewhere in my career but I love my job and clients. They're amazing and don't deserve substandard service. How can I get my ""boss"" and the company off my back while maintaining a professional demeanour? Cause it's starting to crack which I think was the goal.",30Oct2019,1

I've already mentioned a few things such as my dad;s alcoholism, and some things that happened during my childhood because of that (no physical abuse or anything major like that, but things like how my dad broke my guitar out of anger after being drunk and how my mum just did not do anything about it). They are not terrible parents. But they are very serious, stubborn, and its difficult to converse with them. Heres a bit of background: they are immigrants from Asia, went through a lot of hardship when moving to Australia, which spiralled my dad;s alcoholism and created a lot of stress during my early childhood years. So because of that there is quite a bit of emotional distance between me and my family. We all love each other, and would do anything for one another. But when we sit down together as a family, there is not much conversation because of this emotional distance, we have nothing in common, all we talk about is what we ate and how work is going.

I told her that for almost a year I’ve wanted a tongue piercing and I might get one around December. Then she says to me “I want one too let’s get it together after our exams”. And I’m thinking okay that’s but after exams is too long(exams are literally in summer, this girl wants me to wait like 7 months). I honestly thought about why she wants it after exams and remembered that her parents are strict AF and she turns 18 during exam season which means after exams, she can get it done without her parent’s consent (she’s also moving out after exams so she probably wants it then so her parents won’t see it). Now I’m kind of annoyed because she should have just told me that truth instead of give me vague reasons that don’t even make any logical sense. In my opinion what she did is selfish because she’s basically telling me that I can’t do something cool because she can’t.

-the kid with the butterfly net by graham parker (very nostalgic song for me and my dad. he made a youtube video for my tenth birthday and posted it on youtube and this song was the song in the background) 
“And when you close your eyes you don't see a thing / You just remember that you were meant to have wings / For the kid with the butterfly net / The kid with the butterfly net”

-hero by family of the year (me and my dad both love this song but not sure if the lyrics match the theme) 
“And we can whisper things / Secrets from my American dreams / Baby needs some protection / But I'm a kid like everyone else”

-jesus etc by wilco (me and my dad both love this song) 
“Jesus, don't cry, you can rely on me, honey / You can combine anything you want / I'll be around, you were right about the stars / Each one is a setting sun” and “Our love, our love, our love is all we have / Our love, our love is all of God's money / Each one is a burning sun”

-don’t let the kids win by julia jacklin (me and my dad went to go see a concert together last year and were completely blown away by this song and now when i listen to it i get teary eyed) 
i don’t have a specific quote to put here because the whole song is just so beautiful",30Oct2019,2
316,"I'm meeting up with a friends that for the past 7 months that has ignored me because I think he hates my guts. For around 2 years, I was the closest with this guy and we would share a lot of stuff from memes to advise on where we are going in the future. One day, however, we were going through and helping another friend out with a school bully. Now this friend that I think hates me now, is not that good or inexperienced when it comes to these kind of social situations. He posted a joke that was really in poor taste to the tone of the conversation. I got a little mad and said that was not cool and then he quit out. This was a little peculiar because he usually stays during the conversation no matter how bad the arguments got. There was nothing that happened prior to get him to leave.

On the next day, I tried to talk to him on discord like we usually do but he stops responding, even though his status says online and he didn't block me either. So I decided, to lay off talking to him for a bit thinking it was too early to talk since he might still be mad at me for what happened yesterday. 

3 weeks pass and I try to talk to him again and got the same no response. 4 weeks had past and I managed to talk to him on instagram by some luck, and he wanted to end the conversation as soon as possible and I was only managed to get a few lines in before I got the hint. After that, he gives me the same no response, even on his birthday.   

By the time a month and a half had passed, I asked round my friend group to see what was going on. They all gave me the same response, saying that he hasn't been acting strange at all. So I asked one of them to talk about what happened to him and I. He gives the same no response to them when they ask or until my friend changes the subject. I saw something odd and wanted to conduct an experiment and found out that ANY TIME I AM NAMED, REFERENCED, OR REASONABLY INFERRED, the conversation will end flat out. 

Currently, I am asking a bunch of friends to convince him to meet where I can have a conversation with him. He is still my closest friend I ever had and I want to try and repair that relationship we had earlier. Unfortunately, I don't know what to say to him after a whole 7 months.

I am currently rly conflicted wether to go with it or to stick with the current employment situation i have already set out before christmas. Both would bring me the same amount of money it is just the other factors that i am debating. I am going to New Zealand just after Christmas so am also having to considee about mt situation while im there and when i get back. Here are the details for both options

Option 1: stick with current plan
- work weekends
- work nightshifts 3 days a week in December - wouldnt see gf as often 
- will get some holiday pay while im away 
- weekend job garenteed for when i get back
- no real commute
- Both of these jobs are mindnumingly dull and hate my current one as it is retail

Option 2: 
- 1 and a half hour commute
- way more exciting work 
- would have weekends free - would get to see gf alot more
- no holiday pay while im away in nz
- will be offered to continue after i get back from NZ

I am finding it a tough call to make and would love to hear some of your thoughts. Let me know if you want more info.",30Oct2019,1
334,"In my previous relationship, my ex and I got into a very serious and explosive fight at one point. I won’t go into the details but I hit him in a moment of anger/rage/upset. This was an isolated incident. We did not break up after this, even though I told him that he should leave me. I was devastated and disgusted with myself and took actions towards developing myself and making sure I would never do it to him or anyone else ever again. No one could hate me as much as I hate myself for doing that and even though I know I’m not the same person, I struggle with self-hatred everyday and think about suicide often as a plan b. 

I’m in a new relationship now - about a year and a half. Do I tell my current bf that I did once hit an ex, and how that affected the past relationship and how it affected my life? Do I tell him about my mental state?

On one hand I think that he deserves to know so he can really think about whether he wants to be with a person like me. In a way, it also feels like a way to share my entire self with him, not telling him feels deceptive. On the other hand, I’ve changed and I’m not that person anymore so maybe there isn’t the need to share this with him.  Everyone has their secrets, but I want my bf to know everything about me. Any advice appreciated, I can’t see a therapist any time soon to talk this over.",30Oct2019,3
335,"I didn’t have any distractions or anything. I used to be good at this subject, I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

336,"So, let me get this straight. I have to spend money that I don't have, to get my foreign High School transcript to get evaluated, to get funded by financial aid?  Isn't the whole point of getting financial aid is to AID those who cannot afford to go to school? 

They have been doing this to me since the beginning. I took PERT exams to prove that I'm a college level student, the exam was easy but when I got the scores, they said that I'm 3 points away from getting the cut off score. I took it again after 10 days and paid $32 dollars, I had no complain. This time they said I'm 3 points away from the cut off. I asked them if I could see which part I got wrong and these people told me that they are not allowed to do that for the sake of the answers not getting leaked to other students. Well, the questions are different everytime you take the exams so, why am I not allowed to see it? 
Now they want me to take EAP program which was a highschool equivalent course of reading, writing and speech. I didn't complain and I enrolled myself to those courses even if I already took college courses in a different classes and had good grades, plus I also had my college transcript from my country. So, now I thought I was ready, I had my financial aid, i paid my entrance fee online for $25...now hold on a minute, they said they didn't receive my payment, they said something went wrong with the transaction. So now, they want me to pay it again with another transaction fee, all in all I paid $75 just to get in this community college. Again, I did not complain and did it. And now comes the financial aid issue. While I was taking the EAP program for my first semester. They said I owe them, $3000. I asked why it's that much and if it was covered by financial aid. They said that ""I'm an international student"" which makes it more expensive for me to take these courses and that, with the financial aid covering it I ONLY  have to pay $1300. First of all, I am not an international student, second of all, where am I going to get that kind of money when I'm only paid a minimum wage part-time job that only pays me $300 every 2 weeks? They never told me ahead of time that I needed to prove that I have been a resident in the state for 6 years now. How can they not tell me that? That's a time sensitive issue and if it's a very important document, they would make sure to tell me. They did not communicate this with me but then again, they won and they made it look like it was my fault. So, I borrowed money from a family member which by the way, I still haven't paid them back, and paid the $1300. I finished the semester with all straight A's because  my dignity depends on it. The next semester after that everything went okay, courses were free and I took regular college classes, I got more straight A's because I cannot afford to fail at this point in my life, I'm already 27 and i'm still trying to get my shit together. Until this semester came and they found another way to fuck me up again. Mind you, I already complied with all the necessary documents for the school and for financial aid. Now, they want my highschool transcript. 

My highschool transcript was halfway around the world and they did not want to give it to me unless I was physically present. So, I wrote an authorization letter so that a family member could get it and send it to me. That was a success, I thought, okay, it's smooth sailing from here. But then, when I turned it in. They said they need it to get evaluated. And transcript evaluations cost a $100 for a piece of paper that probably has only 1 sentence that says my transcript has been evaluated. Again! How can they not tell me ahead of time about a time sensitive matter like that? Am I the only transfer student that they have dealt with to not know when they have to notify me about these things? These are things that are financially important! By the way, I kept asking why am i asked for this document now, when I already spent 2 semesters in this college and they said that it's not the school. It's the financial aid that need it.

Well, I've had enough of their bullshit so I did some digging. I read the online reviews about the school and most of them are 1 star out of 5 and most of the issues on these students reviews are disturbingly similar to mine. The most common is that, we didn't have problems with the professors but it was the financial aid. Most of issues very identical to mine. It's  like they are doing it on purpose. 

After that, I wrote a message to financial aid on a live chat and asked them why do I need to submit my highschool transcript for proof to get my financial aid? And they said that, it's up to the school what they need from the student. Well, hold on a minute, I was just told that it's financial aid that needs it. So I took a screen shot of that conversation. And from there, I'm still trying to figure out what to do. It would be nice to know what measures I could take.",30Oct2019,1
337,Not sure whats going on i turned 20 this year but I'm in  2nd year uni due to me resitting and I feel old and like ive wasted so many years due to my depression and anxiety.

338,"So 2 weeks ago, I barely did any school work except for some easy classes. The reason why being because I had a angered argument with my mom telling me I was failing Algebra. Im in 6 courses and im doing very good in all of them except Algebra. After the argument, I got so much of a dose of reality that I stopped doing work altogether, aside from some easy courses here and there, and started slacking off. I was worried that if I returned to Algebra, I wouldve fucked up hard and would have to go back to a public school I didnt like. I tried contacting the teachers for advice but all they gave me was a ""USE KHAN ACADEMY LOL!!!"" which just put me back at square one. I dont know what to do. Im worried",30Oct2019,1
339,"The other day I was contacted by someone who sent me a message basically describing and mocking a situation that had occurred last sem and I posted for advice on mental health subreddits (long story short both my grandparents passed away and I fell into the worst depressive episode and lived in an isolated situation with students who didn't speak english and fake friends who didn't include me outside of uni). I'm sort of ashamed of being lonely and venting that but not so much now as my situation is the opposite and I'm really happy :))


My situation drastically changed this sem and I am much happier and have heaps of friends who enjoy my company and we do lots together. I am also dating a great guy.


However, last year I was coerced by a guy that seemed really nice and genuine and sweet, into having sex with him after three months of talking, I'm not ashamed of that fact as its a normal aspect of life.


 But just found out through this message that he had taken an explicit video from behind when I was not aware and shared it to not only his friends but people in our class. To have your trust betrayed like that is crushing. I stopped talking to him not long after but he stalked me on insta with different accounts when I blocked him and got his best friend to contact me and send videos until I blocked him too.


I'm going to see the police about that as it is clearly a revenge porn crime and luckily new laws have been brought into my state to combat this.


However, this person (I have a pretty good idea who it is as it would have been someone we sat with first semester when it happened and the only other people were gay and one is overseas and not really friends) soon revealed themselves as a friend of this guy and stated that at his recent birthday party, he had brought this video out and other images that I posted a long time ago anonymously and forgot about on normal nudes to show weight loss progress when I was in a manic state and I'm ashamed of since I didn't delete them around the time I lost my grandma(I don't know how he found the account unless the original guy saw my username) and showed them to new friends of this guy who he met after I stopped speaking and who also share a class with me.


He stated that the guy brought me up at his party (I don't know why as we are done and haven't spoken for 1 year and a bit) and that the harrasser showed them the video and photos. He even stated that my face is identifiable but it would have to be the video and not the pics as I never showed my face. He kept asking for me to post more as well as he said he got himself off over the others which is degrading for me.


I've just tried to ignore him and his messages but each day (four days now) he sends a new, harrassing one that gets increasingly worse to bait me.


I do know that even if he deletes his account it will be stored in Reddits system with his ip address but I've taken screenshots just in case (shown below, sorry for all the redacts but there was a bit of personal information in it)


Is this enough to go to the police for a harrassment/cyberbullying claim? I really don't know what to do and I'm sick of it and I don't know how anyone could be so sociopathic and cruel.


I think I will also tell him that the video from his friend was non-consensual and I'm going to the police over it and hopefully that will take him down a notch and give him some of the experience I have had and he won't be so smug revealing stuff like that without doing his research.

340,"My mom currently lives on her own in a huge house she refuses to sell, and I think very much resents me not moving her in with my family. I try constantly to spend time with her not just socially but also helping her out. 

She is still working 60 hours a week in oil and gas. Most of her non-working time is spent buying and shipping things for our family in Venezuela. 

She has injured herself preparing these boxes and cleaning the house before. I have offered to have a handyman come every week to help us with the packing and loading - she outright refuses. 

I have offered to buy her a cleaning service - also outright refuses. 

She also has 7 cats and insists on boarding them whenever she travels which is stressful for everyone involved. I usually have to take a day off to help her with the drop off and pick up. I have found a trustworthy pet sitter (which I use) which would offer a cheaper and easier option - also outright refuses. 

All of this because ""I don't want someone in my house!"" Without any actual reasoning besides that she doesn't want it. I don't get it, I just don't see the reasoning. She doesn't have really nice stuff, just functional items. My grandfather was the same way and she used to get super upset with him over it. 

I am just at a loss. I don't have the time or energy to care for two households. I just want to understand her and I want to help.",30Oct2019,1
341,"I was fired from my job in May, 10 days before my wedding.  I worked there for almost four years, two weeks short of four years, to  be exact.  It was a complete surprise to me, and I broke down crying when I was told.  I'll never forget how my boss's boss said ""So we're gonna let you go"".  

It had nothing to do with performance or anything like that.  I was the number two, second to the owner.  I was a month away from getting  raise, in fact.  But apparently there were complaints against me from my coworkers that I'd said some inappropriate things.  My boss's boss rattled off a list of things I supposedly said.  One of the things was similar to something I'd said, but it was changed to sound sexual.  

Even though I denied the allegations, it didn't matter and they'd pulled me aside today to fire me without hearing my side of things.  Even though, there wasn't proof that'd I'd actually said these things, they were going to let me go.  Because I'd signed paperwork when I was promoted saying I'd avoid sexual misconduct.  Because the company shelled out tens of thousands of dollars the year before to a lawsuit where they were being sued for sexual misconduct.  Corporate was scared of being sued again.  So they fired me.  

Over the months, I've spent time trying to move, I got a new job which pays better and I like my coworkers better.  But even though I was about to quit the day before I was fired, it still hurts more than I can imagine, five months later.  I've spent hours and hours thinking about what happened, what went wrong.  When I'd thought I was on good terms with everyone there, who made up lies and apparently got someone to corroborate their story?  

Eventually I remembered getting onto a cook a few weeks before I got fired and I remembered how he'd said to me, exactly what I was accused of saying.  I'm not surprised it was this person who lied about me, but it's still difficult to deal with the fallout of his vindictive actions.  

Every ""How I Got Through Being Fired"" article I read always has the same issues.  Getting fired because of downsizing or lack of performance and those don't help me.  I wouldn't say that I was illegally fired, either because the company was well within their rights.  So how am I supposed to pick the pieces back up?  How do I move from this kind of thing?  I feel like I was MeToo'd and that's an incredible amount of shame to deal with.  I'm so incredibly embarrassed to be fired for sexual misconduct, and while that's not what it says on my file, it stills a giant stain on me.  How am I supposed to explain that at job interviews?  I know I got passed up for other jobs because the application asked if I'd been fired or not.  

And every time my current boss calls me into the office or pulls me aside, I get panicked.  My chest is tight and hot, and I tremble from anxiety.  I tell myself ""this is it.  I'm getting fired again.""  Every time my husband comes home early from work, I panic and think that it's happening to him too because why not?  Every joke a coworker makes about getting fired, I always think ""maybe they're not joking"".  I'm too afraid to be promoted at my current job because I don't want to be in a place where someone wants to see me getting taken down again.  It's been five months and I can't seem to heal.  

How do I move on from this?",30Oct2019,2

343,"I am a college student living away from home. For my birthday, my parents got me a present that costs a few hundred dollars. Recently, my roommates and I hosted a party at our house, which involved drinking and strangers (mutual friends) in our house. When we woke up the next morning, my present was gone. I know someone stole it because I take VERY good care of my things, especially if they are expensive. Nobody should have had any reason to go in my room, but I guess someone did. And I couldn't find it anywhere. I know this is pretty irresponsible of me, but I'm shocked that anyone we let into our home would do this. 

Luckily, the present is replaceable. It is not personalized, but it does suck that the stolen one was from my parents. I also have renter's insurance, so I can replace it. The only thing is- I need the receipt. So how do I ask my mom for a picture of the receipt without her figuring out that it was stolen from me? Should I just say ""Hey, my insurance wants to see the receipt, just in case, for the future""? What explanation or reasoning should I give her?

346,"Been a few months since I’ve joined this company as a software engineer. 


Few weeks back I was attached to my very first outsource project. My boss was supposed to be the middleman of this stating clearly that since I’m fairly new, I will not be communicating with any of the outsource people, and has to go through him. Fair enough. 

Once the project started, I was told to drop them an email if I have any questions. Wait a minute, that totally contradicts the statement he says before.

Well moving on, due to the lack of materials offsite, I was told to come up with an idea to work in the mean time or else head to the client’s work place itself. Since there’s no way for me to work with the lack of materials, I did told him that it’ll be better to work on site.

He then proceed to ask if I’m comfortable to work there. Being honest, I told him I’m not comfortable at all. I’d rather work offsite in my comfort zone (I did not tell him this).

He then proceed to ask why. And then says that I have to take the first step. That again contradicts on why he asked if I’m comfortable in the first place.


Well we have a Telegram chat for the project itself. But he proceeds to mention that if we have any questions, its better to drop them an email as its more formal. Then again proceeds to say that if we have any questions just drop it down in the chat, but don’t ask any stupid questions. What the heck?

Back when I first joined, everyone kinda peer pressures me that drinking to please clients are a must. That was uncomfortable as hell, and now he just contradicts everything he says? I’m so lost. What the heck do you want from me? What am I supposed to do? The thought of leaving the company haunts me till this day but the bills ain’t gonna pay for itself.

In my industry a standard work day is +12hrs and It's very common when freelancing in production to work 7 days a week, every week. Just in order to make ends meet and have a bit extra spending $. 

Now I absolutely love what I do and would never give it up for anythingelse. My 3 years of hard work are finally panning out as I've been getting higher profile gigs as of late, But when you spend that much time working it's hard to find other things to do (such as hobbies). It dosen't help that most of my friends work in my industry aswell. So whether on or off the clock we are almost always either talking shop, about our next gigs, or about movies we've seen. I've had this conversation with many colleagues &amp; friends and have read that this is a common issue in my industry.

I've heard some solutions such as golf, cars, fishing, etc. But those haven't Interested me. And I've met many a person who's just accepted the fact that we work constantly and that's it.

351,"
They have had a strained relationship for as long as I can remember. Some of my youngest memories include my mum telling me she is going to divorce my dad, my parents screaming at each other, my parents having emotional breakdowns in front of me, sleeping with my mum as she cries, constant fighting and more. It’s always been turbulent and I’m only just beginning to realise the impact this has had on myself and my relationships. 

Basically my mum found out my dad has been cheating on her for years. She also found out He has been using her money to pay for the hotel rooms. He was in charge of dealing with finances during the marriage and abused this power to put his salary aside for himself (his entire salary), grow the mortgage debt in the process and create a large share portfolio for himself. My mum has barely ever seen his salary as he has kept this private and separate. It seems as though he was planning to leave my mum for a long time but stuck around to better position himself financially. Basically to set himself up for life as he is not the main earner of the household. 

The worst is that years ago I found suspect texts on his phone that basically spelled out him being unfaithful. I confronted him and said I was going to tell her. He told me I didn’t understand the situation. I never told her as I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I feel as if I am to blame for my mum being taken advantage of. 

Since my mum found out, I haven’t spoken to my dad expect for maybe 2 or 3 angry texts to him in a moment of anger. He hasn’t spoken to me either. I have not seen him. It’s been 5 months. I don’t know if I ever want to see him again, he doesn’t seem to care much about me. He makes more of an effort with my sister probably because she is more easily manipulated.

356,"TLDR, Christian mom runs on classic ""HP bad, LOTR/Narnia good"" logic, I watched Harry Potter movies, enjoyed them, haven't told her for two years, think I should say something in case I get caught, but simultaneously feel like I shouldn't have to unless they see DVDs or something after I've moved out. 

Also, book puritans, please forgive me. I was at Bible College and had a lot more wor than I do at university, and even as a regular university student, I hardly have time to read for pleasure, so the movies were just easier, I'll read the books eventually. 

So, the Harry Potter debate is big in the Christian circles I'm in. My mom is anti Harry Potter just because magic and wizards. This wouldn't be so bad if she wasn't still treating me like I'm 10 when it comes to subjects along the lines of magic and anything supernatural/potentially evil. I kid you not, I learned a few months ago that my mom was almost anti Monsters Inc. because monsters, and it took her fellow Christian mom friend explaining the actual plot before she gave it a chance. 

And this subject goes beyond me not watching certain movies while people are home, she and I heard a weird noise in the house, neither of us knew what it was, and having just watched Phantom of the Opera again, I said ""well then, it must be a ghost"", to which she replied ""we don't believe in ghosts"". Strong emphasis on that WE. Mom, I'm 20 years old. I may still live with you because this is cheaper than an apartment, but you don't think for me anymore. 

Anyway, I grew curious about HP because a few friends said I'd really like it. Several friends, Christians AND atheists, pointed out Christian symbolism in it all, and when I finally had an arguement, I confronted my mom about why HP is bad. When I asked about my key arguement, she literally said ""I don't know"" and left the room. It was at this point I decided to see if I thought it was bad by judging the content.

My roommate at the time was a fan herself, and she watched the movies with me. I loved them! I felt the same magic as I did when I was 12 and watching star wars for the first time with my dad. Problem is I was only there for a year, so I only had that year with the movies.

I just want to make my jokes, have my friends call me a slytherin without paranoia, and let my mom know that I'm an adult and she doesn't dictate what I like anymore. Not like she did much of that when I was in high school, but I'm 20. This is getting old, and I have a good relationship with my mom, I just want her to back off.  Similar things with other areas where we disagree (media and leggings mostly). 

I just want to know if/when I should talk about this stuff, or put up with it for another 2 years minimum before I move out.",30Oct2019,1
357,"so hi dear reader thanks for taking the time to read this so i am in collage right and there is a girl is always eye balling me and walking in front me and watching me following me where ever i go just to keep and an i on me or i should say admire me? anyway see i never been in a relationship i been always the coach on these stuff to my friends but its hard when you are in the situation so i will list the reasons why am not going for the move



1-she was with one of my ""close friends"" they didn't get in a serious thing it was i think 3 weeks maximum so am not that type of dude that would talk to his friends ex's (once before they broke up he told me that she told him that she is in love with my eyes and they way i look that is year and a half ago (yea its been that long she got her on me) and am not sure if that was the reason they broke up or not.

2-she is not my type (body wise) i feel like an assh*** saying that but i have a rule to myself when i find  the one its either she is the package am looking for or am not wasting her/my time (although i would like to maybe motivate her to workout? to become a better version of herself but maybe that would break her and she would take it personally (note am not body shaming her or anything like that but what i think about is that if she is not taking care of herself idk I don’t like a girl that is not looking to herself in the mirror)

3-she is easy so this one am not sure but i will write what i see so she been with i think two to three guys in 2 years one of em is my friend and that i really dont like in a girl not that she been with somebody other than me but like that she move on quick? and that she might be a player or something.

4-that she is taking revenge of my friend by getting to me (i honestly doubt this point but who knows maybe am just listing stuff at this point to maybe give myself excuses ? or just the bitter truth idk.



so the aftermath of my mind i think in stuff too deep as u can see so its really hard for me to decide without asking other people which i dont do with my so called my friends cause most of them are here for the laugh as some people say and tbh one of my flaws maybe is that i dont like to be vulnerable so am afraid from people breaking me cause i get attached too quick like sooo quick so yea thanks for sticking for the ride of reading and am all ears :)

360,"I’m going to make this as short as possible.

Backstory: A few years ago I had a very close friend. He was older than me and became a father figure. In fact he told people I was like a daughter to him, signed his emails “dad” and really was like a dad to me. (This was huge because I didn’t have a dad growing up. My father left my mother before I was born and had no interest in me.) Then things changed. He started snapping at me, attacking me online, putting me down for sharing my political opinions and for having depression, and being condescending. I couldn’t do anything else, He always apologized and I knew he was under severe stress so I kept excusing it. Then he got very angry one day and screamed that he didn’t actually care about me or think of me as his daughter, he was just being nice. It broke me into a million pieces and I closed myself off from others. Swore I’d never let anyone in again. Shied away from making friends and just shut down. It took a long time for me to work through it and heal. 

Well I have a friend on FB I’m fond of and recently got to spend some time with them in person at a Star Trek convention we both attended. We really connected and hit it off. It was like we’d known each other for years. It was a great weekend.

But now things have changed. I get only curt 1 or 2 word responses to my texts or messages, if they respond at all,which is a bit jarring after them being so warm and friendly all weekend. 

I don’t know what to think or do. I’m so afraid I’m going to get hurt again. Why would someone go so cold after being friendly and telling others how much they enjoyed my company? This is the first time I’ve met a FB friend and let myself open up to others since the friend I mentioned in the beginning hurt me so bad and I can’t bear the thought of getting hurt again. What should I do? Am I overreacting? Please help me. I’m only 23 so maybe I’m being stupid.",30Oct2019,32

I'm 27M I have been meeting up with this girl who is 25F for about 3 weeks now and nothing has happened not even a kiss or hug because imma bitch and I am afraid to make a move because I don't know if she likes me that way because my friend (m) kissed her before during the summer then they sorta fell off but still meet up for a smoke but rarely. so like she would text me asking to come out for a smoke but like smoke it and talk for litterly 20 seconds after finishing smoking and drive on (my car is getting fixed) she doesn't even give me a chance to try make a move or even like see if she's interested. Thing is when we're texting she kinda does show interest in me like the other day me and my friend (m) went for a spin to this place and when I got back she was asking me about it and I was like yeah was great blah blah and she text "" Yeah that looks like a great place for a date😉😂""  like bro wtf? 

Then yesterday she won some competition and was like woo and I was the same woo and she said only thing is I have no one to go with 🙃 like is she throwing a massive sign up saying ""I LIKE YOU ASK ME OUT ON A DATE ALREADY""

Fastforward a couple months, I'm studying and my other friend that was like me and couldn't afford to go got a good paying job and well was in a position where he was able to. 

So then the situatino became those 3 going and I'm not because, well, I'm poor.

I became close friends with this girl and ended up falling for her and as you would expect she doesn't feel the same way about me but I mean a lot to her. The thing is I know I'm being selfish when I say I want to get rid of her because I'm not thinking about her feelings but she's the only thing in my life that keeps me happy so anything she does affects me a lot and it's bad for me and her because I don't want to get sad every time she's seeing a guy. It's unfair to the girls I date too because I know they deserve better. I obviously can't tell them I'm in love with this really close friend of mine. 
She (my close friend) told me she can keep these things a secret (that shes seeing someone) but for how long can it go on? I also know people will tell me to try to get over my feelings for her but I really don't want to because I can't not love her. She's amazing.

So  long story short: I grew up in a very exclusive community and was  socially rejected as I came from a weird family with no money and was  very quiet. Essentially socially shunned/invisible my whole childhood.  Never felt loved by my batshit crazy mother who got violent if someone  dropped a plate (or some small misstep) and cruel father who brainwashed  us to be obsessed with work/survival.

I've been to therapy to deal with it, and it took me 10 years to get to the point where I can say I forgive everyone involved.  
Despite  years of working terrible jobs and hating myself, I've managed to get a  ""second chance"" starting a masters program in another city which I am  quite grateful for.

Been doing  everything right: joining clubs, talking to people, trips planned,  online dating. On the surface it seems like I have a full life. But  really I am finding that no one wants to be friends with me in my  masters, and people can sense my self-hatred/low self esteem and  discomfort with myself. I don't feel like I am good enough to talk to people, to sit with them, to be associated, I feel like I will bring other people down. I honestly don't feel good enough for a relationship, but its  not like anyone good wants that with me either.

I  don't want to screw everything up but I still can't help but hate  myself. I'm so closed off because inside I feel unhappy with myself. I  also had dreams of going to law school but I really don't think that  would bring out the best in me, as well as dreams of being a fashion  designer.

365,"When my girlfriend found out that her ex and her best friend were sending nudes to each other, it obviously wasn’t the best news to her. So she decided to check if this was true or if it was all just in her head . First, She tried to log in to her best friends account but that didn’t work so then she logged into her exes, as she evidently still knew the password. When she found the nudes she got extremely angry, and black mailed her friend as an anonymous person with her nudes. Throughout the week her friend was having panic attacks. At the end of the week she admitted it was her to her friend and admitted it to me 4 days later after lying the whole time about who it was. 
As a result of this all her friends hated her, and for a while she was isolated from the school community. I was quite worried about her as she started saying she was cutting herself and was in a really low place. I felt bad about all this so I stuck by her through it all. It has probably caused a few people to dislike me and even some of my own friends started to act different after it happened as I stuck by her.
A few months have gone by now and she has found friends and is not alone. So there is no reason to be there for her  because of her isolation. Regrettably we have still been hooking up throughout all this. She says that she only did it because her friend was lying to her and she does have problems with controlling her anger but I’m not sure. I can’t really find a reason as to why she would do it that is not still being hooked on her ex. I’m just in need of some advice. Am I a complete idiot for forgiving her and should I start to drift from her now she’s found some friends? or should I continue the way I’m going as we are still good friends ?

I've been told that I should not try to understand the course material or get the full picture. ""Just memorize the lectures."" The week that followed was not pretty.

Don't get me wrong, I love learning. I used to spend all my time listening to podcasts, master classes or lectures while gaming/commuting. I read, when not extremely depressed - usually non-fiction. I try to do personal projects - I learned programming, 3d graphics and a few game engines before 14. Lots of IT, writing and sociology stuff followed. Yet I was dumb enough not to finish my projects once I learned from them. I also lost most of it with a faulty hard drive anyway. Only now can I start making up for it, as the last few years were a constant battle with depression.

**TL;DR:** Should I tell my mother I want to end my life because we live with my abusive father unless we move away?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 27 year old living in Europe. I live in a very dysfunctional family, nothing new under the sun, everybody has had their troubles. The problem is this has been going on for all my life. The root of the problem is my father.   
Ten years ago I broke contact with him because of how he treated me. He never understood why and he still can't wrap his head around it. My big sister and little brother still have contact with him - shaky but contact nonetheless. He belittles us, never remembers our birthdays, don't know our age, bullies us, tells us how bad we are, don't believe in us etc.  It took years for my sister to respect my decision but now she understands because she knows how messed up our father is. My little brother is estranged from me thanks to our father thanks to all the hate he spews in his ear about me.  


Now to the problem: We all live in the same house. My sister moved some years ago, but my brother still lives here and lives off of our father, for example he doesn't work and don't have to pay his own bills. Our father does that for him. My mother lives here, she's my safe port. And our father lives here. He lives on the lot but in his own quarters he built decades ago. So not part of the house. Thankfully.   
We never have people over because of the tension in our family. In our home town everybody loves our father and thinks he's the best so they think we have a lovely life here inside our walls. If you ever tell someone who knows our father beforehand how abusive he is they will not believe you because he's such a good sport to everyone else - except us.

  
I avoid him every day because he's caused me so much trauma. If he's inside the house and I've been out walking my dog I wait outside in the garden until he leaves so I don't have to face him. When he comes into the house I leave and lock myself in my room. Whenever he's present I exclude myself automatically. It's unbearable but more bearable than actually having to face him.  


Which I did a couple of days ago. He was screaming at my mother and being nasty so I stepped between them. I told him to leave the room because he was being so awful. He proceeded to threaten me and told me very sarcastically 'good luck in life'. My brother heard all this and said that I should watch my mouth. My brother has threatened me with violence before.   
The other day our father spoke to my sister and blew up in her face, calling her an alcoholic bitch and that he never wants to hear from her again. (because she's sided with me. He sees it as sides in a game of sports)  
Needless to say this broke me because there's something incredibly heartbreaking about being hated by your own family just because you want to protect yourself + your mother. It's an odd feeling and it hurts me.   


I have struggled with a deep depression for years and suicidal thoughts. I have nightmares about my father and my little brother hurting me and my mother. Mostly me. The problem is that for my mother it's just her unruly son and her ex husband. They are tied together in the mortgage for the house and unless she coughs up half a million to pay her side of the loan she can never leave or move. She's tied down.   
Me? I have no education thanks to my decade long fight with depression and anxiety. I have no income at all. I am aiming at finishing my college degree next year if my mental health is ok.   


**Which leads me to my question;** because I am so fundamentally scared and tired of life I have no will of living if it's in this house among people that hate me for just existing - I want to end my life. My mother can stand life here, she just says ""If we have each other it will be all right"". Which is true but for how long? 

I am faced every day with torment and hate. I am not wanted here. It is so difficult. I have no future. I see myself dying in this house. Is it wrong to tell my mother that I will die here if we never leave? Is that wrong to say or should I be honest? I know her hands are somewhat tied because she works minimum wage and she's nearing 60. We have no idea what to do. Neither my father or brother pays any rent or help with the electrical bill.

383,"Okay so basically when i was in secondary school i met this guy, we used to be best friends and hangout everyday together. He had a fat crush on me but i never noticed until he told me 5 years later, so when i finished school and went to college, this led to separation. So anyways, i’m in college 5 years later doing my thing and my other friend which i didn’t know he has contact with my old best friend popped up and got us two back together, i saw in my friends DMs that he was interested in me and would love to date, so we then started talking and i was so happy to get him back. However, i’m an a-romantic person who doesn’t do relationships, i’ve told him this before it started to become more serious. So as the time passed by we started to become very close with each other, telling each other everything, doing drugs together and spending most of our time hanging out. Everything was cool until i found out he had been in a secret relationship with a MAN behind my back for like two months, during that time i noticed something was wrong but i would have never thought this would happen, so anyways during his relationship he didn’t stop being intimate, we cuddled, kissed and held each other like nothing happened. So when i found out that he has a secret boyfriend, i wasn’t angry about it because i knew that he wanted a relationship and i couldn’t give it to him, i just wanted to know why he hadn’t told me about it earlier, and he said he was scared of my reaction, since then we’re still good old friends, even though he has a boyfriend he doesn’t hold himself back, there’s still so much physical intimacy, and that drives his BF mad and jealous, even though he convinces him he’s fully gay and it’s just platonic affection.  I talked with him about his sexuality, he said he wanted to experience and that if they break up he’d never go out with another dude and he said gay sex is disgusting. He didn’t deny that he loves his current partner, however the relationship is very toxic and there’s so much individual differences that it just won’t work out, lately i’ve been feeling very distant with him, i don’t know if i want to be his friend anymore after what he did, i’ve been trying to support him and his relationship but it’s like talking to a wall, someone please give me advice on what to do.",30Oct2019,1

I barely attended high school at all, and never graduated. I coasted through pretty much everything up to grade 12. My parents tried several times to get me to go through online (and local) courses to get my GED. I never put in the effort required and loathed the entire process.

I passed almost all of my courses through high school largely due to the fact that I knew the majority of it already due to overlap with my hobbies and not due to any real effort on my part in learning the course material.

I rarely engaged with my peers during high school and haven't maintained contact with any of them, even going as far as actively avoiding interacting with them (I was invited to be the best man at a friends wedding and said **no** to them like a moron) out of shame and fear.

I have IBS-D (chronic diarrhea), and I spent around 15 years trying to fix this without any success across dozens of different doctors. This used to stress the fuck out of me, and I was terrified to go to school when my IBS was really bad. Now though I just don't care, it seems to be the only thing people consider bad enough to qualify me for a disability pension so I guess I just live with diarrhea now. Better than wasting my time stressing out over another colonoscopy anyway.

I don't want to take anxiety or depression medication. I've already tried both in the past with little to zero improvement. In my opinion any chemical imbalance (if it even exists) is caused by my trauma and coping mechanisms (not the other way around) and treating the symptom instead of the cause seems doomed to fail. I'm probably not the best judge of this though.

I also don't have a drivers license. I did try driving once but found the entire process terrifying (both financially and literally -- I'm nearsighted and easily get motion sickness).

For the longest time I just sort of accepted my situation, choosing to ignore reality and hide online, but I was recently caught off guard with the revelation that I desperately want a relationship. Even just reading about people in happy relationships physically hurts. I can't see any path from where I am now to the functional adult state I'd need to be in to even consider inflicting my insanity on another person.

Even just posting this online terrifies me, both because it feels hopeless and because I'm irrationally scared of showing people this side of me. I feel broken, and I have no idea how to fix myself. I don't want to waste another decade of my life like this.

I feel like if I don't post this now I'm never going to do it, so sorry if this seems aimless and thank you.",30Oct2019,1
385,"Hi,

So basically, we got a bit drunk the other night and I kinda spilt the beans over one of my flatmates. The problem with my flatmate is that he tends to ask people if they want to do something together but never checks if the other person is up for it, which I kinda find a bit annoying. Anyways, so we got drunk and played this game where you have to assign a card to a person that fits their traits. I picked up a card which had a bit of an insult on it (little bitch) and assigned it to him. Ended up ranting about it only to have my other flatmate take his side, that’s when I realised I fucked up. I tried to keep it cool by saying “flatmate 1” got the basic bitch card so flatmate 2 gets the “little” one but I guess it was too late at the point.

So how do you guys think I should go on from here? I don’t want things to be awkward between us and I feel like he’s a good friend. I’ve already  apologised and told him I didn’t mean it in a negative way, just did it for the game. But I still feel things are awkward.",30Oct2019,2
386,"We’re just friends and although we shared mutual feelings, he didn’t want to get into a relationship nor did I due to circumstances. But his treatment towards me had been hot and cold. And when I needed his company, he always couldn’t make it. I know we’re just friends at that point and he’s not obliged to say yes but it still hurt my feelings when he declined my request. And I tend to get upset about it which I know I shouldn’t.

We got into an argument and ever since, we just stopped talking. He did something to trigger me and never bothered to apologize. I made it clear to him that I didn’t like the way he reacted after declining my invite for a movie and when I confronted him again wanting to make up, he just chose to back away and ignore me.

It’s been two months and I constantly get advices that if he still saw me as a friend, he would have come look for me and talk to me. And that he’s not worth my concern. But until now, I still can’t seem to move on. I want to know what he’s truly feeling and why he chooses not to talk to me despite telling a mutual friend that he still wanted to be friends with me. There were a few times when I thought I had actually moved on but in the end I’m back at square one again. I don’t want to feel this way but I just can’t get rid of it.

I'm a 22 y/o dating a 27 y/o women that I met online through a circle of friends. We've been together for almost 19 months now and we met in person for the first time last week. I live in NY and she lives in Singapore, we met halfway and spent a week on vacation together. It was probably the best week of my life. We always texted, always Skyped but none of that came close to being with her physically, and I miss that terribly. 

I'm have a bachelor's in operations management and was picked up by a recruiting firm straight out of college. I'm getting paid 40k (minimum wage, 55 hr work week, no comission) with no benefits and an arbitrary bonus at the end of every year. I'm already thinking of marrying this girl and bringing her here asap but I don't have the finances or career to do so, especially in NYC. I think I need a better job as this one is very stingy when it comes to pay. They recently offered me a promotion and a vision for me but I honestly can't trust it fully. At the same time, I don't even know what I can do for work as recruiting is a little sidetrack of my career focus in college.

Personally, I always wanted to be that guy in a company that manages processes and implements new policies and procedures to optimize efficiency. (I took a class in supply chain management, didn't really like it but I might study it  again on my own). I also enjoy employee relations and making sure my people are happy with the company, creating policies that both the company and the staff can benefit from.

For example she does not text me first even though she used to do it and while she replies right away to my messages often after 5 or 6 messages she stops replying for a few hours. As for going out it is always me to propose and on this weekend I was a bit upset because when I asked her out she said she was booked every day but Friday and later she said she forgot she's having a party on Friday that I can join if I want and maybe we can possibly meet on Saturday during the day (On Friday the party will finish late so we're unlikely to meet on Saturday and so if I want to see her I would have to go to the party). She also says she is not dating others but I cannot be sure of that. Anyway, I have been feeling like she got distant and so I decided to tell her that and she replied by saying that I never text her. I replied that I could say the same and while it is true I am not a big texter I feel that lately when I text the conversation dies quickly and I am also the only one setting up dates. She replied saying that I am the one that barely responds and texts back and that I should check the past convos. Knowing I did return her texts I asked if she could point to some convos where she felt I didn't but she only said ""Can't be bothered"" (maybe because she could not find any). As for the going out thing she said that even with her friends it's always them to ask her out otherwise she'd rather stay at home. I know that this is likely not true because for one of our date she actually invited her friends and asked me if I wanted to join. After that I asked if she would wait for the other party to always organize even if she was in a relationship and she just said I am not in a relationship. One strange thing is that the couple of times that I removed my profile picture from the app where we chat she wrote me within 1h asking why the picture was gone so I am not sure she is ghosting me if she does that.

404,"Good morning,

I hope everyone is having a great Wednesday. 

I have come to realise that I rely on coffee and energy drinks to get me through the day way too much. Three weeks ago I tallied it up and realised I would have 5-7 cups of coffee per day (breakfast, when I get to work, morning break, lunch, afternoon break, then when I get home). I am a father of twins and that week both were ill (sleepless nights, yay!). To compensate, I would have an energy drink or two per day on top of the coffee.

I know this needs to stop. I decided I would have a caffeine-free November as a challenge to myself. In preparation I have massively cut down on my intake; first I cut to three per day for a week (breakfast, lunch then afternoon break) and last week and this week I have cut to just one cup at breakfast. From Friday I will have nothing. No coffee, no tea (not even decaffeinated).

I would like a little bit of advice with regards to caffeine withdrawal.

When I cut down, I developed a headache that took 3-4 days to clear. Thankfully I no longer have the headache and I know from previous experience that the headache is directly linked to withdrawal.

Currently I am tired. I used to go to bed at 23:00-00:00 and wake up at 06:00 with no issues. Now I am so tired I am going to bed at 22:00 at the latest.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this part of the withdrawal process or have I lost 1-2 hours of the day forever? Is the droop in energy merely temporary? Am I doing all the right things in order to prepare for November? All help is truly appreciated.",30Oct2019,1
405,"I moved to Virginia about 10 years ago and made two really good girl friends. We were all weirdos, liked to have fun running the neighborhood, and had similar interests. Now we are 25-26. He have remained good friends over the years and I even lived with one of them. 
I try my best daily to be positive, kind, helpful and a good friend. I often ask my friends how they are, check up on their well being, send them memes that remind me of them, and generally like to keep things light. 
The past year everything has gone so sour between us...er...them.
First off, friend #1 had sex with friend #2s boyfriend and she still doesn’t know (but I unfortunately just found out).
Friend #2 gets drunk often, driving around when she shouldn’t, and has recently broke up with her boyfriend of 8 years so she can go out and have sex with different guys (which honestly I don’t blame her leaving her boyfriend since he did cheat on her with friend #1). She’s feeling that 25 year old spite of not wanting to regret her current decisions...yet is making bad decisions. And for the record, friend #2 has jealousy issues and keeps me at a distance because she doesn’t like the way we look next to each other. I only know this because 10 years of friendship shows you someone’s true colors. 
Both friends #1 &amp; #2 hang out together and leave me behind, yet they are bad influences on each other and are screwing up big time. They keep posting on social media about how “they are so in love” but they clearly aren’t.

406,"Before I explain, a bit of background first. I'm 25 (going on 26 soon) and I have some early childhood trauma so I was often punished when trying to learn new tasks and I was heavily punished for asking any and all questions. This abuse persisted from the age of 6 to the age of 16. I did well in school early on (pre-middle school) but mostly because all of my learning was very rote. I can copy and regurgitate just about any piece of information thrown at me, but I struggle to solve problems myself. This has lead to me being an adult that resists new scenarios and resists asking questions (both to myself mentally and even with other adults I trust). I've never been diagnosed with any form of learning disorder, however I'm noticing that I often lack the ability to logically work through problems on my own or understand data of any kind. This leads to me repeating the same mistakes, banging my head through a wall until I finally bash my way through the problem extremely clumsily (or in most cases) never truly understand the problem or how to solve it at all. I struggle to learn anything on my own, and if I do have someone teaching me, they have to do a lot of hand holding/rote style learning which doesn't actually help teach me how to work on solving problems on my own. It feels immensely frustrating to \*want\* to learn but to have issues learning in and of itself. 

Some people say that critical thinking skills can't be taught but I want to disagree. I don't feel as though I'm unable to learn or that I will never be able to become more analytically inclined or understand the information put before me. I do accept that, developmentally, I do not feel on par with most other adults. Then again my standards might be very high because science is a passion of mine and I want to pursue a STEM related career but that's neither here nor there. This is becoming more noticeable to me, and it's making it difficult for me to pursue higher education and actually truly understand and retain the information that I am paying for. It's gotten to the point where I struggle asking for help and I struggle to learn on my own even when I try my best via slow diligent practice.

In conclusion: I want to learn how to learn. I want to learn how to accept information, analyze it, and then build understanding by asking questions and so forth. I want to learn how to efficiently build up my problem solving skills. I want to be able to better understand the world around me and be able to draw up understanding from my own analysis. I'm willing to hear any opinions, advice, redirection to physical resources (textbooks etc.) and anything else you feel may help me better understand how to go back and work on developing these steps that I sorely missed. I'm not against being taught information, but I do want to feel like I'm able to problem solve and learn from my mistakes without needing others to help me see these things. If there's anyone that has advice on where I can start, exercises I can try, or resources that I can use I'd be immensely grateful.",30Oct2019,1

I’ve been dating my Partner (19F) for 3 years. It started back in 2016. It’s been an emotional roller coaster for me at least due to some past history.

I had a best friend who I had feelings for back then but never asked her out because she liked someone else. Never told her about my feelings either cause I didn’t want to ruin the relationship nor embarrass my self. I tried forgetting her and met my current gf. I thought I had lost the feelings for my best friend and grew feelings for my girlfriend. 

I told her about passed feeling towards my best friend and soon told me she didn’t want me hanging out with her. I didn’t for a while but I began to miss her atleast being around her. I found out she started dating her crush but I hit her up and we began to sneak out and see each other at night just to hangout. Her boyfriend didn’t like me much either but she didn’t care. She still snuck out with me. 

Being with my best-friend was an amazing feeling. It felt like a drug. I just wanted more and couldn’t get enough. The memories the moments we had I wanted it. So I hung out with her and went out at night from view points to the city. To her house. We just hung out it was never flirtatious nor did I ever kiss her or do anything of that kind. It was just hanging out being in the moment and talking about life.  During that time I realized that not only did I miss her but my feelings never left for my best friend. 

That begin to make me distant from my relationship and we begin to have problems and argued. My girlfriend argued constantly about me not loving her. I knew that I loved her but maybe I loved her as friend. My best friend and I stopped hanging out and I began to focus on the relation I have. Till this day we still argue about me. How she feels I’m distant or I don’t try. I try everything to make her happy. I try to make the relationship work but I still think about my best friend. I miss when we would hangout. I miss her. She’s still dating her crush right now and seems happy and I’m happy for her. I’m trying so hard to forget her and focus on my current girlfriend. She’s met my family and my family loves her.  I don’t know what to do anymore. 

I’m lost should I stay with my current Girlfriend and forget about my best friend? And if so how can I forget about her?

I broke up with him a little over a month ago, and since then we've talked things through and we're friends. We text all the time and don't meet much, but it's a very tight very platonic situation.

What I do miss, however, is sleeping with him. I'm absolutely certain I do not want to date him again, and I'm also certain he would never say no should I make a move. The problem here is, however, that he still is really romantically interested in me, hasn't gotten over the breakup completely, and I feel I'll be leading him on if I do anything— even if I make it 100% clear, as I have, that I'm not open to being in a relationship with him again, I feel he may end up getting too attached and hurt ultimately.

I'm not someone for whom sleeping with someone is easy, it took me ages to get comfortable enough with him. It's an if-not-him-then-nobody situation. 

Tldr, I REALLY want to sleep with my ex but I'm afraid I'll be hurting him by doing so.",30Oct2019,0

I am trying to FUCK my Wife's sister. She is 12 but the IQ of a 5 year old and has down syndrome. It has allowed me to French kiss her a bunch of times. LOVE JAMMING MY TONGUE IN HER MOUTH. BUT REALLY CAN'T WAIT TO JAM IT IN HER PUSSY. I have felt her breast (nice C CUP TITS TO BOAST AS WELL AS NICE PUFFY NIPPLES) and have rubbed her ass while frenching her . NICE CURVES. I have also felt her soft PUSSY FUR and I have put part of my finger in her, but her camel toe is small and tight. . We are going to be alone this weekend for about 5 hours. I want her pussy so bad. I know she is so tight and I would ROCK her world. Any ideas? I really WANT THIS. NEED HER PUSSY BAD. I will use lube as well because I don't want to hurt her too badly. Thanks Family Have a blessed day PS I promise NOT to get her pregnant!!! I JUST KNOW HER SLIT is SO TIGHT AND SMALL!! Can't wait to see the look in her eyes, the moment I POP HER! WOW!\\ This is what love is all about. I explained about making LOVE and how important it is. She has not had love made to her so i have a chance to pop a cherry. I told her that making love is important and she will die before she is 13 if she does not have loved made to her. She is scared and does not want to die. I told her, that if I can make love to her and keep it a BIG SPECIAL SECRET she will be fine. I think I got her hook line and sinker! Caring and SHARING while we suffer the burden of taking care of these rejects. God Bless you all and thank you for the well wishes and advice!!! Love my new REDDIT FAMILY!!

424,"For the past year or so, my biological 'family' has not been the best.

To be more specific, they've been sexist and homophobic- not realising that I'm LGBT (I'm half-closeted), and it gets harder every day to not just break down and cry. Not the best idea though, as I'm screamed at to shut up. I've spoken to a friend and after a few months of me opening up to them, they concluded (and told me) that they thought my family was emotionally abusive. I've only seen more and more evidence of this over time- but I'm too scared to do anything- I'm making excuses that it's unintentional when I don't know.

The final straw happened about a month ago, and I still haven't done much anything.  My older sister got a boyfriend, without my parents knowing. Now, they are ridiculously religious and restricting (hence why I'm typing this in the middle of the night). They found out, and the shit hit the fan. 

All because of this one boy, I'm being moved schools after only one year at the only school I've ever been happy at, moving houses, have extreme restrictions on my phone, and am not allowed to talk to boys.

Why? none of this is my fault. I don't have any control over my sister. She does what she wants and I can't do anything.

But I'm leaving everything behind. Everything is a mess- It's exam season and the extra stress isn't doing me any good, my appetite and sleep patterns have drastically changed for the worse,  and I'm showing almost every conceivable physiological and physical symptoms of depression possible. Yet as luck would have it, seeking help for mental health, or even talking about it, is completely taboo. I don't know what to do. I'm a complete mess, unwashed and aching as I type this. 

For the first time, I realise that this isn't exactly normal. What should I do?",30Oct2019,1
425,"So there's me (27F), my fiancé (27M) and roommate (25M and henceforth referred to as Alex).

My partner and I are holding the lease on a 3 bedroom house and he is subletting a room off us. We've been here 6 months. We all moved in at the same time.

We made clear at the beginning that the house was not a ""flat."" It was our house and that we expected a higher standard of cleanliness than Alex was used to. We said he could use our second bathroom since it's in the back wing near his bedroom so he gets his own shower and toilet. The back wing of the house is also where our third (unused) bedroom is.

The first warning sign was him putting up his art in our lounge. I told him no, back wing only, but he didn't move it. Then one day I came by to find he'd taken a picture of ours down and put his own one up. I removed it and put it on his bed. A few days later, I found a couple more of his decorative items in our lounge and removed them too. 

Alex is currently on a benefit due to an injury to his wrists. It's RSI/tendonitis from playing his instrument (which is is very good at and on the way to becoming professional). So he doesn't have a lot of money. He'd been on this for at least a year prior to moving in with us and told us early on that he was ready to start looking for a job.

Meantime, he started using a bunch of our stuff. Laundry powder, fabric softener, butter, sugar, bread, coffee, ketchup, mustard, cooking oil.  Often without asking. He has still yet to contribute to our rubbish collection fee and is often late to pay his share of bills and rent, but does manage it eventually. 

He also doesn't do much to maintain the house. I like to keep things pretty clean and I find myself often cleaning up after him. It's especially annoying in the mornings when he leaves all his breakfast stuff out on the bench including our coffee. He's responsible for his bathroom and has cleaned it once in 6 months, and only when I discovered how dirty it was. He's vaccuumed maybe twice and helps out with the kitchen about once a fortnight.

His stuff has also expanded into our garage and spare room. When there was talk of us getting someone else into that room, he made a point of saying ""well if you're going to do that, my rent would have to come down like a LOT because I'd be sharing the back wing and the bathroom"". Neither of which are ""his"" and we both resented him speaking to us so authoritatively. We told him we'd have a discussion if and when we did bring somebody in.

Meantime, financé and I started a business. We hired 6 people, and to do him a favour, we hired him as a subcontractor as well and offered a good rate. Due to his injury, we agreed that he would work 5 half days per week.

Two weeks into this, he booked a bunch of gigs and did a load of damage to his wrist, essentially reversing months' worth of recovery. He had a huge panic attack about it and said he couldn't do work any more until it healed. In the meantime he's been borrowing money off us. We're okay for that because it will come out of his paycheck, but he's been borrowing so much that by this point he's unlikely to have much paycheck left which will probably affect his mental health.

He uses the money eating out and paying for WoW and other games. We've been quite annoyed because he's not going to physio to try and improve his wrists, instead he's telling us he's too injured to work and then spending all day playing games (super bad for wrist).

The kicker is that he seems really aloof about everything. He's a pretty chilled out guy. One example is that he's notoriously bad for leaving the lights on. I've spoken to him about it probably 10 different times and he still does it. Also I've told him to rinse his dishes before putting them in the dishwasher multiple times and I'm still having to pull them out and do it for him.

I can't help but feel like he is completely unaware of most of this. I've never met anyone like this before. You remind him of stuff and he politely acknowledges it, and then completely ignores it. We've never had any actual beef. He's made no effort to replace the stuff he uses or be more helpful, he's not helping himself to get back to work (and we gave him a SWEET deal) and generally his mental state seems fine too.

I have no idea what to do with this guy. I feel like I'm looking after a teenager and it's having an effect on our personal finances and on our business.

I think mainly I wanted to rant here since it's really hard to accurately describe this guy's personality and I think it'll be easy to read this and assume he's a total asshole - but it's not that. He's apparently just very very aloof and bad at reading social cues. I'm right on the edge of blowing up at him though, and I don't know how best to handle this.",30Oct2019,2

428,"To make a long story short
My older sister (32F) and her long time fiancé (30M) are going to jail. 
They have three kids 10,7, and 3yrs old. 
This all happened within the past 12 hours.
Due to legality I won’t go into detail on their charges but it’s quite serious and can land them a hefty time behind bars which is quite possible due to their history (although their criminal record is pretty clean) they have been involved with the cops for years and they are known to them. 

They’ve never been to Jail, they’re regular working parents. They made a big mistake which didn’t directly hurt anybody else.  Our parents are a mess of course, in their mid 50’s now In the midst of taking on 3 young kids with their already financial and mental strain after my dad’s recent stroke. My sister told my mum not to let the kids know what’s going on and to say they’re away for work until they’re sentenced and we figure things out.  

How do we cope with this so suddenly? 
Where do we begin? Please help",30Oct2019,2
429,"I have always been a stoner. I have always loved to smoke weed, but my habits were not affecting my life, deterring me from plans (short and longer term), slowing down my goals, and I never felt like I needed to quit **or** like I couldn't quit. I now  feel like I don't know how to stop. I have tried a few times and was successful for 3 days.   


I think the shift from being someone who loves smoking to being someone who can't stop smoking occurred in July. I moved into an apartment with a bunch of stoners. They are kind people who I consider them good friends, but they do enable me. I told them I want to quit smoking, which they support (verbally) but still offer me weed when they smoke around me. I have tried telling them to not offer it to me, which they have done sometimes but then... that doesn't last. I'm not blaming them or anyone, I know this is my own problem. My life and habits are my own doing!

I see them smoking in the living room every time I am ""quitting"" (or, rather, trying to)... and it is so tempting for me to be around it that I usually end up caving, asking for a hit, and then that turns into 5 hits which leads to me cancelling all of my plans since I need to stay home bc I'm either eating, watching TV, etc. or I'm passing out in my bed. 

So, even when I don't smoke weed, even when I resist any peer pressure, weed is available to me at any time. This is making things difficult... and, I end up smoking with my roommates 1-3 times a day. 

I am sleeping more and I'm feeling depressed when I'm sober which has lead to me abusing uppers like adderall and cocaine. I flushed my coke down the toilet and have been clean from that for months, but I still abuse adderall regularly (at least 4 days a week). I think I now understand that this abuse began because I felt like I was falling behind due to my weed smoking, which I realize is not okay... none of it is okay. I've wasted money on all of this, too, from the stuff I buy when I'm high to the cost of weed and adderall, too. My bedroom is a mess, my hygiene has times where it's bad (would have never allowed this in the past), I've stopped doing things that I used to enjoy, like running, cycling, reading, and traveling... and I also have gained some weight. 

I really need to stop. I guess admitting that I have a problem is the best first step... but I don't know what to do from here? 

I get that weed is not a ""habit forming substance"", but people can become addicted to anything and **I am addicted to marijuana.** 

I have realized that people do not take marijuana addiction seriously because it can't kill you and isn't considered addictive... but that does not mean that people can never be addicted. Right? People can become addicted to food, sugar, coffee, sex, tattoos, gambling, etc. but that does not mean that all of these things are bad. No one thinks that I have a problem and they enable me without realizing it. 

All advice, insight, personal experiences etc. are appreciated.

430,"Hello reddit! So I’m posting this from one of my throwaway accounts. Long story short last week I (22 F) was at the liquor store grabbing some stuff for a concert when I saw another woman there who looked around my age. Now I hate stereotyping people and assuming, but if I had to assume, based on her presentation (and yes I cringe while writing this), she is a lesbian. Now I’m bisexual, but I’ve never asked out another woman or been with one past making out and heavy petting. However I was instantly super attracted. Now fast forward to today, I go to buy a lighter at a gas station up the road and lo and behold the worker is, you guessed it, the same woman! Twice in less than 2 weeks! I was flustered which almost never happens and now I’m kicking myself for not asking for her number or something. 

Here’s my dilemma, part of me wants to go back another time and ask her out/for her number BUT I also don’t want to be like the creepy guys that hit on me while I’m at work. It can be flattering but more often than not I feel cornered and uncomfortable and I absolutely don’t want to do that.  If I knew I would see her in any other setting I wouldn’t think about asking for her number at work, but I literally don’t know her at all outside of seeing her twice. So reddit, I defer to you, should I ask her out or just leave it alone?

TL/DR: I’m a 22 F who is considering asking out another woman I’ve seen twice and am insanely attracted to, but unfortunately it would be at her job and I don’t know if that’s weird/creepy.",30Oct2019,1

444,"I need words of wisdom. In the past I've been offered several PhD opportunities and I've rejected all of them because I simply wasn't interested in, or passionate enough about the project to dedicate 3-4 years of my life on it. However, recently this changed and something really cutting edge and cool has come up in my field. I've been searching for something like this for a long time, and upon contacting the group I was offered the opportunity to start this interesting PhD project. The catch is that it's other side of the world in Europe, and I'm from Australia. I've worked and studied both in Europe and North America in the past, but not for more than one year at a time. I've been looking for full time jobs in my city, but it's not easy. There's honestly not much in my already specialised area (especially without a PhD) and as such my life is at a bit of a standstill. Even unrelated jobs are tough to get. I've had success consulting and it can be good money, but also unreliable.  Logically then, this seems like a good move right? The problem is I'm not sure I can handle being away from Australia for that long. I tend to miss home very much while abroad, and although I love traveling, 3-4 years away is a fair chunk of time. I'm not currently in a relationship, but all these little things make me sad.  Missing out on so much time with friends and family is messing with me. I'm just imagining all these silly or petty scenarios in my mind... in 3-4 years some of my best friends might have kids and then when I get back it'll no longer be the same, in that time my beloved pets might die, my parents will get older, I have a cabin I just recently built and furnished that I wont get to enjoy or work on.  At the same time, I feel like I can't just stay still and do nothing. There's a chance for me to work on some cutting edge research in regenerative medicine and such an opportunity probably won't come up again for a while.

The other option is to simply do a PhD project where I am now, but they're all very bland by comparison and it may lead to a few years of misery. If only I could arrange such a project here, that would be ideal, but also not that easy to do. I apologise for the length of this post. If anyone has words of wisdom or advice, I'd love to hear it! Is it worth doing a PhD in your dream project for 3-4 years but be away from everything and everyone you love?",30Oct2019,1

I know what it’s like. 

   To have an absent parent in your life. To do your all to try and impress them. To try and get their love, admiration, attention—and still get nothing. And if you’re in my situation watch him give it to another child.  

It **breaks** **you**. 

It leaves you second guessing yourself.  

What do they have that I don’t? 

   I  go to school just like them; do excellent bringing home A’s and B’s,  but still nothing. You slowly stop doing it for you because the person  you are trying to impress the most doesn’t give a *damn*. You begin to become envious of the other kids with both parents.  

At parent teachers conferences I’d see both students' parents and a fire would burn inside. Even sometimes towards my friends; going to their homes seeing both parents it was just a want. I **didn’t care** if my mother and father were together, or co-parenting. I just wanted to be able to speak to my dad.  

So many Christmases missed, so many times I didn’t get anything and when I did they were oversized clothes (wouldn’t even call to try and get proper sizes). That’s how I knew he didn’t care about me and it broke me. I grew to resent him, and slowly fall back. You’d think this is when I’d have moved on but… 

*No*. 

I tried again, again and again and still the same response. On my 18th birthday I feel he laughed, danced, and sang; that last payment and he didn’t have to deal with me *anymore*. 

But, I tell you this stressing for someone to be in your life will get you nowhere; I had to learn that (I think I actually learned when I told him I graduated and got no response). It took me so long to see it; my grandmother was both parents. She would take care of me and when my dad wasn’t there she was. My mother spoiled me the best she could.  

I  don’t know how you cope with it, or if you even try to—but eventually  all that disappointment you just get tired of it. I sat down one day and  I let it all out because I had forgot who I was and what I may not have  consumed me and blinded me. I realized that I got good grades for me no  one else whether or not my father cared or not. So even if he didn’t  see or cared; it was my future I was doing it for setting myself up for  success and that’s who you should do everything for.  

Put  yourself first: do good in school not for someone’s gratification who  has shown they don’t care, but for you and make those who are there  proud. Seeing my mom, my granny with a smile seeing my report card it  brought satisfaction, and eventually graduating I didn’t think about  what was missing; I only was focused on the there and now. 

You may be looking at what you don’t have: asking what is so wrong that makes the other parent not want anything to do with you… 

 but don’t let it consume you, don’t let it break you and don’t think that that’s what makes ***you***.",30Oct2019,3

451,"So lately my (F18) peers have pointed out that I dont have emotions, only joy and stress and have asked why don't I get mad, joke around (very rarely) , sad, frightened or any other emotion other than the two even when I talk. I've also been told that my face is hard to read so I just took it as a compliment that I'm mysterious in that way. I honestly never saw it that way since I am an introvert and quite socially awkward so in times like those, I just don't know what to do but either keep a straight face or smile.  But then I began to reflect on my past interactions with people then I realized how aloof I must be to other people. It doesn't help either that I don't have favorites/crushes so I have a hard time responding to  questions/statements like What kind of music do you like? or ""Person X is so dateable."" but I can understand all references from movies, vines, memes, pop culture etc that other people wouldn't probably understand. So in a way, I do have a personality when it comes to things like those but when we begin to talk about crushes or favorites or anything related to emotions, I don't have a lot to say. It has impacted my social life though since people tend to steer away from me when they do some banter or talk about their love life since I think that they think that I don't have a lot to say.

453,"Several months ago, a guy came up to me at work and told me I'm beautiful and asked if I'm single. I said I'm married. He basically said ok have a nice day and left. (side note: I get this maybe once or twice a year and it's flattering, but I'd rather do without the awkwardness of it. I'm in no way a cheater and I don't want to waste a guy's time, so I'm not gonna be very friendly cuz I wanna just nip it in the bud.)

Today, he came up to me again and said we met before. I said I remember. He asked if I wanted to be his friend. I said I don't know, I mean, I'm married (since he flirted with me before, I assumed he really meant more than friends). He said I know, I just mean friends. He said he's African so maybe I can help him with his English. Um... his English sounds great already and he only has a slight accent. He mentioned he also works in this building so therefore it's... convenient? I didn't know how to politely say no to this, so... I said ok.

He went on to say he's married too and they have a son. So why was he flirting with me before and now wants to be ""friends""?! Am I missing something?

Now I'm screwed because he asked me to put my name and number in his contacts. I wanted to give him fake info but thought he'd figure out pretty quickly that I gave him a fake number, and then he might come harass me about that. And now he's texting me... nothing weird, but I don't want to talk to him because I'm weirded out by the whole thing. Mostly because how he approached me seems weird, but also, I don't like people who are married with a kid but also flirting with someone else. I don't want to be ""friends"" with him.

How can I stop having anything to do with this guy? I gave him my number! Even if I change it, he'll realize and come ask me about it... that'd be awkward. And we work in the same place, apparently, so the odds he'll see me again are pretty high. Any help is appreciated!

454,"I’ve really hit a wall. I’m always up and down with my weight. I’ll be doing really well, and then I’ll binge. Recently, I’ve been having severe knee pain and I’m currently trying to have it figured out. Long story short I’m in Physical Therapy and they will not let me do any kind of physical activity that isn’t just upper body weights that isn’t supervised by them. I only go there twice a week. I’m dying to go back to the gym and do cardio. They won’t even let me do the bike by myself. They don’t want me doing anything lower body unless they’re supervising it.
I’m in pain every single day, both my knees are in severe amounts of pain. I’m crying almost every single day. I’ve had pain since I was a child, i used to think it was growing pains but it continued into adulthood. Ended up being I have a couple of medical issues. Mostly my patella is displaced and my kneecaps are in the wrong spots.
Im trying to get my doctors to preform the surgery to fix my knee caps but they’re reluctant because I’m so young (22) but i cant live like this. They say the surgery is barbaric. PT has made the pain not only worse, but another pain and showed up and is worse than the other pain i had. So now it’s painful in two spots. 
I just want to be active and live my life normally again. I’m in such a hole and I’m scared I’m going to just eat my feelings, I dont know what to do. I’m such a picky eater too. 
I’m currently 197, I started off at 220.
My primary doctor put me on diet pills because I told her about this whole situation. I’m scared when i get off of them I’m going to gain all of my weight back plus more... I am at such a loss. I want to get out and be active but I genuinely don’t know what to do. I’m getting a second opinion and an MRI done next Thursday (November 4th i believe).
My job has cut back my hours because of my pain. I’m on my feet all day (I work at a salon and we don’t get breaks or lunch breaks. I’m an assistant and we are treated worse than dairy cattle) and I’m also in school. I’m barely making ends meet to pay my bills. I am so stressed out I’m losing my hair. I just want to be better and get this surgery done with so I can be better. I’m planning to get into the ultrasound program as well.. it’s a 21 month program and i CANNOT take ANY time off from that or I will be kicked out and not readmitted back in. And at that time I will no longer have insurance. I just need some life advice on what to do. I have been planning on changing my job and working in a doctors office but if i end up needing the surgery I dont want to have to start a new job and then go on disability. 

TLDR: I want to be active but I’m scared of hurting myself further with my knee problems. My doctors aren’t helping me and are very reluctant about surgery. Want to switch jobs but if surgery is upcoming don’t want to start a job to just go out on disability. Also have an eating disorder. I can not afford to go to therapy until I find a new job and get more income. Just some general advice would be nice right now.",30Oct2019,1

459,"It's been a long-time coming. I honestly should have left when I drafted my two weeks notice up the last time , but bills n' stuff. 

Okay, so I'll start off with what I think officially kicked this all off.
A few months ago, a personal joke exceeded a mental line in my head, and I went a lil' ballistic.
Jokes about being gay, on the clock, had evolved into getting texts of a sexual nature from employees that were terminated months ago, and there's only one way this ex-employee could have gotten my number.

A current employee must have given it to them. 

So insert an hour of me calling the only two **current** employees that still converse with this ex-employee, to chew them out and get to the bottom of who gave this asshole my number so they could harass me at 9-9:30 PM.

Long story short, I couldn't get a direct answer from either of the two. 

So I texted my manager at the shop, to see if he could gain some clarity, or help rectify the situation. 

To no avail, neither is selling the other out. 

So I come into work the next morning, and ask manager what he intends to do about my getting harassed by ex and current employees while I'm sleeping.
He just got mad at the entire situation and proceeded to tell at me, and I left and went home for the day. 

Fast forward two days later, and now my boss has caught wind of it. 

So he pulls me and the two others into his office, and closes the door.

He has us explain each of our side of the story. I tell him mine and then I *finally* get to hear their perspective. 

Basically, they were all drinking at one of the current employees houses, and wanted to start some shit. I just happened to be the lucky contestant. 

So they sent a rather vulgar message, with the intent to sexually harass and anger me.

So at the end of the splainin', my boss looks at me and asks me, ""actual, do you feel like we need to start state paperwork up to have an investigation done?""
I said ""only if we need to touch base on the subject matter again.""
I shook hands with the two offenders, signalling that my issue with them was put to bed, and moved about my day, thinking we were past it.

That Saturday would prove me wrong though. 
As I get out on a job, that I'm finishing for one of the offenders, the apprentice that I had that day goes to the restroom. 

When apprentice comes out of said restroom, he directs my attention to some graffiti on the back wall of the port-a-john located on-site. He says ""I'll want to see it.""

So I go in and look, and lo and behold, in black sharpie, is the writing ""actual is a faggot and a snitch.""

Got really mad, two days after I just passed up the paperwork to start their firing process, and this?

Instead of blowing up a shit storm, I took a picture of the graffiti, and finished my job up. 

Less than a week ago one offender and manager were sitting in the office laughing about it all, after offender told me and manager he was indeed the one who marked the port-a-john.

Nothing happened. Now I'm just thinking that everyone here talks about me behind my back. Which I really don't care about. 

It's a matter of ethics and moral code. 
Which just doesn't really run rampant at our shop. 

So fast forward two weeks later, and I'm getting ping-ponged on every job it seems like, between my employer and my manager, I just hear about issue after issue on my jobs. 

This really bothers me because I'm a perfectionist. 
I start at the end of my line and work my way backwards so I **don't** miss anything, but I have been having a rough time the last two weeks with my roommate, who is off his meds, causing me to lose sleep as a result, but maybe they can see something I can't in my exhaustion. 

I accept the fact that I have to work under someone until I can get my schedule back on track. 

So they put me with a new-hire. A four-tour Iraqi war veteran who suffers from PTSD.

**Let me say right now that I harbor nothing but love for my fellow veteran. I think it's a damn shame that they have no time to decompress, and must transition from AD to civilian almost seamlessly, which causes a lot of frustration and sadness, which leads to altercations. I respect any and everyone who has the balls to don an outfit and serve this great country.**

That said, I went in with an understanding that I will have to walk on eggshells. But it was for his benefit, so I said fuck it, let's do it.

We worked together without issue for two weeks. 
Then we started a job for a woman I know personally.
So naturally, she's more comfortable talking to someone she is familiar with, rather than someone she is unfamiliar with.

The issue of a few missing lights come up. I try to deal with her. She calls the shop. My guy comes to me and tells me to direct her to him the next time she asks questions. 

So we're sitting in the garage, her talking to me, and I can hear him huffing and puffing behind me. So she asks me a question of ""well, can this be done?"" To which I reply, ""I can't give you an answer ma'am, I'm not the jurisdiction on the job anymore,"" in an attempt to get her to speak with the man in charge, and minimize pissing her off.

Well, it pissed him off. So he waits until she leaves, and then, with a smile on his face, turns to me, and asks me ""Do you have a problem with me?"" As he starts to close the gap between us.
I ask him, because of said smile ""are you kidding me?""
To which he replies ""no.""
I tell him no, I have a problem with her not listening to you, and making both of our lives harder.
Situation defused after 10 minutes of awkward silence, were communicating about the job to one another and have moved past it.

I did, however, explicitly explain to my boss that I didn't want to work with anyone else at this time, and never said anything about the last altercation. Until today. 

It was decided that I was to work with this guy again. I explained my side of the story, about how he made me feel uncomfortable, and explained that I didn't want to work with him again.

Well this pisses manager off. So instead of keeping this in the down-low, he starts to berate me, and throws me under the bus about not wanting to work with this guy, which angers him and now I'm getting threatened by this guy as I walk to my truck to bid the shithole farewell.

When she first started, she asked what time it was customary to arrive and leave. I told her there is flexibility (which there is) and she could choose her hours within reason as long as she was working 40 hours per week (she is paid hourly).

466,"Basically, I'm pretty sure that I've developed feelings for my best friends current boyfriend. 

To give a little bit of backstory, My friend and her boyfriend have been dating for a little over a year now. The reason that they met was because I had been friends with him for a while and he started to hang around me a lot supposedly because he was into me then, and since I spent a majority of my time with my friend, they eventually ended up meeting and we started to all hang out together. But since whatever romantic feelings he had at the time weren't reciprocated on my end, I kinda backed off. When I noticed that he and my friend had started hanging out just the two of them, I backed off the rest of the way because I was really happy that they were hitting it off. They ended up dating a few months later and we all started hanging out together again and it was all peachy for a while. Fast forward to now. Recently, I had been going through some personal issues and kinda ghosted the entire world for a minute there, and as a result, I had a sort of falling out with my friend (not on negative terms, we just stopped talking as much and spending as much time together.) I still do consider her my best friend in the world and love her to fucking pieces, there's just a slight distance there now. While I was isolating myself and being very recluse and not talking to pretty much anyone, my friends boyfriend reached out to me and kinda talked me out of that depressive hole I was in, which was definitely unexpected. We've started hanging out more often and a part of me felt really fucking guilty for spending this much time with my best friends man, but I tried to convince myself it was fine and totally harmless because we are just friends and it doesn't, nor will it ever, go beyond that. And that was true for a second I think. But now I'm fairly certain that the time we've been spending together made me catch unwanted feelings for him and I am livid cause I really just don't know what to do. I don't want to stop hanging out with him because despite me feeling that way towards him, he's still one of my closest friends, and obviously i'm not about to help my two best friends cheat on each other.

467,"Hi everyone, I'm a little frustrated.  My brother has tourette's, it's pretty severe, he has constant muscle spasms, wounds that won't close and serious arthritis due to this. 

(N: For those who don't know: ""Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive, stereotyped, involuntary movements and vocalizations called tics. Tics are involuntary, sudden, rapid, repetitive, non-rhythmic, simple or complex movements or vocalizations."")

He has both physical and verbal tics (grunts/squeaks), so he's been discriminated against a lot both growing up and as an adult. He's basically in constant pain all the time, and for the most part he deals with it.  However, occasionally (probably only 4-5 times in his life) he's had tourette's seizure episodes, where he's basically stuck on the floor convulsing for hours, some worse than others.  Unfortunately, this happened at his workplace the other day.  He works in a mall and they have those employee corridors that the back doors in the stores lead to for shipments and trash.  Basically he was having the seizure in a corridor and there were employees from another store, one girl was panicking asking if they should call security, HOWEVER, the other employee was laughing and whipped out his cellphone to FILM my brother.  Apparently he thought a person writhing in pain was HILARIOUS. Unable to stop him, you know being stuck spasming on the floor, my brother kinda tried to yell at him to stop, he laughed, called my brother crazy and left. Apparently, this guy only speaks Spanish (or so he said) because when they went to talk to him, he pretended like he didn't understand so they brought my brother's supervisor who is a native Spanish speaker to translate.  They kept asking him why he filmed and he just kept dodging the question instead of saying why or why not (or that he didn't film), then finally when they kept grilling him and asking him to delete the video, he said they weren't allowed to look at his phone (I understand, it's his phone and he has privacy, but he was filming my brother having a seizure?).  Then after all that, suddenly he claimed there was no video. Then apparently the dude and his other staff kept calling my brother crazy in Spanish AGAIN in their kitchen (they work in one of those open kitchen restaurant areas in the food court). My brother had to be escorted home and the spasms episode lasted for another few hours and then he had to walk on a cane to support himself.  I'm angry, but I don't know what to do about this situation or if I can even do anything?  Do I go to the store to complain?  Talk to their manager?  Will that even do anything? I just feel like that's such a trashy thing to do.  Who the fuck films a stranger in extreme pain for a quick laugh or to share with his friends?

tldr; I'm upset because my brother was convulsing severely on the floor for hours and this guy who works next door to his job laughed and filmed him on his cellphone, then lied about it, and proceeded to talk shit about him in Spanish thinking he wouldn't understand.

471,"I (F) have recently become really great friends with this guy. We sit together in a couple of classes and talk about nerd shit together. Honestly, he’s my only real friend. Lol. I’m really shy and socially awkward around most people.

A couple of times now, he’s tried to kind of ask me out in a roundabout way. Luckily, since he’s never asked the question directly, I’ve been able to wriggle out of it but I’m worried that one day he’ll just ask me outright and I won’t know what to say.

I don’t wanna hurt him and I don’t wanna lose my one friend but I’m just not interested in him in that way. Over the past year, I’ve realised I’m gay but I haven’t come out to anyone yet so I don’t know how that works exactly. How can I make it clear to him? I don’t wanna be too blunt about it.

474,"I need some advice. I already know what I’m leaning towards but I could use some resources as well. 

My family has been struggling a ton this year and last. My parents are getting a divorce and my younger siblings are all still at home (19, 15, 12). My 15 year old sister had tons of issues last year with attending school due to debilitating anxiety and depression, so my mom pulled her out (private school where my mom works) and she started public high school this year. Last year, she was in an intensive outpatient anxiety program for several weeks until insurance cut her off because she wasn’t suicidal, but she was definitely not ready to leave the program since she still wouldn’t go to school. 

We had high hopes after the summer that she would start high school, but after going for a few days here and there, she started refusing. My mom works and needs to keep her job, so she could only do so much to force my sister to go to school. 2 weeks ago, my mom wrote in to her department head to let them know that she wouldn’t be at school for a professional development day, but since she didn’t notify the head of school, they told her that this was her final notice and basically any slip up she has will be grounds for immediate termination. They had already cut her hours to 70% this year (she’s a Spanish teacher) and she’s had to pick up a server job at a cafe nights from 4-11 pm. 

This morning I woke up to a text from my mom saying that she is facing truancy charges because my sister hasn’t been attending school. She faces a $500 fine or 30 days in jail. She’s pulling my sister out of school because it’s clearly too late to make it work. 

I am currently staying at home with my almost 3 year old and my 5 month old. I have ppd, but I am on medication and doing much better. I also have a history of anxiety, but not as severe. I’m planning on getting a job sometime from May-September next year, but that’s obviously after the school year, so I was thinking I could homeschool her this year for 9th grade and maybe it would help her work through some of her issues and I could save my mom from losing her job until she can find something else. My husband is a 7th grade social studies teacher in a rough school so that is definitely some stress, but it’s going a lot better this year. We live about 8 hours away from my family, so if we were wanting to go visit others for Christmas/spring break etc, she could go back to visit my mom and siblings for a while. I’m worried about the extra stress, but I can’t even imagine how bad it would be if my mom loses her job right now. The whole thing is a nightmare. 

What should I do? What resources are there for homeschooling teenagers?",30Oct2019,1

480,"- It’s somewhat matter of fact because I don’t want to be too graphic but I hope this covers everything -

When I was a child in the 80’s approx 3/4 years old my half brother (same mother) who’s ten years older than me, used to ask me to play with his penis like a joystick. I vividly remember him telling me to put it in his mouth and me saying “wee wee comes from there no!” I remember him saying “if you don’t do it I’ll tell mum and dad you didn’t do it” (logic right there)

Fast forward to when I was 12/13 he was tickling me on the sofa and then acting like it was some kind of game, carried me to my bedroom and got in top of me. I could feel his erection. I managed to wiggle away and locked myself in the bathroom until mum and dad came home. 

A few years later my half sister (same dad as me different mum so they are technically not related) lost her virginity to him a few days after her 16th birthday. This fucked me up so much because she looks identical to me. 

Around ten years ago I confronted my brother in front of my mum and told him I remembered what he did to me. He laughed and threatened to kill me. 

He is a very violent man, with convictions for beating women and children, but no convictions for anything like I’ve spoken about above. 

I left the country ten years ago and have never seen or spoken to him since, although he is still accepted within my family. 

Recently it’s all been dragged up (he liked a “sexy” photo of me on Instagram) - in addition I know he is around a lot of young children and baby sits my nieces and nephews. 

Do I have any legal standing? 
Is there anything I can do to get justice?
Is there anyway I can protect others? 

I’m so afraid of what he might be doing to others, and frankly I just can’t carry this around anymore. My heart is pounding just writing this.

 Today I came in late and was concerned id dropped a letter grade. So after class I told the professor what's been happening and asked if I could have a little bit of a break on the late stuff. I cried a little bit, I just couldn't help it.

483,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I want to start by saying I've made a serious mistake where I agreed to plans without thinking first. This is me trying to find the best way to make the best out of an absolutely shitty situation that I am 100% responsible for.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having a very serious issue where I told my gf I would come over to her house and have dinner with her family for Halloween a good bit ago, and just realised this afternoon that tomorrow evening I also have a fairly important sports match tomorrow night, that same evening. Looking at the schedule it just looks like there's no way I can fit in seeing my gf tomorrow (especially bc her mom is making dinner) and making it to the sports match. I need to be there at 7, and I'd have to get the train at 5:20, and her mom has invited me over for 4, so needless to say, not really enough time.

&amp;#x200B;

The team would be fine without me, although I must say, I am a starter, so the team might not play as well without me, and if there's several other people who can't make it, we might actually be short players.

&amp;#x200B;

My heart says obviously I should ditch my meaningless sports team and go spend time with my gf and her family, but my brain is desperately trying to find a way I can do both, even though it seems logistically impossible. If I were to go with my gf, and my team would lose the game (which would cost us quite a bit in terms of our prospects for the rest of the season), I'd feel very much responsible. On the other hand I don't want to stand up my gfs family.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice on how I should go about this?  


  
Thank you!",30Oct2019,1

485,"Hi there, it's been a long road and I'd love to have some advice to get better.

A ~~little~~ big backstory:

I(22F) am the youngest of 4 children to my parents, they weren't around very much. My dad used to gamble and drink all day long, and yelled at us for being loud when we were playing when we were young. Nowadays he works from 10AM to 10 PM, and drinks less but still enough to be drunk when he returns. I know he has his faults, but he's still my dad and I love him.


My mom tried her best to raise us to be good, but it proved difficult as my family had a really big disparity in how females were treated opposed to males. (First male born was most important, then next male and then the females came after that) Life was rough for my mother, she raised us, did all house chores. When I was about 7, she started working from 6 AM to 5 PM.


When I was 12, I met a person whom I thought I could trust, and long story short, I was sexually abused by this person for a very short period of time before my brother saved me. This was somewhat the beginning of my spiral downwards I guess.

After this, I was left with  a lot of anger and hurt, and I took this out by stealing money from my dad, because he cared so much about my brothers and gave them whatever they wanted, but I never got anything. Obviously I got caught and my parents didn't even look at me anymore after this. 

Lucky me found an SO(23M) at 16, thinking he gave me the love I wanted and craved for, but in the end it was just someone who manipulated me and groomed me for almost 3 years. 

Now I suffer from what appears to be depression, but I don't want to assume and say I have depression when I might just be a little shit. The only person who was holding me up was my oldest brother who cherished me and I him, however he moved to the other side of the world to follow his dreams. I support him immensely and I'm super happy for him, but now I lost my only lifeline and it's been rough.


Now:

I'm in my last year of my bachelors degree, I have been on this study programme for 6 years now (supposed to be a 4 year programme) and I am literally wasting away. I haven't been to any classes after my first year due to my lack of motivation, I can barely get out of bed from to time.

I moved to Italy for a study abroad programme at the start of 2019, and I felt so happy there. I was able to go outside on my own, not be scolded daily and just live.

But I am back from that now, and since then I literally just sleep 24/7 and went to 2 exams out of 6 that I had.

I finally decided to reach out for help and contacted an anonymous therapy treatment subsided by the government. The counselor tried to help me, but admitted to me in week 3 that I should seek out professional help as my problems were too much for a 5 week programme.

My problem:

What can I do to fix myself now? My GP are incredibly unprofessional and tell me every time ''that my symptoms are fake and I need to stop overreacting''. I'm afraid to reach out for professional help as you need a referral, and therapy for depression costs a lot of money as it is no longer covered by insurance.

What can I do?

You ever have a friend who at first comes off nice and caring and then slowly removes their mask? I reconnected with an old friend recently and everything was fine until I realized that more and more recently after I hang out with them I go home annoyed and unhappy with the time spent with them.

I’ve notice about them that they only seem to be interested in what they have to say if I start off a story about anything it will get cut off into a story about them I find I never get to finish any story I tell them. When confiding or seeking advice I feel the uninterest in their voice. They also have a problem with vanity and care so much about how they look at all times. 

One of the biggest problems for me is that they seem to have a princessy attitude that comes when things don’t go their way. If I’m running late I get anxiety bc I know that an attitude is coming.

493,"(22M) don’t mean this in an arrogant manner as I have objectively analyzed why I have a rather difficult time making friends and dating women my age and come to the conclusion that I am just years ahead of many of my peers. When I was in high school rather than just screwing around I spent my whole time working my ass off and getting good grades. I was never a super smart kid but I worked at it and took mostly AP/honors classes (for those of you who don’t know those are the two most advanced difficulties in high school classes here in Florida, USA) and got mostly A’s and B’s. My childhood dream was to join the Army, go special forces, and do all of the shit you see in the movies. A month after I graduated I enlisted to go Infantry and although I had a tough time in Basic (was in good shape and have always been strong but slow at running which is most of what you do) I made it through. My unit wasn’t the greatest in the world and I began struggling with knee/hip problems which made my running times go from passing to failing and as a result I fell into a pretty bad depression. Eventually after 2 years of issues my time was up and I had to either take a medical discharge or be kicked out so I took the discharge. Moved back home with my parents and spent a year working a shitty nigh shift job that paid really well. Was in a very dark place for that year beating myself up every day for not only failing at my dream but also quitting. Eventually after being alone by myself for over a year aside from interactions with my parents and coworkers and really facing those dark places within myself that many people are to scared to face I finally came to peace with myself and figured shit out for the most part which I’m proud of since I’ve noticed many who are decades older than me still don’t have things figured out m/ found themselves. I quit that job a while back and have been going to school for cyber security (big $$$ there) while working a better job and staying with my parents until I finish up my associates since the state college is right down the road from us. I have been saving up money and will have far more than the average 30 year old does based on statistics, have a nice car, plenty of work experience to easily get better paying jobs than my age group typically gets, no college debt whatsoever thanks to my benefits, am in incredible shape from working out 5+ days a week, and will be finally moving out next year. All of this plus the hardships that I have gone through by facing my fears, failing/quitting, and learning to live with it makes it nearly impossible to even relate to kids in college my age. Hell from what I’ve seen most of them don’t know a thing about the outside world, lack work experience, and tend to be dirt poor due to student loans/blowing money on stupid shit (don’t get me wrong I waste money too but I can afford it and still save 2/3 of my income). I’m very grateful that I’m so far ahead which I got to this place by working my ass off and not just dumb luck and It makes me very hopeful for the future since I will be going into a career field with an abundance of open jobs that pay absurdly well ($60k-$200k a year with the average sitting around $100k) especially with how far ahead I am now but the downsides that I have come to accept are that there are very few people who I can relate to and make friends with and none that I’ve met which I can even date. I am a strong believer in being very careful about who you spend time with as they influence you but to be bluntly honest very few people are not completely fucked up at my age especially a lot of the women. I’m not expecting perfection but at least have some goals in life and not be getting $20k+ in debt for a degree that will never make you enough money to pay it off.

Since end of august everything went downhill becouse we lost an friend that was murdered by her boyfriend. A lot happened in that time journalists got in contact with us and we needed to talk with the police. I was there for her and others. I pushed my pain away like I always do. We had some small fights when it happened and we got through it.

When it hit me that our friend was murdered the feelings came and I needed her comfort but she wasnt there for me. Frustrations came and grieving was harder. We couldnt really talk about our problems and I grew a wall. A little before all this I introduced her to a friend of mine and we had some fun. They started to talk more and I felt pushed away. We talked about it and had some conversations about other things but she never rlly was there for me anymore.

She is important to me and I am afraid of losing her becouse of my fear of abondement and the loss of my friend. I started to be overprotective but I never noticed only when she told me that I was. My friend started being a dick when she was with us or when we talked about her and more frustrations came. I couldnt talk about it anymore and we became even more distant. I needed to hear everything from my friend becouse we didnt really text anymore.

A week ago she got mad at me becouse I was being overprotective and that she was done with it. We didnt talk for 2 days and I texted her and she said that she needed space so she could deal with some shit.

So my bf and I have been together for 2 years. He’s a strong believer that when someone who is in a relationship &amp; goes to the strip club, they should keep their hands to themselves &amp; not even go for any dances. Is this the most common point of view?

Are there any women out there who would be ok with their SO going to strip joints &amp; having the women all over their men (touching them, asking them to buy them drinks, dancing for them)? 

Anyways we have been a couple of times mostly with his friends &amp; they all seem to be doing stuff that even makes me feel uncomfortable, especially when I know their wives. 

I just get sad &amp; grossed out how these taken men can let a woman touch them all over like that, &amp; how they can go home to their SO &amp; pretend like nothing happened. 

It doesn’t make me question my boyfriend, but I know if I weren’t there sitting beside him, the girls would try to be all over him too...

PS don’t get me wrong I love going. But I also love my boyfriend &amp; the thought of another woman potentially all over him like that makes me sick (even though I know they just do it for the money)

5 years ago a girl had a crush on me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me on there) and I’m scared she won’t like me anymore",30Oct2019,0
504,"Hey guys, my crush is my classmate. After studying with her for about 1 year, finally I confessed her about how much I love her. She said that she treated me as her friend and will treat as her friend, so yes. FRIEND ZONED. Btw she is a singer and right now she is participating in X factor in a European country. She has a instagram account with around 1.7k followers. But last week I realised that she hide her instagram stories from me. And I dont even know why she did it. Does she have rights to hide? Definetely, her choice. But out of nowhere she hide from me and I figured out it from my other friends by chance. I was out with my male friends and also they do follow her, so one of them came across her story and showed to me, I was like; wait wtf. She didnt shared any stories today. So I said to myself; SOUL FOR A SOUL, if she doesn't wants me to see her stories than I will give what she wants. I unfollowed her from all social medias, later she blocked me on twitter.

I barely know him and have only talked to him a hand full of times and get nervous when I see him sometimes but I know I don’t even like him. I don’t know if this even makes any sense but can someone give me some advice on what this might be?,30Oct2019,5

There’s a girl I’ve liked for a year now. I never made a move because she had a boyfriend, but we still became pretty close in the meantime. I honestly tried to get over her because I didn’t want to interfere with their relationship and I wanted to move on and have a life. But I never did because I don’t just like this girl. I love her.

Then, just at the end of last month, they broke up, and after I helped her with the initial emotions etc, I had a realisation that she deserves more than I could ever give her. She’s the kindest, most beautiful, most accomplished, most talented and most fun person I’ve ever met all at once, while I’m over here with even my best traits being only slightly above average. But this isn’t a wa I don’t have self confidence post, I realised that she can decide that for herself, and there’s only benefit that can come out of asking her out.

Only question is: when? I don’t want to ask too soon after her break up, in case I mess up my chances for something easily avoidable. Also exams are coming up for school, so does that matter? When should I ask?",30Oct2019,1
509,"I [18F] just started college this year. I've always been really close to my family, especially my mom, but lately things have been really different. She had a really fun experience in college and expects me to be the same as her. I am an introvert naturally and do not enjoy parties. She pressures me a lot to ""experience college right"" and to have tons of fun. But her idea of fun is different from mine and she doesn't seem to understand that. 

I also just started dating a guy that lives an hour away. My mom doesn't seem happy for me despite the fact that this guy is really great for me and I'm having the best mental health I've had in years.

I have always been a really well behaved daughter; I'm very honest, get good grades, and never ask for much. My mom doesn't really appreciate this and she seems to guilt me for being in a ""long distance"" relationship and not wanting to stay on campus all weekend.

What should I do to try and get my mom to support me if I'm happy rather than pressuring me to experience college a certain way?",30Oct2019,1
510,"So forgive me if this ends up being a long post.

I'll start this off by saying I've barely used reddit but this seems like a good place to ask this question. 
Currently I am in the longest relationship I've ever had(5 years+) to a beautiful and loving girl. We've had our bumps here and there but nothing serious, mostly just petty things. She recently moved in with me and is currently taking a break from the world because I make enough money for her to do so,she's  trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life. My girlfriend is in her early 20s so I understand. 

I needed to explain my current situation so you can understand my issue. 

I love my girlfriend she's been nothing but sweet and loving since we've been together. The problem is me. I've never gotten over what I guess was my ""first love"". I've never loved anyone like I loved that first girl. I still love that girl that much and I don't know why. For background on first love girl I'll explain her next.

So I dated this girl in 7th grade I think. So I was like 12. We dated the last semester of that year to come and find out that she had to move several states away at the end the school year because of her parents divorce. This devasted us both but on the week of her leaving we spent a whole day together outside of school alone. At the end of it we were both extremely sad and she gave me what would be my first kiss and our last kiss. She handed me a note that explained how much she really loved me and that was the last time I saw her. 

Two years later we found each other online and started dating again. We texted each other on our flip phones 24/7, talked on our land line phones each night for probably another 6 months. She realized that it was killing us being apart so she ended the relationship. 

I subsequently went deep into a emo phase because of this and didn't date another girl until I was almost out of high school. Which because of my poor judgment ended up abusing me pretty hardcore for 4 years.

Now this brings me up to the present. Almost 2 years ago I found first love on facebook. She is married now with no kids and looks happy in her photos. I sent her a message and she replied the next night seemingly happy to hear from me. She now lives back in the same state I do although about 100 miles away. We have small talk for awhile,talk about tattoos, what each other do for a living and what not.  She starts asking for basically a history of what's happened to me since we split. I tell her and she says she just wanted to know because she starting to begin she thinks she made a mistake marrying the person she did and wonders what her life would of been like if she had made different choices. We have a few more small talks about random things and say goodbye. I leave her my phone number incase she ever wants to text me and we haven't talked since.

Now the problem I have is I want to see this girl atleast one more time just to see if there is something still there. Not date but just see and talk to her again in person and see if i feel a connection. She's never reached back out to me so I feel like that's my answer but she also said that her husband was very particular about who she messaged. So I don't know if that's why. She told me where she worked and she also said she would love to see me again when we talked.

So the advice I'm seeking is should I try and pursue this or should i just leave it in the past and forget about this girl?",30Oct2019,0
511,"Gonna try to write this story as compact and as short as possible. TL;DR at the bottom.

I've never been really close with anyone. Not with my family or childhood friends. I had a really worry free childhood, so there wasn't really anything I'd have to talk about. This changed when I entered lower secondary school (ages 12-15) and started to meet a lot of new people. Suddenly there were girls my friend group too which of course is awesome. Then you start seeing couples everyday in school which kinda bummed me out because back then I was pretty overweight, so no one was ever interested in me lol. I liked to often text with 2 girls in our friend group and it was the first time in my life when I felt I could talk about anything with them. Mainly about how it sucked not having any girls interested in you. Also hugs were great. Those 2 girls then started ""dating"" 2 other guys in our group. So now there's 2 couples in our friend group to remind me that I didn't have anyone that close.

Anyway I felt like I was really close friends with those 2 girls because I grew up with the ""guys can't have feelings"" type of mentality. They were the first people I felt comfortable being open with my feelings, now that I had something to talk about. In reality, now that I think about it, texting and a few hugs probably doesn't count as ""close friends"".

&amp;#x200B;

Skip to the last year, about a month before graduation. Still pretty sad about seeing couples everywhere I go. I was arguing about something with one of the girls over text. She said that I only act sad so I could get attention. Possibly true, it gave me hugs that made me feel cared for. Nothing was lost yet, but then she said she has been ""pretending"" to be my friend for 3 years. Of course I didn't believe it, but she still said it and it hurt so damn much. One of the first people who made me feel cared and would listen to me when I needed someone to hear me has just told me it was all an act.

I cut all contact with the whole group after that. Went back to my childhood friends and started to hang out with them. The guys that I grew up with the ""guys-no-feelings"" mentality.

&amp;#x200B;

I pretty much raised a wall in my mind and pushed everyone away. I became really emotioneless and just wanted to be left alone. Getting my own apartment helped with that. I have been like this for almost 5 years now (not in school anymore). I'm not overweight anymore, but rather pretty fit (2 years of crossfit to thank). Still anti-social everywhere I go though. Those childhood friends moved to another city, so I've been alone this past year. I've had a lot of time to think about myself and what I've been through. I realize I've missed out on so much stuff. Partying, having fun with friends, meeting girls etc. The thing is, if I suddenly had all that, I probably wouldn't like it. One part of me says to be social, meet new people, fall in love. But the other part still wants to be alone. The wall I built in my head is still there. And everytime I go somewhere where I could be social, I don't want to be. I don't want attention, I don't want anyone to say hello to me, I just want to be a ghost. Then I get home and the wall comes down and I'm lonely again.

This is so stupid when it happens. I even realize it when I'm around people. I know the other part of me wants to be social, but the part who doesn't always wins, so I just keep quiet. The only place I could even be social these days is the gym classes I go to which is a really social place with a lot of friendly people. Everyone is about 5 years older than me though. It wouldn't even feel right to talk about something other than the workout itself.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I sit in my apartment, without friends, introverted and alone. Still pushing everyone away the chance I get. And I don't know how to bring that wall I built down. I often daydream about meeting a girl who would force the wall down, so I could be myself lol. Not really realistic though.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I became extremely anti-social after my first friends I was close with, stabbed me in the back when I was 15yo. Haven't had real friends for 5 years now because I push everyone away. One part of me wants to be social again, but the other part still wants to be alone. The latter always wins when I'm in places where I could be social. I have built a wall in my head that I don't know how to break down.",30Oct2019,1

517,"Over the weekend I went to a halloween party with some friends. Everyone at the party ranged from 25-32'ish. During the night, I got increasingly drunk and ended having sex with a friend of mine, Nils. He was drunk too. Honestly, I don't remember the actual sex, but I do remember him **asking** if I wanted to, and me **choosing** to follow him upstairs. A while later, I ended up going home with some friends and we all stayed at one of their apartments. In the morning I got a call from Nils. He wanted to make sure I was okay with everything that happened last night. I said yep, all good on my end. Even though I was drunk and don't really remember doing it, I'm content with the choice I made, and would happily sleep with him sober too. (we were safe as well, if that matters to anyone)

Anyway, my friends overheard and when I came back, they asked if I had slept with someone the night before, and who it was. I told them what happened, and they were all a bit quiet. I didn't think much of it and went to shower. I came back and they said they wanted to talk to me. They then told me that I didn't have sex with Nils, but was actually raped because I was so drunk. I thought they were joking at first, but nope. 100% serious. They started claiming that because I was drunk and don't remember, I must've not wanted to do it. I reminded them Nils was just as drunk as me, but apparently because he's a guy that doesn't matter. They're urging me to press charges and tell people what kind of person Nils really is. I was really shocked by this, and I definitely don't view it the same. To me, and Nils, it was just very drunk, consensual sex.

So the problem is my friends aren't dropping this. They're saying that if I won't go to the police, they will. And they're also saying that people need to know who Nils really is and that we need to tell people. What do I do? A false accusation could ruin his life, and isn't it up to me to decide whether or not I consider it rape (I definitely don't)? Advice?",30Oct2019,2

So I quit my $10.25 job to take this $8 one because it’s in tech so it’ll look good on my resume. 
Now, 5 months later, I’m still making $8 an hour which after taxes is basically minimum wage. I spoke to my boss about it and he said that $10 an hour is “the promise we want to keep” but that the person above him wont allow it yet. So why did he tell me I’d be making $10 by now?

Apparently the pathology results on the extracted tissue + tumor that they hadn't spotted right away on my ultrasound because my appendix was so obviously a thing = cancer, and I'm going to need another operation that will take me out of commission for at least a month.  The phone call woke me up, so I didn't have the presence of mind to ask for the name of the specific type, and am waiting on a call back with that information.

I am still out of work recovering from the first surgery, because my work is fairly physically demanding (I work night shifts in a grocery store), and I'm not supposed to lift anything over 15 lbs for another 3 weeks.  But the qualifying window for health insurance is coming up at the end of November.  It's based on accumulated worked hours over 6 months.  If I went back to work today, and were able to get 40 hours a week, I might almost make it.  But they haven't been scheduling anyone for more than 32 since June (which is why my current hour count is so low, normally I would have qualified about a week ago for the next round of insurance), plus, I still can't do a lot of the things my job requires.

I don't know what to do.  I haven't told anyone yet, and honestly, I'm not sure I want to.

526,"I (28M) recently started a new job in the legal field. My boss/supervisor (30ish-F) is a total badass who absolutely kicks ass at her job, not to mention is quite attractive, so naturally I’ve developed a pretty major crush on her. On top of this, I was hired to help her out, and I actually have more legal background than her, so I’ve been doing a pretty great job at that, so much so that she’s taken notice and praised my work/work ethic multiple times. However the truth is, while of course I’m good at my job, I’m sure I wouldn’t be going above and beyond in the ways I am if I didn’t have this brewing crush on her. 

Yesterday was a prime example of this. I went above and beyond to go out of the office to get her something she mentioned she needed while she was on a phone call, and I brought it to her when she was still on the call. She then sent me a slack message saying “ur attention to detail is incredible, thank u for bringing me [item]”. I didn’t know what to do but reply with a 🙂, which she replied to with 😊. 

I know that if it keeps on going like this I’m going to inevitably tread into dangerous territory. It’s already difficult for me to concentrate properly on doing my job because of my feelings of attraction. How should I deal with my developing feelings while remaining professional?

I’m a 24 year old who has spent the last 3 years struggling with a drinking problem. I’m two weeks sober and recently realized I haven’t really been “going anywhere” with my life. I work at a cat cafe as a barista, and while it’s a fine enough job I don’t really make much and it’s definitely not what I want to do with my life.

So the story goes like this. 
I was bff with this boy(17) who's from my town. We were very close and he was single so i decided to hook him up with my bff from class. They became very close and ended up in a relationship. And let me tell you, it was really awesome at first because my boyfriend was his best friend so we would hang out together and we went on double dates and it was really nice...

They ended up having sex in like a week of their relationship and she didn't tell me that for like a month later. I was really in shock cause they didn't even know each other so well and I tought she wasn't so ""easy"" to lose her v card with basically a stranger. Oh yes, she had to take Plan B three times .. and she would cry when that happened and tommorow she would go happy af and have sex again without worrying..

So couple of months went by and we started to talk less. When I would ask her to go get coffe or smthn she would say no cause her bf is in town. And that happened every week. Then i told her that our friendship is not like before and that I think she forgot about me that shes all about her boyfriend. 
She told me she didn't even thought of me like her best friend and that i was a fake friend ( because i told her how i felt?¿ like wtf..)  and told me a lot of bad things... We ended up fighting about it and now we don't talk for like 8 months.. 

Sometimes she is invited to the same parties like me and no one talks to her or is good with her.. And i feel very bad and I want to talk to her so she isn't left out.. but I know its not my fault that her bf changed her to worse..

My name is ---, and I am a first-year engineering student pursuing chemical engineering with a minor in either polymer or bioengineering.  My chemistry professor, Dr. ---, posted a document describing current projects in the chemistry department. Your work in physical chemistry and the behavior of polymeric materials piqued my interest. I have some background knowledge in organic chemistry from the various chemistry courses I took in high school. I am currently taking UHC general chemistry, and I am planning on taking UHC organic chemistry sophomore year. I have limited experience in research, but I would love to have the opportunity to see if research is something I would like to pursue in the future. On your website, I saw that the places for undergraduate researchers are full, but I would appreciate the chance to talk with you about your research in polymeric materials and possible undergraduate opportunities in your lab. I am available Wednesday afternoons and Friday mornings.

Thank you for your time!

534,"Use to attend the gym 4 times a week. Even having meetings with a personal trainer and made...some progress I guess. 

I suppose the main problem is that i'm really impatient and while i've desperately **tried** to understand how this all works, I  don't fully comprehend how exercise and fitness works. All I know is: if I do work outs with proper form consistently and eat right, I should see progress. 

But it's been a year now and I feel/see little difference. I know it doesn't happen over night, but it's a little hard to keep motivated when you're not even sure if you're doing the right thing. Friend and family have said I do appear more broader, but that's about it. My weight is inconsistent: every week I either see a large drop in weight or a large gain. My diet isn't great, but it certainly a large improvement from where I was.

After a year of uncertainty, I feel like throwing in the towel. Which sucks because I dreamed of feeling more confident and attractive in my appearance. But it feels like i'm going in circles. Plus i've got college classes with assignments and strict deadlines and i'm a slow worker as it is. I feel exhausted all the time and when I finally have the time to go gym, I have no motivation to do so.

How do you motivate yourself when you're always exhausted and feel like nothing is changing?",30Oct2019,1
535,"So this might be a long one, I’ll start from the beginning. Ever since I started elementary school my parents have been very overbearing and controlling. They have to know we’re I am at all times, when I ask to kick it with friends they always have to be in contact with their parents and it’s embarrasing, they search my phone all the time and always, ALWAYS, try to see what I’m watching or ask me what I’m watching on YouTube and Netflix. This was appropriate at the time when I was in elementary school, you know all the “play date” bullshit. But they still do it! When I’m with friends they use find my iPhone to track where I am and they text me 5+ times throughout nights when I’m not with them. They don’t trust me to do anything myself, as if I can’t handle taking care of myself.  The first time I stayed home alone I was 12 and literally not more than an hour. As a result of this, it’s hard for me to hang out with friends outside of school because I’m afraid of the repercussions because there’s always an issue with them. I’m fine socially at school, and I have a good amount of friends but I don’t do normal shit outside school. I have a business, I’m not going to say what it is because it’s tied to my name, but because of the business I’m pretty well off financially. Everything I buy, I buy myself. Im a saver not a spender. My parents will “borrow”money from me because I have cash around and they either don’t pay me back or it takes them months. They use my PayPal the most. The real shit started when I was 15. I slowly was gaining more freedom, only because I pushed the boundaries. (I didn’t go to my first sleepover until I was 16) and I started smoking weed here and there with my friends. Soon, my whole friends group would get together whenever possible and just chill and smoke and have a great time doing whatever. It was the first time in my life when I felt happy with where I was, regardless of my parents. Overtime I became very knowledgeable on the various nuance and science of all things weed. One day my parents searched my phone, as they do, and they found texts I forgot to delete. The texts were weed related and they were clearly incriminating. They confronted me, took all my shit, and made me promise on my grandmas grave I wouldn’t smoke again until at least 18. My friends were all also caught as well and our relationship became strained. The summer after sophomore year was awful. I was back in that depressed state of mind. I didn’t speak to a single friend all summer. All I did was make money and play video games. I was trapped in the house in a circle of conflict with no way out. My junior year has started and most of my friends had started smoking again. I want so badly to just do normal things with the people who I consider my brothers, and just make memories. My parents argument is that weed causes schizophrenia and turns you into a lazy fiend who eventually turns to hard drugs to get high. They want me to wait until I’m 25 but by then most people quit smoking anyway and get a job and move into true adulthood. There’s no point in waiting because all the opportunities have passed. I don’t want to waste my childhood anymore than I already have. I want to have real experiences. My parents didn’t save me, all my friends are still making memories, just without me in them. I’m alone, just going through the motions, waiting for the day when I can be free. Who knows they might make me get life 360 when I move out too. I have not done anything with friends outside of school in months, the difference this time is I know what I’m missing where before I was lost. I know what I could have. I don’t know what to do, I just need some advice or just some anything. I want to know what people think hearing this being said.",30Oct2019,1
536,"I (20F) am currently at a bit of a standstill in my life. I have taken this semester off of college at my university (I am a sophomore), due to my anxiety (which I am going to therapy for) making focusing on academics really challenging, deciding to switch my major, and lack of interest / focus. I also do not have a job right now, because of my anxiety. I’ve had the disorder all my life, but these past few months it’s been at one of its worst points. 

I have never been someone who enjoys doing schoolwork. I understand the benefits of an education, but I find it really, REALLY difficult to sit down and do work that I am totally disinterested in. Maybe I have ADHD? Not sure. Anyway, not being in school right now is making me feel sort of useless (even though at the end of the day, I know I’m not if I just did something). Same with not having a job. I’m basically just living at home, and I go down to my school on the weekends to go out with friends and party... I live only a few blocks away. I don’t want to isolate myself from college life completely. Side note: I do not drink, smoke, or put anything harmful into my body. 

I have a couple of close friends, and a boyfriend. I do have acquaintances but not a large friend group due to not dorming at my school and also not being there as a student currently. 

I have been extremely tired lately, probably because I’m not on a very good sleep schedule but that makes me want to lay around. Also when my anxiety gets bad I just want to lay around too. I really need to get back into my gym routine, but being tired makes me not want to exercise. I’m currently laying in bed typing this and don’t feel like getting up because I’m so comfortable and tired but I feel totally unproductive and need to get to the gym. 

I basically, right now, only have the energy to drive in my car or hangout with my boyfriend. I feel too tired to do anything else and although I feel useless I do not want to do schoolwork or get a job even though I know I have to. I hate doing things I don’t enjoy. (Don’t we all?). I’m not extremely dependent on my boyfriend because I know that if we broke up, I wouldn’t feel shattered without him. Yes it’d hurt but yanno. I do love him so much though, he’s so energetic and makes me feel so happy and silly when we’re together. 

I just don’t have much energy lately. I’m not doing anything and although I need to / want to, I can’t really make myself. 

I do have tons of things I love in life, such as photography, music, the outdoors, you name it. 

Am I being lazy because I feel like I can be, or is it because I am depressed?",30Oct2019,1

541,Hey Reddit. I am new here and I want to ask you if there is anything that I should know,30Oct2019,0
543,"OK soooo first time posting something on reddit, this place seems to be helpful. Also quite curious about the reactions and the thoughts people may have on the subject I'm going to talk about.

Oh and first of all, eNglISh Is nOt mY fIrST LaNguAGe, and worse, I'm French. I guess gtrad is my best friend.
Last point but not least, I hope south Africa will win the rugby world cup, because English people are so *Insert fish and chips joke*


Well, let's jump into it.
I (20M) am lost. In my life decisions. I just don't fucking know what to do, and here's why.

I play the piano since I am 6 years old. Quick maths (big shak), it has been 14 years that I'm in love with music. The fact is that my parents always said that working in music is very difficult, because you have to be very good to have a decent job (teacher, singer, musician,...). So I did a classic cursus, in science (Bac S for those who are familiar with France), and I am now in apprenticeship, looking forward my engineer degree (embedded systems with specialization in Artificial Intelligence) that I will get next year.

I am working in a quite large company, in automation, and its interesting etc etc
BUT I feel like I have lost an opportunity, to be what I dream to be (f*cking dreams), a musician / singer / whatever the frick you want to be when you love music (I do think I'm doing well in singing, but I never had the opportunity to verify it).
So my plans were to continue my apprenticeship and jump into the music world, by doing a cursus at the CNSM (Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique, very good sh*t, like the best in France and surely a little further).
And reality just slapped me in the face.
I just can't, because I don't have the TIME. (And because the CNSM is very hard, u do need time)
My apprenticeship is very cool but is occupying all my weeks, except when I am in school (obviously)
It's like three days in the company and two days at school during a week (except during holidays, where it's full time company) 

So here's my little myself, lost in the big wide world, seeking for solutions that do not exist, locked in a way of life I may have never dezired, aaaand I'm not depressed, for now...

554,"Hi,

So I live in a house with 2 of my friends. I’ve known them for about a year (uni) and life was pretty good until we moved in together. One of my friends is always “loud”, as in, he’s constantly throwing insults at me when my other friend is in the room. He always comments on what I do like if i’m doing something wrong, he’d raise his voice purposely to attract attention from my other mate. I’ve tried speaking to him before but he always claims it’s for fun or that i’m “always” like this. My other friend is more quieter, but he always leaves me out (and even my other mate sometimes). Like if he’s going to get food, he wouldn’t even tell me and just go straight to my other mate. Though, this doesn’t happen all the time so he, imo, seems neutral. But he doesn’t talk to me that much. Not in a lot of depth usually. It’s always quiet between us. I just can’t cope anymore. I miss my old friends a lot and it’s gotten to the point where i’m depressed etc. 

What can I do? I really don’t want a one on one convo with them because I know they won’t take it seriously or even worse, talk behind my back about it and make the situation worse. I’m just fed up of all this.",30Oct2019,1

557,"To start off I will acknowledge that my mom loves me very much and I love her too

I was raised in a very strict house hold. My mom is a single parent to two kids and she does an awesome job. But she is very strict

I am 17 and in college will be turning 18 soon. My mom wants to stay in control of my life. She has always wanted me to stay in a bubble and to not grow outside of the things she has taught me. While yes I know I’m not a saint in any way what so ever I feel she is a bit to harsh

I dorm at a campus 1 hour and some change away from where I live. I love it at this campus and can concentrate very well here. I have nice friends who support me and care for me. I do all my work and am in the honors college here at my university. When i went away to college I had a place I could be myself finally. I enjoy it over here with people my age here who can laugh and talk with me. I don’t really got a lot of friends back home since they all dorm in other campuses far away.

With this being said my mom wants to have full control over me. She went as far as to check my phone while I’m sleeping when I visit my home every 2 weeks on the weekends. She has also went to my wireless network provider and checked my Snapchat and Instagram through there. She went through all the messages I sent out and went through everything on my Instagram. With this being said I have not drank before college and since I’ve been here I have drank. But those times have been few and far between. While going through my phone she found one picture of a bud light in my hand. When she questioned me about it this week I told her the truth and said it was mine and I did drink from it. With this and the fact that she doesn’t like my friends in the university for some reason even though I only talk very positive about them and how much they support me and I support them. She found a picture of my 3 female friends (I’m a guy) kissing me and she did not like that. I also have just broke up with my girlfriend that she adored around that time so she was also mad at me for that. She says she can’t trust me anymore. Me and her argued for that whole weekend which wasn’t smart of me on my end but she said she didn’t want me dorming anymore. 

She said I can’t dorm next semester because A. We don’t have the money which is true and don’t fault her for that. And B. She doesn’t like the person “my friends have turned me into”. She says she lost all trust in me than said I was “exactly like my father”. Which isn’t really a compliment. 

She also states how I have changed for the worse. She says I’m too cocky now and don’t appreciate things she has done even though I always tell her I appreciate her struggle to get me and my brother through everything constantly. She says I’m talking too much about money now even though I say I will get rich one day in positive manor and I say she want have to struggle any more. I try to be as nice to her as I can cause I understand she goes through a lot and it is not easy. 

I am on scholarship for my school and get classes covered by my scholarship. It also pays for some of my dorming. I pay ~1200 a month for this school. I have a job already on campus that pays 15$ an hour and I work the maximum of 17 hours a week. I am going to ask for more money from the school and if not I am willing to get a second job to pay for it all on my own. Loans are also an option but I already took out one for 1500 a year. 

I really wanna stay dorming here. She already said I can’t do it next semester but I am thinking of sitting her down and explaining my plan. I will go through with it either way if she agrees with me or she doesn’t. But I want to. I need help though to make sure this is the right thing to do. Thank you!",30Oct2019,36

But on Sunday night, I toss and turn. I have a pit in my stomach and my anxiety skyrockets because I know I have to go back to work. I’ll often think about how much easier my life would be if I could just end it. I can’t quit my job - I have way too many student loans for that. So my mind often turns to fantasizing about suicide. I would never actually *do* it - I just think about how peaceful it would be. 

I’ve never felt like this before. I’ve always enjoyed my previous jobs. I even used to enjoy this job. All that changed earlier this year. 

This is my first job out of law school and I was incredibly excited and idealistic. I came into work every day just thrilled to be there.  I was primarily doing litigation. 

After a few months of working there, before I ever had the chance to take my first case to oral argument, my boss called me into his office and told me that he wanted to transfer me to a non-litigation role. He said he has seen hundreds of young people come through his doors, and he knows who is innately good at litigating. He said I don’t have that “edge” about me. He assigned me to work under a different person doing non-litigation work. 

In the time I was working as a litigator, I  discovered that litigation truly is my passion. I previously enjoyed it as an intern, and I continued to enjoy it when I started working here. I’m an incredibly confident person, and a people person. I find every aspect of litigation to be incredibly fun, and before all this shit hit the fan, I was genuinely excited to come into work every day. I knew litigation was what I want to do with my life, and felt that I had found my calling, that the horrors of law school had been worth it. 

When he told me I wasn’t suited for litigation, I was shattered. I spent 3 years in law school and took out hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans just to be told I wasn’t suited for my career of choice? Bullshit. 

Soon thereafter, my new supervisor was talking to me about the (involuntary) transfer, and he told me that the real reason is because I’m overweight, and my old supervisor thought that my weight was unprofessional and not suited for in person court appearances. 

Anyways, for many months now, I have had suicidal ideation at the thought of coming into work. This job has absolutely destroyed my self esteem, and every day I have to return to the place that told me I’ll never be good enough. I’m switching jobs soon (I already have one lined up), but I’m really worried that these feelings won’t stop once I leave this POS discriminatory job.

561,"**Background**: I grew up in a poor, rough, and abusive environment with 2 other siblings ( a brother and a sister). We couldn't always afford nice things, family trips, or even family activities within our city. 

**Fast forward to adulthood.** My brother and sister are both still struggling financially and they both have daughters. I am single and childless, but I've done okay for myself and told myself that I would try (as much as I am able ) to give my nieces (ages 2 and 5) experiences that I was not able to have as a child.

My sister is the youngest of us. I try not to discount the fact that she had a hard childhood (I had a front-row seat to it), but she is an *extremely* negative person. The first time she came to my house, she critiqued the decor (I wasn't aware that glass-top coffee tables were passé). She critiqued my cooking (apparently me using whole wheat pasta instead of ""regular"" pasta was one of the worse things that ever happened to her in life). Everyone else wanted to take leftovers home, but she picked at her food with a disgusted look on her face. She's not that much better in other dining situations, either. Every time I have gone out to eat with my sister (and I mean EVERY. SINGLE. TIME), she either sends her food back and/or gives the wait staff a hard time. A few times, fine, but she does this EVERY TIME we go out and eat. She regularly eats fast food, but for some reason, in sit-down settings, she becomes Gordon Ramsay.

The final straw with my sister was last summer. I planned a family trip for my brother, his wife, my sister, and my nieces to Disney World. I covered ALL of the expenses (park tickets, hotel, travel), and even Cash Apped them some spending money. All they had to do was show up. The trip was in mid-August and I sent out the itinerary in May so that everyone would have enough notice to take off work. The trip was Wednesday through Sunday. I got down there a day early to make sure everything was okay for the trip.

My brother and his family arrive as scheduled, but my sister did not. A few hours passed, and she still hadn't arrived nor contacted me to tell me why. Eventually, my sister-in-law gets a text from my sister saying she would not be coming until the next day. I was upset for several reasons,  mainly because if you a part of a group trip and have issues, you should contact the organizer of the trip. Once my sister did arrive, she seemed bored and annoyed. We went to the park and had a good time for about 90 minutes, then my sister suddenly wanted to go home (not to the hotel, but home) so we ALL left the park. Apparently, she had to get back home to work and didn't tell me (even though we had been talking about the schedule for 3 months). I was furious. I had essentially spent thousands of dollars for less than 2 hours of park time. 

I haven't seen my nieces since then and wanted to invite them for Thanksgiving, but I'm not looking forward to dealing with my sister. When I called her yesterday to invite her to dinner, she replied (""Oh…so *you're* cooking?""). Right now, I'm leaning toward two options:

A: Cancelling family dinner and being by myself (which is usually how I spend Thanksgiving).

B. Disinviting my sister and having her send her daughter with my brother and his family.

I'm not sure what to choose, I'm just tired of my sister's attitude and negativity, particularly in response to people who are trying to help her.",30Oct2019,1

The boy in this situation is such a hassle to teach, he cant focus, he keeps causing distractions and honestly there is no point in teaching him 90% of the time as he wont listen. He keeps trying to make jokes which are very annoying and again a waste of time, and there timings are really bad for me as i have to go to them really late and its has a 1 hour drive with it  (30 minutes there and back) I get back from work Tuesdays and Thursdays (the days i teach them) rest for a bit eat and then leave to teach them. I return exhausted and drained.

Now any day of the week people would just quit this gig and move on BUT here are the 2 'issue'

1) This teaching job makes 50% what i make at my full time job. I feel like i am throwing away money if i don't keep it.

2) His father is the reason I got this full time job since the beginning, and its not like he kinda helped. He basically told another friend of his to give me the job. Its not that I am not qualified, or cant do this job. I am more than qualified and have already established my place in the work place as a reliable and hard working employee. But I feel it will be rude if I just quite private tutoring.

I don't want to tutor this kid any more. I cant stand it, they refuse to make it a weekend lesson, and the kid refuses to improve his attitude. He has a terrible attitude of oh school is EW and I don't like work.

Honestly I don't really know what to do any **advice?**",30Oct2019,2
564,"So my boyfriend has some security issues from the past he just can’t seem to get over. We never fight and always have a good time together but he’ll get these thoughts that I’m going to manipulate him or that I find him boring and will dump him later, etc etc. The first time was about 5 weeks ago, and came out of nowhere. We worked things out, but then two and a half weeks later it happened again. This time he was saying he couldn’t trust me and that even though I hadn’t done anything to hurt him YET, it didn’t mean I WOULDNT, blah blah. He apologized and we talked about it and I told him he couldn’t keep freaking out over nothing when I haven’t done anything. Then last week, I could tell something was bothering him, but he just was distant for a day and then was back to normal rather than blowing up. Now, it’s happening again, but he hasn’t tried to contact me and I just don’t know what to do. He’s a great guy outside of these insecurities but I just don’t know how much I can take this because it makes me so sad and gives me so much anxiety when he isn’t talking to me. I don’t know if I should reach out or keep giving him space. He last texted me about two days ago. I sent him a text today telling him I hoped he was ok. No response :/",30Oct2019,3

566,"I'm doing a filmmaking course and have just entered second year, where everything starts to actually count for our grades. It also means everything we do/hand in is group work, this project is a group of 5
We have a pitch coming very up soon and one of our group members hasn't contributed, but we're worried he'll show up on the day and expect to just join in.

Two of my group members are very harsh about this and have flat out decided that we should just leave him.out and prepare it as if he's not there, and if he shows up just tell him were doing it without him. (The lecturers know our situation and would accept this course of action)

What I'm most worried about is, him not doing his pitch then later not working on the film - resulting in home possibly being kicked out and potentially failing the year/dropping out because of us, and I don't particularly want to be responsible for this. Are we doing the right thing by not letting him join us further or is this complete overkill?",30Oct2019,1

568," come from a reasonably well off country to stay in the country my parents grew up in, which is not so well off (Serbia) for a while. I have an online job and I get paid about 10usd an hr not much, but that's at least 3x the median wage here.

I can cover my costs literally working an hour a day, and my aunty keeps giving me her money even though I've refused dozens of times.

I know I'm easily making 2-3x more $$ per hour than she is, she knows it, yet she insists on giving me money. And I know it's a fair amount for her.

 She'll literally leave it on the table of my house when she comes to visit or stuffs it in my hand, my jacket etc. Shes the kind of person who doesnt accept a no, she's asked me about 50 to 100 times over the last 6 weeks to get me a sweater/jacket etc lol. I've accepted a few things as good faith, but I cant accept anything more.

I'm thinking of just hiding a (couple) hundred euros in her purse when I leave this place or something, although i know she would get upset if I tried to pay her back

579,"Okay so I met the girl im dating a year ago at uni. we started off as friends but recently evolved into smth more. turns out, via a mutual friend we have, i found out that my gfs dad, who passed away last year when i met her, had been in jail for money laundering and something related to drugs. after doing some more digging, i found out the case was pretty fucking huge in my country and her dad had been the head of a drug cartel. it was a pretty mediatic case, there was just a ton of information about it online. her dad was still in jail when he died, but he got house arrest bc of his condition. her mom also was arrested for being accomplice and part of her family was also involved. none of them are in jail as of now but i think the case is ongoing or was up until earlier this year at least. 

i dont really mind tbh, its not her fault and after all her dad is dead. but i noticed that shes always weird about the rest of her family and i noticed she doesnt have the best relationship with them. i guess some things started to make sense after i found this out. i dont know how to approach her about this of if i even should. at first i thought it would be best to just give her time and wait till she eventually tells me, but i dont even know if thats even going to happen. i feel guilty about knowing something that she doesnt think i know. i just cant imagine how hard it must have been for her, and to top it all off she had to deal w losing her dad too. i wouldnt want her to feel like she has to hide anything or walk around eggshells  with me anytime she talks about her dad or her family. 

i dont really know how i would approach the subject if i were to confront her about it. what should i do? has anyone been in a similar situation?

582,"Longer story so get ready, I am 21Y M and well... I moved to the city in search of better job market and what not. Note that I am from poorer country(Serbia) and also from not so wealthy family. I decided to go on this adventure alone, with no funds(since I lived in village a chance for making or saving was none since there was no jobs), no friends and honestly I am lost. 

I earn under minimum wage in my country, I eat only noodles for past 4 months + I can feel my health shifting down.

I know Web Design but to who ever I offered my services ""has"" a son who is a programmer bla bla and when they tell me what he does it totally has nothing to do with web design OR 2nd case scenario is they do not need a website. Like how, the, hell, smaller businesses especially need websites and good online social presence to succeed, let me help you help me. If I look it at this way I wasted 7 years on a nowadays oversaturated market, I should have been some lumberjack minding my own damn business and not get education as that feels like years wasted for nothing.

I also had depression which was just labeled as ""eh your just lazy"" by parent, thanks parents really confidence booster.

I tried to find a job for steady income but looking for past year I am losing my hope. I applied for everything, what I am qualified for and what I am not. I even made my CV with some people who are into job market to make it look good as much as I can and still no luck.

I have been living under a rent in a 5 room flat paying 100e a month and somehow I earned them but I really have no money for anything else. How can I earn money? Everything I search online REQUIRES(of course it does) money to earn money money but I cant earn money money if I dont have money to start that(for example dropshipping store).

585,"Hi, this is my first post in this subforum, so I hope it's the right place. If not, let me know and I'll move it. I just really need advice. ***TL;DR at the bottom.***

I recently got my first receptionist job at what I'll call a ""yoga"" studio. It's not a yoga studio, but a related, yet more identifiable discipline, so I'll leave it at that. The job is fairly cushy and easy, and I really enjoy the work. That being said, I have a really difficult boss. The business has been open a year now, and she has lost about 5 part timers in that time period. Now it's just her, her exectutive assistant who she LOVES for some reason, me and another part-timer who was hired after me. In the two months I've worked there, she's lost two other part timers, which means I'm the longest-running part-timer there. 

Going over everything she's done would be too much, so I'll try to list the important talking points below:

* During the interview process, she took a photo of me and sent it to a psychic, asked me my sign in the job interview, chided me for being ""too emotional"" due to my sign.
* She touches me all the time, as well as grabbing my hands when I touch my hair. I have trichotillomania (an anxiety disorder where you pull on or out your hair when nervous) and PTSD. When I explained why I do this, she said that she ""doesn't care what doctors call it to sell pills"" and that it's a result of the nervous, messy energy inside of me. This only makes it worse, ironically enough.
* Will become irate with me and other receptionists for not being mind readers, or for forgetting a small task during peak hours when everything is hectic. For example, she leaves me angry text messages if I forget a pen out on the desk, and says I'm messy and scattered. I want to reiterate, it was one pen, or a notepad, or something, and this has happened a couple times. She however leaves papers strewn about the desk and takes up most of it when she's sitting next to me. 
* She started crying when my coworker accidentally messed up a couple lines of the newsletter she had been ordered to write, despite not really offering much training on the software or layout except ""Watch (Boss's Executive Assistant) and see how she does it. It's really easy!"" 
* She also started crying when I contacted a teacher to do a bio video for the social media platform I'm in charge of running because they had a falling out, despite me not knowing this at the time.
* She just had a meeting with myself and my coworker, talking about how because we make tiny mistakes like leaving pens out or messing up the newsletter, we must be careless, lazy and don't care about the work. 
* During this meeting, she asked if we had any questions or comments. I then very politely broached the topic of not feeling like I understand the objectives, and that I'm 'not a mind-reader' and would appreciate more clarification in the future. She got very upset, telling me that I'm ""childish"" and ""resentful"" and that I'm too young to really understand how important her work is (I'm 25). 
* When I told her that I don't agree with that and that I don't appreciate being called names while I'm trying to have a conversation with her, and that the one time I AM talking to her about my concerns, she calls me childish and resentful, she very uncomfortably apologized for calling me ""childish"". 
* She asked if I wanted to turn in my notice, and I said no, and asked if she wanted to fire me instead. She said no, was very uncomfortable, and then tried to pretend nothing happened afterwards, but lamented that we both look ""so sad"" and how our negative energy is bringing down her practice.

I don't know how to get the gist of it across in writing, but trust me when I say it was really bad. My coworker is upset, and I am upset. My coworker was shaking during the meeting while we were arguing, and I felt really bad, but I wanted to see if things could be fixed by talking them out. They could not. We both show up to work stressed and already afraid of her yelling at us or making a scene for things that aren't our fault.  This job would be really fun and meaningful if it weren't for her getting mad and causing scenes all the time, and both my coworker and my family are pleading with me to try and find a job elsewhere.

That being said, I feel like I'm sort of giving up on a job that I would really enjoy otherwise. I need the receptionist experience, and I want to prove to myself that I can hold my own and maintain my convictions and self-respect in the face of unreasonable people. I know other people have had it worse. If I leave, would I be giving up? Or would I be right to do so? Is training myself to be stronger worth the stress and humiliation?

***TL;DR: Boss is terrible to me and my other coworker, has lost 5 receptionists in the 1 year she's been opened, and I'm miserable. But I don't just want to give up or walk away on what could be really good experience. What do I do?***",30Oct2019,2

It hasn't been a problem so far, I just explain to the customer that I'm new and probably not the best person to ask, they're typically understanding. I've been relying on coworkers to help me out, but I can't always do this.

588,"I posted the other day but forgot the login to my throwaway and accidentally logged out. He went in because he couldn’t stop crying at work and his psych told him to go to the ER. At the ER he told them he had dreams of death a lot and that was apparently enough for a 72 hour hold in a facility two hours (one way) from our home. We both panicked a little at first but after the initial shock we both kinda thought this was for the better. Give him a break from life and it’s stressors. 

Well the end of the 72 hours should be sometime around noon tomorrow (Halloween) but they diagnosed him with bipolar and put him on a new type of medication that may take a week or two settle in his body and brain. That’s fine, but in our state they can legally only hold him for 72 hours then at the most 15 days with a psychiatrists request. Then they can legally only hold him for any more time if he’s suffering from addiction (he’s not) or a judge orders he’s unfit to leave the hospital. 

I’ve done a lot of research on this since he went in to the facility. 

So every time he calls me during call breaks he tells me about what they’ve been doing (music therapy, Halloween movie marathons, meals, etc) and that’s great. I try to be nonchalant as to not stress him out but I always ask if there’s any updates, to which he says no. I asked this most recent call if they know when he’s getting out and he said whenever he asks they ignore the question and tell him not to worry about it. And it’s kinda socially frowned upon to even talk about leaving while there. 

They talk about their families and jobs and stuff but aren’t allowed to ask about going back to them? What?

I’m going to call the facility in a few hours if husband doesn’t have more info by then (he should see his psych by then). 

I would understand if there was some reason for keeping him there but I DONT KNOW. Unless husband isn’t telling me something, but we don’t really have that dynamic. We tell each other everything. Then again, I’m not gonna make any assumptions with the situation we’re currently in. Maybe he knows something he just can’t tell me, idk. 

But we have children. We need income eventually. Eventually I want to sleep with my husband again. And nobody is telling us anything. Even though he was stripped of his rights doesn’t he still deserve to know what’s happening? And can’t I know when my children’s father is coming home???

I’m sick with stress over this whole situation. Why they can’t just talk to me I don’t understand. I mean for Christ sake they called me to tell me about his diagnosis, so if that isn’t covered by some sort of privacy law why can’t they tell me at LEAST what they’re currently thinking about the duration of his stay.

595,"So 2018, I had a high end to my year. I had gotten into the school I wanted, and I was happily dating my boyfriend at the time. Then 2019 hit, and it's just been one big comedown.  I didn't realize the importance of mental health until these last couple of months, to be honest. I'm the type to keep things in because I've been told I have to be healthy and independent. And maybe sooner or later it will all just go away like how I used to cope with it. In the spring quarter, I was cheated on by my first boyfriend and best friend, who I was in a long-distance relationship. Because of this situation, I was under much strain mentally and emotionally.  I couldn't deal with it, to be honest. I had breakdowns every other night.  Because of the trauma of the breakup, my depression hit me for the worse, and I had no idea what to do anymore. I felt that I was lost and all alone with this trauma and confusing state.   
During the quarter, my brain and my thoughts became dark and muddled, and I couldn't sleep or even eat a full meal at times.  I did not know who to ask for help. I had friends and my parents. However, they were far from me, and when we talked, we just argued and debated on my decision to be friends with him when all I wanted was to move on and understand what happened. I'm the type of person who doesn't care if you hurt me. I want you to admit that you did it so I can work on it with you. I can't stand the lies because my sanity is questioned, and to be honest, I already have voices in my head that won't leave me. I don't need it anymore. The negativity that I faced worsened my mindset, so I chose not to ask for help and deal with my trauma myself when, to be honest, all I wanted was to go away and rest. That's it. Because I knew I had forgotten how to breathe. Then the spring quarter came, and I had still not dealt with my depression and trauma adequately. It became so severe that I would not come out of my room only from time to time.  
Added with school, I also was working a part-time job with 32 hours. I took up the hours because I believed I would have been fine, considering I did the same in community college. Also, I needed a way to help my parents since financial aid only covers the bare minimum, and I didn't want to burden them. Loans were not an option because I didn't want to burden them later with student debt. So, work became the only escape I had from all the stressors going on in my life. So instead, I became a workaholic.   
And just when I thought I would finally be able to deal with school and my life...go to therapy. Sort some shit out for once. Put up my grades. It's just my life is going downhill. My classes dropped again only when I did an appeal for my university. I can't talk to my parents about it because they expect me just to be a good student and do my work. My brother is the complete opposite of me, a good student. Great at school. I'm just trying to get through life at this point. At this point, it's only one second at a time. I don't like school anymore. I'm not willing to go to class. I'm tired and exhausted. I'm down to go to work and figure myself out. I don't know myself anymore. My counselor said, ""Someone can only take so much until it breaks..."" and to be honest, I think it's hitting the edge, and I don't want to kill myself. I'm not that ambitious yet, and I also don't hate life that much. I just don't know anymore. Do i quit school? Get disqualified and then reapply?

597,"I'll start by saying that my mom has some type of mental disorder, though she's never been to the doctor to get diagnosed, and I'm not familar enough with mental disorders to guess at a diagnosis.

She's regularly goes through extreme bouts of depression, often times when I'm talking to her, I can't understand what she's saying between her sobs, and saying she ""doesn't want to be here anymore"", which could be about something serious, or something trivial.

She cannot be reasoned with, and when she believes something to be true, nothing anyone can say will change her mind, regardless of how illogical her belief is (e.g. she can think a relative hates her, though that person is always trying to reach out to build a stronger relationship with her). She takes a very ""I'm the victim"" and self defeatist approach to life. She refuses to seek help. When she perceives a small sleight against her, she'll cut that person off, sometimes for months or years. 

I have 2 daughters, now 10 and 13 years old. My mom was over quite often to help with our older daughter when she was a baby and toddler. They became quite close.  When my younger daughter was a baby, something happened at a party where my mom thinks my wife got upset with her about how she was holding our second daughter when she was a baby (I highly doubt this was the case, as my wife doesn't care about that type of thing). My mom also thinks my younger daughter at the age of 3 said ""you can't tell me what to do, you're not my mother"", which again, I doubt happened since my 3 year was extremely shy, but even if it did happen, I don't think she knows what she's saying at 3 and probably saw it from some tv show.  

For these 2 reasons, my mom then stopped coming over, she's never been to our house since, or invited us over, 7-8 years later. Years later she mentioned the above stories to me as to why she just stopped coming over and taking my calls (she's very non-confrontational, she'll just cut people off instead). When we occasionally met for dinner, she'd ignore my younger daughter completely, making me want to setup dinners less frequently. We probably saw her (me and my 2 daugthers, without my wife, since my wife stopped going to these after my mom completely stopped talking to her after her perceived sleight). I tried often to get my mom closer to my younger daughter with these dinners and trying to get her interested in talking with her, with little success.

She now tells me often how much she misses my older daughter. We're actually getting ready to move out of state, and my mom is wanting some of type of relationship with my older daughter. I never had them talk on the phone, as I know my mom would only talk to my older daughter and not my younger daughter. This bothers me on so many levels, and with so many emotions ranging from anger to sadness, to also knowing my mom has this mental disorder and I'm sure just can't help herself.

The most likely scenario now on this path is I'll have a limited relationship with my mom and still give her updates to how everyone is doing on the phone a couple times a month, she'll see my kids a couple times a year on holidays, she'll get older and pass away, and I'll have regrets wondering if I should have done more to mend relationships. 

I know my mom is mentally ill, and I'm really not sure what to do. Advice?",30Oct2019,2

600,"Hi all, I'm not a professional teacher, but am studying to become one.  TLDR @ bottom

So, I work at a nonprofit afterschool program, and my job is to teach the pre-prepared curriculum/help with homework. I love what I do, but we are severely underfunded and understaffed. We waited a month for a pack of thumbnails, sticky notes, etc. (Basic supplies).

I have no issues helping with homework, but I am no longer helping them with that because my supervisor said so. We have lots of resources and curriculum we can use provided by the organization, local hospital (health related). But our most curriculum is paper and pencil and discussion based, which hardly works for the young kids. (We have K-8). I am responsible to teach them all within an hour if they do not have homwork except all kids are at different levels. Some can read and write, others cannot even if they all go to the same school, same teachers, same grade levels. Some are students with disabilities and need specialized curriculum that I cannot prepare within the 30 minutes I am given before and after program. Some of those 30 minutes go to cleaning, manually creating curriculum activites, trying to adapt with the supplies we have.

The program pushes for curriculum but also say we can't force them to do it (which I understand) but it begs the question of what am I there for then? If I cannot teach them something or help with homework (some of them don't bring homework even though they were given homework by their school teachers). There is no consequence for anything. I am essentially a baby sitter.

When I met my supervisor she self-described herself as laid back, but I now believe it was code for ""I try sometimes, other times I don't. Just depends."" She recently also expects me to explain to her everything that I do and why I'm doing it when it comes to curriculum. That is fine, but the way she comes across as demeaning and patronizing irritates me more than anything. 

I love my job, I love watching students progress. But I find it difficult to enjoy what I do when our program is lacking. I suppose I should have looked elsewhere when I learned that all the people I knew before fall semester began left within a span of 3 months.

I am afraid that at this rate I will burn out and hate education before I am a real teacher.

Should I move on and find something else?

TDLR: I teach curriculum/help with hw at my job. Understaffed, underfunded. K-8, not enough planning time, needs of kids are vastly different. Mixed messages when it comes to pushing curriculum. I feel like a baby sitter. My supervisor is lazy and patronizing. Afraid I will burn out before becomimg an actual teacher. What the heck do I do?",30Oct2019,1
601,"  

I am a 27 year old senior at a bachelors in psychology program in the US. I have spent the last seven years of my life bouncing back and forth between school and work in search of a career that I am truly interested in. Also, Two years ago I found out that I had a severe case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. After much hard work in therapy I have learned to live my life in such a way that brings me happiness and fulfillment. Looking back at how much OCD affected my life before treatment and seeing how happy I am now I’ve decided to specialize in the treatment of anxiety disorders. To go down this path I need to at least earn a master’s degree in clinical Psychology, but I would strongly prefer earning a PHD due to the opportunities and job security that come along with it. 

During my time in school I have dedicated myself to developing strong relationships with professors and earning A’s. Recently my efforts paid off and a professor floated the idea of working side by side on a research project and traveling the country presenting our findings (if everything goes as planned). This is a huge opportunity and could be the deciding factor in getting into a PHD program without earning a master’s degree first (and without all the debt that comes along with it). 

My problem comes in when that same professor assigned us the task of presenting some research in front of our class. When my turn came around, I had an anxiety attack and BOMBED (stumbled over my words, needlessly repeated things, and according to my friend I “was obviously shaken up”). I have my anxiety under control for the most part, but the future ramifications of this opportunity got in my head and caused me to act out of character. Unfortunately, this is the only presentation opportunity I will get in his class, so I won’t get the opportunity to redeem myself. My worry is that this instance will cause my professor to be apprehensive to put his name on research that I will be presenting at conferences.  

What should I do? Just talk with him about it? Just let it go? Practice the presentation and ask to represent it to him? I may be blowing this out of proportion, but the fact that this could affect my future has me worried.

606,"Over the last month I have been dating a girl of bisexual sexuality who I met on a dating app. We had extremely similar interests and personalities and kicked it off. Whenever we were together, we always had fun. During the relationship we'd send each other love memes and what if we kissed memes and I felt so happy. 

Every date felt like we were getting closer and closer and I grew more and more fond of her. She would that she was glad she found me and said it was like fate. I had never vibed with anyone so well and felt a way I never had before.

 A week ago I finally decided to ask her to be my girlfriend, and I was so happy when she said yes. On the weekend 2 days ago, I slept over her dorm and it felt like she loved me. We kissed and cuddled for hours and I had never been happier. She even wanted to watch shows I like to make me happy. In the morning we both woke up and couldnt sleep again so we talked and cuddled for hours. We decided to get food in the afternoon, and she held my hand in the car. 

Two days later, I noticed that her replies became simpler and simpler and took longer and longer. I felt uneasy and concerned. Eventually after four hours of not responding, she says ""Can we link up or voice chat."" I knew something was wrong. I responded with ""Sure, is everything alright?"" After some time, she writes ""I’m just not feeling anything between us, it’s not your fault. I just wanna talk about it since I think you deserve a conversation."" I was devestated and have been since. When I asked her if I did anything wrong, she said I was fine and that I did nothing wrong. 

It was ""all her"". It just doesn't make any sense to me, and I am so overwhelmed and dissapointed. I know one month doesn't seem like a lot, but our bond was like no other. She wants to be friends, but I still have a massive whole in my heart. She even instantly went back on the dating app after breaking up with me.

 I dont know how to move forward when I am constantly reminded of the great times we had together. Her not feeling a connection between us also baffled and destroyed me emotionally. I dont understand why she cuddled and kissed me for hours and became my girlfriend in general. Advice on this situation would be greatly appreciated as I am extremely emotional and could use the support.",30Oct2019,1

So my uncle is going through a horrible faze  like it's severe depression and anything I do doesn't seem to help , I feel like I'm watching someone die honestly and I feel like I have to help I just don't Know how .
 A little back story so my uncle's family aka my moms family they were around 7 siblings, my mom got married first and honestly we ( that's is my mom , dad , brother and I ) were really never very close to my grandparents and didn't really depend on them for anything I'd say. So I'm the mean while my uncle who my u is one of the youngest among the 7 was sent to work overseas and basically the rest of the family (my mom dad brother and myself excluded ) used to basically live at his cost while he slogged , fast forward almost 20 years later to now where everyone is married everyone is living there life except my uncle he's almost 50 unmarried he feels cheated like he paid for everything literally , my grandfather died this year in Feb and after that my grandmother like literally just fucked off from their house ( to live in the other siblings houses ) left him all alone ( he wanted to get married to this girl but idk what tf family etc in the end it didn't happen, I'm from India btw and here the concept of arranged marriages are a thing and my uncle thought that atleast they would get it married of to someone). He's now completely alone , feeling cheated , robbed and what not I really don't know and he's started drinking excessively like way way , and smoking like waaay lots it's like literally watching someone die and I really don't have anything with drinking or smoking but I can't watch this really, he's been living at our house now for almost 1.5 years ish met with a car accident before was literally sent here to recuperate, like when he gets drunk literally starts talking crap and to make matters worse we(mom dad brother and I ) weren't really treated well whatever I'm my grandparents house and that pisses me off sometimes. 
I Know my uncle is going through alot I've seen him cry I've actually taken an appointment with a therapist for him he's gone twice but stopped idk what to do literally I can't watch this and I can't believe my grandmom just abandoned him like idk how to help him , he says shit which hurts my mom also and I really can't stand that and sometimes I end up saying shit back , I really really really just want to help him out , but idk how .

Okay so I (23F) was dating this guy we will call him Kevin (26M) for 5 years. We met and stated dating since I was 18 and we had a normally OK relationship accept the fact that he had cheated on me twice and two years into the relationship he broke up with me the day I left to go to another country for just 3 Months (then coming back) to have freedom while I was gone... I came back and we got back together witch we shouldn't have in the first place but we did and stayed for a few more years.

I think there are a few reasons we stayed together even through the cheating is that my best friend (calling her jen)  has been dating Kevin's brother for 8+ years, we all lived/ rented together got a cat and a dog together, we are all friends with the same group of friends. So a break up was hard to do like it is in any relationship. But we did finally after 5 years it is officially over It has been hard but I've been rebounding ever since and it has helped a lot.

My Problem: a girl (we will call her Liz) in our group of friends started hooking up with my ex the night we broke up. its not the fact that Kevin is hooking up with someone I dont give a shit about that. its the fact that its Liz!! a Girl that I've known for years! A Girl that has been single the whole time I've known her and now all of the sudden shes dating my ex the same night we broke up!? a girl who I've hung out with hundreds of times with Kevin there and with him not there. Cant help but wonder if they have been hooking up while Kevin and I have been together? Another issue is that Liz is Jens childhood best friend they've known each other since elementary school so they are close as well. and now they have gone on weekend trips all together with a few others and jen is telling me that she doesn't know much about their relationship and doesn't want to know or whatever. I know it isn't my place to tell jen not to be friends with Liz anymore even though I dont want her to be. it makes me sick to my stomach knowing that this girl Liz did this to me and i dont know what to do And i'm pissed, isn't that girl code?  

Options ive thought of is; Removing Liz from all social media so I dont see something I dont want to see, cut my losses  with that group of friends/ People and make new friends witch I dont really know how to do but ill try, Still remain friends with jen even though she will probably not remain my best friend in the long run because of this whole situation and just spending less time together, or punch Liz?

So I've recently started university and there's a person here who seems to be very interested in being friends with me (calling them T just for clarity).

Luckily they're seeing a therapist regularly and are on medication, so I don't think I need to report it to the school or anything.

633,"I was never really super outgoing, but I always was able to make friends in the past or at the very least met someone I could talk to during classes. It was like this until I got into high school. For some reason in high school something changed in me and I don't know what. I suddenly didn't know how to hold a conversation and whenever I tried, it never lasted long and ended up being super awkward. A handful of times I felt as though I was finally starting to get back into talking again but every time I felt like that something happened and I just went back to being really quiet. In the end, I didn't make a single friend in high school.

I'm trying to change and be more talkative and make new friends in college, but the result is the same after two semesters. I simply don't know what to say and don't say anything. In my head I can imagine talking to someone else for hours, but in reality my mind blanks. I'm about to be 21 years old and have never had a girlfriend because I've never managed to work up to nerve to talk to a girl I like, and I only have 2 friends that I met back in elementary school, but even those friendships are dwindling.

What can I do to try and make new friends when I go back to college in January and how can I stop my mind from blanking when talking or meeting someone new.",30Oct2019,1

637,"Hi. I have autism, andiety, and depression. A great mix for being sucky at stuff. I’m a student in a high school and have been making all A’s this year. Pretty good, yah? Well, I have a hard time talking to teachers about stuff. I get nervous and freeze before I even get a chance to go up to them, or even cry mid-conversation. Yeah. Cry. This poses a problem, especially in a serious environment. When this happens, I try to compose myself only to find myself crying more than before any measures. I typically have to leave the room and hold my breath until the crying stops. I hate it. It’s like my body just decides to do it to fuck me up and make me look childish or narcissistic. I don’t want to draw attention to myself, seem childish, or even look like I’m doing that just to get my way. I really, really don’t want to do that. I just can’t seem to compose myself. Oddly enough, some days I just don’t get this anxiety. I don’t know what makes those days so different than the others, except for my lack in nervousness. So my question is, how do  I keep from getting so nervous that I cry? Why might these bouta of crying happen? What do I do about this?",30Oct2019,2
638,"For my exam I’m looking at “mental illnesses throughout time” and my biotechnology teacher think I should try and focus on one specific illness. He always mentions schizophrenia meanwhile my idea history teacher mentions depression (she has a good source on depression too).

I originally thought of anxiety since we used to treat “nervous” people back in the day with some pretty serious and damaging technologies. I figured I could connect it to what we today call anxiety. My bio teacher DECIDED that anxiety isn’t a REAL mental illness and I want a good grade (: so I’m dropping it. (I had anxiety)

Are there any other mental illnesses that you find interesting? Maybe you have one, so you know it’s complicated/interesting/etc? 

ADHD was something else that came up but my brother has it, and I doubt it will be interesting from a historical perspective. (From my experience with him). 

Then I thought about autism since I can imagine that could be seriously mistaken for something else with the little knowledge we had in (for example) 1600-1800.

I'm back in no contact now and realize I have a severe case of low self confidence. 

Directly after going into no contact, my best friend died unexpectedly, and it's been destroying me. 

The weight of things has lead me to lose sleep. I rear ended a car this morning on accident because I nearly fell asleep after a night of absolute panic.

 I'm normally very well rounded, and all I want to do is just got in this vacation and sleep, but I'm terrified my ex will come in like they did last time and potentially cause an issue in the work place, which I simply cant afford. 

I love my work place more than anything, and dont want anything to jeprodize my reputation or stability there. 

 I dont know what measures I can take that wouldnt break no contact but also protect me. I leave in 2 days.

653,"Hey guys,

I need a bit of help. Uni isn’t what I expected to be honest. My flat mates are nice people but they aren’t my kind of people if you know what I mean. I feel like we haven’t clicked. I feel like they are the “popular” people at secondary school who I always stayed away from. Due to this I’ve been avoiding them and eating alone because I rather be alone because I’m intimidated them. I tried on the first day to be their friends and add them on social media but they didn’t even add me on Snapchat and I can’t really ask for it now. One part of me doesn’t care because I would rather call my boyfriend who goes to a different uni to me in the evenings. I do have a few other friends here so I’m not really suffering. But I still feel sad that I’m left out. My other flat mates are close-  it’s 5 of us in total. I tried to talk to them asking how their day was but it never goes further than that. Like I said before one part of me doesn’t care because I like being alone and I have other friends to go out with. But on the other hand I feel so sad and I’m scared to go in the kitchen because I feel intimidated by them and scared things will be awkward. I feel like I tried to make an effort. But of course I could put more effort in by talking to them when they are all together which is often but I’m so scared. I tried to be funny on group chat that we made before we met eachother but I always get ignored. I feel like they don’t care about me so why should I care about them? Why should

655,"Hi,

I'm in my 30's and the only interaction with the outside world I have is going to college daily. I wanted to know how to talk to people espeically the opposite sex? The reason I'm asking this question is that I'm an AA male and even though I got sexual education from porn growing up I also want to know specifically how to talk to AA females? The reason I'm not into interracial dating (I posted a few derogatory subjects about BF's on this account) is that even today BM's that get into relationships with non-black females (especially European American) have to deal with more issues than combinations of non-blacks with whites and between each other (non-black ""minorities""). The main reason I'm not into IR dating (I still have a tendency to lust after non-black females) is because of a story of a guy getting 12 years in prison in Kansas for interracial dating (google black man gets 12 years).

She sometimes send me to sleep on the counch because she wants to spend alone time with him but she never does that to him. Every month the bills are sky high and I'm the only one paying them.

I couldn't take it, leaving her to suffer in silence. So I reported her father to CPS a few nights ago. They treated the case poorly, talking to them once and then being like ""Well, you're so close to emancipation age, so just hold it out, yeah?"" and ditched the case.

Everything was good for a while, and still is 95% of the time, but lately he has been having more and more angry breakdowns. He seems to get frustrated by every little thing to the point that he will smash (usually his own) things and has even recently taken a pair of scissors to his face giving him a rather superficial cut. I try to help him deal with his shit but you can’t help those who aren’t willing to help themselves. It’s getting to the point where I don’t even want to hang out in my own home for fear of him making me so angry that I turn to violence. 

I am getting very tired of dealing with his childish bullshit and the stress and lack of sleep is affecting my work. I don’t want to kick him out as he is on disability (for mental and physical reasons) and doesn’t really have anywhere to go. I also don’t want to move out as I would feel like I was abandoning the guy. Not to mention, the rent is low and the house (which is owned by another friend and I have lived in for 10+ years) is decently large.

669,"so about 3-4 weeks ago a couple moved into our house. we're in the military and they're just moving out of a barracks and are in between houses. we have a 3 bedroom place on base housing and only use 2 of the rooms as we're a new married couple ourselves. we just transferred to this base about 2 months ago so we don't really know anyone in this area. these guys were our first real ""friends"" and we don't really have many other people. my wife and i kind of have a hard time making friends so we're scared of ruining this relationship. I was under the impression that when they moved in they would only be here for about 2 months or so, but after talking to the guy he told me they were planning on around 6 months or more. As a new married couple I want to spend some time living alone with my wife since this is our first time living together, but that obviously isn't going to happen any time soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

since they are such a new couple we decided to throw them a bone and only charge $250 a month for rent (the cost of our car insurance and internet). the first week they lived here was fine. they respected our space, cleaned up after themselves, etc. however, they realized pretty quickly that my wife and i are people you could easily walk all over (we are people pleasers). I literally cannot say the word no. I don't go to cities because if a homeless person or someone trying to sell me something comes up my wallet will literally be emptied.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a list of things they've done so far that has pissed me off:

* One of them smokes and throws the cigarette butts on the ground outside. I'm afraid my dog will eat them but he hasn't stopped
* They ate all of my food while my wife and I were gone for 5 days (on a military TDY). I had entire boxes of toquitos, a loaf of bread, entire bags of chips, jars of peanut butter, boxed dinner, drinks, etc.
* My wife is still away but since I got back on Sunday (nearly 4 days ago), there were 2 clean plates in the cabinet. (we have 12 plates and 6 bowls). Half of them are in the sink dirtied up with food and half of them are in the dishwasher.. dirty. The first 2-3 weeks they were here I cleaned up after them every morning but I'm waiting this one out to see how long it actually takes them to clean up their messes.
* There is food wrappers, half eaten things, etc. all over my kitchen. We've started getting bugs and they actually CALLED ME DOWNSTAIRS at 1am last night to kill them. I refuse to clean up or say anything to see how long it actually takes them
* I had a shampoo bottle and soap bottle in my shower. Both were half full when I left and are now nearly empty a few days later. They're not cheap brands either
* The amount of laundry detergent, food, drinks, etc. they've taken from us in the past month is well over $250.
* I went to dominos last night to grab dinner and i got a medium pizza plus a thing of cheesy bread. I ate most of the pizza (2 slices left) and 1 piece of the cheesy bread (8 pieces overall). I decided to put it in the fridge to eat for lunch today. When I went to grab it there were only the 2 pieces of pizza left. They ate all my cheesy bread
* I keep going to grab a snack and what I want is never there because they always eat it
* They never replace anything they eat or drink that we bought
* We made them dinners every single day of the week 2 weeks ago - no payment at all from them just out of the kindness of our heart. We made good and expensive dinners (probably \~$20-30 each). They decided to make us dinner one night and asked us to buy our own steak (they buy theirs we buy ours) because they blew all of their money shopping
* We went on a trip with them (about a 6 hour drive) and they didn't repay us anything (we paid for gas, the hotel, everything).
* They have been borrowing one of our cars and have yet to fill the tank (they fill it just enough to get where they need to go and leave it on empty)
* One of them is working swing shifts and the other doesn't have a job. They stay up all night and sleep all day. When they stay up all night they blare the TV downstairs and yell and scream and laugh all night. It keeps me up. I tip toe around the house during the day while they're asleep (I've been working from home between jobs) and respect their sleep
* They keep barging into rooms I'm in without knocking. What if I'm doing something they shouldn't be seeing?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll add anything else when I think of it because I know there's more.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me explain our pay a bit. Since we're on family housing, the $900 we're supposed to get for rent gets automatically taken out of my wife's paycheck (she's active duty i'm national guard). Since they don't have a place, they keep the $900 and only pay us $250 for rent. They're completely freeloading off of us.

&amp;#x200B;

Since we have a hard time making friends, my wife doesn't want me to really confront them but she really wants them out, as do I. But, she doesn't want to lose them as friends (they are pretty good people if you're not living with them). My wife and I's marriage is in a rough spot right now and I don't want to set her off to much and have anything really bad happen between us. I love her to death and I don't want to lose her over another couple.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's just say, I feel like I'm living in their house and I don't really know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; Couple is living with us, freeloading off of us, and making our lives extremely hard. Wife and I have a hard time making friends and don't want to lose their friends. We are also going through a rough patch and I don't want to make her angry because she doesn't want to lose them.",30Oct2019,2

Little backstory here, my wife and I are in our mid 20's and one of my wife's good friends works at a chiropractic office as a receptionist. Said friend is very close to receiving a bonus for bringing in a certain number of new patients.  My wife and I already have someone we see for chiropractic/massage work but in an effort to help my wife's friend, my wife wanted the two of us to become new patients at the friend's office.

My wife and I were setup with an appointment on Monday morning to go start the new patient process of filling out paperwork, getting x-rays, and getting a full examination done by the chiropractor in order to establish a baseline for each of us.  While filling out the paperwork, we decided that I should be the primary person on our account since our health insurance is through my work and I am usually more available for contact if they needed to call either of us for any reason.  

New patient x-rays and exams are underway and my exam goes quick and easy.  My only real issues is bad posture and some minor problems caused by doing a lot of sitting during the day.  On the other hand, my wife has had issues with her back for the past 10+ years due to a congenital defect that caused two of her lower vertebrae to fuse and form excess bone around them.  She has seen many doctors and back specialists in the past and generally speaking, they have all caused her more problems than anything.  In my opinion, half of these people see my wife as a ""golden egg"" and want to be THE person to fix all of her issues and the other half have used her as an experiment.  Needless to say, the chiropractor was much more interested in my wife's situation than he was with mine.

Fast forward to Monday night.  It is 7:30pm and my wife and I are in bed for the night watching tv.  Her phone starts ringing and it is a random number.  She answers the phone and it is the new chiropractor calling from his personal cell phone.  He tells my wife that he was thinking about us and wanted to know how we were doing after our appointments that morning. My wife and I had completely opposite reactions.  My wife's first thought was ""That's so sweet that he actually cares about people and checks in on them.""  My first reaction was ""Why the \*\*\*\* is this 60 year old man calling my wife after hours from his personal cell phone?!?""

My wife and I are both on the fence about the situation and I would like your input.  My concerns are that we specifically put my name as the Primary person on the account and he still called my wife's phone directly rather than going through me first.  I'm also uncomfortable that rather than calling from an office phone before he left the office, he called after operating hours using his own personal device.  This means that my wife's personal cell phone number is now in his personal device.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Wife and I are mid 20s.  Went to new chiropractor to help out a friend. New chiropractor is male in his 60s. He called my wife late at night using his personal cell phone to see how we are feeling after first appointment.  I think its extremely creepy, wife thinks it was thoughtful and caring. Am I overreacting/overthinking this?",30Oct2019,1
671,"My friend is an atheist, and she believes that there's nothing after life. She has recently been extremely depressed and I'm afraid that it'll go nowhere but downhill from now. We were talking about purpose in life and what mine is, and I noticed that all her purposes in life are materialistic things like ""my pets"" or ""my friends/family"" which was very alarming. 

I pointed how that's not a good thing to have to serve as a purpose in life because materialistic things go away and people move on or die, and how it's best to use ideas as a purpose in life. Like ""My purpose in life is to educate, learn, and drive humanity forward"" or ""My purpose in life is to help others in any way, shape or form till the day I die"" or ""To leave a positive impact on this planet,"" etc etc.

I'm not religious, but I do come from a religious household that taught me about a god and life after death, which is something I don't/do believe in. I don't want to force her to do anything that doesn't make her happy or content with her life.

She finds the idea of religion to be extremely depressing because she sees the whole practice as the individual trying to please god. I'm very worried about her and I feel like absolute shit when she cries because of such topics because I deeply understand such pain. What else do you guys think I should do?",30Oct2019,1
672,"To be as brief as possible, I refunded myself about 1200 over the course of the year from my retail job to try and reduce medical expenses. I knew there was a high chance I would be caught, but I am a two-job working student and I have no support from anyone except myself. I admit what I did was wrong, but I did what I did and now I am faced with this situation. 

I was shocked when I was pulled into my managers office as it has been over a month since my last refund, but I was not surprised when I saw a person from the loss prevention team sitting there. He was nice and explained throughly what his job was. I saw an envelope with papers in it next to him and he started to inquire around what I had done without accusing me. I knew he knew more than he was leading on to so I just admitted it when he finally got around to asking. He said he appreciated me cooperating. He then went into detail about what happened and said he wanted to understand from a human side of things why I did what I did. He said he believes the company hires good people and that they don't make bad choices when they hire and he wants to know my mindset. I explained my financial and life situation and he said he felt for me and got it. He asked me more questions to which I answered honestly and proceeded to then have me write out what I said and he did the same. He then pulled out a paper of a payment plan in which he showed me how much I owed and the time I had to pay it back etc etc. I didn't know if he was doing this as a form of repayment or simply to just have evidence against me. He said he needed to now elevate this and then I would hear back by the end of the week. I am broke and I have no real idea what to do. 

Again, I know what I've done is wrong but I have a few questions. Do you think I am going to be arrested / criminally charged? How can I best prepare myself for the outcome of this situation? I have another job and I asked if I could go full time and they said yes. So, if I am fired..which I assume I will be I have that. They said I was suspended with pay and that I will be paid until the investigation is over. I'm 21 and I don't really know what do. Any advice would be helpful.",30Oct2019,2
673,"So, I’m a sixteen year old girl, and I live with my dad and my grandad. My dad moved in with him a couple years ago to take care of him, as he’s nearing ninety and after a heart attack he needed some sort of help at home. He’s pretty much independent but my dad just helps with cleaning and cooking. So far I’ve lived with my mum (child from a broken home here) and just recently I moved in with my dad as it’s more convenient and closer to where I study. I never had an issue with my grandpa, we always seemed to have an okay relationship, but I’ve never really spoken to him properly. He’s a minister, and highly religious, so I don’t think he approves of me or my dad since we don’t go to church. The past year or so though, I feel there’s definitely an icy atmosphere. He’s always complaining about me to my dad, for really silly things, that I forget to close doors, turn off my light, and even that I use too much toilet paper. Obviously a girl is going to use more than a guy. He doesn’t speak to me, usually ignores me, and I can always feel him disapproving whatever I do, I can just be sitting in the room and he’ll start shaking his head at me while giving a dirty look. I got up and walked across the room the other day to get something while he was watching tv and he started making a big fuss that I was in the way, even though I passed in front of the tv for a split second. I know all those things can be just put down as being a cranky old man, but to confirm my thoughts, I heard him talking about me to himself one day. I came home early from college and sat myself down in the living room, he was wandering about muttering to himself, and I realised what he was saying was about me, ‘she’s a lazy miserable lump, there’s something dreadful about her.’ At first I thought maybe he was talking about my cat, he’s not too fond of her, but it seems pretty doubtful that’s the case. I don’t really get how any of that’s true, I pick up after myself, I keep to myself most of the time, if there’s any mess it’s usually just in my own room. I do get a little pained when I hear him talk so fondly about his other grandchildren, already buying lots of Christmas presents for them, when last year all I got from him was a dog toy. I don’t want to sound ungrateful or petty, but the years before he’d always get me pretty okay stuff, just as time goes on it becomes clear he’s disliking me more and more. I don’t really know what to do, I talk to my dad about it but he tells me not to take it personally, I struggle with that though. I feel I’m unwelcome here, I’d go back to my mum’s if the situation was better at hers but it isn’t really, besides it’s too far away from my college. I’m hoping to move away with my boyfriend next summer, but it’s a struggle getting through these last months. He recently went away to my aunt’s for two weeks, and it was absolutely great having just my dad there. There was peace, there was quiet, I didn’t feel like I was being judged. I felt myself dreading his return. The other problem is his room is right next to mine and he doesn’t sleep, and tends to make a lot of noise, so it’s ear plugs for me unfortunately. I just feel quite upset about how he sees me, I know he probably doesn’t have more than a few years left on this earth, and I don’t want him to leave knowing that he didn’t like me. I have no idea what to do, everything I do he doesn’t like. It’s not like I can ask him about it, there’s never been that sort of relationship there. He doesn’t really like listening either, if he talks there’s usually no chance to get a word in. I know there’s probably nothing I can do other than accept it, but if anyone can help, don’t hesitate to comment, thank you. :)",30Oct2019,2
675,"So Friday night I lost my baby boy. The father and I are never really in a relationship, but we have been basically together. He claims he's single, but he acts completely different. He's with me every single day, he sleeps at my house every night (even though he has a place), he shows so much affection and is constantly cuddling with me and even whenever he's not with me he calls me anyways. He initially said he didn't want to be together because I'm too good for him, but then he said he doesn't love me. He said he wants to be friends, but yet he still acts the same and always wants me around. He calls me his girl and has accidentally called himself my bf several times. He also has a long history of trauma and he's faced a lot of rejection and stuff so he's a little hardened in the heart. I just don't know how to deal with this because he was like this even before I lost the baby. I just don't know what to think. He acts like he loves me, but he says he doesn't.",30Oct2019,2

That college isn’t the only one, there are hundreds of school in this program that will let me transfer tuition free.

One day, she told me he died and her mom wouldn't let her go to the funeral or something like that. We got in a fight over it because it sounded totally fake to me and I called her out on it.

We're 25 now. I'm still SO curious about that boy and what the story was. But back then, whatever it was, she was really upset and hurt by it, so idk if its appropriate of me to bring up. And if it was fake, am I going to embarrass her by asking?",30Oct2019,1
680,"Ok, so I’m writing this because I’m genuinely baffled and have no idea how to approach this situation. So my roommate and I are friends, we met last year and decided to room together this semester. I have no complaints about them roommate-wise, it’s been fine. 
Roommate likes kpop. A few days ago they told me that one of their favorite groups had a member leave. The kpop boy is fine, he just had to leave because of something with his contract, and yeah it kind of sucks but honestly it was his choice is what it sounds like. 
Roommate has taken this incredibly hard. At first I wanted to be sympathetic because it was important to them, but honestly it has become ridiculous. Roommate  has stopped eating, cries at every given opportunity, talks non stop about this kpop boy and the company, and is skipping classes, acting like a close family member has passed away. This has gone on for almost three whole days. I’ve stopped doling out sympathy and I’m trying to ignore their obvious pleas for attention but it’s so frustrating to watch them take these extreme and destructive actions.

683,"I feel incredibly torn and unsure about who to trust or what to do, it's giving me stomach pains. I got into an accident two evenings ago. I was getting off the freeway, waiting in the far right lane to turn at a red light. A truck slammed into me from behind. Apparently his brakes weren't working, he swerved to avoid the highest concentration of cars and ended up just hitting me.

I'm actually fine. My car's rear windshield was shattered and the trunk is caved in. But I don't even really have whiplash. I was in a much more major accident a little over a year ago, where someone made an illegal left turn and totaled my car. I was severely injured in that accident and still suffer back and neck pain. The police put the other vehicle at fault, but in my state (in the US) that doesn't matter for insurance, and so neither insurance took blame and I was only paid for the value of my totaled car. That money went into paying off my vehicle, leaving me with just enough money left over to buy an older, shabbier vehicle (the one that was just hit).

In this latest accident, the truck company's insurance is going to claim fault. They want to meet with me tomorrow to go over things, like my injuries and the fact that I'm losing time off work (I'm a Lyft driver, that car was my livelihood). The agent heavily implied I'd be walking away with a check. My girlfriend's coworker insisted I talk to a lawyer that she swears by. I didn't actually call them, but my father did, after I happened to mention it to him. And now the lawyer has just contacted me. They told me not to go to the insurance meeting. They want to set me up with their own doctors so I can go to a bunch of chiropractic meetings and do x-rays and all that. Apparently, the lawyers will make a ""package"" with all the time I spend at the doctors, and negotiate payment with insurance that way. Then we would split the ""winnings"" (as the lawyer put it) three ways.

The lawyers are insisting the insurance company will give me the bare minimum to make me go away. I'm not wholly concerned about injuries, I just want my car fixed as quickly as possible, and some money to cover the lost work. I do have a bit of back pain, but I've had this pain since the previous accident where my car was totaled. I can't really tell if it's any worse now. It feels a bit disingenuous, like I'm taking advantage of a new accident to fix an old pain. And I always hate this mindset that whenever something happens we have to try to make as much as we can out of it. But I also don't want to get screwed over again. I'll be taking a lot of time off work over the course of the next two months for holidays, and I had planned my income down to the cent so I'd be able to take time off to visit my family (who live on the other side of the country and I only see once a year for Christmas) and still pay rent.

Now with this accident, my entire income has been shot. I can rent a car through a Lyft program, but they'll take $200 a week from my earnings for the rental, which is nearly half my weekly income (not even including what I lose from gas). I will not be able to afford rent without canceling my holidays, which I already bought tickets for. I'm not sure what to do. If I meet with the insurance, I might get locked into a deal that ends up hurting me. Could I still go and reject their check if it doesn't cover the costs this accident has caused? Will using a lawyer cause even more strife than it's worth? I just want to get my car fixed and pay my rent and see my family for Christmas. What's the best way to do this without screwing myself or anyone else over?",30Oct2019,1

693,"One of my closest and oldest friends (25m) dating back to high school has recently taken up bodybuilding in the past 2 years. I’ve always been supportive of him in all of his goals and this was no different at first. I went to his shows, trained with him, and even encouraged him to pursue a career in fitness as a full time gig down the road. 

This was fine at first but over time his obsession with bodybuilding grew and he could not shut up about it. Whenever I’d invite him out to to a get together, he would constantly talk down on everyone because they were drinking ‘empty calories’ or worse, he would pull out a calorie counter and tell you how many calories you were eating. 

I was able to brush this off until he started becoming inconsiderate of all our time. We’d make plans to meet up at a specified time (Mind you we’re all in our mid to late 20s so time is scarce), and he would absolutely blow us off or show up several hours later, even when he was the one that insisted on us meeting up. Usually because he was meal prepping or working, or both. 

Things hit a climax when he and I did a boys trip to Mexico recently and he absolutely refused to let me have a good time. He had a comment to make about every single thing I drank and every meal I ate. Furthermore, he had to go to the gym for 3+ hours everyday (always around noon) and refused to do anything that we had planned (snorkeling, cave exploration, etc.) because he was self conscious of his legs and wore jeans everywhere. Throughout the trip I told him that I didn’t care about any of those things and that he needed to STFU but he either didn’t listen or didn’t care.

Anytimes the guy is around, my GF acts nice, but an animated ‘my day is suddenly better’ type of nice. I dont know if to take that as a mother being nice to her daughters boyfriend, but it comes off as suspicious sometimes. Some of the things she says or how she says it is what bothers me. Shes very playful and I feel I know her well enough to know when shes putting on for someone. 


This has been on my mind as of late, but have not pressed it. My GF claims loyalty and Im the only and so on and on, but thats a played tune for us humans. Especially those of us that have been fed those lines only to be played. 


Skip to today: the four of us are out somewhere to do something for my GF. The place has security so we have to do the whole airport thing with thing bins. Someones headphones get tanged and my GF goes to help untangle, funnies ensue and we are laughing while walking up to the front desk, my GF and her daughters BF are the ones dealing with the headphones ordeal. Hes pulling them while her hand is stuck in the tangle. She makes a joke saying “do you want my hand?” And laughs. She then turns away from me, towards him, and follows up with “I mean you can have it, but I want it back” and laughs again.


Now to me I know if roles were swapped and Im all giggly with a girl saying these things, my GF would look at me funny. 


Ive thought it over and over and my personal opinion is I think I am right to suspect something but I dont have any land to walk on in a proof type of way. 


My advice is moreso how do I go about this? If I do bring it up, how do I bring it up and keep the conversation civil without triggering something?",30Oct2019,2

700,"I have a very close friend of almost 20 years and recently, my physical health has gone downhill which has also caused my depression disorder to get much worse. I try my best not to be a 'debbie downer' so I tend to keep most of my complaints to myself, though some days are really bad lately and on those days, it's harder not to be so negative. The last few weeks, I've noticed that every single time I mention something even remotely negative going on in my life, she has to one up it or says something to the affect of ""oh yeah I'm right there with you""; and it's increasingly difficult to deal with. Obviously this happens, I've been guilty of it myself.. But the last few weeks it's been Every. Single. Thing. I have medically diagnosed illnesses that cause my symptoms and she feels like because she had a 'rough week' with her kids, it's the same. (I know her life and yes, it has been rough in the past, but she's doing good so I don't understand why she's doing this.) I've even stopped bringing up any negativity to her whatsoever. I need advice on how to approach taking to her about herself because it's to the extent I feel like I'm going to push her farther and farther away and I don't want to lose our friendship.",30Oct2019,3
701,"Hey everyone. I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years about 6 months ago and since then I have had implemented a lot of healthier things into my life. Some of these things include working out daily, drinking exclusively water (no soda/coffee/etc), and trying to sleep more. Things have been going really well, but I've noticed that other things in my body are starting to happen which are really freaking me out. I'm always more tired than usual, my hair is thinning/coming out, my libido is really low, etc. I'm a really anxious person and I'm worried about having low testosterone or something similar. I can't tell you the last time I woke up with morning wood, I truly couldn't. I have been with 3 people since I broke up with my girlfriend, and every time, I've either been unable to get it hard or only been able to get it hard for a few minutes before going soft. I can't even masturbate with a full erection. I'm just really fucking worried that something is wrong with me, and it's highly embarrassing having these issues at age 22. I am hoping all of this shit is in my head and that my levels are fine, but I am getting blood work done this week to check. I am just looking for any positivity or advice that might help me feel better. While these issues extend past sex, this is really the main reason I am so bent out of shape over it, it is so embarrassing not being able to get hard for a beautiful woman when you're sober. Not to mention, who the fuck likes thinning hair. I'm really going crazy and just need someone to hear me out.",30Oct2019,1

705,"Sorry for the long story.  I've posted this to a bunch of subreddits because Im kinda really anxious and I want a ton of responses.

Background:  
So the other day I (M, 20) was parking my car at my college dorm and I accidentally scratched someone’s car.  I left a note with my number, which she (F, ~20) called. Everything started really professionally, and she said she would get back to me with an estimate the next week.  I requested she get second and third estimates as well, and she seemed to respond positively.

When she got back to me, however, she got extremely impatient and started getting less professional when I asked about the additional estimates.  She said that she wanted to get it done with quickly and that I wouldn’t get to decide where she went, so I didn’t need any more estimates. She claimed that they would only vary by about $20 anyway, which goes against what I’ve been made to understand.

This change in attitude and the estimate being higher than I had expected makes me a little nervous that I’m being taken advantage of.  

Question:
What should I do?
I want to make sure that I’m not taken advantage of.  That she doesn’t just pick the most expensive place for estimates and that she doesn’t include any repairs that weren’t my fault in the estimates.

I’m working with my parents to try and figure out how many estimates our insurance would ask for for comparison, and I intend on paying the shop directly, but we’re still new to this and I’d like as much advice as I can get.

Thanks for any help",30Oct2019,1
706,"Hey. I could do with some objective, impartial, friendly advice from strangers on the Internet. 

I'm 32, and currently in recovery from being poisoned by a prescription med. It's been 3 years so far, and I've just started feeling able to go for 10min walks round the block. I'm currently in trauma therapy as a result of the range of symptoms and effects it's had. 

I was living independently but had to leave due to my housemate and moved in with a parent. In this time both parents have became ill, and fragile, and lost all their money due to a messy divorce. I now have to leave as the flat we were renting will be sold. I have 3 months. 

I should be able to just do it with the money I have, but, in general, I need to get on my feet. I am currently surviving off disability benefit and I want to fight my way to a position of financial security and independence. Also because I have a younger brother who is very vulnerable and want to be able to provide for him. 

I need to decide on a serious career but I don't know what, and I don't know when I'm going to make a full recovery. So I can't do work shadowing or internships to figure things out.

I crave security but feel like I can't commit to a full time job (right now) because of health. 

I'm very creative and make some money as a part time illustrator and artist. I don't really feel like this a secure career though.
I like helping people but realise I could do this on a voluntary basis.

If I'm being honest with myself, having always lived paycheck to paycheck and now having experienced intense vulnerability, I'm drawn to status and financial security. Partly for the obvious security, and partly for the feeling of self worth in the world. And yeh I know you shouldn't attach that to external things but let's face it - working on something worthwhile, such as providing for yourself, your brother, and future family is I imagine, deeply satisfying and significant in our sense of self. 

I need to find a job/career that either:
1. pays well
 or 
2.pays enough but leaves enough time to build up my creative work which I feel has  potential to push annual earnings up. 

I'm a qualified teacher, but, it's probably the best job at NOT fulfilling either of the above criteria 😂 (I qualified when I was young, idealistic and invincible). 

Here are the other criteria:

Essential
Job that I can actually do without hindering health
Pays well

Desirable
Potential for growth and progression
Intellectual stimulation 
Autonomy
Big picture aspect (fighting for justice, social issues)
Geographically flexible (if I moved abroad in 5 years it wouldn't take much to retrain for that country)

The complication

Don't know when I'll recover
Don't know when I do recover and am well enough to work if there'll be some vulnerability with my health indefinitely. Therefore high energy, high stress jobs possibly a risk to aim for.

Without going into too much depth, I am absolute shit at anything math/science oriented and have failed on these fronts countless times. In fact, I am struggling immensely with a coding course at the moment. Regardless of this, I have managed to convince previous employers (employers=internships bc I'm 22) that I am competent in those areas when I have shown no evidence of that to be true. Regardless, I was able to get two brilliant letters of recommendation from two fairly large companies, and I am still wondering how they were able to convince themselves that I am the person they say I am.

My parents are good people, but I know that level of strictness is what drove me to all sorts of reckless behaviors when I left the house. I dont want them to push my brother away, but I understand the importance of what they are trying to do by having him do well in school.

I dont know which of the two created it. But originally it was the DM who posted something for an email, everyone typed OK and now the supervisor is using that same group chat to call people out. “Miss victoria make sure x is done from now on mr godfrey dont do this” normally if you are to be repremanded it is NOT in a public text message.

For example, one coworker has health issues, another is doing home repairs, and another goes home to visit family on occasion. They all report to my bosses boss who approves it always. We are all on the same team, in the same role. 

My boss has allowed me to work remotely for 1-2 weeks at a time, when I want to see family. My family lives across the country so it’s hard to go home (and expensive). I asked to go home this summer and he said no this time. He said the policy is 2 days a week. 

I found this very strange since he had said yes in the past and since all my other coworkers are allowed to, basically at their own discretion.

721,"TLDR: I'm turning into a sour person working here but I need the reference and cant afford to work for less. How do I help myself?

I take more than one issue with my job so I'll try to be concise on my points. I work at a Pellet Plant for a company I won't name. We produce a small amount of power here as well as the pellets. We're a 3rd class plant. We're set up right beside their sawmill and planar. I was stoked to get my job here and never worked in the industry before I got my chance 2 years ago. I grew spiteful and upset about 8 months ago.

We had a change of managment in the last 8 months. Our new supervisor is an older guy that only really has the job to satisfy his boredom. Before this our other supervisor was a guy in his mid 30's. Great guy, everybody loved him, and we all respected him because he respected and appreciated us when we would bust our ass. The new guy couldnt guve a shit wether the job gets done or not. He just takes it on blind faith that people do the work without going out to check that the job is done right. He has made some questionable safety calls that I disagree with, and is too lenient on cracking down on people.

My hours are always changed to benifit everyone else. No one else has their hours changed back and forth. One guy had a drug problem so they set my hours to be fucked so he could do something better.

Several times I've been required to act as supervisor to sign off on paperwork regarding the abilities of another worker. I'm just a utility here, not managment. Even if I'm asked to train the new people, when the operator takes them onto their shift they get lazy and just sit around for hours on end a day when they should be out cleaning. No one follows up on their work to make sure its done right.

This is a big one. I run a trackmobile as part of my regular responsibilities as well as loading our railcars. The company wont pay me equipment operator wage because ""all the other pellet plants get paid the same wage. No one else earns more than you."" I'm paid $22.30 an hour. The company pays the forklift drivers at the sawmill more than they pay our 3rd class power engineers. It's not just me. We all get stiffed on our wages, and most people have just settled into being depressed and deal with it. I'm ticketed on all our equipment except 1 and it does nothing for my pay. They gave me $0.40 an hour to be a 3rd level first aid attendant and after 2 years of no on site training, I declined it because I felt I couldn't perform my responsibilities properly.

We have a union, but it feels like they dont give a shit about us. They constantly fail to properly represent how we feel about anything happening here. Our reps within the site care more than the actual union it seems.

This has become too long a post so to sum it all together: I hate new ""managment"" and their complete inability to manage the crews. Our site looks like shit, and people who just get hired now get a free pass to do nothing and earn my wage while I'm expected to fix their mistakes. I just want to come to work where I can be taken seriously and just do my job without worrying ehat other people do or don't do. I can't just settle for a poorer paying job atm. I have too many bills and too much debt right now. What do I do? I've started lashing out at people and I normally never do that sort of thing.",30Oct2019,1
722,"Hi....apologies for the length. I work in a smallish industry in a major city, I've worked for my current firm for about 2.5 years.


A friend-of-a-friend, J (40sF), is about to join a team which sits adjacent to mine. There is about maybe 10% crossover between that team and my function within the department. That team has very serious recruitment problems ie they struggle to find people they like with the right specialism.


J is someone I maybe see once a year, ie only when I go down the pub with our mutual friend, T (40sM), who is also in the same industry. She also came to my wedding a few months' back as T's plus one, since I really wanted T there but he didn't really know anyone and is single. As I'm not directly involved in that team's hiring process I only found out J was joining the firm after she was offered / accepted.


I have some concerns about J joining from my selfish perspective -


1. J has a history of unstable behavior, mostly alcohol induced but not always. For example at my wedding she got so drunk she had to be put in a cab, only to be thrown out of it shortly after for behavioural issues, and T had to go and collect her, take her to his and call her bf to explain what had happened.
Other people I work with who know her have similar stories.


2. I have known J for 8ish years or so. When I first met her via T she sent me some creepy messages for a bit that I ignored at the time. I don't recall what they said but think she may have been hitting on me. I can't really remember mind.


3. To join our firm, this will be her third job in around 2 years. I have contacts at both of the previous two firms who tell the same story: she causes work drama, cries a lot when challenged and throws paperwork in tantrumd. 
Unfortunately I believe these stories from my interactions with her.


4. I found out today, which prompted this post, that she has outright lied to get this job. I knew she was leaving to get away from interpersonal drama in her current job, and it's completely understandable in my view why you would give an ""adjusted reason for leaving current job"" to a potential employer.
However, she's told my firm she's leaving as she is an FTC (fixed term contractor) coming to the natural end of her contract. This is categorically not true - she's a permanent employee handing in her notice. In my industry, there is a big difference between FTC and perms so this is a material lie.
She's told it because she doesn't want to be seen to be leaving two jobs in quick succession.




There's more but this is already quite long. I cannot change the fact she is joining, it's too late to take my manager aside and even if I did, I have no proof of the red flags. So, I know I have to wait this one out. Any ideas, Reddit? I'm concerned she will latch on to me and drag me into her dramas.

727,"I willingly took on the role of this business club on campus as the president. No one wanted to do so I volunteered. First semester holding the position was ok, we weren't expecting students to get involved as the previous executive members  didn't leave any information on where to access finances, who to go to if we needed help with our organization etc. so it was a learning curve that we are still trying to figure out. This semester we're planning events and trying to reach out to the people in the business department to help spread word about our club (which is 3rd business club on campus). The other 2 clubs are very populated and don't seem to do much as I've attended meetings before, but I am unsure as to why people are willing to join those clubs but not mine. Previous executives had a handful of people attending meetings and now everyone on the executive board are the only ones attending. We have done everything to try and get people involved, I designed a bulletin board to spread word, we have flyers everywhere etc and no one comes to meetings. Any advice on how to change the club to make it seem more appealing to students? Any ideas on more interesting events that we can host? Ideas on how to make business fun. 

To preface the next rant I'd like to note that we did write job descriptions together to make sure everyone was comfortable with the work load and everyone signed off on it. These documents were also supposed to be for the next executive members but I don't think that is in sight currently. 

Also recently my executive board is me and 3 other men and they are lazy and rude and I wish I would kick them out of their position. The secretary helps designs the flyers and sends out weekly emails to let the people on our mailing list (the ones that dont show) know when there are events and meetings. Numerous times he's spelled things wrong, gotten dates wrong, and the designs are just terrible and don't flow nicely, like he has no understanding of what color theory is. 

My treasurer is an accounting major and doesn't do anything I've asked him do. It took him 2 months to give me a financial estimate on pens. On his job description I've asked him to give me monthly reports of spending for the club, which I haven't been handed one ever. The club is in a rut currently so we are not spending much but it would make our executive meets feel more practical if we actually had things to discuss and actually plan. 

Lastly my VP is seemingly the only one I butt heads with. he's controlling and will branch off on his own to talk to people and never discuss anything with me, for starters, but with the club in general. He's sneaky and its disgusting. Some days he says absolutely nothing during meetings, other days he's taken control of the entire operation. On these days he blatantly ask for ideas as to what should go on the flyer, or into planning. I will answer and he gives a look of like ""yeah right. in your dreams"" and then will move to ask the other men in the group what they think. I dont know how to improve this club dynamic to get even my executives involved as we typically sit in silence during meetings. It's like pulling teeth to get anyone to talk. I can't tell you how many times I've thought about just resigning and letting them deal with the mess that was left for us to deal with, because I really don't see change ever happening. I know it's a lot to digest, but if you have any advice, it would be appreciated. :)",30Oct2019,1

735,"I moved in with my grandparents for the winter this month (October). One thing I’ve noticed is that my grandma is way too pessimistic to be healthy. A little backstory. My grandparents have been screwed over multiple times since my grandpa got (unfairly) fired from his job, about a year or so ago. My grandparents moved into a place only to find out they’d been screwed over by their real estate agent, an entitled rich (by marriage) bitch. They paid a local to fix up their house and instead he screwed it up, only to disappear. They now have an unfinished house with tons of issues, very little job security, issues with my grandpa’s machine that gives him air at night (supplier is very finicky about appointments and shit, HE has to do all of that, even though most of his time is spent working and he doesn’t want to deal with that shit). So now we get to our problem. This, plus the removal of her friends and hobbies, has made my grandma’s outlook on life very sad. She won’t respond to recommendations, she turns anything good into bad (for example, Team Trees mention turned into “they probably just plant it and forget about it” and “I bet they just line their own pockets with the money” even after describing details about the project).

We had to do peer reviews and she came to my table sat next to me at my table. She sat between me and a woman Im friends with, talked to her she said something, smiled at me and looked deep into my eyes and didn't stop smiling and it felt awkward, if I didn't break the eye contact she probably would've continued. She was making forced eye contact and scratching her head while resting her head on her hand. One day I sat down waiting for class and sat with a woman I give a lot of attention to in class and she came in for class walked over and started waiting very close to me, hovering over standing in my personal space, she walked right in front of me and started getting close to me and I could smell her but she had her back to me. This was the closest she's been to me. There was a whole room not a lot of other people. When I talked about another girl that likes me that I don't like and asking for advice from a woman I talk to in college to not lead her on. She joined the conversation said that the other girl will continue pushing and I have to ignore all together and tell her I'm not interested. This was the biggest response I got from her and longest convrsation. She started this stuff after I asked for advice, . I told her someone said my hair looks like the clown from it and she said that's not nice. I saw her in the hall one day we stopped seeing each other in class. She saw me and stopped and asked me how my classes were this semester and she had the biggest smile on her face. I ask her stuff and it's like she has a hard time with conversation but has the biggest smile on her face talking to me. I said my advisor would kick me out bc he knows I smoke pot and she says ""awww"" I do get an awkward forced vibe from her. I asked her how her classes were and it went over her head. I crossed paths walking on a small walkway and she didn't look me in the eye was looking down and said hey very softly, unassertively.

Words just escape my mind. Really simple ones, like ""later"" in the phrase ""sooner or later"" just yesterday.

758,"So, I moved 3 years ago. I agree that at the time I had done some crazy shit, but after time I realized that it’s crazy and I decided to improve myself. I started taking to people more, improving my grades, and just trying to enjoy my life.

I started talking to some guys today, and they told me that a lot of the guys think I’m a stupid weirdo and that I do a lot of weird shit. I admit that I also have breakdowns at times (I tend to cry a lot at tests and stress over things like that). They also mentioned something which I never think I even did. 

I feel horrible for everything. I’ve tried so hard to improve myself, to make a new name for myself. Maybe it isn’t working out in the end. Maybe I’m meant to be a stupid loser. Maybe I’m just not cut out for the world, and I’ll end up failing no matter what I do. Maybe everyone's conspiring behind my back. 

I find it hard to open up to people (although I try to be generally kind and helpful to everyone). Almost no one I know actually knows the ‘real’ me. I’m terrified that if people do find out, they’ll stop being my friend or treat me like garbage.

I don’t even know how I’m living with myself right now. I’m such a horrible person. I don’t know what to do, or how to deal with this. I don’t trust myself for anything, and I tend to go off of other people’s opinions of me as I always think that I’m a biased narcissist. What do I do? How do I deal with this?

The last meeting we had, someone said that all of us were invited to a Halloween party at his house. I want to go but I don't have anyone to go with and he didn't say any details about the party so I don't know if he was just being nice or if he wasn't really serious about the invitation.

I guess I need advice, the invitation wasn't to me specifically it was to the group, does that mean that I am invited or was he just trying to be nice? If it was an invitation to everyone, how do I ask for more details? I don't have facebook, only his phone number.

763,"Hello guys I really need someone else’s perspective on whats going on with this guy. Ok so let’s name him Kitkat, KitKat and I have known each other for yearsss now. We have been around each other because we used to have similar group of friends. I never thought much about him until we become closer during our last two years of high school. Our last year of high school I did start to catch feels for him but I suppressed how I felt because I didn’t think KitKat would feel the same way. Somewhere in April he told me he liked me but told me we should wait for each other(he dates to marry). Obviously I wasn’t happy with that and told him I wouldn’t wait for him if he dines t give me title now lol. We ended up going to prom together he seemed like he forgotten the fact that he told me he liked me. I asked him one more time what this was between us and he said that dating isn’t what he want to do and instead we can get to know each other? Anywho we graduated high school and shortly after that I moved to another city. After moving we started to drift apart and I never got the closure I needed to fully move on. We spoke on and off after I moved but it wasn’t anything stable. I felt like I just needed to move so I removed off of my snap shortly after that I got a new number and never told him. 
The reason why I’m writing this long story is because about a month ago I was told that he is dating a girl. After finding out I go into contact with him and we caught up on life. I ended up asking him if he has a girlfriend and he responded with “I do”. KitKat told me he stayed dating her a year after we graduated high school (that’s the year we didn’t talk to each other). Mind you ever since finding out he got a whole girl I have been asking questions and KitKat has obviously been answering them. He told me that her family is crazy and that they don’t give her enough freedom. His girl is a year older then us (btw I’m 20 years old). Apparently her family talks negatively about his family and she told him her family does that yet he’s still with her. For some reason he only discusses the bad side of their relationship. KitKat told me that he only recent found out that his family is being spoken about and not in a good way. She’s also sensitive, he can’t talk to her unless they are in a group to discuss their relationship. Also there is a middle man in between them that got both of them together. KitKats girl currently is studying abroad and he told me that he’s looking forward to seeing her but also is not looking forward to seeing her. He also rated her an 8/10😂 wtf. Like I said earlier KitKat dates to marry and they have spoken about marriage but he says they don’t have quality time together because of her uptight parents. Most of the time they hang out in a group setting. After hearing all of this it seems like he’s in a friendship and not in a relationship. I still like him and I asked him what would your girl do if she found out we are friends again. He said probably nothing. Obviously she would feel some type of way because she knows about our past. He told me to stay tuned for January when she returns from studying abroad on how things are between them.
I did ask Kitkat if we could ever be something and he said “god only knows” like he doesn’t know.  I replied to that saying “fair enough” and he emphasized my message “!”. I obviously like him but what should I do. It’s already been two years almost three since high school but I feel stuck and can’t move on. Even when I cut him off here I go again😂😭 I recently saw him and I just felt like something is there but I just don’t know. Please be honest with me.

764,"Ok, sooo... I didn't think it was possible to lose all my friends, yet somehow I have accomplished this feat. I'm going to attempt to keep this as abbreviated as possible.

Went to a private school, all of middle school and the majority of freshman year. When I stopped going there no one kept in touch with me (the people I had grown up with and been friends with for ages). Sophomore year, switched to public school. Made friends there. It was great until I tried to kill myself. I went to rehab and disappeared for a year, nobody noticed and those who did didn't care. That makes this year my second sophomore year because I had to repeat all of my classes. Lately I had been talking to new people, and I thought I was close with them, but they were a bit exclusive and they never invited me to anything. I went off on one of them for this reason.

I told her that I was feeling really awful and that I felt like none of them made an effort, which she kept on denying. Then when I dug a little deeper, she goes, ""well, you kinda fucked my friends over"". I hooked up with this dude that one of these girls had her eye on (along with the guy she's currently fucking), and she never confronted me about it. They actually really didn't talk to me at all, about anything, unless I reached out first. I even tried to make a group chat with them and they all left it. I talked to one of them about it today in person and she didn't bitch me out at all, which she totally could've, but she said I needed to be more 'mindful'. She basically told me that she isn't psycho, but if she was she could totally make my life a living hell because she's 'older than me' (everyone I know is now in the grade above me), and that I'm going to lose a lot of friends that way. So this is just another friend group that I've been kicked out of over the years... And now I have no friends after having been recycled through every clique in my city!

Am I a dick for this??? I know I shouldn't have gotten with that guy but I didn't know that she was even into him, like it's not like she told me this stuff. And even then... Is it really that deep? Or am I just an insensitive brat? I genuinely have no clue if I'm in the wrong. But point is I feel like a bag of flaming shit right now and I am very, very, dangerously close to relapsing. I'm beginning to think I should've tried a bit harder last year when I OD'ed. 🥰",30Oct2019,0

766,"Social media is really distracting me from work throughout the day, but I use them for parts of my work and general socialising too, so deleting them has only resulted in me needing to reinstall again. So I've decided that I need to schedule out-of-work-hours to SM management and not have access to the apps for the remaining hours of the day.


**Here's what I've tried, and what my circumstances are:**


- I've tried apps that *lock* apps for scheduled times, but I still see them on my phone and end up tapping them a bunch and triggering the ""locker app""'s ""punishment"" function to lock it in my time off. This doesn't teach me anything because I then turn it off in my time off and start scrolling, losing two hours instead of one. Completely hiding the SM apps removes that compulsion to tap it when I see it, as I've learned from outright deleting them.


- I've tried deleting them in compulsive moments to just ""get them out of my face"", so to speak, but I do still end up needing them again. Having to delete apps to stop distraction and logging in every time I get them back for work is a huge time-waster.


- The problem goes away when there are internet blackouts because I just end up dedicating that time to doing work things that I can do offline, which can be VERY productive, but internet is of course required during working hours to keep in touch with customers (and then of course after work when my partner comes home), so just turning that off is a no-no.


- Buying a ""work phone"" is not feasible, and I don't want to pay for two plans either. I am a self-employed artist, social media management is just a small but vital part of the job, so no company supplied phone here.


- My PC isn't an issue, I rarely use it because I'm usually working at a coffee table. Plus I have a newsfeed blocker for FB that works wonders. That takes care of most of the job. (Sidenote: the FB Page app sadly sucks)


I'd prefer to not unfollow the distracting subbreddits and pages, because I very much enjoy them in my time off.


#**All of this trial and error has led me to the following conclusions:

- schedule time in the mornings to contact customers and post, and remove the social media apps from view for the rest of the work day.**


*I have (very recently) diagnosed and medicated ADHD, hence the inability to ""just not click it and just stop scrolling"". Suggestions to ""learn self-control"" or ""just don't do it"" will be considered if the suggestions are methods that I never tried. An app to block them would solve my problems. I don't have distraction issues in other areas while medication is in my system, it's only social media apps, and I guess SEEK, but that's incredibly productive so that's fine.*",30Oct2019,0

I think it stems from the fact that I'm actually getting old and stopping being a kid, and it should be a good thing, if I didn't feel like I wasted every single opportunity I had to be with a girl and feeling like a complete virgin. 

Now not to say I never dated anybody or had any sort of sexual experience,  i did, it just i never went full on because

1) i wanted it too early and scared the girl away
2) didnt had a condom on me/didnt had the balls to buy one
3)  didn't shot my shot when I could've despite seeing clear signs they were into me. 


Most girls who fell to category #2 did things with me (oral, mutual masterbation,handjobs etc) but never went full way because of reason #2 

So yeah, here we are a 19 almost 20 yrold ""virgin "" I feel like I'm in the point of no return rn, my goals are what I stated above plus a few, plastic surgeries to fix my minor flaws.

779,"Hi all, I need some help to straighten out a situation that I have with my boss for a Tutoring Service that I have been working at for about 2 months. So far the relationship that I have had with my boss was good until we had a disagreement. He recently contracted me to tutor a set of twins for Math simultaneously for 2 hours. I get paid to teach $20 an hour, so I had the understanding that since it is 2 students I will be paid $40 an hour ( 2 students each hour) which would net me $80 a session with this set of twins. My boss rejected my submitted hours saying that ""He only charged them one package (a package is a set amount of hours, think 45 hours for a semester, which means they pay all at once and not per session.) "" He also said that tutoring 2 students on the same subject is the same amount of work as tutoring one student on the same subject. He later told me that if I am unhappy with tutoring the twins for the price of one he will find another tutor to do the job. I need the money and I already made a good connection with the students and their parents. How can I convince my boss to reconsider perhaps paying an extra percentage for the 2nd twin?",30Oct2019,1

I can't explain it exactly, but if I was asked genuinely ""what do you consider to be your positive and negative aspects"" I wouldn't be able to answer. I just feel as if everything is ""fine"". I don't really feel strongly to anyone or anything. I don't feel like I've earned anything in life. I'm fine with living in a one bedroom apartment nearly as much as in a mansion. While I wouldn't be fine with it, I could tolerate eating dry bread and drinking water for the rest of my life. I feel like there's little of me. I do have hobbies (reading, 3D modeling and programming), but It just feels wrong to talk about them. Either way, they are the things that if I spoke about, would end with me receiving a weird stare or giving the impression as if I'm showing off. I'm not good enough in any of those to show off anyways, and if I would be I still wouldn't talk about them. It just feels wrong and pointless for me to talk about things unless they are related to what needs to be done at hand. Strangely enough, I don't experience this problem as much online. I can actually relax and relate to people more. But enough of talking about me, what about others? I run into pretty much the same problem. It's fine, not bad or good. I think though, even am certain, than this isn't fine for others. On the contrary, it must be dreadfully boring. I just don't know what to do.

791,"So I’m 13. Let me get something straight: My dad doesn’t constantly hit me. He’s threatening me seriously three times, but only acted on it once. The only time he’s ever actually acted on it was when I did something REALLY bad and REALLY dumb. (The cops had to come due to a fight I got into with this idiot that verbally harassed me for 6 months. Luckily I never got in legal trouble or even my name jotted down) He hit me really hard once no cops were around and I had bruises for almost two weeks. 

Another time I got falsely blamed at school (eventually that was revealed in a sweet sense of vindication) and he squared up with me for a good 10 seconds and wouldn’t let me walk in the house. He didn’t hit me only because my mom was home. He instead just made me do yard work for 3 or so hours. He still threatened to hit me when he said my sister and mom wouldn’t be home. He luckily never did. 

The other time, I actually defended him. It was two years ago in sixth grade. A kid online fell victim to rumors and told me I was wrong when I persisted my dad didn’t do anything (kids thought he did something minor I won’t get into, which he obviously didn’t) this kid said I was wrong. Now this was over text, and I snapped on him and said some things I regret (just cussing) and he showed it to his mom, she screen shoted and literally sent it to the SCHOOL. My dad found out and only pushed me, but he threatened to hit me. (That was the most minor incident) 

Now please note, I am a good kid, get good grades and generally have good behavior. In three years of middle school, I got one in school suspension (the very vulgar text incident) and one detention (the false blame). I’m in my schools National Juniors Honors Society (NJHS) and am in the top 5-10% in my grade of 145 kids.

I considered that the conference is about a week after her (21) college graduation, and I thought of extending the trip myself and spending more time there with her. We haven't traveled together in years, and I thought she would find the idea nice. 

So, what say you guys? First I want to make sure it's not rude or anything from either my advisor or my sister's perspective.

797,"My family had 3 cats, 2 dogs. Cat were upstairs, dogs were downstairs. They were separated by a gate since we made the mistake of never training the animals to get along. Every time the dogs got upstairs, they would chase the cats and nothing ever came of it.

\------------

2 days ago it was different.  This is what happened (or the story my parents told me, i was at school)

They got one of the cats and killed it.

My mom tried to interfere, the same dog that killed the cat bit my mom. I like to think it wasn't out of aggression towards humans in general, but due to  the fact she viewed it as my mom trying to take her food.

Cat's body is cremated, my parents surrender both dogs to animal control even  though only one dog did anything

\-------------

Im 99% sure that my mom used this as an excuse to get rid of both dogs. She never liked them, and my dad follows her in literally every decision. We could have kept one of them, but it would have been difficult since they were sisters and have never been separated at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I have a lot of options as to what to do. I could probably fight my parents and convince them to re adopt the dogs. I really want to do this since those dogs were literally my best friends, and I'm scared for their future. Chances are they are going to be put down since not a lot of people want to get a dog that has killed a cat and bit a person, it just doesn't look good. Even though I really want to do this, it would be a lot of work and would put the other two cats at risk. I would not put it past them to be especially aggressive with our cats now, but I don't think they would bite us again. If we did get them back, we would have to cut down on cat security. This probably means two gates and some other things we would think of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any other option is anything that can be thought of. I've considered getting another dog and raising it to like the cats, but it wouldn't feel right. It would just make my dogs feel replaceable.  I'm just trying to think of a way to fill the void my old dogs left. 

&amp;#x200B;

This probably seems like a fairly dumb post, but it's seriously affecting me. I can seriously feel myself getting worse and worse as realization sets in. I'm actually going to see a therapist within the week if it doesn't get better.

808,"I feel like my life is falling apart, coming to a head and I have to make a pretty big decision when I don't entirely feel ready.

My dad passed away from end-stage heart and kidney failure in September. My 5 year relationship recently ended 3 weeks ago in October. It was mutual, but I am now absolutely devastated. The upside is that I now can do the things I wanted to do that she was hesitant to commit to doing with me. We were living together and I can't afford a one bedroom apartment on my own, so I have to end the lease and move out. My ex came today to take our cat, so now I am truly alone. 

I work full time, and am in graduate school for art therapy, in my second year. My internship for school is at a placement that is falling apart, with literally every member of the clinical team leaving because of safety issues caused by the staff. I am starting to feel unsafe there, and even the other intern is probably leaving. I will be the only clinical ""staff"" member who knows the program or anything about the kids when we have all new clinical staff. Outside of the clinical department, the other staff has very toxic dynamics that make it difficult for any of us to counsel the kiddos.

My job is wonderful, but does not pay enough and is now almost an hour away from where my housing situation will be. I wasn't able to find anything else I could afford. I found this opportunity to get a free room if I watch this woman's kids while she works overnight, and bring them to the bus stop in the morning. My plan was to stay at this place and save all the money I can, and move to Maine in August after my 3 week residency for school. It is hard to take this time off of work, so I wanted to plan moving around this, quitting before the residency, going to school without having to worry about working on the weekends, and then moving. I was considering moving in with my brother for a year while I need a 30 hr/week internship in my 3rd year of grad school. I would then graduate and be able to move out on my own. Also, my plan was to mentally focus on myself for the next 6 months, and the move to Maine and treat it as a new beginning once I have processed some of this loss in my life.

My issue is that now I am feeling really unsafe at my internship, and I am seriously considering leaving. If I find another internship, I'd rather find it in Maine. But if I go to Maine now, I would have to move in with my brother and his wife and possibly stay over a year. I have no money saved up, no job lined up, and I don't know if I could find another internship in the middle of the school year. I also feel really guilty leaving my job at this point, because we finally have a solid team, and our little department has become my family. Working there is the only consistent thing in my life right now, and it feels really scary to leave that.

So, I guess I want some input and advice. Should I say F it and move now, or should I stick it out and move in August?",30Oct2019,2
809,"So last week, when i was walking in a supermarket, a guy approached me and ask if i can withdraw $200 of cash for him because his card doesnt work.

812,"Going clubbing tomorrow for Halloween, however, today I was diagnosed with a neuroma in my head after having consistent headaches and cold sensations down my right face - and that’s at best. My parents are extremely worried and sending me to another doctor for a second opinion since there’s a linear dent in my skull from an accident I’ve had (which the doctor felt today). They are also terrible at diagnosing people, so I am sitting tight for the results to come. I’m not sure if it’s a good idea going out and going crazy knowing this, at the same time, when I told my friend she told me I always let her down by cancelling and it’s not that much of a big deal if it hasn’t affected me until now.  (I’ve had these symptoms for around five months since the accident)

I’m kind of in a weird place at the moment, my parents don’t want me clubbing for my health until I have a solid diagnoses for the tumour. My friend is mad at me because it’s another excuse I’ve made to not go out, and well she’s really wanting to club with me tomorrow and so do I, but I’m torn now. I know it should be easy, but if it hasn’t affected me so far, would this be the pushing point where I get severely hurt? Is my friend being really selfish? Is whatever the hell I have (at best a non-cancerous tumour) a big deal if I haven’t died yet?",30Oct2019,1
813,"Here's the context: I'm a 19-year-old who's currently embarking on what should hopefully just be a gap year. Almost immediately I was expected to get a job as soon as finishing A-Levels, with my mum wanting monthly rent. Bearing in mind the money I saved wasn't, and *isn't*, intended for clothes, make-up, etc, but for accommodation and other expenses pertaining to university. I did this as a means to get a foot in the door — or, that's what I'd intended it to be, as opposed to blown on rent while I tried, and failed, to find a job.

Here's the issue: I struggle majorly to hold a job down. I don't do it intentionally, waking up and immediately deciding I'll self-sabotage and throw it all away, which is something I feel my family thinks of me. I *genuinely* struggle. The last job I'd had lasted for a month — some lasting a day, others three months — and ultimately I had to resign as I was struggling far too much with anxiety and panic attacks, crying daily. I'm not sure how to actually explain it, which is majorly frustrating. In layman's terms, it's this: I seem to process information a lot slower than everyone around me, or perhaps in a different manner. Everything becomes too **much** — too loud, bright, confusing and generally overwhelming. Because of this, I'm often slow and end up what feels like under performing. This brings me to believe that I'm incompetent for essentially any job, and, well, frankly I feel like a broken, dysfunctional 19-year-old. 

Due to being what feels to be the only introvert in the family, my family has come to believe I may potentially have Asperger's — that I'm on the spectrum at least. It's frustrating, though, because it feels they're merely wanting to put a label on me. They've read only a few signs online and are now adamant I should go visit a doctor. Perhaps I am just a dysfunctional adult, and they can't accept the fact they raised a failure? All I know is this: it feels they're not concerned for my well being, but more so how it impacts my ability to hold down a job. It feels they only care because I'm bringing no money in, which I've tried to explain to them. I'm immediately shut down most of the time. 

I don't know how to go forward with any of this. I've always perceived my behaviour to be normal because nobody said otherwise while I was growing up, so right now I feel as though I'm stuck in a spiral; right now I feel as though I'm too — pardon the cliche — damaged, and that I'm a lost cause who'll end up stuck on the couch with little ambition or desire to move forward. I'm already in counselling and taking medication (Citalopram), but ultimately I just don't see a future for myself. If I can't deal with any of this, how can I expect one?",30Oct2019,2
814,"I work in a company with distributed teams. My boss and most of the leadership are in California, while my co-workers and I are in another country 10+ hours away. We're a smallish company so there isn't really much segregation among employees of different seniority, and anyone can/does speak to anyone else.

Our CEO is very action driven and detail oriented. This makes them successful at stuff like securing funding and public speaking, but it also makes them incredibly impatient and borderline overreaching with their leadership team. This individual has a history of micromanaging and undermining authority, and they certainly don't understand how my team functions both as a business unit and as a group of people.

A few months ago the CEO changed several senior leaders and started to step back to allow them to run their teams. We just finished up a quarter and while our numbers were good, the quality of some aspects took a hit. A fully expected and temporary hit that my boss has been actively addressing.

CEO has hit the panic button and reverted to type. Lately I have been getting Slack messages asking me questions about our team's strategy, objectives, how every small task relates to revenue (not everything in my team yields $). My boss is traveling and so I've been forced to defend our strategy (fine by me) but also get on calls where CEO keeps telling me how to change approach to maximize revenue.

My boss who is VP level tells us we should never feel like we have two bosses, but due to the time difference and having to deal with the CEO's questions, that's exactly how it feels. My boss is easily the best I've ever worked under and I really see myself growing under their wing, but I don't want to run the risk of having them resign one day, leaving me stranded as to my next career move.

815,"As the title says I’m not tired but I have no energy, I started year 10 (4th year of high school) about 8 weeks ago. I’m in the middle of two weeks off for half term.

816,"Hey there!

So, as a teenager (15yo, almost 16), I'm on my last year of highschool, and I'd like to start doing some private tutoring, helping teenagers with subjects I enjoyed learning, and would enjoy teaching. One of these is English (I'm from a non-english speaking country), and the others are science related (Bio, Math, etc.).

Do any of you guys have any experience with this? Did any of you go to a young tutor, or are/were a young private tutor? Do you guys think it's a good idea? Do you have any tips? 

I'm doing this because I genuinely enjoy teaching, and explaining things to others; I'm willing to give out the first class for free.

Despite me never even having sex.

The letter had $250 worth of money on a giftcard for baby clothes and the works from someone named Jenny B. I don't know anyone named Jenny.

823,"This is kind of a long one but bare with me for the moment. I really need help. About 3 weeks ago I was on a night out at university and I was drinking (this was a thursday night which is important for later) - I know my limits, I was a bit tipsy but not very drunk at all, a friend bought me a drink in a nightclub and he handed me two (I think one extra from the bar which is obvious warning signs) I thought nothing of it as my friend handed it to me, drank them and after that I have no memory of the rest of that night or the day after. I have been told that I was awake and talking, even walking the day after. But spent the best part of 30 hours throwing up etc. Come Saturday (2 days later) my friends took me to A and E. They cleared me all fine. But ever since then I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night a few times unsure of where I am. This hasn’t happened in about a week or so but on Monday I decided I wanted a beer or two and tonight (Wednesday) my friend was talking to me about Monday night and I suddenly realised I have no recollection of quite a lot of the evening and night. I think I should go to a doctor but I want advice first.",30Oct2019,3
824,"Hello, so I had a best friend called Anna, and we were best friends for 10 years. We were always together and never left each other's side. Unfortunately one day, her mom passed away due to breast cancer, and one day she told me during class: ""I'm leaving to another city in the next week"". And so she left with her father.  
Months went by, we still talked and everything was fine, we had some discussions, but we always forgave each other.   
Everything was fine, until 9th grade started. In the beginning of the year, I could tell she was talking less and less. She read the messages but didn't answer when she was at school. She used to tell me ""Oh, I forgot to answer"", or when she was online and didn't even read it, she would say ""I didn't see the notification"". But with the time, I thought she was spending time with her new friends, so I stopped worrying. She suffered from anxiety and depression, and I was so glad she was making new friends.  
We didn't talk as much because she also said she needed to study, but we still talked. Until January 26th arrived.  
On that day, I was feeling quite bad, and she helped me and in the end said ""We all love you!"". I felt happy after her help, and was able to put a smile on my face for the rest of the day. Until at night, she texted me, saying ""I can't talk with you for a while, I don't know how much time and I can't tell you why"".   
I got scared and asked her ""Why?"" ""Is something wrong?"" ""Can I help?"", and with that she answered ""No"" and ""Be right back"".   
Days went by, and she would never answer me or see my messages, and my friends tried to help me by texting her. She told them she wasn't mad at me, but she couldn't talk to me. All I could do is ask to myself ""Why?"".  
After that, she blocked me on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord and even blocked my phone number. My heart broke. I tried using another account I had to see her posts, and when she was asked about her best friends, she never mentioned me.  
After 1 month, I had an idea. Once, we had an argument and she created a fake account to see how I was doing, so I decided to do the same. But since I didn't like to use other people's pictures since it would be very stupid to use other people for my own benefit since I never liked that, I didn't have any profile picture or anything. I still don't really like the idea of creating fake accounts, but it left me no choice.  
I was on the car when she started answering my messages and said: ""I had a best friend, our friendship lasted 10 years, but she was shady as f\*\*k. She contacted my new friends from my new city without my knowledge and spread lies about me to ruin my reputation.""  
When I read this, I started crying and hyperventilating. I felt like my life was over! My friend tried to calm me down (she was on the car with me), but she couldn't. I never did that to her! I didn't even know her friends! But somehow, I still managed to feel guilty, even tho I knew I never did such thing, I kept thinking she just wanted to get rid of me, so she invented a story.  
I tried contacting a virtual friend we had in common, and he tried to help me, but she blocked him too.  
After I revealed myself in the fake account in a message where I tried to explain I would never do such thing to her, she blocked the account. Some days later, I found out that some minutes after I revealed myself, she left all her public accounts and created private ones, so I could never discover her.  
I felt so sad, and I would leave in every single class to go to the bathroom cry.  
I would often remember all our conversations and the promise we made to each other that we would never leave each other's side.  
I still can't understand why she said this, because I never did anything like that. She was my world, she helped me and I helped her. What's worse is, if it was one of her new friends that invented this because they were jealous of our friendship, she preferred to believe a friend she had for 4 months than a friend she had for 10 years.  
Some days later, I received a message from one of her new friends, threatening to hurt me if I ever tried to contact Anna again. I didn't feel scared or anything like that, because I never did such thing to Anna. I calmly talked with her friend, and at first she said she didn't believe me, but as the conversation developed, she started saying ""I know it hurts to lose a friend.. but I have to be by Anna's side, sorry"". At that moment, I understood something was wrong, because she told me that she felt obligated to be by her side.  
1 month ago, she unblocked my friends, but never unblocked me. After all of that, she never said a word to me again, and I can't contact her in any way.  
It's been 9 months since this happened, and I still didn't move on yet. Some days ago it was her birthday and I discovered she had a new public account, so as an act of respect, I sent her ""Happy birthday"", but she quickly blocked me. I came here to ask for advice on how to move on, or how to be able to contact her somehow and let her understand that I didn't do such thing to her. Should I try to talk with her somehow or leave it be and try to move on? How should I cope with it? Should I try to contact her father or brother to try to understand the situation?

833,"So I started a new job a couple months ago. My boss has been treating me poorly in comparison to my coworkers. I get very kurt emails from her after asking a straight forward question. The answers often dont even resolve the question because she misinterprets them and just reacts. My job description hasnt been exactly what I was told it would be when I interviewed. This switch in my role happened after about a month and a half after starting. I went to HR to ask advice on how to handle this. I was concerned that bringing these concerns up to my boss would be viewed as complaining and that I would be labeled a pain in the ass. HR lady was somewhat dismissive but suggested I try talking to my boss. At the end of my conversation with HR lady, I specifically asked that this conversation be kept confidential. Her reply was “You are not filing a complaint so this will stay between us”. 

Fast forward a few days and I talk to my boss about the change in job description. I approached the situation as diplomatically as humanly possible. I asked for clarification on expectations and that I had no issue doing these new tasks for a temporary period since it would help the company. The response I got was not at all what I expected. She got defensive and went off on a tangent. This was the first time this happened but not the last...

Fast forward another few weeks and all of the sudden my boss is acting way nicer. Problem solved right? Not really. Right around the time I noticed this attitude shift, HR lady asked me in passing if things were better. My boss has been nicer but also seems nervous around me and as if she has her tail between her legs. Her counterpart on another team made an offhand remark about not “running to HR” to everyone during a team meeting. This struck me as strange and thought my boss possibly told him about my going to HR and now hes taking subtle jabs at me during meetings. 

Im at a loss for what to do because I cant probe this, though it seems likely. My boss is acting nicer but also much more nervous and strange. There is also now the possibility that i will be punished in i direct ways for going to HR. Do I approach HR lady? Contact an attorney? Any input would be appreciated!

834,"Before you say, “leave” or “dump him” please understand I can’t. The man helped me get out of a shit hole and helped me get over many addictions I struggled with. There is no place for me to turn to, if there was I would. 

At first it started with messages to other people. It’s been going on the entire time but I try to ignore it because they’re just messages. Then he became uninterested in me. He slowly stopped showing me off, gassing me up, going out on dates, caring about my life even though I live with him.

That has really hurt me because I feel like I’m being strung along. Or maybe there’s more that I don’t know about. He still acts somewhat romantic with me but anything sexual, he won’t touch. I feel disgusting or I’m not good enough for him. We used to be extremely active. So I’m not sure what I did wrong. Where I went wrong for him to feel the need to cheat.

I try my hardest to be a good partner but there’s no instructions. I don’t know if I’m too clingy or distant. At this point though I’ve been avoiding our home as much as possible. It’s like a reminder of all the conversations he has had with other people. It makes me want to cry, vomit, and die.

When it happened the very first time he cried and begged me to stay. I’ve never seen a grown man cry before. It felt horrible. Even though he was the one getting caught, I wanted to hold him and make him happy. I felt horrible for making him cry.

To give some context, I am an amature cosplayer and occasionally post my pictures online. I posted a picture from a photoshoot I had on Reddit here about 6 months ago. This past week I was considering going to a Comic Convention in a nearby city, and was googling inspo pics to improve my costume. When I googled related images, I stumbled across my own photo! But to my surprise it wasn't from my Reddit account.. It was from a random website that has wallpapers available for download.

Its such a violating feeling that these people are using my picture. I have no idea who would have submitted my photos there. On the site it says 145 people have downloaded my wallpaper! I know there's always a risk of people being creepy when you post a picture of yourself online, but its different when I decide to share it, as opposed to it being done without consent. I had never considered needing to watermark my photos because I get such small attention for it, but clearly I need to start doing that.

I have obviously contacted the site by email and told them that its a copyrighted image they are unauthorized to use, and to please remove it, but unsurprisingly they never replied.

I have a friend like that. I know grades don't define you but straight A's in hs &amp; college, multiple honors &amp; stuff like that. Not afraid of math &amp; chemistry and the ""scary subjects"" most ppl run from.
Well here's my problem I've never really had a job prior to this year and I'm just starting to get good at what I do. At times I still struggle and make mistakes. It took me awhile to get to the point i'm at and that's probably not even that great.
A position opened up at the company I work for in my exact position. I hesitated to tell my friend about it because I didn't want to ruin our friendship by being co-workers, I thought this was my reasoning for my hesitation but now that they've gotten the job a lot of other feelings are coming to surface.
I feel like my friend has everything and this was my thing - and now they’re intruding in on it. Which I KNOW sounds freaking ridiculous for an adult to be saying that. But its only been a couple of days and they’re already doing better than I was. 

I’m not sure how to feel or change how I feel because my friend that I brought into the company is going to be better at my own job than me. It’s making me really depressed and I can’t talk to anyone because they’re my only close friend.",30Oct2019,1

840,"It may sound harsher than it actually is but yeah, today is my birthday. I wanted to hang out with a friend(F20) of mine to kinda celebrate my birthday. She told me that she had to work till 6 pm so I had to ask my mom if I could go out after 6 pm because she often refuses to let me out when it's dark outside. I am a simple girl who still goes to school, it actually is my last and most important year so yeah just a side note. I asked my mom if I could go out at 6 and when she asked me why I told her that my friend had to work. She completely lost it. I was speechless the whole time because at the end she was right. My dad left us two years ago. He never supported us finacially in any way and my mom would always get everything together. Well, she complained about me and was about to cry because...... I had no job. Like a lil job to earn some money. She compared me to my friends. Because almost all of them had a job. It sounds harmless while telling it here on reddit but I swear I was about to throw up because she asked me about my future. I had and still have no idea about my future. I've been frustrated for months now, just because of that. And after that argument.... I feel like my whole existence got questioned. I just sent some applications hoping to get some kind of job, but what no1 gets is that I am (mentally) not prepared. I have anxiety and no I don't say that in an easy way. I used to cry everyday because I was scared of school, of my teachers for no reason ( last year) .  Insomnia, overthinking, emotional eating. Now I kinda am fine, but after todays conversation, a panic attack is about to approach me. I literally feel it in my veins. I don't know what to do. I am scared to work, I am scared of new things. I am scared of my future.

And example is with money 

We have limited money and the car is not working  as it should and is not up to its best conditions 

First she was saying that we need a brand new expensive car and my parents need to get it immediately (she can't even drive sigh )

So then few months later we bought my uncle's old car and it's a good strong , big car and she complains about that one as well 

She constantly argues about simple things like clothes and hits me if I mistakenly wear hers by accident , she despised the only time we helped out a family friend cause she was in a situation and needed a place to say and kept questioning why we were even helping her , she's constantly saying negative things about our helper even though she's a human as well , and she yells at us , she always accuses me of lying and has an entitled way of thinking (she has better grades so apparently I must be the ""dumb one"") she makes me late for school cause she's up their arguing about which uniform Is her own (even though she was supposed to do it the night before)

I'm being blamed for this , apparently I brought it into the house and she followed me and I don't know how I have anything to do with her behaviour because even though I had my faults( I ain't perfect) I did not act the same way , seeing that we are only a year and a few months apart I don't influence her to do anything especially since I don't even talk with her much though we live in the same house

Single mom with no help from father. I do have a fear of not waking up when I go to sleep with my heart pain.
I told someone I knew that my son is able to call 911 if need be and every few months, especially when they pain really kicks in, we refresh this info, how to call and give our address. Thats all. When I told them, they told me it was very inappropriate to teach my son at a young age such and I should just go to the docters and fix my issue. Obviously I know I need to go to the docters but thats not my point. She said I shouldnt worry my son with that, when we discuss the topic, he doesn't seem worried, instead he's happy that he'd be able to help me, as he has seem me in pain from the sharp pains, the dull aching pains are tolerable but the sharp ones scare me, hence why I felt I should teach him...just in case worst case scenario happens.

849,"My chihuahua mix is a puppy and we live in an apartment with a girl who owns a 2 year old pitbull. The first time they met, the pitbull nipped at her but his owner just said it was because he was “scared of little dogs” and signed our lease anyways... as if it was a good mix for them to live together. About a month into the lease, he got out of his owners room and bit my friend and her dog upon them entering the apartment... resulting in an ER visit and a wounded dog. I now do not allow my dog to play with him. He remains in the living room all day, so my dog and I are confined to my bedroom and outdoors. Our other roommates favor him because he is more potty trained so they ignore my puppy and play with him all day. They even made me get her obedience training because she chewed up about a square inch piece of the carpet at 3 months old (which i immediately replaced), however when the pitbull attacks he does not need training. My roommate said it’s my fault he attacked for having a guest over without permission, even though her dog was in a room with the door shut.

851,"I’m going to try to keep this as short as I can. So about 10 months back there was a girl in my life that I liked for a little while but have since gotten over her completely. We had a huge argument over text and subsequent falling out 5 months ago. Now, I’m not one to fight people and on the surface, I’m a laid back guy. The reason we argued was because I told her that I felt really shitty about the way she responded to my texts. I put a lot of effort into my text messages to keep a conversation from being dull and dry. But this girl would just respond to my thought-out messages with “haha”, “lol”, or “fun”. 

After a while of this I stopped talking to her which is why the argument began; she said something along the lines “Are we even friends anymore?” So I told her the way I felt when I was around her in real life (we had no common interests and trying to have a conversation with her was like pulling teeth) and the way it made me feel when she would respond to my text messages with one word, because it just made me feel like shit. She didn’t respond to it well and things have been awkward ever since when I happen to walk by her. Since that argument I haven’t talked to her and have met a few new friends that I get along with much better.

However, today she snapchatted me again. Whenever she wanted to talk she’d send a picture of her ceiling and she’s just done that now.

I don’t know what to do, and I hate being rude to others or leaving people on read, but I know talking to her again would only take me back to a part of my life that I never want to be in again.

There’s a lot more to it, I can explain in a response for the sake of keeping this post relatively short

Any advice is greatly appreciated",30Oct2019,2
852,"Background info: I have liked this guy at my school for over a year. We’ve been talking in a group chat for the majority of that time, and I genuinely love having conversations with him. He’s the type to bottle his emotions so it’s very hard to tell if he likes me back or not. Plus I’m the same so that’s the same for him lmao. I’ve only told 2 of my friends about it because I’m sooo scared of word spreading about me. I occasionally drop hints, and they haven’t really gotten me anywhere lmao. They’re very subtle.

Yesterday my crush and I were having a playful argument in a group chat and my crush’s best friend commented that we argue like couples and that we should just date. Today at lunch 2 of my friends asked the best friend if my crush likes me. He said that he has personally asked my crush and that my crush said that he doesn’t :) 

My reaction (mental breakdown): I’m honestly so heartbroken lmao :) My friends tell me to take this with a grain of salt because his best friend could be lying, or he himself could have lied to his best friend because he’s so closed off about his emotions but I honestly don’t know...

I ame a dutch student and curently in my 3th year of my study civil engineering ( the whole study is in dutch so i ame not a master in english). In this year i have to follow an internship. I have the possibility to do this is sidon/saida lebanon. But i dont know if i should do it or not. 

Some people tell me i should do it but the same amount tell me not to do it. I have done 2 internship before this but they were close to my home. 1 of these i had a very bad experience with. I realy hated to go there and was realy demotivated. It also affected my social life. I didnt go out much and wasn't really motivated to do anything at all. 

Now i ame questioning if i should go abroad to do my internship. Because i can get demotivated for everything so quickly. Also i ame not the most social person. Its not like i have anxiety or something like that. I  ame able to have a conversation with strangers  but i wont start one or lead one. Especially not when i ame alone.

I’m in the first semester of nursing school. It’s brutal. Way more brutal than I thought it would be. Additionally, I’ve had a lot of health issues and a diagnosis that has disrupted my life a lot (personally I don’t want to get into right now, but it is life-changing). 

I’ve always had trouble with relationships. Always. I try to put my best foot forward, but nothing ever seems to work out. Recently, I met someone who had treated me better than I’ve ever been treated. Listens to every thing I say. Constantly fits me into their schedule. Let’s me bitch and moan about everything going on in my life. This person is perfect for me. I think. 

I guess what am asking is this: should I try to incorporate and include this person in my everyday life? Or should I focus on finishing school and my long-term career? I know that I cannot encapsulate the entire situation here, but I am truly lost on what to do. Every time I try to focus on another person, it blows up in my face. I’m terrified of that happening again. But at the same time, I really think, for the first time, that I’ve found someone who truly loves and appreciates me for who I am.

He heard this as he was in the basement, it was obviously he waited in the steps to ease drop. He then said to her ""don't talk behind my back"" even though nothing bad was said about him. I told him she's 14 and can't really defend herself, he said I defended her because I hate him. I do hate him, a fucking lot, but I try to be fair, I haven't even told my sister the shit he's done to me. 


My main point was that ""she's 14, and he's 17 years old and about to turn 18 in a month."" especially given to how he handles arguments, I didn't want him to think her just talking about minor shit wasn't a big deal.

So about a year ago I developed a crush on this girl, and I thought it was no big deal.  I'm a very shy person and assumed that I would just eventually get over her.  So yeah, that was lie. Eventually we met up with some mutual friends and had a pretty good time.  That's when we started texting and really getting to know each other.  FFs a month and we went on our first date.  Nothing too fancy, we grabbed a drink and saw a movie.  It's worth noting that we are both shy and were pretty nervous, so the conversations weren't super deep. As for anything physical, we held hands and that was it.  

We both enjoyed the date and wanted to do something else.  This is where things go downhill for me.  We live pretty close to each other, but have only seen each other once since then.  It's been two months and I've used just about any excuse to see her.  From just going on a walk, ride to/from school/work, etc.  She's always busy and never tried to give an alternative until now (we cancelled that due to time constraints) .  She's very focused on her schooling, and I admire her for that, but I'm beginning to feel like she just doesn't want to make the time for me and is stringing me along.  

I really like her and want to be patient, but I feel like 2months is just too long.  We are practically on the same campus, and live within walking distance. Am I being too clingy?  I can fill in more details if people are curious.",30Oct2019,1
