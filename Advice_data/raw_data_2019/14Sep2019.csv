0,"My friend feels like his repuation will plummet and I need help ASAP. This is serious.

On discord, my friend (I'll call him Tom, am not going to reveal his name) and a past friend of his (for this post, Hunter) have been distancing for months due to Hunter doing something shitty to him (don't remember what exactly). Yesterday, Tom removed him from a group, causing Hunter to be pissed and remove tom from his friends.

Now, Hunter is planning to gossip about Tom. I am not going to spare the details, but not only is it a lie, it is a VERY HUMILIATING lie. The kind that will make your friends really make fun of you and see you differently. Tom is crying and can't sleep, he feels like the only resort is to delete his account permanently. What do I do about this?",14Sep2019,3
1,"I graduated May of this year from high school and am waiting to enroll into the spring semester of this nearby college. I'm a bit confused on what I should be doing though. I know the degree I'd like to pursue but not much about how to pay for it. I know I can apply for FAFSA in October when it comes out, but when it comes to scholarships I'm not sure if I should already be enrolled or if I can start applying now. O plan on calling the college about their financial aid options or if I should wait and apply for the FAFSA and then call them. Does anyone have any advice on what steps to take and when?",14Sep2019,1
2,"I am a photographer who shoots mostly nudes. My work is **not** even remotely erotic. Nevertheless, I constantly get met with prudishness. I just had a person from a gallery tell me how much she loved my work and she wants me to do a solo show. However, after I signed  the contract “some jurors” were concerned that a child might see the show so “could I fix it or shoot new stuff with clothed models.” For one piece that she really “loves” she suggested, “Just Photoshop some sweatpants onto the model. I know that you can do it.” I have to say that for this particular piece (which shows no actual skin) it would change the feel and meaning of the piece.  
I’m at a loss as to what to do. I offered to withdraw from the show but she really discouraged me from withdrawing.  
I don’t want to alienate the gallery. They are well connected in the local art community and I don’t want to burn bridges. I want a wide audience for my art. Given that I spend thousands of hours and thousands of dollars a year I would also love to be able to sell more than the token amount of art that I am selling now.   


At times I feel like I should be able to do what I do with clothed models, although when I try I get work that is not as good. At other times I get mad at a society that is so prudish in so many ways. Do I compromise my artistry to have a broader market and less snarky comments to deal with? Do I keep making the art that I like best and just be constantly irritated by the reactions of society? Is there another approach?  


FWIW: I had an opening Sunday at a non-profit gallery and a member of their board made a joke about my models showing up for the opening nude. I told him that I doubted he could correctly identify which pieces the models were shot nude vs. shot clothed. He took the challenge and tried on four pieces. He got two wrong before giving up.",14Sep2019,1

I haven’t had much confidence in my self for as long as I can remember, my mother mentions since I was a child I always had several insecurities and a very low self esteem/ self image accompanied with low confidence. 

I’d just like some advice on how you guys would go about this. As of now I’m 19 years old and you can imagine it’s quite an issue for me. I’ve grown to be introverted and I think so lowly of my self and just can’t help it. I can’t take any compliments, I hate the way I look, sometimes i just stay alone for days on end. I’m not able to attribute any of my accomplishments to my self. I feel like a loser and a fraud ( I exhibit a lot of imposter syndrome symptoms).

7,"Hello this might sound stereotypical and stupid coming from a 13 year old but whenever I talk to my mom, even one word, it drains me and then I’m in a bad mood for hours after. I just hate everything about her, her laugh, her smile, the way she breathes, and talks. I have withdrawn, and she likes to point it out at the worst times. (When I’m calm, in a better mood, first thing when I wake up) it’s usually when I’m (respectfully) short with her, which is always now... We could be driving to school and be silently looking out the window when she goes “clean your room when you get home” “okay” “I’ll stop talking cause you clearly don’t want to talk to me right now.” I hate it. Sometimes I’m not even trying to avoid the conversation. I never say anything either, whenever she’s clearly wrong, making assumptions, accusations, rude comments or everything else that I want to desperately say something about but my mental health issues prevent me. It’s a problem because she now thinks she’s always right and is dominating my life and every conversation she and I have. She has so many other, bigger, issues than this but this one comes to mind because it’s constantly their and never stops, getting worse with time. I can’t exactly confront this head on because it’s not like it’s diagnosable abuse, for someone to even half understand the problem I would have to sit down and express for a long time, and let’s just say I have never opened up to anyone. (Except of course strangers online of which I only sit and tap the screen for way too long) and god knows how they could actually help with this. It’s more than just a “me” problem, but I don’t know how to deal with her manipulative behaviour.",14Sep2019,1
8,"I don't know if this belongs here but I need some advice so ya. he is 6'6 and weighs maybe 100-110 pounds. He is so skinny you can see bone landmarks through his skin. He has always been a very tall and very lanky person but after moving in with him it's starting to scare me and I don't know what to do about it. The reason I don't know if this qualifies as an eating disorder because from what I can tell he doesn't not eat because of body image or anything he just isnt hungry and will eat until hes ""full"". But sometimes he could eat nothing all day and then at dinner he had 4 bites and was full?

For example today, we woke up and I made him breakfast of scrambled eggs and a banana protein smoothie, he had half of both and then had a salad (his salad is just romain lettuce, oil, vinegar and salt) for lunch and then the same salad for dinner. This was the most amount of food he had in a day all week. He always has a reason for why he didnt eat, like too busy, not hungry, or this week he claimed he has a kanker that is so bad he cant eat. A kanker that lasts a whole week is so rare.

Hes on an ADHD medication, can that cause hunger loss? Its not a new medication he has been taking it for over 5 years. Over the past month ive seen his appetite and weight decrease exponentially. He has been overly stressed at work which can also lead to hunger loss. But its starting to reach scary levels. Do I talk to him about this? How do I even bring it up? Does it sound like an eating disorder and I am just missing something? Should I get a doctor involved? or am I just overreacting and mind my own business?

9,"I’m still a teen. My life is completely normal since i have my dad and I’m thankful for it, but this past years, I’ve been feeling down like everything hurts.

10,"I’ll keep this short, don’t want to write my life story but in essence
-failed school, C in maths, A in music, practically D’s everything else.

-failed university 2:2 BA animation

-Failed achieving a career with my art (concept art, storyboarding, illustration, etc)

-Failed recruit training for the Royal Marines(injured knees, looking at 1 year rehab, missed my own space and independence and didn’t want to put up with shit whilst not progressing so quit)

-fail at finances (been in debt and in and out of my bank overdraft limit since university for 9+ years, worked part time to develop skill in art to hopefully break into industry, so always low income. Now I just can’t mentally handle doing full time in hospitality/retail, physically and mentally makes me sick(have battled depression, still depressed but no longer suicidal somewhat) so no way of grinding out of my debts thus far. I’m always quitting and changing jobs when I can no longer handle it so no real managerial experience. None actually.
—————————
My priorities right now are finding a job that I can mentally bare to be in full time and pays at least a grand a month. I don’t spend much but this is what I need to cover rent and bills and finally start climbing out of my overdraft slowly. then to actually put something aside to save and still not feel extremely stretched. Relieve some accumulated stress off my life and live.

I have no idea what’s out there for me. 
I’m currently looking at maybe an office job like data entry, or junior? Something entry level and easy to get into. 
 or perhaps a call centre? I interact well with people and can handle angry,disrespectful people. It’s more the serving them, and the restocking and busting your balls aspect that I can no longer tolerate. 
9+ years customer service exp gotta count for something. 

I’ve stopped aspiring for art, don’t wish to go back into military although I think about it but just not the same age to go through it again and deal with kids and disrespect and potential chronic injury. My eye is on SAS reserves if I’m to try one last time. 

I’m introverted, kind, patient, just need a new lease of life by first resolving my finances.

11,"Sorry if this is a little long, just wanted to give some details and background on the situation.

I just recently started my web and logo design business. I'm still learning a lot about the business aspect of it but I have 17+ years experience in web design. Anyways, I posted online flyers for my business on buy/sell apps, Facebook, etc. I wasn't getting very many clients so I purposefully listed my prices very low compared to others in the industry. It's basically like an introductory pricing to get some clients, so I can build my portfolio. And then raise them to normal standard pricing. I do inform my clients of this in case they plan to refer me to others and so they know that my pricing is not equal to my experience. I know some people wouldn't recommend this but it's just how I chose to do it.

So, a woman who is a realtor messaged me saying that she needed social media help, but no website or logo. I'm struggling very bad right now financially, so I discussed everything with her. Since I have a 1 year old son and was really in need of some work, I was open and willing to consider all options. I have experience in doing social media management and I have a lot of knowledge on it but I'm definitely not a top expert.

We discussed over messages, emails, and on phone calls, and I did tell her that it will be basic social media management, nothing extreme. She said that's all she needed. I told her I will reply and like comments, do 1 post for Facebook and Instagram per day or alternate with Facebook and Instagram, etc. I told her if she didn't have pictures or images, I would create some for her. She said that was perfect. All she wanted was postings 5 days per week of houses she's selling or a random meme/funny post here and there. Or instead of posts, polls and engagement on her Facebook or Instagram stories, and just to make sure to interact with people too. I agreed and thought this was a good opportunity. She was easy going and really nice and very cooperative.

When I first told her my pricing at the beginning of us discussing everything, she never mentioned an issue with it. The only thing she said was that she would rather pay me monthly versus weekly, which I agreed with. After talking for days and asking when she could pay, she said she didn't think she could handle the pricing. Now after doing some research, I learned that the price I offered was very cheap and really on the lower end of the spectrum. I was a little upset we had already talked for a couple days and she didn't mention this earlier when I first stated the pricing. So I asked her what would be more comfortable for her and she said she would pay HALF of what I asked for. Now, I started feeling a little insulted. I declined, and offered a small discount and she said she can only pay the half. I told her I was sorry but I couldn't go that low. She almost started begging and pleading for me to take this offer, which felt a little weird. She said she will just have me do the absolute minimal for her and she will work with me and will send me everything I need to post so it's super easy for me. She said she really just doesn't have the time to post and she REALLY needed help. She said she can't pay me what I'm asking for because she's already paying $300-400 per month to 5 other marketing agencies and real estate websites.

So she has no problem paying all of them what they charge, but she doesn't think she can handle paying what I'm asking for? And then it had me thinking, when she goes to doctors appointments or the hair salon or wherever else, I'm sure she doesn't try to negotiate their pricing, so why do it to me? The pricing I offered was not supposed to be negotiable at all.

So, she goes on and on about how I should take the deal. Very weird to me that she was pushing so hard. So reluctantly, I agreed. I did tell her also tell her that she has to pay the monthly rate up front and it is nonrefundable. She had agreed until it was really time to pay. Now she says she only wants to pay HALF upfront (so 2 weeks worth) and will only pay through a payment processor that takes out fees, so not even the full amount I'm supposed to get. So now she's only paying me half of half of my asking price...and again I reluctantly agreed. But then I thought about it and was actually glad it would be paid for, for 2 weeks because if the 2 weeks didn't work out, I wasn't stuck in a deal with her for a month. 

Immediately after she pays, she floods my email and text messages with TONS of things she wants posted. No lie, I walked away from my phone for just a few minutes and I had so many messages. I thank her for all of the stuff she sent me and ask a couple questions. Then she lays out how every week will be and 7 days a week, she wants: 1 post to Instagram and 1 story and 1 post to Facebook and 1 story. So 4 total posts per day, 7 days a week, when we agreed to 5 days a week with 1 post or 1 story to each platform. Then she adds in that she wants me to fix up her Yelp account, set up a Twitter, and possibly make a YouTube. Well, that was never mentioned before...

Now every single morning around 5am, before I'm even up for the day, I have about 4-5 text messages and 1-2 emails. I don't even know where to start with so many messages and information. There's been days she asks me to post pictures, so I do. Then I'll receive a text message saying ""You are never to post 2 infographics 2 days in a row"" or ""You're not following directions as I stated, you need to do it this way"" or ""We're going to have a problem if you don't post a 12:30pm when people are scrolling through social media on their lunch breaks."" Well we never discussed posting at a specific time. I try to post at opportune times, but there was no specific time ever spoken about. It really just feels like she wants someone working for her that she can boss around all day to make herself feel important or something.

She literally texts and emails me all day. And the mornings is when I wake up with a message of her talking down to me in disappointment when none of these things were discussed before. I've been following instructions exactly as she asks. I can't take it anymore and I just want it all to end, but I really don't know how to go about doing that without offending her. I just took on a huge project where I'm getting paid really good money and I want to fully be able to focus on that, but it's hard when she is contacting me constantly and stressing me out. I'm not a confrontational person so I don't want to argue to start a fight. I just fear she will start badmouthing me or my business so I just need to know the proper way to end this please.

I do want to note that I know I made some mistakes such as taking any offer, not doing enough research, agreeing to her low prices, nor setting times that are appropriate for communication, etc. I've learned a lot throughout this and I've done tons research since all of this. I've learned even if it's hard to turn down clients, for fear of losing money or opportunities, sometimes you have to because you both just may not be a good fit.

It seems she may be sensitive or take things personally. How can I end this without making her super upset? I want to be polite and not rude but assertive. I don't want her to try to convince me to still work with her either.

Thank you for reading all of this and thank you in advance for your advice.",14Sep2019,2

22,"So recently my boyfriend of about 7 months broke up with me largely for the reason of; he's currently confused with what he wants to do with his life and is stressed about it and he also said that he couldn't see himself marrying me. He kept telling me that he also felt that since he is trying to figure out his own life he didn't feel like he would be able to give me enough or be a good enough boyfriend.

I'm not mad at him at all and I understand but it kind of got me questioning my own thinking when it comes to dating. I never knew that he was so focused on marriage or anything like that and if I would have I 100% would have had more conversations with him about it. However, it has started making me question my own opinions and outlooks on dating.

Since I am so young, i'm only 19 and a sophomore in college, I have always had the mentality that I don't necessarily date with the future in mind. I do think about it and I do want to get married and have kids someday so I do generally bring it up but in very casual terms and I don't stress too much about it because I know that things can change so fast and nobody really knows where they are going to be in 3-5 years. My outlook was always, if you're happy now then why not stay and see what happens, it doesn't really seem like wasting time to me. I guess i've just never really seen the logic in breaking up with somebody just because you don't know what's going to happen because honestly, nobody knows what's going to happen and relationships are always going to be somewhat of a risk.

I guess what i'm asking is, should I date being more future minded? I feel like i'm almost being too laid back about dating.

anyways a couple months after the relationship ended i realized how toxic it truly was and that i was suffering because of it. i’m not going to self diagnose but it’s pretty likely i have ptsd. i finally confided in a friend about it. she’s also friends with him so i don’t know what i was expecting. she told me, and i quote, “well he probably did it because he felt like he wasn’t getting enough out to the relationship”. she really defended him and said it was my fault. i don’t know whether i should cut her off or talk to her about it or forgive her. 

on top of that i confided in a few more friends. i dated within the friend group so most of my friends are also his friends. they had sympathy for me but continued being close friends with him. any advice would be helpful.

38,"I don't know what day but very soon I want to go from guadalajara airport to LAX and I have nowhere to go.

The situation is I live with my mom in mexico in a small house, I help her out in her job, she's a school cook. I make $50 a week.

The reason why I want to leave is I am very miserable here. I am American born and raised. Before my mom I lived on my own in orange county and was self sufficient, people where asking me for money and I always helped out even when I couldn't, unless I really cant. But I was only making about $400 a week and living in a room for $500. Living in califormia I was generally happy. I hated waking up to go to work but I had no issues at work, I was miserable because I had no one to cook for me and the people who i rented from where filthy. But these were all things that with some work I could've resolved and really should've. I was a bad cook and restaurant food was making me sickl so I really missed my mom. Moving back seemed like an easy and safe option and I promised myself I would bring something back, a skill. I wanted to go to school here, that plan went to shit once I realized I hate it here and want to go back. 

The air pollution is so bad where we live, I always have a headache and I'm in a really shitty mood, plus where we live is on a busy street, so the pollution is worse in our area, my aunt has a house about 20 minute walk and the pollution is tolerable. Ive also developed mental effects, OCD and Panic disorder, so I'm also scared to go back on my own and go through the stress of work, but I'm confident I'll adjust.

I've been in mexico for a year and recently I lived in Manzanillo beach for a month with an aunt, I was living with her and cooking my own food, I was actually really happy, the downside was that it's tropical climate, so it was humid and I couldn't for the life of me get used to it, plus side was no air pollution.

So, I'm on edge, the walls are closing in, and I'm ready to go to California, I have no money. I'm going to overdraft my bank account to buy the plane ticket and be left with  -200 $

I don't know where I'm going but I will be staying at a bnb hostel for a night, from there I'm going on a journey to reclaim my sanity. I think the pros outweigh the cons, I'm stuck in a viscous and deadly cycle here, in CA, I will be in control of my future atleast.

I have reached out to family members and I feel like a beggar, they tell me to ask my mom and sister for help. My mom wants me to stay and my sister who lives in California won't help. I have an aunt in California and she has a 4 bedroom house with all her kids in college, we let her stay in our house whenever she wants for as long as she wants and she won't let me stay with her for a few nights.

I'm open to hear all advice",14Sep2019,1

43,"I’ve been seeing this guy for four months now we finally made it official since we both have very strong feelings toward each other and have had some major things come up that could have broken us but instead made us stronger. He lives roughly an hour away and we both work a lot so we only get to see each other once a week maybe twice if we are lucky... but despite this we still talk everyday! I love this relationship and he makes me incredibly happy! On the other hand I have my best friend who seems to be jealous of the amount of time I spend with him (keep in mind I only see him once a week). When my boyfriend and I first started seeing each other I only worked 3 to 4 days a week but he worked six so we still only saw each other once or twice. On the days I wasn’t working or with him I hung out with my Best friend (which ended up being most days). Well 2 months ago I got a promotion and am now working 6 days a week so I don’t have much time for anyone now. I still make time to see my boyfriend once a week because of our distance. And I usually go to the gym with my bestie a few days during the week... well tonight she texted me asking to hang out and I told her I couldn’t because I was busy. She assumed it was because of my boyfriend and started “telling me how she felt” this is how the conversation played out. 

Best Friend: 
                     “I just feel like ever since you and blank got together I’m like a second choice always. I make plans with you and you’re like “idk if I have plans with blank” or it’s “maybe” the only time we see each other is during the week. Which is fine but we don’t hangout a lot.” 

Me: 
      “I work a lot especially lately since they hired a bunch of new people. If I get the chance to hangout with blank I’m going to because of the distance from me.” 

Best Friend:
                    “Okay but I feel like it’s unfair that we make plans and you cancel them for someone else. I’m happy you’re happy and I want you to be happy but it’s like you don’t want anything to do with me anymore.”

Me: 
      “When have I canceled plans with you for blank? I’ve told you if I don’t see him we can hang but I don’t ever remember canceling plans with you for him! I only get to see him once a week and that’s on weekends. If you want to hangout we can during the week and you know this! 

Best Friend:
                    “Yeah but I sometimes don’t get off work till late sometimes.”

Me:
      “Me too! And there have been several times I have asked if you wanted to hang and you said you were to tired to.”

Best Friend:
                     “And there’s been times I’ve asked you to and you didn’t want to because you were waiting to see it blank and you were hanging out.” 

Me:
      “Yeah because I don’t want to go out with you and have to turn around drop you off back at your house just because he is on his way and I already promised to hang with him.” 

Best Friend:
                    “Honestly idk I’m not trying to argue with you.” 

Me:

Now, I'm in a position where I can definitely make real friends, and I definitely get some real social activity.  But I often feel extremely anxious, to the point that multiple people have told me to relax.  One person just kept telling me to relax over and over since I looked so anxious.  I have had this anxiety for years now.

Also, I want to point out that it is NOT ""social anxiety"" or nervousness or a lack of confidence - at least, as far as I know.  I can basically do anything a normal really confident person does, except I might be visibly anxious while doing it.

I feel incredibly anxious on any public transportation because it is boring.

I should point out that right now, I have just started a new job in a new country, which is great.  

The most relaxed I have felt, and the highlight of my week, is when some students at my school invited me to shoot a shoot a few hoops (with a basketball), which I did for a few minutes.

Basically, the moment he comes home everyday, whatever I am doing is interrupted and I have to be social with him until he's satisfied. If I open my door and walk out of my room, he leaves his room to come start a conversation. When I go outside to have a smoke, he joins me to have a conversation. When I walk into the kitchen to microwave a quick meal, he comes in there to start  conversation. He doesn't have many friends or people to talk to so he talks to me and I do try to indulge and accommodate him. However, when I moved in I told him I was antisocial and that I like to keep to myself and am usually absorbed in whatever I'm doing. He told me that he understands and is okay with this but his actions tell a different story. 

In most other facets he is a good room mate and friend. But it is getting to the point where I don't want to leave my room for fear of getting stuck in a conversation. When I go back to my room he stands at the doorway and talks to me until he's satisfied that we've had a conversation. Or something. This is a friend of mine and I really don't want to come off as mean or rude to him because I care about him but his incessant need to follow me wherever I go and keep talking to me is driving me crazy and is actually a significant source of stress in my life right now.

I have a small job at a restaurant right now and everyone there is friendly and nice. I apply to jobs every day that are more suited to my field but I never get any responses. I feel like I am so behind on life.

55,"TLDR: Rude cafe worker keeps pointing her finger at my mom while she's at the pool. What can I do to make this stop?

My mom came crying to me for help today. English is not her first language so, she asked me to write her a letter she can send.

My parents go to the swimming pool every morning. My mom does an aerobics class while my dad swims laps. There's a cafe in the pool lobby that has a view of the pool.

For the past 6 months, a cafe worker has been pointing her finger at my mom and gossiping about her. (Not important information but, my mom thinks this all started because a rumour started around that time that one of the lifeguards has a crush on her.) Whether my mom is just checking in through the lobby or doing an aerobics class, this lady sticks out her entire arm to point my mom out to whoever she's gossiping to. My mom is not the type to get upset about people gossiping at her but, the fact that this worker is pointing with her arm out 90 degrees, while maintaining eye contact, is making her feel harassed. She tried to ignore it but, this has been ongoing for almost half a year. She says it feels demeaning that this worker openly points at her while she's just trying to exercise.

Today, my mom snapped. The worker did the usual routine and pointed straight at my mom while she was swimming. My mom climbed out of the pool, pointed right back at her and took a few steps to the lobby. This scared the other worker she was gossiping to and caused her to scurry away to pretend she was working. 

Later in the day, my mom asked a worker for a supervisor and was asked to leave her phone number. When the supervisor called and was told the situation, she said the worker could have been pointing at anyone in the pool. My mom told her that this worker shouldn't be pointing her fingers at anyone when they're exercising. My mom also asked her, ""Don't you guys have cameras in the lobby? Check the times between X:XX-X:XX. It's very obvious when she does it. She stands at the glass separating the pool and lobby and sticks out her arm."" To which the supervisor replied that she doesn't know if they have cameras or not. My mom didn't say it then but she told me that the supervisor sounded really sus. Shouldn't a supervisor know whether there is a camera or not? I didn't mention this to my mom yet but, I am worried that the cafe worker called (or got a friend to call) pretending to be the supervisor.

My mom just wants to be able to exercise in peace. She doesn't care if the worker gossips. She just does not wanted to be pointed at and harassed as she's working out.

I'm not very good at writing so, I was wondering if you guys can help me come up with something good I could write? Also, who should I send this to? The pool is run by the city so, I am unsure whether to send it directly to the pool or try to go higher up by emailing city hall.",14Sep2019,1

Yesterday I was supposed to go on this holiday boot camp that my mum wanted me to go on.

I've been on these camps before, they're difficult and very stressful to deal with (you go to bed at midnight and wake up at 5 in the morning), and you do these physically demanding exercises all day. I get along with absolutely nobody in these camps. So this time I put my foot down a few days ago and said I'm not going this time. These camps are just too painful for me to bear. 

My dad's alright with me not going (he understands my stress), but my mum was shocked and said that she wouldn't talk or listen to me anymore if I didn't go. She wanted me to suffer some hardship and 'be stronger'. She sure isn't talking to me now. As a punishment, Mum said I have to do housework and dig up weeds for my entire holiday.

My dad's flying interstate to see his mother (She's almost 90) in a few hours. And since I'm at home (not at camp), he just booked a plane ticket for me. But you see, I'm supposed to do housework instead of visiting my grandma. My mum said to me I won't be her son anymore if I board that plane.

I love my mum unconditionally, but my grandma's beginning to really slow down now and I'm afraid these holidays might be the last opportunity to see her.

Any advice? Thanks!",14Sep2019,4

81,"I’m currently in a social work program at a university in the US (25,F, Masters program) And whichever professor we are assigned now, we must continue with for the coming 3 semesters. My current professor is difficult to say the least. 

Not as far as homework or class work.... but so far he’s been tough on us and rude at times to students. There’s a student who’s severe ASD in my class who’s grown quite close to me and the professor seems to bully him almost. And when I try to help this student with his replies to questions, it’s as if the professor dislikes me just as much. 

Let me add that this is in the social work field. And outside of class, this professor is a social worker with troubled youths. 

I also have concerns that this professor may be an addict who recently relapsed. I don’t have hard evidence of this. But the last two class periods he’s been quick to frustrate, and nonsensical in some of his speeches and reasoning on why students are wrong. Everyone in the class will look around confused at each other and gossip after class about his odd responses. 

Beyond my concerns with this and his bullying, he’s egotistical. Since we are all far along and grown adults, most professors in the field go as far as to let us call them by their first name. But this professor has a doctorate and insists that we address him as “doctor ___” And seems to try to flex his knowledge. When any student gives some extra insight or uses social work jargon, he seems to look down on them and dismiss them. 


The student in my class a good people, so they have small complaints but say they think he’s a good professor. They don’t want to speak out I think. But I’m having real concerns about getting through these next semesters with a professor like this. He seems to already dislike me, and I leave every class period frustrated and confused by his behavior.",14Sep2019,1
82,"Throw away because I don’t want this attached to my main, on mobile so I apologize for formatting. 

So my sister when I was younger used to have a lot of episodes where she would run away, fight, and other things because she was mad over something. It’s not the healthiest thing but we all have our flaws.

There was this one night where my sister threatened suicide to emotionally manipulate my mother. I was naturally really shaken up about these things. I almost committed suicide because of it ( no one but a few close friends know about this part ) and I began to realize something very recently.

I’ve been getting more and more apathetic about life. In almost every way. I care less about grades and my future and the rest of the world than I did. I realized I started doing this because of my sister. And I don’t know what to do now. 

I don’t know how I’m supposed to carry on a relationship with someone after they did that to their own mother (who’s an amazing person) and who caused me to feel so num for such a long time that I now have to work myself out of.

She is very impatient and gets angry a lot over the smallest things and complains constantly, saying that everyone annoys her. She seems to only be nice to me and her other friends and strangers who she doesn’t find annoying. Maybe 3-5 times now she has said the n-word as a “joke”. And when i say, “don’t say that”. She plays it off like “aww are you offended? boohoo aw is little black baby offended??” and we move on. like she really doesn’t give a fuck. she doesn’t call anyone it, but more says it as a joke, calling me it, which is still not okay and idk what to do. She also has said the f-word that’s derogatory to gay people. I know it’s kinda outdated, but it’s kinda offensive?? She casually calls her friends the word as a joke. she also casually calls people “gay” or say “that’s gay” or “what are you, gay?”.
Today we both took the train home together because we live near each other, so she then drove me home from the train stop. And she wasn’t familiar to my town, so i would point turns out and things to watch out for. and she would get confused, and blame me, but also pretend like she was right?? like at one point she was confused in a rotary, and i pointed in a direction. and she was like “i know i know.. :|” in a condescending tone. like it was obvious or something. but then she missed the exit. i honestly already have blocked everything that happened out of my mind because the way she was talking to me almost gave me a panic attack. usually at school, she is much better at containing her sassiness?? i only have ever hung out with her for 1-2 hours at a time though because she’s a commuter and we have different classes. but i’m torn because she actually is quite nice and caring towards me. and she has shared so much info about her dark family and her boyfriends dark family life and everything that goes on in her life. i know i don’t have the strength and willpower to cut her off, but how do you suggest i cope with her behaviors? or am i overreacting?

tldr; my new friend at college says the n-word and the f-word (derogatory to gay people) as a joke. And when i say, “don’t say that”.

5 years ago my crush liked me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me on there) and I’m scared she won’t like me anymore",14Sep2019,0
89,"I have been talking to this guy I met in college for over 2 years now. I had a slight crush on him at the time but I didn't think anything of it. Until he messaged me on Facebook. At first, we had conversations sporadically maybe once every one or two weeks. It didn't take long though for us to start talking every single day. However, it did take him about a year and a half to finally ask me out. We never made anything official, never posted online about our dates together or invited each other over to meet our families. It's not that we were trying to hide each other, we just both don't care enough to be posting everything we do online. But we went out to each other's favorite places, and to our favorite restaurants. We'd even go run errands or just drive around and listen to music on the days where we didn't feel like doing anything but still wanted to spend time together. 

One thing though, that he'd talk about a lot was New York, where he's from. He's been wanting to move back since he was little and him not being able to, became one of the reasons why he had become very depressed. He's been taking medication for it way before I met him. During this time I also became very depressed because of my situation at home and my relationships with family and friends. So we've been there for each other. Talk every single day, take each other out of the house when we're at our worse. About 5 months ago he really started considering moving back. He started looking for places to live and started applying for jobs there. So knowing that eventually, he plans on moving back I decided to ask him about our relationship and how he actually felt. He said he really liked me, but he didn't feel like he was stable enough to get into something serious. He wanted to focus on getting his life together. So I ended things and stayed friends. I told him that I didn't want to get attached and get hurt once he leaves. But we really did stay friends. We never stopped talking to each other, and we never stopped hanging out. He has always been very respectful about it, never tried to make me jealous, never tried to make me feel bad about. However, about a month ago we started up again. We started talking like if we were together and started kissing again, but we never talked about being together or about making it official. We just went with the flow of what felt right.  Yesterday he got a call for a job in New York and is leaving in 4 days for an interview. He's the smartest and most talented person I know so I'm very positive that he's going to get the job, which means that he'll be gone by the end of the month. 

I've never let myself get attached to people for the reason of not wanting to get hurt. He's been the first person that I have allowed myself to open up to, and I really do love him. I know that nothing is going to stop him from leaving and I want him to be happy. But I also want him to be with me, even if for a while it is long distance. But I am not sure how he feels. He's never told me he loves me, never told me he actually wants to be with me.  He's so happy about going back and I am so scared that if I tell him how I feel and what I really want that he'll stop talking to me. I don't know if I should let him go and try to move on or if I should leave things the way they are and see what happens. Please help",14Sep2019,1
91,"This is kind of a weird question, but I've struggled on what to do in this situation. I usually get 95-100s on tests whereas most of my friends get like 85s.

First, they're just like 'you're a genius', 'lifespan's hard being smart', etc. I have no idea how to respond to this so I usually just laugh and say thanks, but I feel like that makes me look conceited.

The other way is they start feeling bad about their own score. Usually I try to say something like 'it was a hard test that's a good score', but I feel like it also comes off as snobby.

96,"To be honest, I’ve never always had a ton of friends around. It has always been just one, two, or three people that I can manage to get really close to without emotional energy burnout. Sometimes, problems arise in those relationships (drifting/distancing) that leaves me alone with no friends. But I’ve never felt the need to desperately try to change myself because I’m pretty satisfied with I am. I love myself a ton and I enjoy spending time alone. I’m happy as long as I have at least one person I can talk to relatively frequently. 

But anyway, that one person happens to be my boyfriend right now. We’ve been together for 10 months now, and for 8 or 9 of those months, I’ve always had my former best friend with me to hang around. We’ve quickly distanced throughout the summer as I got busier. But managing a few jobs on top of excelling in my schoolwork leaves me with little free time. I choose to spend that free time with my boyfriend whenever we could, whether it was getting home from class, or studying at the library for a few hours. Sometimes I’d come over and nap when I would really need it. This would be about 3-4 hours together a week. So this Friday, I knew I would have a pocket of free time where I’d be able to hang out with my boyfriend a little and I was so excited for that. I was calling him before I slept to tell him how excited I was and I was just overjoyed. 

He seemed to reciprocate the same feelings, but when my morning Friday classes came, I got a text from him telling me that he was going to be hanging out with his friends until 9-10, and would most likely be too tired to hang out with me, and suggested we hang out Saturday instead. That really, really fucking hurts me because we’ve had a problem with our relationship in the past with things like that. He sees those people every day in his class—much more than than how much I see him. Having someone dear to me chose someone else over me hurts. Promising to call me/promising to hanging out and then flaking when the time comes because of his friends or because he’s too sleepy. Yes, I understand that complications arise. Since we’ve had this problem in the past, sometimes he’d come hang out with me even if he wasn’t quite feeling it that day, and it wouldn’t be as much fun. 

But while I understand he has a bigger social circle than I do, it feels like I’m a second choice. Like he doesn’t really feel as excited to see me as I am to see him. He tells me otherwise, but I don’t feel as if his actions reciprocate his words. I’m left feeling alone and neglected. While I’m not always the one who texts firsts, I know that I always call him first. I never get calls first, or spontaneous messages telling me how much he loves me like I do. Maybe the way he shows love is different, but fuck, I feel so unloved.

Even my former best friend made sacrifices to hang out with me. Even if he were on 3 hours of sleep, he would often be fucking overjoyed to see me like I was to see him. We were really close, and for 8 months, only once has he really flaked on our plans. Maybe it’s because my best friend had a smaller social circle than my boyfriend, but I felt really fucking appreciated for all my efforts to make the other happy. It’s not the same in my relationship. 

The complication arises where I’m not sure if I’m justified in feeling this way. Am I too attached to one person and have unrealistic expectations for him? Is it because of my lack of a social circle? Or is he being too flaky? I don’t know what my feelings mean, I just want it to stop. Thank you for listening.",14Sep2019,1

108,"Necessary information:  
I'm a 46 yr old woman with autism; what used to be Asperger's syndrome. I am very sensitive to loud noise, and my anxiety is terrible. I take a beta blocker to control the tremors from it, and I wear earplugs most of the time. If they didn't become painful, I'd never take them out.   


We were given a house in a bad neighborhood several years ago. We lost our house in the southern US, and a friend helped us move up near Detroit, where through a very unlikely turn of events, someone we didn't know gifted us the house that we had rented.   


And everything was sunshine and roses for four years. There are social programs here that make life really easy for a person in my position, free appliances, healthcare, electric and gas bills controlled, etc. I knew that gangs and drugs were here, but they didn't bother us, so I didn't care. We moved in in 2015, and things were great until a few weeks ago.  


 Across the street from us is a very nice woman whose been in jail twice since we've been here. Our next door neighbor told us that she was in jail for drugs when we moved in, and there was an ambulance a her house one night, taking people out on gurneys.  So I'm presuming that she does heroine. Shes spoken to me a few times when I was taking out the trash. She's always completely drunk, but friendly.  There are always different cars parked at her house, presumably buying, selling, or sharing.   


There are abandoned house all over the place. One is just down the block from us. The first year we were here I woke up from a nap at 3:15 in the afternoon to ""pop!"" ""pop pop!"", and then several cop cars and yellow tape all over the street. Later we found out that there had been a gang camping out in it, running some kind of gambling thing, and a couple guys tried to rob them, so they shot them; in the ass and in the arm, respectively.  That house was boarded up until last year, when a woman started camping in it. It has crips graffiti on the back. The woman is obviously mentally ill, even from just passing conversation. She came knocking at our door about midnight two months ago, saying that her sister passed out and that she needed to call an ambulance, and her phone was out of batteries. She was distraught, so we let her.  - ""Passed out"" I think meant ODed.   


Actual problem:  


Then about three weeks ago, the abandoned house got BUSY. I have security cameras because I've had mail stolen. I saw twenty people a day going there, on foot, in cars, (some new, some rust buckets), on bicycles, everything.  It got progressively worse, until last week, when the constant noise of blasting stereos just became TOO MUCH. People we parking in front of my house to walk down there, and leaving their radios on full blast. I put in my earplugs, and earmuffs over the top, and I could still hear it.   


So I started manually recording them, and calling police about the noise.   


After three days of calling the cops several times a day, and it accomplishing nothing, because they were always gone by time they got here, and having meltdowns bawling because the noise was unbearable and inescapable. (If I'm standing in my kitchen at the back of the house, wearing gun range ear muffs, and the bass is still loud, I think I'm justified in being irritated.) I started posting friends-only videos on Facebook, asking for advice.   


My sister, and an internet friend I respect, both said to go talk to them. That they're my neighbors, and they should want to keep the peace with me, because we're neighbors. So the following afternoon, when a big SUV was parked out front blasting music, and the always-drunk lady from across the street was out there talking to them, and I was having a meltdown, I went out there. I figured in the midst of a meltdown, shaking like a leaf, barely able to speak, obviously crying, they would take me seriously and not be offended.   


I told her that I was very sensitive to loud noises, and she said she could put her dog inside. I said no, the dog is fine. She said ""the thumping"" I said yes, that I couldn't function, and I couldn't get away from it. She said she'd see what she could do, and she talked to them, and they turned it down. The next day someone else was parked out front basting music while he went down there, so I went out. The people who camp at that house yelled at him, ""She want you to turn down the music, she tryin' a sleep"", and he said he was sorry, and I said Thank you, and that was great.   


But it didn't stop. The next day there were five teenage-looking guys out there, with a bunch of different cars, and loud stereos. It went on all weekend. So Monday, I started calling any government agency that I could find. Now the house is boarded up again, and the block is FINALLY quiet again.  


I went out last night to put some cat food on the porch for the raccoons, like I always do, about midnight. The people who normally camp at that house were parked where they usually are, sort of between my house and that one, in front of another vacant house that's completely overgrown. As I was coming in, one of them stood up out of the car and said at me, not yelling, but loud enough to hear, ""We lived in this neighborhood our whole life. You'll leave before us. Remember that. You'll leave before us.""  (I didn't want them to leave. I just need it quiet.)  


And now I'm fucking terrified. People get shot here nearly every day. There are burglaries every day. Once in a while, there's a burglary where people get shot, or their dogs killed. I just don't know what it takes, or how aggravated they have to be, to break in or shoot someone.   


 We have SimpliSafe, four cameras, signs about the cameras on both doors, a pit bull mix who barks at everything, and crossbows, (because my partner refuses to get a gun, he says it's not needed, though I vehemently disagree); but I don't know if that's enough. I don't know anything about those kind of people. I spent my whole life around rednecks, where drug dealers were just basically hippies with weed and acid. This is a whole other ball game, and I am completely lost.   


We can't afford to live anywhere else. I get SSI and my partner is retired, on social security. We've got about $6k in the bank, so we could move, but the best we could do would be to buy another house in another bad neighborhood. We can't leave the area, because there is a program here that pays for our medicaid/medicare premiums, and one that pays most of the electric and gas bill. The best we could do would be to get a different house in a neighborhood just as bad, and it would take all of our savings to do it.   


My partner says that I'm over reacting, and that it will pass, and that if they'd meant it as a death threat, they'd have said so; but I don't know.   


My mistake was taking the advice of my sister and my friend. If I'd never gone out there, they'd never have known who called the authorities. But knowing that doesn't help now.   


If anybody broke in, the cameras would record them, (front door, back door, over the front yard, and one pointed at the abandoned house, to get license plate numbers)  the dog would be on them, and SimpliSafe would start beeping out its 30 second countdown, then it would scream bloody murder. I'd hit the panic button in my room, and it would be a question of how long the police would take to get here, and how fast we can put arrows in somebody under duress.   


Is that enough of a deterrent to keep gang members from breaking in and shooting us, if they strongly suspect that we reported their drug house?",14Sep2019,0

If I calculated it all out, my average 8 hour work day involves only about 1-2 hours of actual work, and most of that is re-forwarding emails. I can't exactly ask for more work because I don't have the education skills to be of any help to my coworkers (master electricians). And if they did have something for me, by the time it took to explain what I had to do they could have done it themselves. The reason I want to stay is the pay is insanely good for the work load, benefits are good, and my boss has a very hands off approach to my management; aka as long as the works done accurately &amp; on time he doesn't need to really bother with me. Also, this job requires a human to do, and most of my coworkers are not computer literate enough to handle it themselves. But it's clear this job has no future or forward progression. 

Should I begin to risk looking for a new job in hopes of getting something for a better career path or something more engaging? Or should I stick with the long term stability of my current job and seek other means of engaging myself (reading, writing, coding, etc...)?",14Sep2019,4

Later into the week they’d tell me how much they appreciate that I was there and that I had been a big part in getting them through the week. We’d text normally and he’d talk to me about his day to day life or we’d fuck around and joke about things. But now it seems to be different. They will neverrr message first which I didn’t think of as a big deal at first but it never happens. They always (nowadays) seem so uninterested in an actual conversation unless they’re initiating it. I constantly put on a comedian front for them because i thought it’d help them out (with feeling better and all). I don’t know, I kind of feel like I’m just entertainment for them and all. They only message me when they’re bored (and I get people are busy, but it only happens so)  and I’ve noticed they’ve created a pattern of making up excuses on why they have to go.

On FB he started writing snarky comments under my status’ and not saying much when I messaged him. So, I stopped contacting him.

So, the other day I uploaded a photo album of my recent London trip. I wrote “glad to get out of NI, it was depressing me being there, I don’t know why anyone would volunteer to live there for the rest of their life”. 

To which he wrote a snarky comment about me being a politician. He then wrote that I whine too much etc.. so as I got sick of his digs, I wrote “well delete me if you don’t like my content”.., to which he did immediately.

I don’t know what is behind this behaviour but he seems to be irritated and irked at me lately. I’m really not sure what’s going on or what I have done. I’m feeling confused right now. 

I don’t set out to get into conflict with anyone, particularly someone whom I used to talk to on a cordial basis once in a while. I really don’t have any angst against him.

So right now i’m feeling a little hurt and insecure. I’m all confused and I feel that he lashed out at me out of nowhere, with a switch in attitude towards me.

The fact that he has not contacted me to resolve the situation or apologise is annoying me. (I have not contacted him as he is the one who deleted me).

149,"I am a 19 year old American who was baptized as catholic but went to an episcopal church throughout childhood for some reason. My dad is catholic and my mom is church of christ. I also had an edgy atheist phase at 14, but this quickly ended by the end of my freshman year. I originally went to a catholic college, but had to leave mainly because of mental health reasons. I also had a hard time adjusting to the toxic atmosphere there. Now I go to a community college in Virginia, where I was raised. 

There are a few reasons for my interest in Islam. Firstly, I lost faith in catholicism due to its turbulent history and barbaric views on political issues such as abortion. I’m leaning left, so clearly the ultra conservative catholic church is not for me. Another reason is an openness to other cultures and beliefs that arose since I started going to my community college, which is extremely diverse (there’s plenty of muslims there too). Lastly, I used to be a hateful misogynist who openly despised women and feminism. These toxic views on women ruined my teenage years and left me mentally broken, so I seek to find a way to cure myself of this hatred. 

The main reason for me wanting to convert to Islam is it just makes sense. It emphasizes aspects of life that I support (like modesty, donations to the poor, education, and spiritual enlightenment). It also forbids all that is poisonous to the world such as alcohol, premarital sex, and general hatred. 

I do realize that this is a great life adjustment and it will be a difficult journey, but the same is true for any religion or lifestyle. I’m not exactly in the best lifestyle. I’m living with my parents, i’m a full time student, I have few real friends, and i’m still recovering from my mental illness. I’m often feeling depressed and empty. Worst of all, I am finding myself spiraling into the very hateful mindset I had in the past. My own therapist has told me that she will stop my treatment if I become a misogynist again. That of course would be absolutely disastrous. I’m in a vulnerable state and what I need is guidance. Is Islam the answer here? If so, what can I do to turn my life around and be a good muslim? I need a drastic change in the right direction in my life. Could this be it?",14Sep2019,0

That’s it. And that’s still like 20 minutes away from me. Now that you have an idea of how generally far away from people I live, here’s the question. I want to go to public school in the “bigger” town next year for sophomore year. I know a lot of people there that are very nice and cool people. But, it is a more skeptical environment. My parents don’t want me going to public school because they think I’ll be influenced by the kids there. Because some of them cuss a lot and are disrespectful to teacher etc. but. I’m in highschool now, I’ve grown up away from that. I feel like I’m old enough not to be swayed by these other people and I really love talking to people and just being social. And my parents do very well in trying to give me a life for how far we live. I play volleyball during that season. I go to church and a youth group. But that’s about it. And I just really want the after school activities, the options. See this won’t technically effect them at all as I will have my license next year and can drive myself or take the bus (last bus stop is 2 miles away) and I understand what they are telling me and their point of view but I’d really like to try it, and if I don’t like it, keep homeschooling. What do you guys think? Bad idea? Or should I go for it? I think they’ve decided that in the end it comes down to me, but they don’t really approve.",14Sep2019,1

161,"I'm a senior in high school getting ready to submit my college applications. Because of my school rank, I'm automatically accepted into the University of Texas at Austin; however, I live in Houston, and going to UT would entail moving away from my family. I would obviously be hesitant at first having never lived on my own, but still glad for the chance to start my adult life independently. My parents have been telling me since last year that they will support me no matter where I choose to go. There is a University of Houston, but its program for environmental science (what I plan on majoring in) is surpassed by that of UT Austin. Beginning at the end of last school year, my parents have stopped saying they'd support me but rather telling me to apply to the Houston school. If asked by family members 2 years ago, they'd say that I had the liberty to choose and they'd get behind my  decision. Now, they say that I plan on going to UH when I have explicitly resigned from any definite statements about where I plan on going (for precisely that reason). It's obvious that they want me to stay close to home, but I don't think it would take very much convince them to let me go to Austin. I'm fearful that, if I do go to Austin, I'd be drawing a pretty bold line between my parents and I--a relationship that varies too often to be sure where everyone stands.",14Sep2019,1

I'd really like advice about the DID but some refreshers on coping with depression might help, too.

I'm seeing a really good therapist right now but it's not enough.

The problems I'm specifically facing with depression are severe isolation and loneliness (I'm too down and low on energy to have a social life) and with DID  it gets even more complicated, with heavy internal miscommunication and dysfunction that's led to some severely traumatizing experiences.

166,"I just started highschool a few weeks ago, and there’s this girl that I thought was cool, but it turns out she’s not. I’ll call her Kenzie in this post. 

So kenzie and i are in choir together, and we started talking and she seemed very nice so I talked to her more. She sits right next to me in my math class so I see her there too. Well, maybe a few weeks into our friendship I notice she’s kind of weird... not in the good way. I thought that we were friends so I told her about my crush. And I don’t even talk about him that much to her! And any time I bring him up she’s like “you need to stop”. And that’s just a little strange? 

Apparently Kenzie sleeps with a full grown pig every night. All she ever talks about are pigs and she ignores me when I try to talk about something I like. A few days ago I showed her my Beatles drawing which took me quite awhile, and I asked if it was good, and she just shrugged. I don’t know about you, but I think that’s really rude. Also, I do golf, and sometimes I tell her about how I don’t feel like going to a practice or how I’m excited for a match, and she just totally ignores me. Besides pigs, all she talks about is how she does swim. She’s showed me her ymca card at least 20 times and I don’t wanna be mean and say I’ve seen it a billion times. Kenzie’s constantly complaining about how she smells like chlorine, and apparently the girls on the swim team can’t shave their legs, so she showed me her hairy legs which was gross.

Kenzie is super clingy too, she’s following me around constantly, and on top of all that, she has horrible breath and doesn’t take care of herself too well. She doesn’t seem to give a damn about her hair, or appearance overall. She told me that she gets strep throat every year, and well I don’t really wanna catch it from her at all or ever.

Back to how she despises when I just as much as look at my crush. I’ll call him Gorgeous in this post! So I’m having an awesome and funny conversation with Gorgeous, and Kenzie comes over to where I’m sitting and tells me to go over to her spot, (which she does all the time. But I’ll talk about that later.) and I keep saying no and that I’m talking to Gorgeous and she can tell me whatever she was gonna tell me right at my own spot. And she tells me that I need to stop staring at him. And so I tell her I’m having a conversation with him! And I don’t know why she just hates the idea of me liking Gorgeous.

Back to how she always calls me over to her spot. Yeah we’re in the same computer class together, and I’m lucky enough to sit right next to my crush. So Kenzie always tells me to go to her spot so she can show me pictures of pigs for 10 minutes and tell me about her other friends that go to a different school. When I try to go back to my spot and get some actual work done, she grabs my arm and she’s like “wait but my friend did this, my pig did that” 

So in conclusion, she’s really clingy, frumpy, and ignores me when I talk and I know she’ll ruin my rep. And I know she gossiped about me to one of my other friends because that friend told me about what she said about me. (You guessed it, how she hates hearing about my crush who I don’t even talk about that much) and I just need help getting her to leave me alone, but in a polite subtle way cuz I don’t wanna be super mean. Thanks so much if you read this whole thing and sorry if it was super long!",14Sep2019,1

169,"So uh a bit of background: we come from a conservative non-white background (race/cultural background is important in this case) and my mom has been refusing to take her meds for years. My mom has been depressed for as long as I can remember and her depression comes in waves. I remember being around 7 and my mom urging me and my sister to call our dad and tell him her goodbyes because she might not last the night. There have been multiple occasions where she has attempted (or at least it looked like to me). I never really believed it (I know it sounds bad trust me) but since I've seen her go through this since I was essentially born it meant it was my normal and putting the word depression to it would make it abnormal. Like your mom doesn't sleep for 18 hours straight or consistently makes you lunch; I can't relate. A few years ago when I was around 14ish and in the throes of her depression she attempted to jump off a bridge and well even then depression didn't come to mind because according to my mom she only did it to help with my dad's sponsorship process and it was nothing. To the mind of 14 year old me it was plausible so I never really questioned it. My mom has also been in and out of hospitals and in psych wards for prolonged periods of time throughout my teenage years which meant being her not being present. After her last psych stint my mom has stopped using her depression meds (even before she was lax) she stopped because aunties in the community told her if she continues she'd become the living dead. Essentially, the meds will control her and all of that nonsense and my mom has believed it and has refused to take her meds. What this has meant is her not leaving her room for 3 months, losing a bunch of weight and believing God has cursed her. As I said before my mom has been depressed probably her entire life and due to this she has become a bit of a nomad, moving constantly and at times without reason is normal for us. For example, we have lived in 4 different countries and 8 different cities since 2006. Most recently we moved during my senior year in high school to a small town (I've lived in major cities my entire life so this was an..... adjustment) during that year life was hell. My mom was horribly depressed and alternated between threatening to kill herself to saying ""forgive me my time has come, forgive my sins and remember me fondly"". She wouldn't come out of her room and would just sleep for hours on end and at times wake up and cry. Yeah that was interesting senior year. Two years on and we've decided to move again to a whole new city because the town got her sick. Yeah. My dad has been actively trying to get her to reconsider the move because we don't have the funds and its not a sound plan on all fronts as we've built a life here. My mom has refused pulling out the famous ""I'd die if I stay here"" and ""I stayed a year for xx's university, I can't anymore"". I'm fine with the moving because moving around constantly as a child has made me anxious in staying in one place forever, it's so mundane. The only issue I have is that I know for a fact that's it's not the town or the location that keeps making her suicidal and depressed and no matter how many times we move those feelings will stay with her. It's an illness and the only way to get better is to get medicated, my dad agrees but my mom thinks my dad wants her to quote on quote ""Go crazy on the white man's medication"" and for her to be sent to a psych ward forever.",14Sep2019,2

Like 2 weeks later she makes a guy account ok snapchat, saying ""he"" was her friend. So I had her number still saved in my phone incase she tried to do something like this. So I asked ""him"" why he had the same number as her. She got all angry and said ""well we have the same number!"". So I asked for her to send me a voice recording saying it wasnt her. She unfriend me so I blocked gag account. Then like a week later I was scrolling through my ""blocked"" section on snapchat and I notice my best friend since childhood was blocked on there. I think I know who did it. My ex friend hated my childhood best friend with a passion. Ex best friend always steals my phone.

176,"Currently, I'm a senior in high school, and the person I'm referring to as my best friend doesn't consider that to be mutual. 

We met towards the end of freshman year but didn't really talk much until the start of sophomore year, where we shared a history class. As a result, we started talking pretty often, cracking jokes and teasing each other, the usual stuff. It eventually got so frequent for me that I eventually declared — one-sidedly, mind you — that this girl was my best friend. 

I never said it aloud since I knew she didn't reciprocate the best friend part, but she didn't deny the fact that we were pretty close, so I didn't care much that we weren't seeing things at the same level.

Come junior year and we're not talking as much, but by this point I've noticed something slightly odd and, honestly, a bit worrying: my best friend never really talked about herself. 

Sure, whenever I'd ask her about stuff, she'd say she was fine and would share small tidbits here and there, but nowhere near the volumes of information I'd tell her about. That is to say, she likely knew almost everything about me at one point, but I didn't know nearly as much about her. 

Hell, even that regressed to the point where it would be glaringly obvious that something was wrong with her but when I'd try to bring it up, she would just brush it off. For a while, I accepted it, especially since after a while of doing that she admitted that she'd rather help others with their problems than “burden” others with her own.

At the same time, though, I was wondering why she wouldn't want me to help her, even after making it (what I thought was) very clear how much I cared about her. Perhaps it was because she already had a group of friends she was extremely close to and a great boyfriend as well. But I wanted to reciprocate all that she had done for me so far and she wasn't letting me.

It was getting frustrating.

Slowly, by the end of junior year, I've gotten mostly over it so far and the hostility that had began to slightly build up died away, thankfully. But, having faced that “I'm fine” when she made it clear earlier that there was most definitely a problem, all of that frustration has come running back tenfold. 

At this point, I'm led to believe two things. One, she really doesn't know how much I care about her. And two, that she really doesn't consider anywhere as near a good friend as I see her to be. 

After this year ends, it's almost certain that I'll never see her again, so I'm hoping to end things on a good note. But as for what I need advice for (sorry for the long backstory, whoops), do you guys think it's possible to somehow get her to reciprocate even the slightest bit, or should I just back the fuck off and be a friendly person?",14Sep2019,2

183,"This may be a bit long. If so, I apologize. My boyfriend(22) and I (f22), go away every labor day weekend with his family. This year we borrowed my best friend's sister's suitcase. When we loaded up, I put it in the car because my boyfriend's back is already effed up. So much so that docs have told him he will eventually lose use of his legs. So we went out of town, had a great weekend, and came home that monday. 
When we got back, I'd been texting my best friend all day and was thrilled to be home and have some girl time. We went to Walmart like usual and halfway through the trip, my boyfriend texted me to tell me he had fallen down the hardwood stairs in our house. When we got home I found that what he had neglected to tell me was he fell taking the suitcase up, resulting in the suitcase going down with him. I panicked a little because I worry about his back a lot and him being in pain. She's aware of the back issues and the risks should he strain it too much or hurt it too severely. But versus even so much as asking if he was okay, her immediate response was, ""I hope the suitcase is okay."" I thought she was joking and while it annoyed me, I firmly reminded her he could have been badly hurt. She only reiterated that she was more concerned with the suitcase and that she, ""will not get bitched at because he fell."" 
Now, I know we all have flaws. We all have quirks. And I can usually brush hers off. She does small things that irritate me like never apologizing no matter how wrong she is. She started dating my boyfriend's best friend earlier this year and, recently, no matter what conversation we have, she manages to steer it towards him and their sex life. I understand she's excited they finally slept together, but I really don't care how many times they do it a day or when. But she gets defensive and rude if I say anything and if she thinks I may be annoyed with him, she gets pissed at me.

At the end of my first week she told me her employer cut her check short due to payroll issues I guess and that sucked considering I planned to take my boyfriend out to eat later that weekend but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and believed her and she said she’d pay me the following week. The next week came and went and still no payment she told me she was going to get money out of the ATM while she was out shopping to give me the money but she didn’t. Now the third week has passed and LAST NIGHT she told me she’d pay me TODAY for sure (my birthday is Sunday and i was talking about wanting to go shopping) but when she came to get my nephew she said she was taking him to buy shoes and stuff and did not mention the money at all.

I’ve always actively tried to cure my depression and challenge myself in uncomfortable situations. I’m doing what I’m supposed to and I’m still the way I am. 

His family is dysfunctional and there are dynamics that mimic the problems I faced in my own family. They think I make all this up. They’ve accepted me as family but they don’t understand my introverted-ness, my awkwardness, my depression. They don’t understand that for some reason my memory has been horrible and sometimes I can’t even understand what’s happening around me. Sometimes people will talk and I’ll miss bits and pieces or even all of it...while actively listening. When this happens people just get angry and then I get more anxious and more words sound jumbled to me. Which makes it worse. 

Idk where I’m going with this really. I just need help. How can I control my emotions like a fricken adult. How can I rid of my anxiety in private on my own time so no one judges me or gets angry and makes it worse. I’m not helpless but shit-I’m depressed and I’ve accepted it but everyone’s an asshole about it. As far as I’m concerned-elementary school me wasn’t thinking about death for fun. I wasn’t feeling empty and hopeless at that age for fun. And I don’t “intentionally do so” now for fun either. I just am this way and I want to deal without other people bringing down another layer of hell. 

any ideas appreciated-sorry my thoughts are fairy disorganized.",14Sep2019,2

 this time he started a conversation and he ended up asking for my number, several boys has hit on me at work in the year I've been working there, tho I've always played it off. 

He also asked if he could drive me home but that seemed sketchy so I played it off

I gave it to this guy tho because tbh I'm really attracted to him, when we lock eyes and when I think about him my heart races. I haven't felt like this since I was a teenager, I'm a 21f 
 
He texted me that night, we exchanged names, he asked if he could drive me home again and said good night

194,"I was pretty confident going into Algebra II because I was alright in Algebra 1/2 in freshman year. I’ve never excelled in math ever in school but I definitely peaked that year and I whole heartedly believe it was because of my teacher back then, she was very helpful. 
Not to say that my current Algebra II teacher is not that but I’ve been struggling a bit. It was just review but it’s been tough because inside I know just 2 years ago I was able to get through these questions no problem. And I’m already struggling with this on its own but my teacher keeps saying “if you are struggling already, please consider dropping the class and going to a lower level” 
I understand she is just trying to be considerate and let us know honestly we might have a tough time the whole year. However, I’m probably overreacting but, I couldn’t help to feel discouraged since I thought even if I am stumbling a bit in the first chapter, if I try I’ll get somewhere, if I put in some effort like going to Khan Academy or watching videos and even asking my brother (who is a math major in college) to tutor me during homework. Her telling us straight up to just give up makes me wonder if effort can’t win over my impediment in math. 

I can’t drop the class now as our due date for schedule changes have passed. So my question is, how should I practice or study at home to not struggle as much? If you struggled in math and overcame it how did you do it?",14Sep2019,3

198,"So I'm the type of person who really only has two friends. One of them always came with me to football games since I played in the pep band. Now that friend is hours away and in college so she stopped coming. Now my other friend said over the summer that she would sit by me and we would hang together. The first football game she drove with another one of her friends but said we would ”definitely meet up and hang” but we got separated and she barely made an effort while I actually tried. I was a bit petty but pushed it aside and I moved on. I didn't want to make it a big deal because sometimes shit happens. A few weeks later and the football team has another home game. She talked to me in school about hanging during the game and acted super excited. She told me she was driving with someone else, but that didn't matter to me. Then not even an hour before the game she asked me if her younger sister could hang out with me because she didn't have any friends and her sister would get yelled at if she sat with the seniors. (her sister is a freshman) I said sure since her sister is super nice and I enjoy being around her. I thought it was a bit odd since I haven't ever really hung out with her sister but I didn't mind it. I assumed she would come sit with her sister and I for a but or say hi before the game starts. Nope. Not a single word the entire game. She didn't say thanks for hanging with her sister or anything at all. The only time I saw her is when traveling band playing in front of the student section and she waved. This is the girl I consider one of my best friends and she always says I'm her best friend. Even her sister says what I'm her best friend. She knows that I don't hang out with anyone during the games besides my friend who's now in college and she acted as she would hang with me. I'm pretty hurt and pissed about this. I understand she has other friends and I talk to other people but she couldn't even say hi? She didn't even walk with her sister up the bleachers to see me before the game. I was less than 100 feet from her. Maybe I'm taking this too hard but I feel like I have the right to be pissed.

205,"I have cute aggression. I know it sounds ridiculous but it IS a real thing and my cat and I suffer from it daily. I have never hurt an animal and could never ever do that. I just get extremely overwhelmed by an animals cuteness and I honestly canNOT control it. 

I own a cat with my boyfriend and she is mean. I think that I may be the reason that she is mean. I hold her against her will, I boop her nose, I always want to touch her and hold her. 
But of course she doesn’t like this. Sometimes even her getting upset will make my cute aggression continue to happen. She will make little noises and even her little sounds that she makes when I’m holding her against her will is so cute to me. She will start to growl sometimes and then I open up my arms and let her go... after a few more seconds. I know this is just the worst thing in the world to her but everything that she does I literally think is so cute. 

I think that me holding her against her will has made her aggressive and mean. We have friends over and she hisses at them and growls. We eventually have to lock her in our bedroom. When we go on vacation she will pounce and hiss at the people feeding her. One sitter even says that she will hiss and rub up against him. She is a mess and I really think it’s my fault.

The problem is me. I don’t know how to control myself. I know it’s hard to take this seriously but I want my cat to be nice and friendly and I know that the solution has to come through me. I think she may think that I am a threat. Anyone have an idea or solution for me?

a little about the cat:
She is a wild cat, came from a barnyard momma.

207,"Okay so, I work at a retail job in the mall that I just started at the end of June. My old boss from a previous job actually works there as a sales associate and got me the job. It’s been a very short period of time, but things were going really well, and all women work there so the only problem I really faced was that most of them are catty and dramatic. I don’t mind my job and the hours are pretty good, but I’m a high school student and I only make minimum wage so it’s not a huge deal to me. A month and a half ago I fractured a small bone in my foot and have been off work since. I’ve stayed in constant contact with them, and keep getting someone to bring in doctors notes every time I get a new one so they can stay updated until I can come back to work. Anyways, at my last appointment three weeks ago they said i could return on the 17th of September. When my mom brought in my doctors note for me she told them (and left a sticky note) that I was unable to work on the 19th and the 21st. Sure it’s inconvenient that it’s the first week back, but I gave them lots of notice, and they’ve managed without me for the past month and a half anyway. So today I call my boss to ask for my schedule next week, when she proceeds to tell me i’m working both the 19th and the 21st. When she told me on the phone I really only processed that I was working the Thursday (19th) and forgot that that Saturday was the other day i needed off (21st). I told her that i wouldn’t be able to work the 19th and that i asked for the day off because I have a concert, and she told me nobody was available to work Thursday night and i would have to try to find coverage myself. when i told her i already bought tickets and had no way out of it she replied by saying it would still be my responsibility to get coverage and i could “ask the only person available who doesn’t work any Thursday’s”. I said okay i’ll try to find coverage then when i come in on Tuesday and hung up. Ever since that phone call this afternoon i keep wondering why she would do that? Is she angry at me for missing work even though it clearly wasn’t my fault? I need the money so I would like to return the work,  but I will not be working both those days so now I don’t know what to do? Do i just quit my job because my boss is rude and malicious or do I just tell her i’m not working those days and she can decide what to do with me. I’m afraid to quit because I would be too worried to shop there in the future, as well as my old boss got me the job. I’m also scared to just tell her I won’t work because I’m afraid of confrontation especially if I have to make a phone call into work to do so. I’m so conflicted and I can’t get a good response from anyone in my life. Please help!

TL;DR My boss didn’t give me the two days off I requested after missing a long period of work due to an injury. Do I quit my job, no show for the shifts, or simply tell her I’m not working those days? Please leave some advice.",14Sep2019,1

Tl;dr I recently got a job, in which I haven’t been interviewed or received a job offer for, which has me sending large amounts of money to random places. 

I recently graduated from uni and have joined the masses of unemployed grads. A few weeks ago I applied to a job listing on Indeed for a receptionist position for a company that looks legit enough (through reviews on GlassDoor, albeit there weren’t many). 

I then get an email from them redirecting me to someone we’ll call Mr X. Mr X says that I’ll be working as a personal assistant for him, but since he’s out of town for a few weeks, he’ll wait until then to give me a formal interview and offer. However, he did have errands that I can run for him during this time. It’s not exactly the job that I applied for, but I’m jumping with joy after being ghosted by countless of companies, especially since the pay is rather high for what it seems like I’ll be doing.  

I get a check in the mail sent by his “financial manager” for a large sum of money ($XXXX), and he tells me that he wants me to put together care packages for foster kids.

However, during all this I do note a few things:
-Googling Mr X’s name doesn’t show any LinkedIn profiles, relevant websites, etc. 
-Neither does Googling the name of the person who sent the package. 
-Mr X’s area code is a different state than mine, the address that sent the package is another different state, and the check lists a bank in yet another state. So we have four different states involved (including mine). 
-The company name that was listed on the package was not the one that I applied for, although it also seems like a legit company. 

After the check processes with my bank, Mr X tells me that the care packages will be too expensive and that he wants me to buy money orders (worth $XXXX each, and yes, Walmart did file an SAR on it) and mail it to the foster care people. He tells me that the address is a suite, but it looks like an apartment/townhouse area to me (although I’m not sure because Google Street View doesn’t work for the address). 

That was yesterday, and today he had me send the remaining amount of money ($XXX) through CashApp to what looks like it should be a business CashApp, but Google yielded no concrete results. He also sent me another large check in the same amount as the first. He hasn’t told me what he wants me to do with it yet. 

So that’s where I am right now, and I tend to overthink everything, but I’m getting all sorts of red flags from this. Am I right to worry? Is this some sort of scam or Ponzi scheme or am I being used to launder money?

What should I do from here? I want to confront him and ask, but I’m not sure how, and if it’s legit, I don’t want to upset him and ruin my chances at landing a decent job.",14Sep2019,1

However, I got caught this week by one of my teammates from the soccer team. I go to college and im on the soccer team. I usually never wear thongs to practice or games. 

However, earlier this week i decided to go shoot the ball around for fun late at night like at 10 pm. it was empty the field and so i decided to wear a thong under my soccer shorts just to see what its like wearing it while playing soccer. I didnt expect to see anyone. As im playing two of my teammates were walking from their dorm towards the field. There was a deli close by and they mustve been headed that way and they saw me and came up to me to say whats up. 

I was so nervous because i was wearing white soccer shorts that were very see through and i had on a bright yellow thong underneath it. So i knew if they would see me from behind they would easily be able to see the thong outline i have on under my shorts. So i panicked and sat down on the grass to act like i was tired and chekcing my phone. They said they wanted to kick the ball with me for a bit and i was like im tried etc. they then said they would wait for me since i said i was done playing and my soccer bag with my wallet was by the goal and in order to get it i would have to walk to it and my friends would see me and notice the thong. so i tried asking them to get it for me but they were like nah stop being lazy. 

So basically i tried sprinting to get it and as i came back they didnt seem to notice until we were walking on the sidewalk and one of my friends went behind me to tie his shoe. he then looked up and noticed the yellow thong under my white shorts and they immediately roasted me and tried getting me to show the thong. they couldnt believe it.

227,"Yesterday my friends and i talked about my boyfriend, and how he never really pays attention to me when i’m there. My friends told me that he told them he’s gonna break up with me, so of course i was sad af. So me and my boyfriend met up yesterday night in a park while my friends were waiting for me somewhere else. I asked my boyfriend why he didn’t break up with me sooner, and that i feel like he’s been lying to me. I was crying and stuttering like a little bitch, i probably sounded like a dumbass, Anyways, He then told me that he only said that he was THINKING about breaking up with me, because i’m moving away in a few weeks. But he never said that he will break up with me, at first i was so damn relieved, But at the end of our conversation he came close to me and whispered “We’ll stay friends though, okay?” and i started crying again and then he hugged me. He didn’t even seem sad or bothered, he just seemed angry and annoyed. While he’s doing fine i’m crying my fucking eyeballs out and it’s lowkey killing me. He was my first boyfriend and i know that this wasn’t going to work out because this is my first time, and nothing really ever lasts forever, i have so much to live for yet i don’t even want to exist anymore. I feel so alone. I’m trying to get over him already but whenever i think about him i just start crying. I want to delete all the pictures i have of him and i want to delete his number but i can’t get myself to do it. A day before the breakup i told my entire family i had a boyfriend. That didn’t age well LMAO

sorry if this is all over the place i just feel so empty and so sad and i know this is a normal thing to go through i just wish i wasn’t so damn affected by this",14Sep2019,1

Last night I was originally going out with my really close female friend and then meeting up with some friends from work. But less than 30 into our night she meets her neice and her boyfriend who are very big personalities and my friends ex boyfriend. So less than an hour into her night he's basically grabbing my friends ass then soon proceeding to making out leaving me to essentially be a 5th wheel. I went home very early for a ""night out"" at like 9:30-10 it really upset me as I originally planned on just meeting up with her because I wanted to hang out with her and chat to her. I have social anxiety and generalised anxiety which she knows too. 

What should I do? 

To clarify in advance I'm not upset she wants a boyfriend I'm just pissed because I wouldn't do this to her, I'm also not upset she wants to date anyone because I'm her as she likes to put ""gay best friend""

251,"Personally, I'm a very extroverted person with many friends, but whenever I get close to someone I end of pushing them away.  I recently had a conversation with one of my ex-closet friend on how our friendship is falling apart. It came down to both of not us not trying hard enough to maintain the friendship and a miscommunication on both of our parts. Unfortunately, in an emotional state I had made a subpost (Ik it was a real dick move) about her and that's how she found out.  

Some information about myself that might help speculate a conclusion. I am the literal definition of a class clown with a creative mind. I don't have a strong, supportive family so I resort to friends, which isn't really the best. I don't think I get enough attention at home and I've suppressed myself in that environment. Only at school can I freely express myself and people just see me as the weird kid at school. I try my best not to get in any drama.

The issue first arose when she had just gotten a boyfriend and I felt like I wasn't getting the attention I was used to getting. At first I was jealous, but I gotten used to it and continued with my life, but overtime we stopped talking. Any future interactions from there on involved plenty of miscommunications, that hurt both of our feelings.

Another reason I might push people away is when the first time I liked a girl I had overcommitted myself to that person. It wasn't a relationship with the person, but I had felt strongly and passionately about that person causing an emotional break down when getting rejected. 

Some of the reasons I have narrowed it down to is...

1)  Family issues? 

2) Relationship in the past where I've overcommitted, then ending poorly

3) Need for attention

Ofc there might be some other factors and would appreciate your own opinion/experiences",14Sep2019,0

256,"Dear Reddit, 

TLDR: rejected house offer from mom, now mom is pissed off and I have no idea what to do.


I don’t really have good relations with my mother since I was young. She has really high expectations of me which I keep failing to meet. One of it is that she wanted me to a doctor, but my grades were not good enough so I ended up doing an engineering course in university. I can name a few more disappointments, but that’s not the type of advice I’m looking for. It affected me as a child and I have always been a weird kid growing up and have not many friends. I mostly keep to myself and have gotten bullied a handful of times.

On the other hand, she really dotes on my younger sister a lot. She’s really pretty when she was young, she was fair skinned and just really, really pretty and adorable. There was always unfair treatments, like my mother would bring her out to malls, while I stay at home and do house chores. My mother’s reason being that she’s young (she’s 6 years younger than me) but to this day, my sister had never once even washed her own plate after a meal. Due to this, my sister and I have been on bad terms, as she views me as the “failure sister”, and I also resented her a little.

My dad is never really in the picture, cause he’s a workaholic. He is a mechanic and he owns a business. He works even on holidays because he wants get as far from the family as possible. This caused my mum to commit adultery, and have other boyfriends on the side. In the beginning, she was hiding the fact that she was cheating, but as time went by (10 years at least), my dad did notice, but he pays her no heed. He still provides for the family though, financially. My mother moved out of the house to the city to stay with her boyfriend and only comes home once a week. She goes on holidays with her boyfriend which she thinks goes unnoticed. 

There are a lot more other unfair treatments from my mom, and negligence on my dad’s part, but the point I’m trying to make here is that I really do not have good relationships with my family.

Fast forward to now, I am 22 (F), and I just graduated from university and am looking for a job. As of now, I am living in a rented place which costs about 930 bucks per month on rental, and 250 on utilities, which I split with a housemate. I’m also giving private lessons, and my student’s house is about 20 minutes away on a good day, and about 40 minutes when it’s rush hour. The apartment is also close to my housemate’s work place. All in all, its a small, but comfortable apartment.

Now, I just received a call from my mother. She has bought a house in the city, and is no longer on bank loans. I have visited the house before about 5 years back, and as far as I could remember it’s 2 floors. My point is, it’s a lot bigger than the tiny apartment I’m living at. She had rented the house to people, and the previous tenant just moved out. 

She now request that I stay in that house while paying her monthly rent of 1000 bucks (She so lovingly included that she charge others 1200-1500, but because she’s my mother, she’s offering it to me for 1000). Utilities not included. She hopes that I can stay there with my housemate, and when my sister enters university, she could come and stay with me too. 

Now, It’s a huge place, meaning I’ll be spending more time on cleaning. God knows that if my sister do come and live with me, she wouldn’t be cleaning the house with me, she would be making it messier, as she’s a slob (her room floor is oily and greasy and there’s hair all over the place. Not to mention she eats snacks on her bed and there’s flavor dust all over. Her duvet smells like sweat). I wouldn’t want my relationship with her to be worsened with us staying together in a house. Not to mention, the house is far from my student’s house and my housemate’s work place. Traveling would be wasting time and tiring as traffic is heavily congested. 

My mum would also want the house to be painted, and had asked me to do it instead of paying professionals. She asks me to ask my friends for help, but my mother has no intention of paying them other than buying them lunch. I feel embarrassed to ask my friends for free labor, so I told her I’ll willingly do it for her. 

I told her I’ll discuss this over with my housemate, and after the discussion, it came to a conclusion that we wouldn’t want to be living there, because firstly, my mother is very controlling, and secondly, we are very much comfortable living here, and moving our things over would have costs a lot more. Not to mention, we’ll be paying more for rent, and we’ll be taking more time to commute back and forth. 

When I told this to my mother, she’s very unhappy. I felt as though I’ve disappointed her yet once again, and I hate myself for it. But I just couldn’t find myself paying for rent that is higher, and is going to consume much more of my time in cleaning, and my housemate and I are both very busy people. My mother told me that if I find cleaning a problem, then there’s a huge problem in my life, and proceed to tell me that I can’t get my shit together in life or something. But the thing is, she hasn’t done a single housework, ever. As far as I could remember growing up, my dad took the role of house cleaning, and then when I was old enough, I took on the role. My mother couldn’t possibly understand the tiredness that comes from cleaning. 

I don’t know what to do, my mother is mad at me, and I don’t think I did anything wrong by rejecting her offer, then why am I feeling like such a failure at this point..?",14Sep2019,1
258,"I work for doctor and he is the kind of person who really emanates the ""good guy"" vibe and the patients love him. However, behind the scenes he can be pretty immature and slightly unethical at times. An example of this is when he told me to put patients who have insurance on a therapy table because that way we get paid for ""doing nothing."" Another example is that he wants to be registered under an old doctor who recently retired so he can be in network with a specific insurance. I'm not too savvy on how all of that works, but I asked the retired doctor if he would be ok with this and he said no. I have worked non stop, and tirelessly with this insurance to get him in network and he keeps thinking there must be something I haven't tried and there ""must be a way."" When I emailed this to the doctor I work for he never responded to me. In fact, he almost never responds to email if it is something that he is emotional about (he's openly said he wears his heart on his sleeve.) This makes it difficult to know what he wants at times because when he is emotional he changes his mind about things and then forgets it later.

The reason why I'm writing this post is because today at work he got snippy with me on how I put two patients in the same room. They were a couple so I put them together. I forgot he doesn't like that because he says it takes him longer. Here is what I think the issue may have been, the couple that I put together was lgbt. When I said I roomed them together he immediately asked why I didn't room another couple together (this couple was non lgbt). I was taken aback by how he snapped at me and why he asked that question at all. The wife of the non lgbt couple changed her mind at the last minute and didn't want to be seen and he knew that so what was the point in asking me that?

Like I said, this doctor comes across as the greatest guy in the world and is your text book christian. His response when people are talking to much and he wants them to go away is ""yep, uh huh, that's great, yeah haha.""

They have a shit reputation and I knew that going in but decided to work with them for a few years: the experience has been stressful and frustrating and I’ve been trying to get out of the relationship little by little. The last step was to retrieve remaining artworks. This has been difficult. I went in to pickup some paintings and asked if the remaining pieces were in the gallery. I was told no. But another artist showed me 6 pieces in the storage closet which I removed. And the assistant showed me 3 more in the office. This assistant had initially lied to me and said they were not there. I was extremely frustrated. This is not the first time I’ve been frustrated. Getting paid for sold work took much longer than it should have, for instance. I returned on another day to pick up more work. I was very angry and upset and texted with the owner and told him to never contact me again, that he could speak with my lawyer. I was so angry I went on Facebook and made a post but took it down a few hours later. I said he had lied to me, that the gallery had lied, but I was not specific. He has a terrible reputation for lying and not paying artists. There is even a website where he has responded to comments that say he is basically a terrible person to work with. Although I had blocked him on FB of course a mutual friend showed him the post. He has written my lawyer that I have smeared him and falsely accused him of lying, that I have damaged the gallery’s reputation. He says he doesn’t want to escalate the situation.

I think I’m probably being very dramatic, but I’m having a hard time with this.  This feels like late to have my first job and I’m worried about it. Right now this feels like such a long time but I don’t know anyone else who’s in a similar situation so I’m wondering is this a ridiculous amount of time or is it fine as I will have a good job at the end of all this?",14Sep2019,1

last night I saw her with a group of mates she literally ignored my existence the entire night I felt pretty excluded tbh then when I left hers she text me saying sorry for being dead tonight - Feel like I’m being strung along and it sucks, She’s always texting this Guy all of a sudden and seems way more interested in her phone then talking to me, What’s honestly the easiest thing to do?

273,"So, 2 years ago, taking place back in July 28, 2017...

A drama started between a friend of mine let’s call him Lee and his friend, don’t wanna mention her name so we’ll call her Cassie.

Unknown what the cause was, but when it happened, Lee was after me over something my boyfriend did, which I was in no way involved with.

I do not wanna give any details of the drama because it’s really painful to think about.

But Lee and his twin brother started posting about me and my boyfriend constantly (negatively) and that resulted in Cassie disliking me.

I looked up to and wanted to be friends with Cassie for a really long time and the fact she disliked me (and one point wanted to get information on me), and told me I have a ton of mental disorders was a painful thing to hear.

I made an apology post on G+ before earlier this year (which she never saw and G+ shutdown so she’ll never see it) and today I’m thinking about actually DM’ing her and apologizing to her on my own now that I’ve matured more.

Any advice on how I should come across her?? This whole situation has haunted me for a long time and I finally wanna make things right.",14Sep2019,2
274,"My wife and I are having our first child in December. We're both hispanic, with a big close family. This has made us have to plan a baby shower requiring banquet hall and extensive planning as we're trying to cut costs in event planner and prepackaged. Needless to say, it's become a little stressful.

That being said, besides family we have a handful of close friends we invited to our party, this including my best friend of 10 plus years. Recently he's been having to resort to doing off jobs here and there to support himself. My wife and I broached him with the idea that he could bartend (has experience and offers up for free every time there's a non formal friends party), surely to make a killing with the kind of tippers in our family. This was presented as a choice, we want him there as our guest first and foremost. He seemed psyched and even began brainstorming specialty cocktails for the event.

A week goes by and he passed by to hang out. We' finally have a set date, and then he brings up that around that weekend we decided on his family might be planning a party for his sister in law and nephews birthday. All speculation from him at that moment. I again brought up that if he felt he couldn't do the bartender gig because it required prep work and time he might not have it's cool. He said he would confirm and let me know in a week's time.

another week goes by and he text me complaining about his brother and how he can't make up his mind on plans for planning the family celebrations. I ask him to elaborate and pretty much came down to he wasn't sure if he had the time to prepare for bartending. His family plans are not concrete and it's all speculation still, but he swears his brother is a last minute planner. I let him know that if he can't bartend it's cool, he can enjoy the party even more now. But he goes on to say that he might be a bit late to our thing because of family plans that aren't even confirmed yet. That is where I began getting a little bothered. I cleared the air and let him know I was sorry if bringing up doing the bartend job rubbed him the wrong way. He was very candid that it did not and was actually appreciative of us looking out for him in that way.

But that being cleared bothered me more. When we broke the news about our pregnancy he literally cried and hugged me. And he knows how much we're working at making this baby shower a fun event for family and close friends. I understand the importance of family and being there, but at this point I'm a bit hurt that he's so willing to dismiss our party for one that isn't actually set. The whole time talking to him it just seemed him being more pressed to accommodate the possible future event rather than committing to the real set in stone one.

Not sure if I'm just being dramatic and overly sensitive, but I feel I have legitimate reason to be let down/upset. I let the conversation alone, but not finished. Not sure if I should let him know it's upset e or just let it pass and not over think it.",14Sep2019,4

279,"Basically what the title says. I (24f) live with two other girls (20 and 24) in a very old house. This house isn’t very well insulated which means sound carries extremely well to all the bedrooms.

When I first moved in we were all employed or at university, and so all had a normal schedule and I was one very well rested human. After 4 weeks 20f decides to drop out of university and since then she is awake at all hours. She is mostly pretty respectful of the fact that our other housemate and myself work from about 8am most days of the week (I work during the week, 24f works weekends) but there have been times where she gets home at 1:30am and proceeds to walk around the house, turn all the lights on and make more noise than a person should at that hour but it’s rare and not bad enough to bring up.

The most annoying thing is when her boyfriend is over. Her boyfriend is almost always at our house which is something that I was warned about before I moved in. This isn’t the issue. The issue is that her boyfriend doesn’t have an acceptable volume level for times when most people would be sleeping. He will come over at 1am and proceed to knock on the door, he tends to fling open doors and he stomps around at all hours. There have been times he comes over at 5:30 in the morning and is whistling until he is reminded other people are in the house.

At one stage 20f mentioned that he wouldn’t be spending as much time here anymore and those two weeks were the most peaceful of my life.  Since then i don’t think there has been one night when I have stayed here that he hasn’t been here, and I’ve started staying at my boyfriends house in nights he is over.

There was one day where I was trying to suggest we have quiet hours between 12:00am and 7am, except as I started to, 20f mentioned that their last housemate had all these ‘rules’ and she was a controlling bitch. I haven’t managed to bring it up again.

Basically, I need advice on how to bring up house rules, and what’s respectful or not. I don’t really know how to phrase it without seeming like I am attacking either one.

TL:DR: my housemate and her boyfriend keep me awake all night and I don’t know how to instate house rules without being a controlling bitch.",14Sep2019,1

Tonight was a friends Important Birthday, so me and husband went and had fun. I sat and listened while another friend ranted about her issues and I tried to help as well as just be there. However, later getting home me and my husband were about to get hot and heavy but somehow I started crying pretty heavily about an accidental bump to my teeth (which actually hurt VERY much) and it was also something i was self conscious about. I kept trying to shower but he kept trying to keep me and talk to me about it being ok to cry, but I just wanted to shower and sleep so that's what I tired to do. 

Somehow, i was trapped under him and he was really trying to comfort me and that's it, he even used my whole name-no one but my mom calls me that- and I couldn't handle it and bit him as hard as I could. 

He was truly just trying to calm me and help, but I was freaking out and kept trying to leave. I felt panic, fear, and concern and I was crying in a corner trying to calm myself while still being worried and hurting because I caused him pain. 

He took our dog for a walk while i showered, and I revealed that I'd had 2 dreams about rape and a weird experience with my brother to him. He went into our closet and cried and moaned and yelled and went for a walk. He's now sleeping, I'm so apprehensive on how to approach this or anything because I want him safe. I've only ever told one counselor in grad school about the dreams and experience. I don't want to think about it because what if it's true? how do I cope with something I can't remember? or what if it's fake, just something my fucked-up brain thought of?? how can I help my husband process and cope with these things as well??

I think my dad has already given in, my mother however remains vocal.

PROS: 
- Afterwards they may trust me more in the future to sleep outside on my own. 
CONS: 
- It could do the opposite by angering them and making them even more strict. 

(TWO) Lie and say that my friend — who they like and trust — is coming with me. 

(This will probably involve getting my friend to fake a text confirming it.)

PROS: 
- Gives me a big advantage, even if it doesn't fully work. 
CONS:
- I lose this chance to assert myself. 
- There are unexpected questions / consequences and I can't keep the lie together.

Lately I’ve noticed he’s been staying late, sending out additional reports and feedback with timestamps as late as 8pm. His reports are super detailed but they definitely go above and beyond the original assignment, but they are technically late. We both have confided that we want to plant ourselves in this company and I think this is his way of getting noticed. 

However I’m not sure if all of this working late is necessary, in fact some of it imo is poor time management and annoys me because by doing the extra analyses or adding a chart/graph his work is technically past due. 
 
However, I have no idea what management thinks about it maybe they love it maybe they don’t so I can’t help but wonder what I could be doing to stand out as well? My projects are always in on time and the latest I’ve stayed is a 6:30 every now and then but it’s very rare and honestly I have a life to get to. I mean I could stay late and do extra stuff that no one asks for and see it as an investment but I really don’t want to, I feel like I’d start to resent work.  I also want to mention we’re hourly so maybe management appreciates that I’m not wracking up time and half to stay late - although I’m not sure if he’s even clocking his hours which who knows if this is the kind of company who turns a blind eye or not.

301,"Hi guys, I have always been a person who tried to not complain and get on with things but I am having a very difficult time and and hoping I can get some good advice on how to deal with it...


So, for pretty much of the majority of my life I have been bullied, betrayed by so called friends so it made me be very cautious about opening up and letting people into my life. When I was 26 I went to university in a different city and met friends who where unlike the previous bullying group before. The (bullying) group of friends I used to associate with were all tough guys, in and out of prison always fighting so you had to be tough to hang with them. I was quite a bit younger and wanted to fit in with them almost probably as a status thing but the odd few truly were good friends. 

Anyway, when I started university I met a new group of friends who were the complete opposite of those people, they are kind, open, understanding and truly some of the most genuine and beautiful people I have ever met. Because of my affiliation with these people I ended up being thrown into a large social network and now I literally have friends all over the country.

Their lifestyle is quite crazy because they like to party and take drugs. Now don’t get me wrong I have been partying for a long time, I’m 29 now and have been taking drugs since I was 16. Nothing crazy like heroin the worst I’ve done is cocaine, but I would say I have been partying consistently since then. I am also a DJ with a residency so that whole partying culture is a huge part of my life.

My problem is that whenever I drink/take drugs, I get horrible paranoia that that is ultimately causing me to be severely depressed, I have thoughts of suicide daily, it’s got so bad that I even when I have break periods from taking drugs I’m still depressed. I have no confidence in myself, I haven’t been intimate with anyone in 3 years because I’m too scared to let anyone in because of how much of a mess I am.

I know I need to get out of this lifestyle to clear my head and my friends are so supportive and understanding, nobody forces me to take drugs. They are constantly worried about me and always text/call to make sure I am okay. My issue is that I want to change but all of my friends who I can’t live without live this lifestyle and I can’t or wouldn’t want to stop them. I have no self control and always end up taking drugs/alcohol because I don’t want to alienate myself and lose them, but my depression/anxiety is going to kill me.

Tdlr: all my friends who I can’t live without party and take drugs but I feel drugs are (or the states I get in/comedowns) are putting me in a crippling depression.

Publicly shouted at, hit on the head, flying files and pens are common here. Plus the nurses’ sneer and backstabbing are the cherry on top. We are expected to bear this as a learning experience to be able to attend emergencies and dire situations. Mistakes are not tolerated. 

I felt like on edge everyday I work. I want to overcome this fear. What should I do to be brave and confident?",14Sep2019,1

307,"This is my first time posting on reddit I’m dyslexic please be gentle 

A little bit of back story 
For the sake of this we’ll call my best friend sally and the boyfriend Fred. 

So sally and Fred have been together for going on 5 years and own a home together and have 2 dogs together. 

Sally is ready to have kids and marriage and Fred is. Then he isn’t. Then he is and so on. 
It’s exhausting for sally as she has a lot of fertility issues and Fred just doesn’t get it. He thinks unprotected sex = baby. 

They constantly argue. Every conversation is an argument. My husband has said many times to them that this is not normal in a relationship. He told them to stop arguing and get the fuck along or we will leave. 

An example. Sally asked Fred to make some gravy while she was cooking dinner and he argued back to the point that my husband had made the gravy and the rest of dinner with out them realising until I had the table set and told them dinner is ready. 

I don’t want her to raise a kid with this environment. Should I tell her how I’m feeling? That I want them to split up. I know that there are other guys out there that she will be so much happier with. I don’t want to feel as though I’m the reason they break up and sally to hate me for it in the future. 
Thanks in advance",14Sep2019,1
308,"This is kind of a drunk post (it’s almost 6am) but I have to get this off my chest. I’m a senior and one of the older bros in my fraternity. We are well-known for our parties and I have countless opportunities to interact with new girls and old ones.

When I crossed into my frat my freshman year, everything was going great up to junior year. I just had the ability to get with plenty of cute girls and even dated one who was so fucking gorgeous but it didn’t work out... (I was unable to get over the fact that she had fucked several of my fraternity brothers before me). 

Ever since I ended that relationship, I’ve had zero luck. I spent almost the entirety of my junior year dry (except for 1 booty call in the middle of the winter break because of desperation). 

Now my senior year has started, and this girl that I’ve been talking to for weeks.... thought about cuffing her and thought she was really feeling me.... until I saw her tonight leaving my house with one of my bros. I don’t blame my bros, but why the hell is this happening to me? Not to be egotistical but imma fairly good looking guy and definitely know how to present myself.",14Sep2019,1
309,"Hi long time no see. 
   If you read my last post on this subreddit. You know my story but i'll retell you my story. I like/liked this girl (we'll call her C) I've liked her for multiple years and don’t know how to tell her. We went to the same and hung out pretty frequently but I can’t tell if she knows if I like her. I haven’t said anything about liking her beside back in 6th (I think she forgot this day)

Updated: Our old school was collapsing very fast so 7/9 kids in my class left (multiple reasons) So me and her happened to go to the same school. We share in the carpool and have to sit in back because we are new to the carpool (“Awesome”). 

The Problem: So my family, friend, and everyone around me knows. My brother goes to this school as well and was sitting with my friends and I with My friend made a gay joke towards me so I went with it for the joke. Then my brother says I don’t think C would like that. So one of the two friends at the table made the connection we knew each other because we talk at the lockers. So the second person says he is gonna ask if me and C are together on Monday 9/16. (Post from 9/13). I don’t know what I’m gonna do I’m silently freaking out.

After I graduated high school in 2017 I went to university and I did well my first semester even with adhd and anxiety. Second semester comes round and I overhear my dad and mum struggling to pay bills whilst he works 80 hour weeks (taxi driver). We live in public housing and my dad still struggles with bills even with that many hours of work due to competition being Uber. I decided to take a break from uni and focus on work as a cashier. My cashier job was good initially until it took me away from my original goal of being successful one day and getting my degree. Management is absolutely disgusting at my place there is constant bullying and threats being made. It’s full of grumpy old ladies talking down on everyone and have had close to 15 employees leave this year alone leaving us with 5 casual employees. Everything is broken at the place, and we are constantly understaffed leaving us stressed out all the time. Customers screaming at us why there isn’t enough workers and my manager screams at us to hurry up, when he’s the one understaffing us what do you expect on Sunday afternoon when everyone is cramming in all their shopping on their day off. I returned last year to uni and failed due to work/uni balance and stress from my job it left me in bed all day after coming home from work. Same thing happened semester starting this year. I’ve lost all motivation in life now and this job has ruined me. I feel like zombie everyday, my dad says not to worry about helping out with bills but I’m worried because he’s not financially stable and I’m a uni student and an adult. Sometimes I need expenses to pay groceries or go out with friends which I haven’t done in months due to university and work. All my hobbies have been thrown out the window. What should I do do you think I should quit now and look for a job or keep looking whilst working there? I’m seeking help with psychologist and I’m on medication due to depression, anxiety and adhd at the moment.

316,"I've been with my boyfriend for just over 6 months. Around the 6 month mark, he went through my phone and saw messages between me and a male friend of 6 years. He got upset and assumed the worst. We talked about things and he decided to trust me. The same argument about my relationship with this Male friend has caused tension twice since. 

Background on my friend's and my relationship. We've worked together for many of the six years we've been friends. We no longer work together and haven't in at least a year. He has admitted previously to me that he has romantic feelings for me, he was in a relationship with children up until recently. I did not reciprocate and he's been respectful of that since then. 

Background on bf. He was cheated on by the mother of his children. She cheated with a man she called a friend. My bf is naturally seeing the similarities between the scenarios and understandably drawing all the same conclusions. 

I'm stuck in an awkward situation where I feel like  I can't talk to someone I consider my only friend without hurting my boyfriend.

 The latest fight was because he saw I deleted messages from my friend. Friend was drunk and sad about the ending of his relationship and said things that I knew would set off bf so I got rid of them. The day after friend drink texted me he told me he was going to be more respectful of bf and my relationship.

I saw on his phone one day that he was messaging not only my exes but  my current sex partners for sex and would pull up to my house or to our plans with my ex’s exes and not tell me who they were but tell them who I am. They all wanted to fight me and I had no idea for years. I was in this friendship (and around those girls) from middle school until mid college.

The thing is, people love him. He’s very popular, always out and about. People HATE me! Not only because of him, but because of the exes and I’m not from this town, let alone state. It stinks having people be scared to associate with you because they think you’re a big fat slutty man-stealer. What makes it worse is that I did steal someone’s man. It was a girl (one of the exes gbf had me around actually) who called me a n**** and was using the guy to buy her stuff and cheat on her other bfs and she was always telling me she’s gonna f*** my bf anyways so I didn’t care too much about how she felt, I was still wrong and as you can tell it didn’t help my rep or peace of mind at all.",14Sep2019,1

Now I’m almost 30, I have a family, and while I still try to hold on to faith and spirituality, I don’t want to have it plastered all over my body. The work itself is beautiful. The artist who did them—who is not only a terrific human being—is one of the best in the state.

326,"Hi all,

So I'm in a tricky situation. I'm applying for a job at this company, the process started end of June/beginning of July since then I've had several interviews. My last interview was on August 5th and immediately after, the next day August 6th, they called me and said they were going to make me a job offer and even asked for some documentation like my ID and the title of my Masters. Before continuing I need to explain that I'm currently living in Spain with a student visa, this company is willing to do the paperwork so I can work here with them. 

After approximately two weeks I emailed the girl from HR that called me, she also was one of the ones to interview me.  I asked if there was an ETA or updates regarding my process and she said that they were validating stuff internally and she hoped to send me the offer as soon as possible. 

Another two weeks went by and I emailed again since I haven't heard anything since. On Tuesday this week, she told me they were still going through the process and she would get back to me as soon as possible.

Is it normal for a company to take this long for cases like mine where they need to check not only what offer to make me but also the legal side of things? I think the job offer will come through because otherwise why keep telling me to wait, but I don't know what could happen.

Meanwhile, I've been applying to other job positions, etc. But I would really like to enter the aforementioned company.

What do you guys think? Has anyone had something similar happen to them before?  Right now I don't know what to do, I think I need to wait for a reply from them whenever that is...",14Sep2019,1
327,"I have been living at my friend's house with his grandad for about 4 months now, and his issues are becoming more and more worrisome by the day.

He grew up with a very abusive mother and has never had a good relationship with her, not even as a small child. When he used to live with her, she'd always blame her personal problems on him, and never sees the fault in any of her actions. His grandad told me that when he was 5, he asked him ""why doesn't mum like me?""

I am certain that her awful parenting is the foundation for all of his issues today. 

He is an insomniac, never getting more than 2 hours sleep a day and sometimes not even sleeping at all. He is severely depressed, constantly reminding me how much of a mission he considers it to simply carry on living. He is convinced that his psyche works differently than a normal person's, and he is also convinced that he is botted out for everything, right down to the silliest detail. If he turns the air con on and it doesn't work properly, it only happened because *he* wanted the air con on. If the air con starts working and doesn't reach his room, the only reason it's not reaching is because it's *his* room. The other day, he took his car to the garage to get his ignition  coils replaced and a couple other things that escape my memory, and the job cost about $1500. Of course, it wasn't that expensive because he owns a Subaru and they had to get special coils imported, no, it was so expensive because it's *his* car. Literally any bad thing that happens to any regular person on a daily basis is taken by him as just another bot that exclusively happens to him. He claims that if someone lived in his body for a week, they'd kill themselves because of how many times he gets inconvenienced. 

He refuses help of most kind. He has been to one therapist who was not a good therapist at all (Literally told him that he needs to ""get into a sleep pattern"" to help his insomnia), and so he has definitively concluded that therapy doesn't work. We both have one-off periods of taking drugs (weed and psychedelics), and it affects us in complete opposites. I take them for a good time, I enjoy the buzz they give me and then I get on with my life. But to him, they are his medicine. His verbatim words to me no less than an hour ago were ""the only thing that can help me is drugs."" The rare occasion where he got help that actually *worked* was when he was prescribed zopiclone for his insomnia. He took 16 pills and almost died.

I am genuinely at a loss as to how he can be helped at this point, but he needs it more than he ever has done. Most people in his life are worried about him.",14Sep2019,3

335,"My rapist was incredibly kind, witty and intelligent before he lured me back to his apartment. He was always talking about how he respected my boundaries and never pushed me to do anything. I should’ve known something was off when he ordered his parents to stay in their room. But I fell for him and didn’t see the red flag. Most of the night is a blur but distinct parts of it haunt me. I remember him slapping my face without asking if it was ok, probably because I told him I liked watching it in porn. I said no but was too shocked to move. He choked and groped me. I was still feeling numb to everything and couldn’t resist him. He slapped my breast and butt and left bruises even when I told him “no”. He then ordered me to masturbate and when I didn’t, he showed me how to do it. I felt so angry that my body enjoyed it even though my mind was telling me to run. He asked me to replicate what he did and he wouldn’t let me go until I “hit the right spot”. I couldn’t find it so he touched me again and yanked me into him. I clawed at his back but he didn’t relent. And the thing is, he knew EXACTLY where to rub. It felt good, biologically and I thought to myself “maybe I actually do like this”. He blindfolded me sometime before this and tried to test me. He said he was leaving to get water and told me to not take off the blindfold. I felt like it was a trap, and it was. He stepped outside and yelled at his parents to get back into the room and immediately re-entered. He laughed and called me a “good girl” for not taking it off. He locked the door and forced me to masturbate, yelling at me if I stopped. He made me give him a handjob. I’m a virgin and didn’t know he had no condom on, since I insisted that he wear one. I figured that his penis felt smooth because of the condom but I felt something trickle onto my hand. I thought it was sweat, and he got up, grabbed some tissue and then came back. I only realised it was cum when the blindfold was taken off and I saw a streak of white across my hand. He basically asked me to touch myself again and he told me he wanted me to cum for him. I didn’t, because I obviously wasn’t sexually aroused by the situation even though I was touching “that spot”. He moved me onto the bed and tried to get me to degrade myself. When I refused to and said that I couldn’t , he pushed me further back on the bed and told me to cum for him, again. It didn’t work and he grabbed a vibrator even though I said I didn’t want it. He put it against my thigh and I lied, saying I couldn’t feel anything. He gave up on that and became increasingly angrier, basically telling me to listen to porn. I did, and could only cum because I pretended he wasn’t there and because I wanted to go home. He didn’t react and I lay there in shock for like 10 minutes. I literally couldn’t even react. He made me feel like the whole thing was my fault and I asked him what else he wanted from me. He tried restraining me but I broke his cuffs. He got scared at that point and left me alone. He still didn’t unlock the door, and I was scared. He just sat there. I don’t know why I apologised for breaking his cuffs, I guess I felt guilty. I felt his anger and basically tried to make small talk with him to reduce the tension in the room. This softened him enough that he let me get dressed and unlocked the door. At one point, he demonstrated the difference between a kill choke and a choke that wouldn’t leave bruises (unfortunately for him, it did). He’d switch from the normal choke to the kill choke (basically pressing hard on my windpipe) when I didn’t give in to him. The last thing he told me was “wow, you’re not submissive.” I know what he did was wrong but why do I still feel so guilty? I can’t seem to connect that the person I fell for was just being nice to manipulate me and I’m always questioning my own memory. Did I ever give him consent? Is that what the gaps in my memory are? Isn’t this my fault for following a guy back home? He broke almost all of the boundaries I set and I still feel guilty reporting him. My parents forced me to lodge a report and I’m always questioning whether I did the right thing. The guilt is literally eating at me, even though it’s not rational. The police and hospital workers keep telling me it was sexual assault and that I did the right thing reporting it, but I still feel so guilty. Any advice?",14Sep2019,2

I now am a bit confused about my present situation and I am asking you all for your advice or opinions. 

I am now back in a relationship after my second divorce.  (Again check my previous relationship post on pro revenge through my profile)
Things seemed to be going good, but now I'm not so sure. 
I'm by myself here in a foreign country with little money and very few words I can speak and with this new woman things are getting along ok. 
But.....

You see, she is massively into physiognomy and claiming to know people as if it was a 100% accurate science. 
She seems to follow Freudian views for many things and it makes her at times sound very pessimistic.....

These things combined make her at times, come across as very offensive in her judgement of people. 
She says it is the Chinese way,  but I feel that firstly,  not all Chinese are this way and secondly,  you choose your own words and actions.

I arm enjoying my time with her until she makes comments that really set me off, such as just before writing this, I was showing her photos of my friends and she said

""I can tell this guy is not nice,  because I'd his nose structure and his ears'

I told her that saying something like that was not nice and she replied with explaining how she can tell this through physiognomy and that I didn't know my friend very well. 
I began to boil and then she topped it off with my poor past judgement of wives (yes I know the irony of being my new partner and pointing this out)

I like her,  but perhaps part of me is just wanting to be loved again... I'm not sure,  I'm here alone in this country for at least another year......

340,"A little background context:
My parents separated when my younger sister (25) and I (27) were in high school. Mum found another partner after about a year who was starting his own business. Business was good in the start, they bought a house together, everything was great. Fast forward to about 6 years ago - Mums partners business isn't going so well, they sell the house to try and cover some costs but inevitably the business needs to be shut down and Mums partner declares bankruptcy.

My sister has been living in a rental with my Mum and her partner for the last few years and I just received a call from Mum excitedly saying she was going halves with my sister in a brand new home that hasn't even been built yet. I didn't ask any specifics but it sounded like they had signed some sort of contract earlier today. It was a complete surprise to me and when I said I didn't even know either of you were looking to buy a house, she replied they just decided this morning. The company they are going through is marketed towards first home buyers in Australia, massive ads about stop wasting money on renting, no deposits etc etc.

342,I have many people in my contact list from my old school and I am constantly asked if I want to party or go for a drink but I don't have any lust and I prefer to do other things in my spare time. Of course I sometimes go outside but I don't like to be in clubs to get to know some new random men or to get drunk senselessly. And that is something they like to do I think. Furthermore they don't share my interests and hobbies. The Problem is that every time I want to cancel they are disappointed. I sometimes have trouble saying no and don't want to hurt anyone. They keep telling me I'm an important person in their life but I see it differently. I always give them advice and listen to them and I like to help too but in the long run its a bit tedious. How can I handle the situation without being too selfish and hurting someones feelings?,14Sep2019,2
343,"So I've had some bad relationships.....(see my post in pro revenge for some more details on that)

Anyway I've climbed out of some dark places and into happiness only to be kicked down again. 
Maybe bad choices,  maybe my actions,  maybe just bad luck. 

I now am a bit confused about my present situation and I am asking you all for your advice or opinions. 

I am now back in a relationship after my second divorce.  (Again check my previous relationship post on pro revenge through my profile)
Things seemed to be going good, but now I'm not so sure. 
I'm by myself here in a foreign country with little money and very few words I can speak and with this new woman things are getting along ok. 
But.....

You see, she is massively into physiognomy and claiming to know people as if it was a 100% accurate science. 
She seems to follow Freudian views for many things and it makes her at times sound very pessimistic.....

These things combined make her at times, come across as very offensive in her judgement of people. 
She says it is the Chinese way,  but I feel that firstly,  not all Chinese are this way and secondly,  you choose your own words and actions.

I arm enjoying my time with her until she makes comments that really set me off, such as just before writing this, I was showing her photos of my friends and she said

""I can tell this guy is not nice,  because I'd his nose structure and his ears'

I told her that saying something like that was not nice and she replied with explaining how she can tell this through physiognomy and that I didn't know my friend very well. 
I began to boil and then she topped it off with my poor past judgement of wives (yes I know the irony of being my new partner and pointing this out)

I like her,  but perhaps part of me is just wanting to be loved again... I'm not sure,  I'm here alone in this country for at least another year......

346,So basically we got raided last night. I opened the door the first time to basically a noise complaint. I told them okay we will turn it down sorry. Then I hear a second knock to which (stupid drunk me) I open. They said they heard glass bottles clacking which can’t be true because we all had plastic bottles. We would never buy alc in glass bottles. Anyways I later realize this was a lie just to get into our dorm. I tried to stay compliant doing damage control. They go through our stuff to sure enough find alcohol bottles (plastic) and other stuff that could be alc in other sorts of bottles. They didn’t touch a thing. I had to dump out all the contents of every bottle and whatever was in it. They took a picture of it all to document and show the hall dean or something like that. Once done we got a big trash can and dumped it into the hall trash chute. He said we were very compliant and he said he doesn’t know what happens next. It’s all fucked.

347,"So I just moved into an off campus apartment a few weeks ago, and my roommate has smoked weed three times. We have our own bedrooms but share a common area. She smokes in the common area. The first time was 3:30 in the morning and the smell was so bad it woke me up. I went out and asked her if she could keep it down with her friends. She said okay and I was still a little shy so that’s all I said. The second time it was late and I went out there and told her I can’t stand the smell and that she needs to take it outside. She said okay and that was it. Last night, I walked in and the apartment reeked of weed. I didn’t see her doing it, but I know she was.

353,"So one of the dudes I live with, call him (M) has had a history of making our female friends feel uncomfortable. We’ve always approached him on it and just kept an eye on the situation and made plans to avoid having him around when our female friends are around. We have a pretty tight group of 7 friends, 8 if you include him... we go to university and live close to each other. So we’ve come to find out that he really crossed the line with one of our female friends, call her (D), at one point a few months ago... she was vulnerable because of a family situation and he claims to have also been, having just recently had his relationship of 4 years broken off. They both tell two different versions of the story. I’ve been avoiding talking about it because it makes her feel very uncomfortable to relive the situation and she suggested we don’t bring it up, so I’ve just treated him kind of normally. Until last night. He brought up the situation when we were out at a bar and it just spiraled. I ended up talking to him about it and I don’t believe a thing he said. I believe he has some serious issues with his behavior around women, but I’m not sure he knows it. I’ve also never really seen it happen. 

My dilemma is that he has adamantly denied what happened and says stuff like he will “forgive me when the truth comes out” and that we’ve “blamed the victim” and treated him unfairly. I don’t believe him but the possibility that he is being truthful is always in the back of my mind. When she talks to him, she seems very normal. I think this is because she wants to avoid talking about it and reliving that night so she just shrugs it off, but that becomes something for him to reference when he says everything is ok. The conversation we had was him using excuse after excuse, talking about how drunk and vulnerable he was, when she was the one who told us she told him no multiple times. The end of the conversation was borderline psychotic, it was 2 in the morning and I told him to leave, but he refused to leave my room, so I had to forcefully push him back to close the door, which seemed to make him aggressive. The whole thing just seems like he thinks he can lie his way out of whatever he did. He sort of admits he did something wrong when you talk to him about it, but he also blames alcohol, his vulnerability, and the close friends/housemates of the woman he took advantage of. So I don’t believe him.

I’m sorry this is so disorganized... I’m rushing off to work now. I’ll leave with the two main questions I need advice on.

354,"Hello. Sorry if there are formatting issues as I am on my phone, and sorry if this turns out long but any help at all is much appreciated!!

Some background information: I am from the UK. My parents are Chinese though so I am also Chinese aswell and can speak Cantonese. I am about to start my 4th and final year of university. I am studying Japanese. My boyfriend of 1 year is Swedish. So we are doing long distance and it has been good so far! We have had barely any problems even though after the first time we met, I had to go away to do my year abroad in Japan while he stayed in Sweden, which I am pretty proud of! I got to visit him in Sweden twice during this year and it went really well. I met his parents whom I love and they love me.

Here is the problem: I don't know what the fuck to do after I graduate. My plan when I chose this degree was to move to Japan afterwards and either become an English teacher or work in a Japanese company. This changed after I met my boyfriend and now all I want to do is close our long distance as soon as possible.

We have talked about the future many times. He is not interested in Japan so moving there together is a no. I am fine with this, as I'm not too crazy about Japan and it was never my real 'dream' to move there.As I really like Sweden, we have talked about me moving there. At first he said that it I can move in with him and I quote, he said ""I don't mind if you don't get a job, you can just stay here and learn Swedish and then find a job afterwards"". He lives in the countryside basically, in a really small village so my job prospects would be like zero. But his house has been owned by his family for generations so all they have to pay are the electricity bills and whatnot, which is really good.

Well I think his heart was in the right place when he told me this but his head was not. Me moving in with him is no longer a good idea because of his social anxiety? Not sure if this is considered that. I just came back from visiting him and he just told me that as soon as I left he realised how much more relaxed he was. It's not me specifically but he just tenses up around people and can never truly relax around people. He told me how he got more easily tired when I was with him, and how when I was at another part of his room away from him and when he was driving, for example, to work alone he felt a lot better. He also said he slept way better without me beside him.He actually told me about this problem of being around people before we became a couple, to which I replied that if he ever wanted space he could just tell me and I would move away. But everytime we were together I didn't notice him being tense and I thought everything was fine. He also said he didn't notice it until I was gone aswell.

So if I were to move in with him I would feel not only guilty that I don't have a job but also guilty that I am making him feel so bad in his own house.

He said he thought about it and that his ideal situation would be if I lived 30 mins - 1 hour away from him. Normally this would be fine. We don't have to be living together just yet. The thing that I am most worried about is if it is even possible to support myself. Since I cannot speak Swedish, and I've studied fucking Japanese, the only job I can see myself getting is a cleaning lady. Which is not a bad job but I don't think I can afford my own place with that job alone?If I were to work various jobs, plus attend Swedish classes, I am not sure if it is worth it to throw away everything and struggle so much. Let's face it, while it is a really beautiful and nice country, I have no real interest in Sweden apart from my boyfriend. I would be doing all this just so I can see him a few times a week. Not to mention that I won't have any friends and will know nobody.

And with brexit going on (fuck brexit btw) my chances of finding a job would probably br even slimmer than it should be. It will probably be even harder to legally move to Sweden.

Ive even looked at Master degree programmes in Univervisities around Sweden but none have caught my eye. When I asked the University closest to my boyfriend they told me they basically have nothing that someone like me can study. I don't know whether to laugh or cry at this. Like am I that useless? Have I dug my grave this deep already?

I'm sorry if I sound dramatic, I just feel really hopeless and am kind of freaking out that we can never be together and that I will never get a good job. And overall I just feel really useless.

So please somebody, what kind of job can someone like me get in Sweden? Someone who knows 2 asian languages and English, which everyone is already super good at in Sweden. Or should I not move to Sweden, take my chances elsewhere and do long distance until god knows when.

Thank you for reading this long ass mess and thank you for any help.",14Sep2019,1

356,"I am trying to make this short as possible:

So 3 months ago i meet this girl (she works with my best friends and they are practically best friends). It’s my birthday and we are out clubbing and i get told by friends 2 weeks before this night she wants to get with me.

We get with each other but don’t back home since she has work very early in the morning but we trade numbers.

Casually talk for next 2 weeks and meet up. On this date we were so comfortable, laughing, non stop talking and talking about good things not the usual boring chit chat.

Go back to hers and it’s first time i’ve been emotionally wanting a girl like this and actually having a connection in the bedroom unlike the one night stands.

We talk afterwards but I move back home for 3 months for the summer. So few days after the date she says she had a good time but doesn’t see it going anywhere especially because I am gone for so long.

Now few days later she’s on holiday and messaged me, since then till even this point we have talked everyday. However through this journey 3 weeks ago I got asked out by a girl, I told her I rather go on a date with her again than this girl - lowkey saying i like her - which to her response was mutual and agreed when we are back we will see where we feel. 

Then 2 weeks later she tells me she has been speaking to a guy but doesn’t want to keep anything hidden.

Cool, we are still up for the date and now speaking more than ever and better so i’m thinking this guy has gone. Then few days later she says they have discussed being exclusive....

Now today is when I meet up for the “so called date” but said she wants to be on the same page as its friends.

But I don’t think I can move on without telling her how I feel and I know she likes me which is what hurts the most. Is it wrong of me to tell her how I feel tonight or not?

By the way the guy she is exclusive with now is back home which is the main reason she didn’t want to continue with me. So I don’t get it, but I just don’t know if it’s wrong or the best thing to do is say the my feelings",14Sep2019,2

A few days ago he came in to visit, mom left to buy some stuff and told us to do some chores while she's gone, it went fine for a while but when i wanted to take a little break he started yelling at me, i told him to stop and wanted to lock myself in my room but he took the key, i told him to go away but than he started pulling on my arm, when i tried to push away he hit me, at this point mom came home but he didn't stop, mom told us to stop fighting, brother started yelling at my mom and at me, later he would come back to my room, yell at me and leave, this reapeted the whole weekend.  
I really don't know what to do, im worried that dad's been beating him, i tried to talk to him about it but he was to angry to hold a conversation.

I work back in the kitchen with two other people. I work with a girl and another boy. The boy is very talkative and has a good personality. The girl and him talk a lot. I will talk and say something when I feel I can add something to the conversation.

However, the boy leaves earlier than us, and when it is just us two it's quiet. I have Social Anxiety and I am a very quiet person in general. I do better with group interactions as opposed to 1 on 1.

I don't really have any hobbies besides YouTube and Reddit. I don't have a whole lot of interests. My coworkers try to get to know me a little bit, and I don't really have anything to say because I don't really do anything. They ask me what are my hobbies, what kind of movies do I like, etc.

359,"Hi all,

I'm often nostalgic from my childhood friendships and was wondering if anybody else is feeling the same. 

Basically i had these two friends in my local school from like 7 to 12 we were always hanging out together. After that i went to a different school than theirs but still in the same neighbourhood and we kept on seeing each other alot although less frequently until we were like 17-18yo. From then my relationship with them naturally and slowly faded away to the point that nowadays (i'm 25 yo) i barely see them once a year, and it happens because we run into each other in our chilhood neighbourhood. They are still very close with each other - best friends i would say - and spend a lot of time together. I never see them and  have updates on their lives only through my parents who get along well with theirs.

So i'm writing this because i often feel nostalgic and dont really know how to react to it. We drifted apart because we evolved in two different directions, have a different way of living and hang out with different types of people. Whenever i see them i feel this gap between us, like we would never become friends if we met today. But at the same time i still feel some deep connection, a connection that has been built for years during the childhood and that you can't get with someone you meet at 25. It makes me happy and sad at the same time, because i'm scared i will never feel this kind of connection anymore. 

I would love to try and rebuild something with them as i know at least one of them kinda feels the same. But everytime i saw them in the last years i felt so different from them. They are kind of in a bubble, they spend a lot of time smoking weed just the two of them or with another guy - pretty cool actually. It's been like this for years as they smoke regurlarly since we were teenagers and not that i don't like smoking (i actually do) they have kinda developed their own little world after all these years of just hanging out and smoking together. They are very nice to me of course but i can't help feeling really external to their world.

Anyone else has experienced a similar situation? I'd be happy to hear how you felt and what you did - if you tried hard to maintain/revive the relation or just let it go into nostalgia.

Thanks all and sorry for the bad grammar or choice of words, i'm not english :)",14Sep2019,2
360,"My fiancee and I are 26 and getting married in November.  While kids aren't on the immediate list of things to do since she's working on her PhD, she does want 1 or 2 eventually.  Her primary reason is because she wants someone around when she's old.  I get it.

But right now, kids are the last thing I want.  I usually can't stand other people's kids and don't get any sort of gushy emotional reaction out of them.  When we're out in public and a baby/toddler starts crying and throwing a temper tantrum, I just think to myself ""Why the hell would I ever put myself through that?""  If we're with friends and one of them has a baby/toddler or is showing pictures, my only thought is ""Glad it isn't mine.""

However, that's still just with other people's kids.  Everyone always says that it's different having your own kid(s).  There's a small part of me that thinks I'd enjoy having a son to play sports and video games with.

The primary reasons that I don't want kids right now are:

1. I'm dreading the baby/toddler stage.  When we got our dog as a 9 week old puppy, I was on the edge of returning her to the breeder.  The time it took to potty train, the whining at night, the constant attention needed...I was going insane.  Playing guitar is one of my top hobbies but I didn't play for like 8 months because I didn't want to get too distracted in case the puppy did need to go out or something.  Once she was completely trained, I was able to get back to my normal life, and now she's 3 and the 2nd most important living being in my life.  I'm sure I'd be this way with a kid, hating the young stage and then liking it better once they become more independent and become a more integrated part of my life rather than a burden.  But it still freaks me out because the puppy stage lasts months...the infant/toddler stage lasts a few *years*.

2. Kids are so freaking expensive.  I'm the type of person that's trying to retire from full-time work as soon as possible.  Research shows that the average amount of money spent raising a kid from birth to 18 is like $230,000.  That's a house.  That's ***years*** off of my career.  That's several trips to the places my fiancee and I want to go.  [The UK, Ireland, Japan, China, Scandinavia, Germany, northern Canada, Alaska, Italy, Switzerland.](https://youtu.be/h_bUcNjmuSk?t=49)

My fiancee knows both of these reasons and understands, but still wants to have at most 2 kids, but I like getting a lot of input on things like these.  So what do you guys think?",14Sep2019,1

We moved out of our shared rental home.  Now that I’m « single » I am seeing someone for less than 6 months... as well as working full time / salary.  I’ve been actively saving.  I have 14 000 saved at this moment and steadily transfer 1000 into savings a month.

364,"Couple of days ago our house air conditioner stopped working. Was still causing power dips and humming, though. Logged into HomeAdvisor. Got names of 3 HVAC contractors.

Contractor A had like 250 reviews and 4.6 stars. Contractor B had like 20 reviews and 5.0 stars. Didn't contact third contractor. 

First guy came out in the morning and met with my 80 year old mother who lives with us, while I was at work. Said compressor was shot and fan was seized, recommended a new unit for $3400, could install it in a few days. Also said our furnace was on its last days and should be replaced (~$7200). Told him I'd call him back.

Talked with wife, who insisted I get a 2nd opinion. Contractor B came out, found a blown capacitor,  replaced it for like $60 and labor. Working now.

My mother paid the ~$130 for the first guy's service call on her credit card (I was going to pay her back for it). Questions:

- Should she try to have the credit card charge reversed for the scammy ""service call"", since we have a working AC unit now to show as proof?

- Either way, how can we best warn others of this first guy? I can only leave a Homeadvisor review of the 2nd guy, since we used him. The first guy has a lot more reviews, but in looking at them now they all look similar and paid for.

Firstly, please allow me to rant about my teacher: dont get me wrong, he is an extremely nice individual but cannot teach, even if his life depended on it. For instance, on logic gates/boolean algebra he literally spent only 10 mins on it and did not even teach programming concepts, not even basic ones. In lieu of that, I was given a very thicc packet of labs. Honestly, it didn't really click with me and I began to struggle. There are 8 labs and all are due next week but I'm struggling in lab 3-4. This had me stressed out so badly that I have had a sharp jab feeling in my abdomen. In addition to college apps and upcoming SAT, I suppose this added more stress.

This is def my fault for not seeking more assistance sooner. I am drafting an email to my teacher in order to resolve this issue.

367,My friend has this bf. She wants to leave him bc of how he texted some random guy about how to play with yourself. He went threw his snap to find all this out. They were flirting and what not. Then he looks again today and he was talking to a different guy about going on a date but never said anything about being in a relationship. My friends bf didn’t not inform him on top of all the other stuff that went on. My friend considered it cheating but is scared to break it off. Should they break up or not?

371,"Okay so I’m having a little trouble making a decision. Back in July I was supposed to be moving in with my mom, from GA to FL. Things popped up postponing me being able to move in. Now it’s still kind of up in the air. When I move to FL the plan is to get a job working with my mom and get into cosmetology school, which is what I really want to do with my career.  And I was really hoping to be able to move in the beginning 2020.

Now the problem is, in the mean time while waiting for my mom to get all her ducks in a row my current boss has promoted me, kind of with no choice. We had our general manager walk out and quit on us, leaving us blindsided. So he told me it’s my time to step up. Seeing how my moving has been to inconsistent, I have not told him. 

He’s opening up a new business and really needs someone to be trained and ready to fully run the store alone by January 2020. Like I said that’s when I planned on leaving. Now he’s training me into this position and getting me ready and I feel guilty because he’s taking the time to train me, gave me a raise, gave me a bonus, and gave me a new phone. 

Even with all the nice things he’s done, being a GM is not my future. So now I guess I’m trying to figure out how to go about this situation. 

I appreciate all the advice and thank you guys ahead of time 💜",14Sep2019,1

373,"I've recently moved into a management-esqe role at work, this role is where I want my career to progress and I find the job very interesting. 

However it's so toxic at my current employer it's hard to cope. A couple examples (none-exhaustive list) are:

*  Team A and Team B work together as different parts of different departments to deliver value adding work to the customer. One of the first things I did when I got the new role was schedule a meeting with my counterpart on Team B saying exactly this ""How can we work better together"", very productive meeting and put a few things into effect. As part of this relationship I found a communication error prior that would cause a problem down the line, I raised it to Team A, who told me to bury it so it blows up in Team B's face.
* A couple people approached me to complain about a process, I ask a few other people their opinion of the process, their manager overhears and chews me out, people shouldn't be telling me these things, they should be telling him (they had, 3 months+ ago, unactioned since). I need to talk to my direct manager to get approval. I speak to my manager, it's a 2 minute convo as it clearly falls under my role and he thinks it's a good idea, dissenter blows up, starts chewing me out again, no my mangers approval isn't good enough when he says yes, he expected him to say no. Next thing I know the dissenter is running the process I designed to solve the original complaints.

I know this might just be some of the games of management, but it hurts to be part of it, the back stabbing and scheming, all within the same company, where we should be working together to deliver value!

I want to leave. But this role is a big part of my career plan, if I leave with &lt;6 months experience it might take me a couple years to get back to this point at another company, I keep telling myself if I can last 12-18 months in the role I can move to another company at the same level. But recently I've come home and had to have a couple beers to relax after such a bad day, something I hate having only drank socially before. I've tried not drinking, but that just leaves me up all night twisted and hating work...

I have no idea how to proceed, I can move companies, move backwards in my career, or I can stay in a hellhole where integrity and values and treated like some hideous disease.

374,"Some behind. First of all i have autism, anxiety, mild depression and ADD, and in Iceland (where i live) we have to learn danish (it’s because they used to own iceland so now it is law) and i have been fine with it, until recently. So i got a new (well technically old) teacher to teach us danish. The problem is she does not bother asking me why i do stuff (for clarification i from time to time watch youtube or something to calm myself down if i am angry or sad for some reason) and usually she yells at me and takes my school ipad away (the school distriputes ipads to 7th to 10th grade). And i usually can’t take it and take my ipad back and skip school the rest of the day. In my most recent danish class with her i called her the devil and ran away crying and i got to go to a new classroom to take danish in. But then something else happened. I went into the classroom ad saw a bunch of my classmates in there (for clarification we are split into classes and groups. The classmates meet at the beginning of school and for things like PE, swimming lessons and stuff like that while the groups go to classes together) and i got anxious and went away because the class hadn’t began yet so i waited until it did, but they still hadn’t left. So i went into the room and started staring at a poster because i didn’t know what to do and decided to wait until the teacher would acknolage me or start a conversation with me. I waited for like 10 minutes and all of my classmates were gone but the teacher didn’t start a conversation with me. I started panicing and realised that whatever would happen it would be extremely akward and so i just left the classroom quickly. So here is where i need advice. I don’t know what i should do because i need to go to danish class but it would be weird to find a third classroom to learn danish but it would also be weird to go into the classroom where i just stared at a poster and would have to explain why so please good people of reddit.

I have lived my whole life in T, except for the summer, when I usually go visit my relatives in S. Yes, I speak both languages. The problem is that my parents have started a divorce, and two years into the divorce, I have been diagnosed with Hogkin Linfoma, a type of cancer. My mother went to S to live with her new partner, and is trying to convince me to go with her after I am done with cancer and school. The problem is, I have a very bad relationship with my sister (who lives with me in T) and the relationship with my parents feels fake, as of late. Also, in order to go to S I would need to change lifestyle and to leave behind friends,dad and sister, who I still kind of love. I am not enjoying my life in T, because I am effectively doing nothing, living like a parasite. At the same time I don't feel confident about going to live in a totally different country with my mother and a stranger.

377,"My girlfriend and I moved into a new apartment 4 months ago. As we were moving our stuff in, I noticed in the window of the office building next door, a guy that looked suspiciously familiar. 

15 years earlier I had a job selling women’s shoes at Nordstrom. I was in college, and it was a fun job working with a lot of other young people, many of whom I am still friends with. One of my coworkers/friends was living with his mom and decided it was time to move out. I offered for him to come live at my house with my other roommates. Everything was cool for awhile, but then we started noticing he wasn’t around as much and his personality was changing. I didn’t think much of it. I graduated college and ended up going on a backpacking trip with my brother for a month in Europe. When I returned from the trip, I found a couple of thousand dollars worth of my personal belongings missing, as well as a few credit cards. A lot of the stuff missing was Nordstrom shoes and clothing that I had purchased while working there, because they have a strict dress code in some departments. 

I soon came to find out that my friend/roommate/coworker had developed a cocaine habit, was fired from his job, and moved out of our house without telling anybody. I quickly came to the conclusion that he had taken my belongings with him and returned them to Nordstrom for money, since they will let you return anything. I found out he was back living with his mom, so I went to confront him in the most mature way I could think of without getting into a physical altercation. Of course he denied everything, but I told him he was basically a piece of shit and if I saw him again things would not go well for him. 

Fast forward 15 years. I let my dog out of our new apartment to go pee and this dude pops his head out his office window and says, “Oh cool dog, what kind is he?”

As soon as I heard his stupid voice I knew it was him. Keep in mind I had almost completely erased him from my memory along with the aggravation, betrayal, and financial loss I had incurred as a result of this douchebag. Realizing he didn’t recognize me, I tried to let the situation play itself out. After a couple of months of frustration of having to see him every day and listen to his typical slimy sales calls from my kitchen window, it was time to figure out how to proceed. I was drunk one night and asked for advice about the situation on Facebook. It was a mixed bag, from beat the shit out of him to forgive and forget bullshit. 

A couple of days after my FB post I was working on some furniture in the grass area of the courtyard that my apartment complex shares with the office building. He must’ve got wind of my FB post from a mutual friend we apparently have, because he came up behind me and said, “Hey man, I didn’t recognize you until somebody told me, but I owe you a really big apology. Hopefully you can chalk it up to being young and dumb.” Then he went on and on about how he ended up in jail for a few days (not because of what he did to me) and his life went to shit. However, now he found Jesus and has a good job and everything is great for him. I didn’t say much other then, I figured you more or less still weren’t in a bad place, or a “thieving cokehead”. 

His “apology” only seemed to piss me off more, for four reasons:

1. He never used my name.
2. He never actually acknowledged what he was apologizing for.
3. If Jesus changed his life, then maybe Jesus should have told him to find me in the last 15 years and attempt to make things right. If the universe hadn’t of placed us in the same vicinity again after 15 years I would have ever heard his “heartfelt apology”. 
4. Now because he apologized he thinks we are buddies again. 

I could’ve of let this all go and dealt with having to see him in his work environment for a few hours a day, but there is a new wrinkle in the story. My friend who lives in the apartment below me and who also happens to work next door in the same office building as “thieving cokehead”, has informed me that he is going to have him move into his extra room in his apartment, because he needs the money. He is doing this even though I have given him a detailed history of the guy, like I have here, and there are thousands of people in our city that he could choose to have move in. Not only that, but we have had multiple conversations wherein he tells me from working around him, he doesn’t like or trust the guy either, and thinks he is only out for himself.  What the fuck!? 

If you have made it this far in the story, then I’m sure you could give me some sound advice on the situation, or at least tell me, what would you do?",14Sep2019,1

I think the part that is bothering me is that:

1)he paid for it.  And I would still have a problem with him paying for it if it was a ciswoman.  But I also understand why people pay for sex and he explained this was a difficult point in his life. 

2) it happened another time (that he didn’t pay for).  The part that’s bothering me about that is wondering if it’s something he likes and will I measure up/be enough.  He has assured me that he was exploring his sexuality which I completely understand.  He was also extremely reassuring that he was with me for a reason and not with anyone else.  Which is comforting, but it’s still hard not to have those thoughts.  

I feel like I should ask questions but at the same time I don’t think knowing the specifics will make me feel any better.

Has anyone been in a situation like this where a) you found out your partner paid for sex or b) they were with someone trans and you had feelings of being inadequate?

My bf was with someone trans (once he paid for it and once he didn’t) and I am struggling with feeling inadequate and the thought of him paying for sex.

394,"***I've been operating with a severe lack of sleep the past several days... weeks, so if something doesn't make sense or the grammar is off...***

&gt; SUMMARY...  
&gt; 11yo daughter has generalized anxiety disorder, expressed suicidal thoughts in Jan, things improved with therapy and lots and lots of talking.  School started back, things have gone sideways.  Very bad divisions being made by her at school + mention of self-harm, stating she doesn't want to live... but doesn't want to die.  In normal, non-school, situations she seems like a normal kid.  She is making plans for near future... but when stress hits, it is like a switch.  
&gt;  
&gt; Right now my dilemma is I originally had the school of thought that all this asking her if she's okay, keeping an eye on her every move, and all that is indirectly driving her mad.  I've been in a low point, heck right now I am (out of a job.. ) and people trying to help and asking about the job situation drives me nuts, I just want a f'n break from decision making.  That said, I may be applying that observation to her.  Also, those of the family (mother and grandmother) who are the primary sources of the safety plan(s) and methodical questioning are also the people she complains the most about and has a difficult relationship with.  
&gt;  
&gt; But things have escalated and I'm trapped between the decision of informing her school therapist (it is a medical group that is positioned at the school), but I know that most likely result is her being taken to a facility, but I feel that will destroy any hope she may have left.  Alternatively, I say nothing and then I am wrong about the situation and.... I don't even want to say it.  
&gt; 
&gt; Right now she's been stable and happy... we're working on art projects, but school is going to suck for her this week.  She's lost most of her friends over an incident that got everyone suspended and her birthday is next weekend.  All the parents will not allow their kids to stay over as originally planned.  I believe it has the potential to push her far enough.
&gt;   
&gt; It's just my logic is everyone else is trying to secure her ""now"".  But I have enough experience to know that suicide often comes unexpectedly and after you think the storm has passed.  
  
That said, additional facts below.  I am just looking for opinions or thoughts.  Not anyone to make the decision for me.  My mental state seems fractured and I no longer trust my logic vs my gut.  I say ""my decision"" as everyone seems to expect it of me and well... the other decision maker hasn't even checked on her in 8 days.


# FACTS / Narrative

**Backstory?**
- Divorced father.  Have two daughters that I get every weekend and any extra possible.
- Jan 2019, 11yo daughter expressed thoughts of suicide
- We were advised to send her to a facility/hospital specifically for this type of thing
- I was on the road for work, couldn't eval or research - went with advice
- **It was a mistake** and I think caused more harm than good.
- Things had seemed to improve though.  I made sure that each weekend we'd talk for a few hours regardless of topic - just letting her ask questions and I'd give an honest response.
- Summer seem okay, but I had been working extra overtime starting April.
- Quit Job as I was going months without a day off and as a weekend parent... 
- Feel that I was not able to provide enough positive ""momentum"" past few months (no vaca, etc)

**Current:**
- School starts, her anxiety ramps up and there is mention from her therapist that she says _she wants to disappear_, which I get as I kinda want to drop of the grid.
- I discover ""draft suicide notes"" which address all the main people. Not much for her mother (3 lines, which I will get to)
- I had taught her to find a way to get the negativity out... express it.  I do it in the form of art or writing, so I got her to right and say the things she wanted to say.  Such as her teacher making her mad or how a certain subject sucks.  
- I also realize that those papers had been there for three weeks, I just never pick up he stuff to read... just clear around it.
- Call her and ask about it, she tells me it was just trying to get those thoughts out and that it made her think about good things.  
- I go along with it, but spent the next week barely sleeping and wondering if I should tell the therapist or others (afraid they might over react) 
- She seems fine, but then things go sideways with her friends and strange behavior.
- Find out she's been talking to some 19yo guy on an app.  Her mom has the thing to authorize apps and was supposedly monitoring (I know Apple made changes that effected Parental Control Apps)
- Spend a whole week with a friend/detective doing forensics (my background and previously in L.E.)
- Don't find anything from her side, but he was grooming... issue dealt with.
- Following week, another call - she took pills to school and was giving them out.  
- Was only an antibiotic, but she didn't know that and IT IS NOT GOOD. 
- Out of school suspension and has been with me this whole week as I am out of work right now.

**Other**
- My initial thoughts were to home-school.  Get her away from the majority of the friction, let her get a year to learn (catch back up) and return with more confidence or perhaps another school.  I lack the income though.  
- I am also considering not allowing her to return to school this week and trying to get a second opinion if possible.  *I'd have to inform the school / therapist and again... back fear of a forced decision.

396,"TL:DR I didn't get any female attention from other women till recently when i proposed to the love of my life , why ?  


It all started when i was back in high , your usual average looking 6'2"" dark hair brown eyes, average build , i was trying to make contact with the oposite sex and mostly ended up some form of ''school friendship'' or just staright up ignored , wasn't even in a relationship with anyone so i ended up being the relationship coach, not a single girl gave me a second look in restaurants , library , coffee shops....etc   


Fast forward till recently , i put a ring on the love of my life , proper job , proper house , proper car , i couldn't ask for anything more than this , i'd kill for her , she's my everything for many reasons , suddenly i'm a chick magnet , not only i got a number slip from that waitress i've been eyeing when i wasn't in a relationship , now women approach me constantly and compliment me out of nowhere especially at work , keep in mind i haven't done anything special to my physique or my face or anything , even my buddies mock me sometimes for remaining the highschool me...

Throughout my life I’ve just always been average at everything, I’ve never struggled with grades but they haven’t ever been great either. I’ve tried a lot of sports but I always find a reason to not go and eventually quit. I’ve also been at two different instruments but I end up never practicing and then just quitting my lessons altogether. What made me really worried was when I recently decided to start writing, I decided to write a mere 200 words every day which would only take me a couple of minutes, that lasted less than a week. I am at the point were I’d rather sit and look at a wall than actually do anything productive and it worries me quite a lot. I just wish there was some magic way to motivate myself but I realize that there really isn’t. I have tried forcing myself to do stuff so many times but I just never seem to be able to stick with something no matter how hard I try. Does anyone here have any idea how to stop being lazy? Does it have to do with my mindset or is it simply a type of personality that can’t be changed? Do other people also struggle with this seemingly dumb problem?

My roommates decide to leave at the end of the lease term and I decided to take over it. When they left, they said they had initially each put down 593 towards the deposit (1780 in total) which they wanted back. I am still in the search for people to replace them and in the meantime they told me I could pay them and charge the new people moving in. I made the mistake of giving one of them their cut of the deposit because I later found there were damages to the property (134 dlls). When I told em they had to pay for those damages, they said I could just pay them from the extra 593 I was getting in a year from the guy whose sublease I took over’s cut (the guy left the US and we haven’t heard from him since). I still owe one of them their cut of the deposit which I was going to deduct the damages from his cut.

I want to seem more impressive then I really am because I’m insecure.

I’d like to prove that I’m worth something more than I really am. And now, it’s eating me alive because nobody that I’m friends with know who I really am. All I know is they need to hear the truth from me, so that I can regain their trust and not completely destroy precious friendships that I’ve worked so hard on.    

Some lies that I've told, to give context on what I usually lie about:

1. I know how to ride a motorcycle

2. I know how to drive stick

3. I have a screw in my ankle

4. I have friends that I still speak to at home

These lies are generally unimportant and told in passing, and aren't so easily disproven due to my current situation, whether it be where I live or what they can notice.

I realize part of growing up is to deal with your mistakes and accept them as things that happened. You can’t change the past; you just have to deal with the consequences of the mistakes you made. I feel like I’m in grade school again, lying about how wealthy my parents are. I’ve been lying since I was a kid, and I’ve gotten good at it. Now I need to learn how to tell the truth.

418,"This is the most embarrassing thing I'm ever going to post, hence the throwaway, but I wouldn't be doing it if I wasn't desperate. I never learnt how to wipe my butt after pooping, and I'm embarrassed about the future and people finding out.

My parents are Pakistani immigrants living in the UK, I was born here and have lived here my entire life. In Pakistan it seems the way they wash away poopedyschmoopedy is by pouring water on it from a jug with the right hand and using the left to wipe it off. That's the way my parents were taught to clean themselves and that's the way my siblings and I were taught. Don't get me wrong I thoroughly wash my hands afterwards with handwash, but that doesn't take away the fact that I feel gross. 

I know how to wipe away pee with toilet paper, but I just don't understand how people wipe poop with toilet paper. It doesn't come off. It's itchy. Its gross. It gets everywhere. And now I'm worried and embarrassed because I'm scared of going on school trips or other outings where I may have to use a bathroom for a number two and not being a able to wipe off the shit properly. 

Anytime I've been unable to hold it and had to use a loo for the a poopdoop, I've tried wiping but the poop doesn't all go and my butts been itchy and I feel disgusting. I can't concentrate properly for the rest of the day because I constantly remind myself how much of a piece of shit I am for not being able to clean it off and generally, for not being a normal British person.

So here's my question: how the fuck do you wipe your bloody ass after taking a fucking shit?

I need to know everything a normal person would do like how much toilet paper a normal person uses, how do you wipe it off, is it supposed to be itchy, what happens long-term, everything that is important in deeming whether or not I am an acceptable person in society.

Also, if you are grossed out, I am really sorry. I am ashamed with myself honestly. Its not the sort of thing people want to hear. However, I'm desperate and want the disgustingness to end. Its not nice.

Additionally im not saying that's how every Pakistani person does it, you don't need to judge them. I've been to Pakistan before and in airports there, they used water to clean. There is toilet paper as well, but there is also this hose thing with a spray that you wash your poop with. The spray is enough, you don't need to use your hands, so its not really disgusting, but the at home way people clean can seem so. Most Pakistani immigrants probably have more braincells than me and were able to work it out themselves, but I am stupid and haven't worked it out.

Actually this whole post is stupid. Fuck. I'm a dummy dumb. I'm not big brain. I'm a stupidy poopidy. Yuck.

427,"Art has always been my passion. It's always been my number one, my go-to, my fall-back, my everything.

In high school, I swore up and down that I was always going to be an artist. But it wasn't until I reached college that the dream I had began to change. The reality of it all started setting in.

The constant projects I had year after year wearing me out and art looked like more of a chore and less like something I enjoyed.

Eventually, I reached a crisis point during my mid-year in college, and decided to switch over to English/Creative Writing. And boy let me tell you, I fell in love.

Things flowed easier. I had such a kick out of figuring things out with words, phrases, etc.

It now all made sense why I loved proofreading other people's papers in high school.

It all made sense why I loved reading stories and coming up with different scenarios in my head.

Writing just came easier. It was more exciting to me to be staring at a blank page of college-ruled paper versus a blank canvas.

But during my whole time in my English degree, I felt a tinge of jealousy by leaving behind the very thing I swore I'd never give up. And that jealousy? It started to eat at me.

Eventually, I felt terrible for giving up the thing I started, so on a whim and idyllic move, I switched back to my art degree with dreams of owning my own studio, being an artist, and working at a design agency.

Now, as a soon-to-be graduating art major, I feel like I'm in a major pickle. And honestly, I'm pretty certain I'm in denial.

With my parents droning on me to get a job out of college, I feel pressured to chose something, and it's either design or copywriting/technical writing.

When I think about design? I feel conflicted. I've always loved designs. I'd buy things purely because I adored the aesthetic of them. Find a cool poster? I'll buy it. Come across a neat label for a honey company on a mason jar? Give me twenty. One of my favorite artists has a cool album cover? You know I'm getting it.

Because of my love for designs, I thought graphic design would be a surefire way to keep the things I loved about art and find a career. But every time I go to Adobe Illustrator, or try to sketch out ideas, I find myself dreading every waking moment of it.

In my mind, I see myself as some creative artist making these cool labels for companies, etc. - but when it comes to actually doing the work, I absolutely hate it. And honestly? That really upsets me. 

Now when I think about writing? I love it. Staring at a blank Google Doc screen is exciting to me. It's easy to work with. I don't have to spend hours drawing something out. I can simply throw word vomit onto a page and work from there. It just comes so much easier than design.

I get an insane amount of confidence after writing a good story, paragraph, article, tagline, whatever.

But I can't help but feeling this major pit in my stomach every time I do it.

I can't help but feel like I'm doing a disservice to myself by not doing something visually artistic in my job.

I can't help but realize that I'm in major denial about what's going on.

Why is it so difficult letting go of art when it's obvious that's probably not the career path for me?

I am currently studying marine engineering in college and about to start my cadetship with the British merchant navy as of next year, now this is a great career path that I could potentially be making a lot of money in and would see the whole world.

My problem is I don’t know if I want to do it. I don’t know how I feel about being away from friends and family and my girlfriend for 4 months at a time, it feels unfair on them and I don’t want to miss out on experiences at home or miss them all too much. 

I could use the qualifications I receive from this course to move onto another field of engineering and stay on shore and live a normal life, but I’m not sure if this is a stupid decision and I am just not 100% sure on whether or not this is what I want to do with my life. I have a lack of qualifications due to not trying very hard in school and this has set me back a bit in what other stuff I would be able to do and everything that seems interesting to me I just don’t have the entry requirements for them just now.

I let both cats outside periodically by the owners wishes, but I let one cat out more than the other because he’s easier to get back in side. I’m guessing that was my thought when I let him out, but eventually forgot. I could have sworn I had let both cats in by 5:00 pm and so I went ahead and locked the door. I made dinner watched tv and went to bed.  I never heard the cat by the door and I didn’t see it running around the house before I went to sleep (but this isn’t unusual they are more reclusive). This morning when I got up to do my chores I didn’t see the cat and when I opened the door (hoping the cat wasn’t out there and instead tucked away safely inside, but just to make sure) there it was just sitting by the door, perfectly safe and In good condition. 

I feel absolutely terrible and guilty (definitely cried). What if it had disappeared, gotten eaten, or ran over. I’m unsure whether or not to call and tell the owners what happened since he’s perfectly fine now.

Another issue with this is i live very, very far out from town and my parents can't take me anywhere (dad leaves 5am-6:30pm, mom leaves 7am-7pm, however are almost always busy with something and usually don't take me anywhere) so i'm worried i won't be able to spend time with them

Idk i guess this thread is just overall asking if the first paragraph is normal and advice on what to do to make sure i'm not a bad boyfriend lmao",14Sep2019,1

435,"I currently have an iPhone 6s. It works great but I realised I need a something that I can utilise better for my studies. I need a bigger screen and better usability with pdfs and notes. I have two options. Keep the 6s and buy a tablet (preferably at least an used iPad mini 4, mainly for its build quality and the fact that it will serve me for at least the end of my studies without problems). Or I ditch the iPhone and buy a second hand galaxy note 8 for its large screen and S pen. What do you think would be the best choice? 

Ps.: android tablets are out of the question, because the cheap ones won’t last me for 3+ years and the usable ones are just way to expensive for me rn (used aren’t an option either because they don’t have the same longevity as apple devices do)",14Sep2019,1
436,"Hello, I am 18 and I just graduated high school back in May. I did the FASFA online last November, the last thing was my parent's signature. I printed out a paper copy to mail, but I haven't gotten a ride to the post office to buy stamps or an envelope to mail the paper copy. I was planning on going to community college for the first 2 years then switching over to my state's university. But I missed the deadlines for mailing, the placement testing, which was all back in August. I would have to reapply to college for the spring semester. In the mean time I've been been seeking employment but some jobs have already turned me down. I haven't worked or been employed before and it's hard to find a job that's not at a fast food restaurant. I live with my mom and she's the only one working to pay the bills and utilities. 

 I don't have any forms of federal identification because my mom lost my documents at my grandmas house. My certificate, SS card, passport were lost. I still carry around my high school id from my last year, even though it's not valid anymore. A couple months back my stepmother helped me get a new SS card and It's already my 4th copy. I have a negative balance on my bank card too. 

Theres not much to do besides being inside all day in PJ's watching television, being on the internet, or reading books (which is not the lifestyle I want to carry). I don't know how to drive a car and I haven't gotten a drivers license, or a car of my own. I don't have any form of transportation. Besides walking or asking my parents or my older brother for rides to places. I've been trying to get on the public bus, but I don't have money for at least 1 months ride. I've asked both of my parents and my older brother if they could help me or teach me. But they get dismissive and tell me to do it myself or to figure it out myself. When I ask for rides to places, they don't want to and they'll say well go ask the other parent. Like last week I asked my mom for a ride to the library and she started talking about her personal life and her struggles growing up, then she kept mentioning my dad and to ask him because he ""doesn't do anything for me."" 

I'm not sure if this is allowed, but I was wondering what I could do because I'm lost?",14Sep2019,2
437,"I was online dating this guy for a few months, and I essentially let things get out of hand. Initially things were alright but gradually I found it more difficult to deal with him as he got very emotional and would start fights with me, the motive being to get me to 'prove my love'. He would talk about suicidal thoughts and his personal life and he tried to get help/went to a hospital a couple of times, once for a suicide attempt. A month or about 3 weeks ago I broke up with him because he'd turn against me and it made me pretty stressed and I felt like I couldn't trust him. Sometimes I'd get frustrated with him because he'd refuse help or only want me to help him by meeting up with him or some other such thing. I lost feeling for him completely over those few months, and I told him so when I broke up with him, saying he'd brought a lot of extra stress into my life and we didn't want the same things/the relationship was just difficult. I didn't block him because he always said if it didn't work out we'd still be friends and he never really threatened me with anything even if the relationship was strange or he acted out and said mean things. But in the past week he's messaged me talking about how he's going to kill himself if he can't be with me, because of his love for me or something. I'm not even sure what to believe, I've tried telling his friend who hasn't replied to me and as we live in different countries I wouldn't be sure what authority to call or if he's even telling the truth. It's gotten pretty serious and I know he's capable of attempting. He's said I've led him on to believe there's hope, but in my own estimation that isn't the case. I've told him that at least living gives the opportunity of good, even if it's painful. I feel like the solution is to block him but I can't help but feel a personal responsibility as a human to help but everything I do and the attention I give it by engaging seems to make it worse as 'he only wants me'. I've tried to explain to him that that isn't a fair thing to expect of someone and that I feel he's abusing his position, but I'm not sure what to do next, as he's still persisting. Will blocking him lead to him killing himself, would calling some kind of authority even achieve anything? Sorry for how disorganised and long this is, I'm really not sure what to do at this point, whether this is abusive behaviour, or whether there's even truth behind it.",14Sep2019,2

440,"I am embarrassingly old for this to still be a problem.  I'm 26 and, until I finish my education in a couple of years (had a few missteps along the way) I will be living with my parents and sibling at home.  I need advice on how to confront my father over his behaviour.

He's one of the most negative people I know.  He'll complain that the house is dirty, but he just sits in front of the TV all day.  He's not feeble - he loves doing yard work and doesn't let the weather stop him from building something or taking care of some sort of fixture outside.  If we make progress when we clean, he ignores it and focuses on the things we - and HE - have not done yet.  He'll complain the basement has clothes and things we never use, but he won't raise a finger to get rid of them.  He'll complain that the room we're using for storage is dirty, but he has borderline hoarding tendencies and never throws anything away himself.  He's the sort of person who seems to think he's entitled to things being a certain way, but since that's the way ""it's supposed to be"", he won't help out.   ""It's not *my* X, why should *I* clean it?"" is something I hear all the time from him.  He's gone so far as to suggest that one of us (we're all working except for him, he's retired) stay home from work (costing whichever one of us over 150 dollars) to clean, despite us having scheduled days off that we can do this.  I have straight up told him ""well let's clean now.  I don't work today, so we can get this done in an afternoon.""  And he'll just tell me that he doesn't feel like it, or that he wants to make a list of things to throw away before he does anything, and that's the very last time I'll hear about it (until he complains that the house is dirty again).

He'll complain we just go about our business in our little isolated corners of the house, but he resists any attempt made to spend time together.  ""I don't feel like it.""  ""I'm too tired right now."" to the point where I've just given up and stopped trying; I think the most time I spend with him on an average day is if I watch TV with him in the morning while we drink our coffee, but most of the time he'll get up after 10 or 15 minutes and go do something else.  He will insist on driving me somewhere I need to go (we have one car, and so one person taking it so that it can sit in a parking lot for 8 hours is not a good idea) but then complain that he feels like a taxi service.  I pay for gas in these situations, but if I forget a payment he won't say A SINGLE THING about it (I *know* he realizes I forgot at the time I miss a payment) until he feels like complaining that I can't even keep my payments straight.  His entire attitude from my childhood up until now is ""it's okay until it isn't"".  He'll act like something I'm doing is fine.  He might even participate or encourage it.  But a few weeks later, out of the blue, he'll start to complain about it as if he always hated it but could only bring it up now, and it completely pulls the rug out from under me every single time.  I have *trust issues* because of this man.

My family decided to try and get a dog today, and they haven't told him.  I know he's going to be so angry about it and he'll rant and rave about why we shouldn't have one, how we (allegedly) can't take care of one (we can afford food and toys and we have the time to play with it and walk it), and how the house is messy, and he's going to be absolutely miserable for 2 solid weeks.  I heard him muttering this morning that ""maybe I'll move"" if we came home with a dog.

***He's not abusive.  He doesn't yell at us, and he's never hit anyone.***  But I just don't enjoy spending time with him.

How do I confront him over his behaviour?  He's clearly miserable, and nobody in this house appreciates his behaviour.  We try to fix things he doesn't like, but he either resists the attempts or complains that it's not enough after we've tried fixing it.  You have no idea how difficult it is to stay motivated to keep the house clean when all you hear is someone verbally smacking you and your efforts down.  I don't leave my room if I can help it because that means talking to him.  I don't even mention to him that I'm feeling ill because he'll somehow link that to something that I'm doing; ""maybe if you didn't X, you wouldn't feel that way.""  Discussion with him just riles him up, and it's easier to either ignore what he says or *do* what he says.

I'm sorry that this is more rant-like in nature, but I've been bottling that up for years.  I really do need advice on how to proceed.  I don't want to explode at him, but I feel like it's inevitable.  My family (minus my dad and I) are out right now looking to bring a dog back home, and I'm sitting here in front of my computer, heart hammering and a stress headache forming, and my hands are shaking.  I'm pretty sure this is what a panic attack feels like.  I'm terrified of how my dad will react when they get home.

444,"  So I know the title sounds like almost every significant other but last night after a small disagreement with my girlfriend she broke down and told me she hasn’t felt like her self in a while.  
  We’ve been dating for 4 years and she’s never really been one to open up or cry about anything but she started telling me how she doesn’t feel like her self and like she’s missing something in life. She’s 26 I’m 28 and she’s a college grad with a good medical job so it’s like she’s a failure. 
  She said some of the reasons she’s sad is the recent deaths of her grandparents this past year 6 months apart, her aunts death from cancer and her shitty relationship with her mom who never shows any affection to her at all. Her mom is constantly nagging about every single thing and also her sister was outed from their house because she came out as bi. 
Now with the anger she said she doesn’t know where that comes from but she gets mad about every single lil thing
examples: someone breathing loud, taking too long to put a cap on something, dropping a straw. Just minimal things that most people would blow off 

So with all that I asked where do i stand on this she said she doesn’t know and sometimes she feels confused so now I’m upset haha 
She said she never really knows if she wants to get married or have kids and for me that’s the complete opposite 

So I’m confused on how to handle this because I’m worried about dragging this on and it ending in nothing but also worried that if we stay together her issues will make things difficult or get worse",14Sep2019,1

448,"I’ve known my best friend for about 8 years or so and in that time, he’s had 3 serious relationships. Generally whenever he dates girls, they’re pretty cool and we all usually hang out with each other so I get kind of close with them also. After he broke up with the first girl, I was still friends with her and a few of her other friends after the relationship and he didn’t have any problem with it. I didn’t really know his second girlfriend but now he just came off of about a 2 year relationship with his most recent girlfriend. In that time, we hung out a lot and she actually became my best friend that was a girl. I want to note we have NEVER been sexual with each other and it has always been very platonic between us. But I mean she dates my best friend and she’s a lot a like him so we always got along together. They broke up last year for a few months and I continued to hang out with her and her friends until she ended up getting back together with my best friend. They continued to date for about another year but they just broke up about a month ago and this seems to be the final breakup between them. 

After this breakup my best friend asked me to stop hanging out with her and I agreed with him and I haven’t talked to her since their breakup. Well last night was my 21st birthday and I do have a girlfriend of my girlfriend of my own and my friends ex reached out to my girlfriend a few days ago asking about what she should get me for my birthday and she was kind of wondering why she hadn’t been invited to my birthday since we have been such close friends before. My girlfriend kind of told her that it was nothing against her but that I was keeping my distance due to my loyalty to my best friend and she seemed to understand. Well yesterday my best friends ex wished me a happy birthday and I felt bad so I told her that she could come out and celebrate with us. My best friend is out of town for college so he wasn’t able to make my birthday but I told him that his ex is gonna come out with us for my birthday celebration and he flipped out on me for always being friends with his exes and that he was tired of it. I told him that I still wasn’t seeing his ex but since it was my birthday celebration I thought it’d be okay if she came out with our group and that it’s not like I’m just hanging out with her but he hasn’t responded to me since and I feel like I’m in the wrong but just because they broke up shouldn’t mean I should automatically hate her and not be her friend anymore either. I thought it’d be fine if she just came to my birthday celebration since it’d be a big group but I wasn’t expecting my best friend to get so mad at me about it and I’m not sure what to do. 

TL;DR: My best friend has been dating a girl for 2 years and she became one of my best friends in the time of us all hanging out. Since they’re breakup a month ago, my friend wanted me to stop hanging out with her. I respected that but She’s still my friend and she seemed hurt I haven’t spoken to her since the breakup so I invited her to join my group for my 21st birthday celebration and now my best friend hasn’t talked to me.",14Sep2019,3
450,"I work for a non-profit with a staff of 15. My role is important in that it takes some training and has a large learning curve. In the past, people who have left and given 2 weeks notice have been talked about negatively and it’s been frowned upon by upper management. (Even though there was no expectation placed that more notice should be given)

I’ve had some personal stuff happen where I have to relocate out of state. My apartment requires 60 days notice, so I gave my organization 60 days notice, too.

I was verbally attacked behind closed doors by the CEO, saying they had laid out for me a few months ago that they would need 4-6 months to replace me. At that time, I had no intention of leaving, but things changed. He said I am burning bridges and I’d be hard pressed to get a recommendation from them (I’ve been there 3 years). He threatened me that I need to follow their transitions otherwise I wouldn’t be vouched for my time here and then said “this isn’t a threat.” He said I needed to tell the staff about my departure (when usually a note comes from the CEO) and he suggested I say, “my life sucks and...” 

It made me extremely upset and distraught. The reactions from the ceo and then also my boss have been dismissive and cold. I need to finish out the rest of my time but I feel the working environment is affecting my mental health.

There really isn’t an “HR” but we have a board of directors. Is there anything I can do? I’m scared to say anything to the CEO because he likely will just berate me again. I’m there for another 5 weeks so any advice would be appreciated.

However, some days it’s all I can think about. I get jealous of women who can have unplanned pregnancies, as I cannot. I have a hormone disease, therefore if I want to have children, lots of steps have to be taken. There’s also a lot of risk involved such as ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, miscarriage etc. 

I still want to risk it. I know it’s because I practically grew up raising my 4 little sisters. At 14 I was forced to drop out of school to take care of them as my parents were not around. This became apart of my identity. I am a mother, without children. 

I know that I’m young and that should be enough to make me not want to have children, but i’ve always wanted to have kids fairly young. It sounds dumb but I just want to be able to relate to my children and be able to run around with them, and keep up with their high energy.

I don't know how to start telling about everything that might matter. Problems started happening the day that my parents got marred. After the wedding my dad got drunk with his coworker and said mean things to my mother. As my mother told me ""He wasn't like that at all before the wedding."" They sorted things out because he told my mother he got so drunk that he didn't even know his name, but either way it left a scar on my mother. Two years after they were married I was born. My childhood (to around 7 years old) went fine. The only thing that my dad would do wrong is that he would sometimes beat me up (not hard enough to leave any  bruises or scars) for something i didn't do. There were some arguments in my family but it wasn't anything big. When i got older things would start to get worse. He would expect me to do things i wouldn't possibly be able to do like help him in his messy garage. The help was kinda like pass me this and hold this. They weren't like heavy things that i wouldn't be able to pick up. Instead i would always pass him the wrong thin even though i know that he asked for exactly this or i would hold something wrong when in fact i didn't. And it would happened all the time.

Now that I’m thin again and back to normal, I feel great. But I still find myself thinking about food and what I’m going to eat next WAY too much. I don’t know if it has anything to do with me wanting to be a chef in the future and having a passion for cooking, but I’m sick of food taking up so much of my thinking.

Maybe it’s my body telling me something, or I have a genuine problem, I really don’t know if thinking about food this much is healthy or not. Any advice on how to cope with this is appreciated.

We became friends again, and I forgave my partner and we are working on our issues (via therapy). She is unhappy with this, even though her herself picks horrible partners, and stopped wanting to be my friend because I mentioned my partner to her. She claims she doesn't need a man, and its pathetic that I do, etc. She then claimed that she feels sorry for him, and for having to deal with me, because I am immature and too emotional. I was upset because I have always told her if she has a problem with me or otherwise, to let me know versus blowing up, which she still hasn't done, and claims it is my fault that she has not. She also compared me to her parents, which are horrible and abusive people, so this really bothers me.

467,"Sorry if this is too casual for an advice post, but I genuinely want to hear some opinions!

I'll start with all of the information on my language experiences and which languages I'm interested in, but I'm going in with an open mind! I just turned 23, I'm a native English speaker, and if you haven't looked at my username, my main area of interest is classic film. The only other language I've tried to learn is Spanish, which was required in high school. I actually fully participated in it during the year and a half I took it, and I remember some common words and phrases that the average American might not know. The only place outside of the US I've been is Mexico, but I was in a touristy area where everyone spoke English.

As far as the languages I might be interested in: The main country I want to visit is Italy, so I figure Italian might be useful if I ever actually go. My favorite actress is Hungarian and she sounds amazing when she speaks Hungarian, so in addition to maybe wanting to visit Hungary someday, I could see that being useful here and there. My boyfriend also has a full set of Rosetta Stone French lessons that he received as a gift, but never used. These may be preferences, but honestly I eventually want to be a world traveler and would hear out any advice or reasoning for other languages as well. As far as difficulty, I would like easy to medium. I'm prepared to devote a lot of time to learning a language, but I don't want something notoriously difficult like Portuguese.

I've been interested in taking more college classes where I might learn a language, but I'm about to start a full-time job, so I want to take my education into my own hands and learn something at least while I work. I thought this might be a fun hobby that could come in handy.

Also, any advice on the best sites/resources to learn a language would be helpful! I've heard Duolingo is good, but I really don't know. Please explain WHY you think your suggested language would be useful or fun to learn!

469,"Ok so. I have this “friend”.  We went to high school together (we are 28 now) and were super close, like best friend level. I moved out of the country and lived overseas from her for about 5 years and we drifted apart, as you do, but I thought we still remained friends and would catch up if we were ever in the same place, despite not being as close friends as we once were. Now, I moved back into the country about 7 months ago, when I first got back in the country I messaged her and asked if she wanted to catch up. She said she would love to but is busy for a few weeks. I left it alone and didn’t hear from her at all but I wasn’t too fussed, as I mentioned we definitely weren’t as close as we once were. I bumped into her on the street last night and said hi. She was outwardly friendly but I could sense things were super off, the friendliness seemed really forced. Despite this she said we should text and catch up some time. Now another aspect I should mention is the last time I did see her, which I think was maybe a year and a half ago, she told me about how there is this girl she knows that she absolutely can’t stand. She thought she was annoying af but the kicker here is this girl thought that my “friend” was one of her best friends, so much so that she asked her to be her bridesmaid. So my “friend” sat there bitching and moaning about what an awful person this girl is but still agreed and took part in her wedding as a bridesmaid. Messed up right? So all this makes me think; this girl would rather be polite than have a hard conversation with someone and tell them how she really feels. So now it’s clear she is doing the same to me, keeps pretending to my face that all is well but really actually doesn’t want to be friends at all, When I got home I checked Facebook and realised that some time in the last year she had unfriended me, she also doesn’t follow me on insta anymore. I’m just really perplexed by it all because I can’t for the life of me figure out what I did for us to stop being friends. I knew we weren’t as close obviously but this feels like I had done something specific to have caused this. But I’ve been living overseas for 5 years so I’m just not really sure what it is, I have been debating in my head whether to message her and ask what happened or whether I should just let it go. It’s clear she doesn’t want to be friends, but part of me is curious to know what went wrong. Do you think I should message her and ask, or do you think I should just let it go? Part of me is also annoyed that she keeps pretending like she wants to catch up when it is quite obviously a lie, I almost want to tell her that it’s much better to be honest with someone rather than be two-faced because you would prefer to be polite and that the whole situation has left me feeling rather foolish.

And it's not even playing fighting, it is straight up punching me in the gut, the arm, or even the boob, and slapping my head, all of which fucking kill. There aren't any marks to show it but I really wish they'd stop.

476,"Hey, so I'd like to share my situation if there's anyone out there with any advice: I'm 22, work as an air trafic controller and I'm an aspiring currency trader. I believe I have high ambitions in life, at least compared to the people of my age around me. I have a few real friends and a beautiful girlfriend with which I get along really well. Basically I don't have any real problems in my life, I have enough free time and money to enjoy things around me.

But the problem is, I'm not able to actually really enjoy any situation. I believe it comes back to those ""ambitions"". I always feel some kind of gap between what's happening around me and something else... Basically the fact that I'm not where I want to be in life plays a really big pyschological role and usually I don't know how to enjoy the process of getting there. That obviously affects my mood, self-confidence and overall presence in the environment. It's a real slippery slope. 

I feel really bad about it, firstly because I know I'm really lucky to be where I am and secondly, I'm afraid I'm losing these moments - cause I'm not fully present in them and not enjoying them as much as I could.  

If there's anyone who has been in a similar situation or has any ideas or recommendations on how I'd be able to get out of my head and enjoy the nice stuff in life would be much appreciated.

478,"I start tomorrow at a local university not far from my hometown. It has a good ranking from my subject and it looks really nice. I did a small summer school there last year and really enjoyed it. However my girlfriend is going there and its making me dread it. We have the same academic advisor and are in the same lab group. However we live in halls on opposite sides of campus. 

The reason for this is because I realised over the last few months that I am not happy in this relationship anymore, primarily because I think I am gay. I want to break up with her but always talk myself out of it because I get bursts of what I think is love for her, but it always fades. I think about fucking dudes pretty much whenever she isn't around. I used to have a crush on a guy in junior year of high school that I never pursued because I was in the closet and went out with my gf instead. I told her I was bi and she reacted quite badly, I am not allowed to talk about it with her as she says it makes her very uncomfortable. She told me that it is her biggest insecurity in this relationship. 

I want to come out at Uni and just start single. I want to start being me more, something which I have denied myself for a long time. 

I don't want to hurt her. I want to break up with her and just give her space. How can I do that when I literally live 10 minutes away from her? I just can't do it. She is my best friend and I really care about her, she has honestly made me into a better man, but for me it is just time to move on. I have no idea how I would even start. 

She isn't the only reason. I realised that I want to move further from home and do a different subject, I'm doing biology, but would honestly rather do Maths or Chenistry. Nothing essentially changes if I go to uni. I am just around a few different people. Lots of people from my school are going here, so I know quite a lot already. The only pro of staying is that I have a job that can pay for quite a large chunk of my tuition and grants that pay for another large chunk.  I thought about taking a gap year. My a level results weren't amazing and I might redo them. It also give me a year to just calm down and think about what I want to do and not have to deal with breaking up with my girlfriend of 2 years in the first semester. 

The bottom line is that I just want a fresh start far away from home. I know I sound like a shitty person for wanting this. I know I should've done it sooner, but I've honestly been so confused and am scared of losing her. She has been pretty much one of my best and only friends for the last year. Any advice?",14Sep2019,1

So I’m in college and I lived with my friend last year and starting this year as well. We’re friends, yes, but I’m beginning to think we might not live well together. She sees nothing wrong with our situation but I do:

1) she forgot her comb and brush at home so she asked to borrow mine 🤢

2) asks me to clean my side when it’s nowhere near as disorganized as hers

3) talks down to me like Im a child and argues with me even if she’s wrong (85% of the time I’m right)

4) makes fun of my mother and sister.

5) hugs me from behind/pats me on the head/boops my nose without checking with me (I get Anxiety/sensory overload issues) and sometimes even without letting me know she’s there

6) kinda tries to manipulate me into apologizing to her friend I had an argument with where I was NOT by any means in the wrong.

7) comes back to the room at 1:00 am when I have an 8 am the next day and keeps the door open to have a conversation with someone at a normal volume, waking me up.

There’s a lot of other stuff (passive aggressive comments about the food I eat while she buys food and it rots in her fridge, making popcorn in our room at 12:30 am, etc.) and my friends all say I should leave her, but here’s the thing; I have nights where I enjoy spending time with her and we have a lot of fun.

I always try to look on the bright side of things, but it’s getting increasingly difficult. I did ask her to stop some of these behaviors (personal space boundaries, people in the room w/o my consent, touching my stuff without permission, treating my anxiety disorder like it’s unimportant, etc.) But I cant get her to listen.

Essentially, what I’m asking is am I overreacting and should I consider switching rooms. I’m so stressed about this I’m having panic attacks. I need advice.

481,"My friend’s parents separated when she was 3 and went through years of fighting in court. The father cheated and her mom found out so she left him and he married the woman he cheated with. Throughout the divorce the father pulled insane stunts so that he could win and didn’t hace to give her any alimony. 

My friend and her brother where always placed in the middle of the fighting by their mother and at the beginning their father didn’t really have a relationship with them mostly because he didn’t want to fight for it. Fast forward to now, she is 21 and has gotten to know her father a lot better for the past 6 years. They have a very close relationship now and she’s been pretty happy with it lately. 

Her mother recently asked her father for  a marriage annulment since she is a very religious woman and he won’t give it to her. Because of this issue, last night my friend found out from family members that her father used to rape her mother when they were married. 

I am in no way qualified to give her any advice and honestly I wouldn’t know what to say. To me, any way you feel about this is okay. She was pretty distraught when she first found out. Her father doesn’t know she knows. At first she was scared shitless of him and now she says he has changed so much in the master 20 years that she doesn’t think he is the same man. 

I think she holds more of a grudge against her mother for bringing this up now and for never shielding her children from this. What should i say? She asks for help because she doesn’t know how to feel but I don’t think anyone is supposed to tell her how to feel. 

Any advice would be great! Thanks",14Sep2019,1

483,"This is on a throwaway account.

To give some information, i go to a private k-12 school. It recently got some new students when school began. One of those students was from LA. Very early on I was told to stay far away from him because he was from the “hood”. He was very shy and didn’t really talk to a lot of people, and he really didn’t look like he wanted to be here. When we all did  the “Get to know each other” stuff, he said he doesn’t do anything for fun anymore. He says he used to skate. 
Now as school goes one I think he’s becoming more open as he now brought a condom to school blew air into it and was throwing it around the locker room. He also took a cut a charging cord in half and stuck in the wall, which caused sparks and smoke. Tuition is around 7,000 for the school. So I definitely feel that his parents care enough to put him in a private school, because if they didn’t they wouldn’t pay that much. 

Is this something that I should care about or is it just someone being rebellious. I might just be paranoid.
Clearly you can tell this school doesn’t encounter this stuff ever because this seems really small right now but I’m already worried. Any advice?",14Sep2019,1

Both of them have their girlfriends over every single day and they sleepover at least five times a week. Both my roommates work the same job so they leave at 7 a.m. in the morning and their girlfriends just stay at the house. YES, you heard that right! They just stay at our house while they are at work! I find it so odd.

I don't have work until 12 p.m. so I am always looking forward to having the house to myself in the morning.

Most mornings I get up around 8:30 or 9am, I'll be walking around in only my boxers playing some music and drinking some coffee.

It just feels so awkward because I feel like if I pay rent for this house house I want to feel comfortable here. Especially if I know both my roommates are gone at work, I can walk around the house as freely as I please. 

I feel like I have acquired two new female roommates and it's really bothering me. Like the other morning one of the girls was doing dishes at like 9 a.m. while I was trying to sleep in a little bit.

I printed out a paper copy to mail, but I haven't gotten a ride to the post office to buy stamps or an envelope to mail the paper copy. I was planning on going to community college for the first 2 years then switching over to my state's university. But I missed the deadlines for mailing, the placement testing, which was all back in August. I would have to reapply to college for the spring semester. In the mean time I've been seeking employment but some jobs have already turned me down. I haven't worked or been employed before and it's hard to find a job that's not at a fast food restaurant. Me and my mom live together and she's the only one working to pay the bills and utilities.

I don't have any forms of federal identification because my mom lost my documents at my grandmas house. My certificate, SS card, passport were lost. I still carry around my high school id from a few months ago, even though it's not valid anymore. A couple months back my stepmother helped me get a new SS card and It's already my 4th copy. I have a negative balance on my bank account too.

Theres not much to do besides being inside all day in PJ's watching television, being on the internet, or reading books (which is not the lifestyle I want to carry, beside reading books). I don't know how to drive a car and I haven't gotten a drivers license, or a car of my own. I don't have any form of transportation. Besides walking or asking my parents or my older brother for rides to places. I've been trying to get on the public bus, but I don't have money for at least 1 months ride. I've asked both of my parents and my older brother if they could help me or teach me. But they get dismissive and tell me to do it myself or to figure it out myself. When I ask for rides to places, they don't want to and they'll say well go ask the other parent. Like last week I asked my mom for a ride to the library and she started talking about her personal life and her struggles growing up, then she kept mentioning my dad and to ask him because he ""doesn't do anything for me.""

502,"My wife and I are about to move into a new apartment that we love. When meeting the landlord we opted not to tell him about our cat because we didn't want to lose the apartment. Now I'm feeling concerned that we lied, and I'm wondering if we should just come clean.

Some other facts:

* we have not signed the lease yet.
* the lease makes no mention of pets whatsoever.
* we already paid for a full year up front, this was a stipulation of the lease.

The landlord is a friendly guy and wants to get to know us a little bit (invited us for a beer today). But he is very protective of the apartment. Our cat is older and well behaved, he doesn't tear up the furniture or urinate outside of the litter box. Our last apartment explicitly said no pets, but we finished a year there and the old landlord never found out.

I can't decide if I should tell the new landlord about our cat and risk losing the place, or withhold it and hope he never finds out. Part of me thinks he would be reluctant to lose on all that money, especially since he already has it in his bank account. On the other hand, he might get mad we waited this long to bring it up. Need advice please!",14Sep2019,2

504,"I am an 18 year old who had both anxiety and extreme depression all my life. For the most part I ignored it and thinking it wasn't worth my time to take care of myself. I lived my life suffering because of it and lost key aspects of my life. 

This year I did decide through that I wanted to be better which is why I am trying to work for myself and know me as a person. I want to be someone I am proud of and be content in my life. Problem is I am 18 years old and in college. My single parent family is what you would consider poor and I am the second oldest. I do not have the time or the means to find the job that I enjoy or things that interest me and that honestly scares me. I want to be a person who can be happy in what I do and content with the person I become.

512,"Well hear me out first and it’s a bit long so sorry guys! A short background, I (28F) been living with a roommate/workmate(33F) for two yrs in a flat where we share the same room. The problem started when she began bringing her FWB(an arab guy I only met the day we moved in the flat so like 5mos ago) at home, she knows I’m not comfortable with it because he’s a stanger coming into my safe haven, at first it was ok cos I was either at work or out when he comes over. But then it escalated to him coming even when I am there and get this I was not informed she gave him house keys so he can come over whenever he wants to. It started to bother me when I come home from a graveyard shift I’d find him still in her bed and roomiie nowhere to be found and would kater text she’s at work already and just to let the guy sleep until it’s time for him to leave for work. Is that ok? To leave your roommate there with practically she considers a stranger? Well of course I did not sleep until he left and I stayed at the kitchen the whole time. This happened for weeks. The thing is she knows my background, I came from a very conservative family and I don’t do the stuff that she does(smoke, drink and premarital sex) and never had a problem with that before until now. The huge fight happened after two comsecutive nights that they have been doing the nasty just a few feet away from me and used a wooden divider for “privacy” and I was pissed off and talked to them both after work( yes I have work the next morning both times they did that and didn’t get sleep obvs cos I’m not used to that and I just cried the whole night while shouting expletives at them but according to them they didn’t “hear” me, imagine my horror when I realize what they’re doing the first time 😭). So after the “talk” I thought we’re good and they finally will let me sleep and have my peace but boy was I wrong and did it again. I just exploded and we fought and I said either he stops coming here for good or at least while I’m around or he can pay half the rent cos I will not take their disrespect anymore and leave. What did you think she chose? I’m having the best sleep so far in my new flat. The roommie accused me of telling our friends about it and making her out as the villain( well duh? I’m the one telling the story so of course I’m the heroine and you’re the freakin capital B with an ITCH! STDs aren’t pokemon, you’re not supposed to catch ‘em all! Gaaawd!) So yeah, is it justified that I left my roommate and cut all contacts for good because she had been bringing her FWB in our flat? Did I overreact? Because some people say I’m a “virgin” so I will never understand that, what??? Some friends say I should have compromised and make up with her but No way I’m gonna be friends again with that female dog in heat. Well, this came out more of a rant I guess. Lol. Well thanks guys!",14Sep2019,0

So last night was a doozy for me. I just arrived back to my place from a party where I had a beer. I ran into a group of friends outside my place and decided to tag along with them. One of the guys, we'll call him James, asked me If I was drunk, so he offered me weed acting like I was so drunk after ONE beer. Usually I'm a very sarcastic guy who'd laugh it off, but I was having a shitty day and I didn't want to take it. He persisted and I kept rejecting him. It brought back memories of high school where people teased me over this shit and I felt powerless and frustrated. I wasn't gonna have it. It got to the point where I texted the building manager and reported his ass because of it. Turns out, it was only twigs in his hand and not marijuana. He yelled at me that I betrayed his trust and everybody elses... I apologized, he said it would blow over and everything would be back to normal by tomorrow (today), but now I still feel like a guilty asshole. What do I need to do to fix this?",14Sep2019,0
514,"My dad has apparently started taking up drinking again when he's been sober for at least the past 15 years. I was young enough at the time I don't really remember what he was like while drinking but I remember the stories. Wrecking a motorcycle while drunk and having to walk a mile with a fractured spine to get help, accidentally misfiring a firearm into his leg, driving drunk in general, etc. He was obviously abusing alcohol. I believe he stopped drinking shortly after the motorcycle accident but it still affects him to this day. It was found out that he was bipolar and once he was on his medicine he calmed down a lot and hadn't touched alcohol since. 

For the past year he's expressed interest in drinking with me for some bonding but I've turned him down each time. While my mom was away this weekend he told me over text, really casually like its no big deal during a regular conversation, that he's drank three beers this week and that he ""Doesn't crave them like he used to."" I don't know exactly what to do here. He ignored me when I told him he shouldn't be drinking and just talked about how calorie efficient this beer is he found. I don't know if I should tell a family member like my sister or my mom or if they might already know. I don't want to start a fight between my parents since they argue enough as is, especially if it isn't a big deal like my dad is treating it. I don't want to tell my sister because she is also a recovering alcoholic so she might be a bit upset with dad if I told her and she might tell our mom. 

I don't want to start trouble for my dad if it's not a big deal but I don't want him to start abusing alcohol.",14Sep2019,2

But today I woke her up and helped her stand from her bed, he cried and yelled a bit when I helped her, so I let her go thinking I might have hurt her. That didn't happen,  but she like loses consciousness most of the time, she sees things and recently has begun talking about seeing my grandpa.

516,"I’ve only lived in/near big cities before coming to university, and chose the school over the city. 

I’m currently in 2nd year and am getting very of tired of this town. I’ve had a lot of problems social-wise; but since it’s such a small community, it’s hard to go places without bumping into the people who were the cause of a lot of drama. (whom of which I really want to escape from.. and moving away sounds pretty nice right now) It is equally hard to just meet new people in general. Not to mention how there’s nothing to do here! I’m just not used to it since I’ve only lived in bigger cities before.

If I wanted to, it wouldn’t be that hard to transfer to a uni I initially got into, which is literally located in the downtown area of a major city. It’s still a very good school, in terms of ranking at least. But in terms of the environment, the faculty, and just general vibe of the school, I like my current school a lot more. And people I know are advising against transferring there as well. 

But honestly, it doesn’t even have to be the comparison of college town vs. the city. It could just be “would you choose the school you like better in a city you like less over the school you like less in the city you like better?”

Why does it seem so easy for everyone else xD why do i get awkward for no reason to the point, where I end up asking people on Reddit to help me with a problem that isn't a problem😂

I frequently text them to organise things and if I leave it for them to message me first I never get invited out. It hurts because they still go out to events without me and post it on social media. Whenever we go out, no photos are taken. Yet the night is always great.

I've maybe got one or two friends who still invite me first but they live pretty far away. I smoked weed pretty heavily through my teens into my early 20s and recently quit. As most of my friendships were formed through this herbacious plant, these days I never get invited to do anything with these people.

Which sucks more is that some of my closer friends have also quit, have lots of free time, live close by - yet still don't invite me first to do anything. I feel the worse my mental health gets due to isolation, the less I get invited out. It's kind of infuriating when you do hang with these people and they act as everything is the same. I can't remember someone asked me how things are, probably never.

To make things worse is that all my mates, ALL of my mates, have girlfriends or are seeing women. I'm the only single guy in our social circle at the minute and believe this may be a factor why I don't get invited out too. Like, hey man, I can't help that women don't wanna vibe with me. 

On top of everything, I have no money or a job. So seeing my close friends would really help right now. This has only been a recent thing. I'm not exactly a horrible person. I'd do anything for my friends. Yet I know they wouldn't do even half of that for me.",14Sep2019,2

533,"(warning long post)  
I'm a 21 year old from the UK.  
My long term partner (female) is afraid that if we stay together, we will restrict each other from pursuing the best possibilities that our lives can give us.

She is in Cyprus working with a project to conserve endangered turtle nesting beaches. Last week she sent me a long message about how confused she was over whether we could be together, when we were both growing so much, without stunting each other (even without intending to).  
I love her completely, and I take what she says very seriously. Neither of us are perfect. It is a struggle of communication and self awareness to be sure that we are giving each other the best of ourselves and not letting insecurities hold each other back. I think that she see's me as a safe option, and she's in a place in her life where she wants to know that she isn't settling for someone who will stop her from being the best that she can be. It's something that I have thought about as well. But I have worked through those feelings and I have no doubts that she is the person I want to commit to. Even if our relationship does not work in a few years because we have grown in separate directions, I want all of the time with her that I can get and I want to push her to have the best of her life, never to hold her back. I don't want us to end things now because of fear. I know that I can live without her, but I want her in my life, intimately, because I choose her.

I am writing her a letter, and I know that it needs to be the best letter that I have ever written. I don't know if there is still a chance for our relationship; I know that if there is a chance, and the letter fails to connect with her, then that chance will be lost forever.

I'm trying to find the right ending.  
I am writing about the difference between need and choice.

Need is restrictive because we cannot walk away from it if it is damaging us. 

We don't need each other. We are both strong, fulfilled individuals. But we love each other.

I want her to choose me.

I'm writing to tell her that choice is not restrictive. Choice is freeing because it allows us to look at all of the possibilities that life can offer us, and decide between them based on what we want. Even if we choose something that is flawed, we are not being restricted because we are doing what we want and choose to do, we deciding what is fulfilling for us and we have power over where we go from there.

If at some point that choice is no longer right for us, and we choose to separate, I will bear her no ill will because, if it is not working, that would be the best thing at that time.

But I don't want her to leave me out of fear now, and for both of us to lose everything that we could have together in the future.  


I want advice on how to show her that choice is the most freeing and unrestrictive thing that she can do. I want help with this letter, because it may be the most important thing I ever try to say to her. Please help, reddit community.

Ps:  
Thank you for reading all the way; you are the best.",14Sep2019,1

Both her and her boyfriend are friends with me but neither of them are close it's like we're friends because we used to meet everyday in class, now we've graduated. So I helped her get over the guy because I knew that the guy was very wrong in what happened and caused their break up. Some time before this, my sister had broken up as well after engagement so I knew what it's like for a girl to get through this and I genuinely wanted to help my friend get through this phase. I even went to the extent that I would stay up every night as long as she needed to talk or share things some nights right upto dawn, I bought her chocolates to make her feel a bit better, treated her to various lunches, helped her in doing her college work staying up all night and even went to meet her whenever she asked. We became really good friends and she always says this that out of nowhere I became her best friend and is like you helped me soo much I will always be there for you when you need me. She's almost over the breakup and seems to be normal and happy now but recently I feel like she's ignoring me, like I see her online and uploading stories but no reply to me. I get replies say like after about 8-10 hours or sometimes not at all or when she has to talk but when she was depressed and needed my help the replies were like real quick even some time after she recovered but now they're not.

I'm sure there's a bunch of things I havent considered yet, so if anyone has experience with this, I'd love some advice!",14Sep2019,2

544,"Lately I’ve been feeling so lonely, if my boyfriend wasn’t around I genuinely think that I would be suicidal because no one else would miss me. 

I have one sister who I don’t get on that well with. My cousins and extended family are almost all younger than me. I have only one kind of close friend from college dorms who lives over 2 hours away from me and she has so many other friends that I’m not that important to her. The people in my college course are not people who would get on with me or understand me at all. My friends from my hometown have all split up. 

This year we came back to college and one of my good friends, let’s call her Maria, from last year was moving in with some friends from her hometown. I thought this would be a great opportunity to meet some new girls however she has completely ditched anyone she was friends with last year for these new girls and I have no explanation as to why she’s not talking to me.

I’m not as popular as most other people but I don’t know why. I seem to get on well with people who are popular but I’m just not well liked and I’m having a really hard time because losing Maria’s friendship has made me realize how little people actually think of me. 

I would like advice from people who are in a similar situation but maybe handling it better than I am. Or maybe someone who could give me ideas of how to make more friends although I feel like at this stage of my life (22, finishing college this year) the opportunities to make properly close friendships are much less.",14Sep2019,1

552,"TLDR; I barely make $26,000 a year with my job, have barely anything left over for the month, pay for pretty much everything already in terms of my own bills, trying to save money for medical school, and my mom is still trying to charge me to live at home, am I being unreasonable? 

Using my cousin's throwaway account so no one can identify me. I (F, 23) just graduated from college and got a job working in a major medical school on the east coast doing research. I debated moving into an apartment in the city or living at home (about 1 hour commute with car, train, and walking). I thought it would be smart to save money and live at home. I have two younger siblings who are in high school so my parents still have a home in the town I grew up in. Today my mom confronted me and told me that she's going to ""charge me keep to live at home for groceries and utilities."" When I tried to ask for the number, because I was clearly shocked she said ""well, now I am going to wait until your dad gets home to discuss this since you're being bratty."" Before this conversation, she would keep on asking me when I was getting paid and treating my family to a celebration dinner on my tab. I only make about $33,000 a year at my research job, and with income tax the net is around $26,000. Now, for the record, I pay my own monthly car payment, car insurance, gas money, phone bill, credit card bills, and my own health insurance through work (ie I am not on my parent's health insurance even though I could be until the age of 26). With all of this into account, I barely have any money left at the end of the month. maybe a couple hundred dollars (and whatever I have leftover I try to invest in a ROTH IRA or the stock market in the hopes of good financial planning for the future). I don't go out, I don't spend money on frivolous things likes clothes or shoes, I take lunch from home, and am trying to be really good about saving as much as I can. I have plans to apply to medical school next year which is going to be very a hefty expense between the MCAT exam fee, application fees, interview expenses, flights and hotels to go to those interviews, then student loans for school etc. I'm now starting to wonder, should I sell my car, get rid of my car insurance payment and put that money towards moving out and renting in the city? Am I being unreasonable by not wanting to be charged for living at home? I thought living at home would give some ability to save before putting myself into debt for medical school, but it's proving to be more hassle and possibly more expense than it's worth. I honestly am kinda upset and shocked that my mom is charging me to live at home when she's knows I am barely making ends meet and trying to be good about saving money.",14Sep2019,0

I think i will need German in my life but im not sure.    The other teacher is an old guy that doesnt really know much but for sure i would be straight A student but i would learn german at all.

558,"So, my life got side-tracked and slammed hard 2 years ago with my dad dying. Now I'm middle of moving in the past year. I don't want to explain or talk about that but what I'm here for is to talk about my career and what to do with my life as a 27-year-old. I graduated from college with a B.A. in 3D digital design. I do a lot of game design and 3d modeling. Unity/Unreal Engine stuff. I always wanted to be a game designer/director since I was 12 years old. I'm very good at what I do with the graphic design aspect. I love it most of the time (except for the programming part which can be very frustrating). But right after I graduated from college and I was ready to look for a job and build a better portfolio. My dad got cancer and died and then everything fell apart after that and I'm in deep shit right now. My mom is my only family I got, I got no one else. I have no money. My computer is getting old. It can get the job done. I'm in the middle of moving and have been in the past year and own 2 houses which is insane. My mom doesn't do anything. Both parents hoarded a lot of stuff. I'm really hoping that we sell the old house soon and get all her stuff out. Anyway, I started seeing a therapist and getting myself back together, learning boundaries, self-love, etc. 

Oh I also was working on a game by myself last year and it was shaping up to become something really cool but I stopped because I ran out of money for software and we started moving. My friends told me that they were genuinely excited to see the outcome of my game and quite impressed on my work since I did by myself. I would love to have 2-4 more people to come and help me as a team. 

I really want to get back on the game design thing. I want to become a game designer/director. I know that the gaming industry is rough right now but I could go indie and have a small studio and go from there. 

I need a job to make money. I need to be able to move out on my own and have a life. I need a lot of money. I need to pay off my student loans, be able to afford a new computer desktop and laptop. I want to own a small tiny house, not apartment since I got pets which my mom won't keep and I love them.

So I have been given so many options and having people telling me what to do and what I should do. I have lost my identity in some weird way. Like I know who I am and what I enjoy but I don't know what to do for a job. I was set to study to become a personal trainer back when my dad was sick just to get a full-time job to make money. Now, my mom and everyone else is like that doesn't really make any money. Now I am told I should be a realtor, I would be good at it. One on one even though I'm very introverted and suffer from social anxiety. It's also great money and business is booming here from where I live. Now I went to a group for depression a few weeks ago and some guy offer me a job as an IT front-end developer but I have to move and study and all that etc. I hate programming but it's good money. So I feel pressured to do these different jobs. I want to get a job I will get paid well, enjoy for the most part, and be able to work on my game design projects on the side during my free-time until it becomes something that is worthwhile and can be a money-making thing. There's also a meetup group in my area for game devs but I don't have a laptop or anything to bring. So I do need to be able to afford a new laptop.

My mind is telling to go with personal training for enjoyment but I also keep looking at real estate since my realtor said he will hire me and help me get off a good start. I could use the money from real estate but I would do a great job as a personal trainer but I won't get good money from it. I don't know it's so random. Some personal trainer makes less money while others make a lot. I thought of why not both? I start with real estate first, then study PT when I'm a realtor and then do PT as a part-time during winter when real estate business is slow and during all that work on my game project and start going to that meetup group with a new laptop and hopefully maybe meet some people that would like to join me in making my game.

I don't know. What should I do? My therapist told me to go with what feels right to me and really think about it but I am still clueless.",14Sep2019,0

569,"Hi. I'm currently in a graduate program studying English. As part of my program requirements, I'm supposed to take something called the ""comps"" exam in the fall of my last year. I took these written exams, which are based on roughly twenty books, about a week ago and just got the results that I **didn't** pass. In my program, if you fail a second time you are asked to leave the program. If I decide to take it again, I'll have to wait a month.

I have really bad depression and anxiety which have always made school difficult for me, but I've been keeping my head above water. I haven't really enjoyed graduate school, but the program I'm in has free-tuition and pays a stipend, so I've stuck with it mainly because it's a sound financial investment that has a degree at the end, regardless of whether it was ""fulfilling."" I also dislike most of the people in the program and spend most of my time alone doing schoolwork. I can name more things I dislike about this program than the things I like. But... it's free.

Anyways, I have the suspicion one of my two advisors might be a bit of a hard ass. This is okay when it comes to writing my thesis, which ***I am*** actually interested in, but not in the initial hurdle of passing the comp exams which signal, at least to the department, that I am ""ready to begin thesis writing and research."" Further, in reading my responses, I found that only one really seemed deficient. My other concern is that this advisor doesn't want me to pass because her career is based on composition and rhetoric (outcomes and assessment blah, blah, blah) which I'm kind of critiquing in my thesis as an important field that doesn't accomplish enough in the age of climate catastrophe. I should also note I'm the only one in the program who didn't pass. I have a 3.8-something GPA and the lowest grade I've received in the program is an A-. Like most people in the program, I didn't read everything on my reading list as doing so would have entailed two books a week for the entirety of summer, but I read a majority and what I didn't read I intended to read while writing the thesis. The problem is that I teach two classes (44 students) and take an environmental law class, which take up so much of my time that reading to pass my thesis is going to effect my effort toward those other pursuits. All of this is compounded by the fact that I have an advisor with unrealistic expectations (she suggested I read three books in the week leading up to my comps exam while school was in session).

Anyway, as far as I can see, I have two options.

a.) Meet with advisors and quietly accept all the shortcomings they see in my writing without defending myself, take the comps again and either fail or pass.

b.) Leave the program now without taking comps again, find two part-time jobs until my lease is up and move back to my home state. Finish degree at another school, or find another career path.

570,"Last night, my car was broken into late at night. I realized when I got back to the car after a night of being with friends. It was in a dimly lit pay-to-park lot in the city I live in. Approximately $300 worth of stuff was stolen (sunglasses, some tech stuff, tools).

I'm not extremely concerned with the material value of those items but I am concerned that my center console, which was entirely emptied, had a customs document from when I returned from an international flight earlier this year. **I know it was stupid to leave this in the car.**

574,"Let me explain. Today is the birthday/party of my fiance's niece. I love his niece to death, she is so sweet. However, this is the daughter of his sister that currently hates my guts... 

2 months ago I was at a fire at her house (she lives right next door to us so, it was pretty normal to be there and no big deal that we were all drinking). Well time passed and people left or went to bed. Fast forward to late in the night and the only people left were myself, her husband and two other people (my fiance was not in town at this moment). 

Well her husband got shit-faced drunk. He kept trying to put hands on me that I would walk away from or try to deter. Well at one point he told me to shut up and calm down and pulled me against the back of his car and pinned me there, trying to kiss me to shut me up and touching me in places I did not like. His friend ended up pulling him off of me.

Well the next morning I immediately told his wife, she was my friend and I wasn't going to hide something like from her. Surprisingly she was expecting me to say that he was being flirty and putting his arms around me. Because apparently he had done that very thing to my fiance's other sister. But she was not expecting me to tell her about how he did much more than just that. 

After that she refused to talk to me. I was told that it was my fault because I'm ""flirty when I drink"" (I'm flirty with my fiance yes, drunk sex is awesome. I, however, am NOT flirty with random people especially with my soon to be sister in laws husband) I was told it was also my fault because of the way I sat in my chair and the way I was dressed, and because I even stayed at that fire after everyone else went to bed. I'll admit I stayed at that fire a lot longer than I should have, that was my fault but my fiance had been gone for 3 weeks and I just didn't want to be alone in the house again, a fire was a nice way to just have fun and relax... But I admitted my mistake. 

No she won't acknowledge me or speak to me unless she is obligated to. I'm afraid she will tell me I'm not welcome at this party (although she did send me the Facebook invitation...) I don't know I'm just super anxious and scared. What if she continues to refuse to speak to me... What if she tells me I need to stay away from her house and kids. I apologized profusely for what happened that night... But when it happened to her sister he was the dirtbag, when it happened to me I was the slut...

I get so much anxiety from the whole thing, I feel like his whole family must hate me because of what she must have told them. He keeps telling me to just let it go that everyone is past it... But when she won't speak to me or acknowledge me it sets off my anxiety and I feel like it's all still a very big problem...

578,"Hello. Sorry if there are formatting issues as I am on my phone, and sorry if this turns out long but any help at all is much appreciated!!

Some background information: I am from the UK. My parents are Chinese though so I am also Chinese aswell and can speak Cantonese. I am about to start my 4th and final year of university. I am studying Japanese. My boyfriend of 1 year is Swedish. So we are doing long distance and it has been good so far! We have had barely any problems even though after the first time we met, I had to go away to do my year abroad in Japan while he stayed in Sweden, which I am pretty proud of! I got to visit him in Sweden twice during this year and it went really well. I met his parents whom I love and they love me.

Here is the problem: I don't know what the fuck to do after I graduate. My plan when I chose this degree was to move to Japan afterwards and either become an English teacher or work in a Japanese company. This changed after I met my boyfriend and now all I want to do is close our long distance as soon as possible.

We have talked about the future many times. He is not interested in Japan so moving there together is a no. I am fine with this, as I'm not too crazy about Japan and it was never my real 'dream' to move there.As I really like Sweden, we have talked about me moving there. At first he said that it I can move in with him and I quote, he said ""I don't mind if you don't get a job, you can just stay here and learn Swedish and then find a job afterwards"". He lives in the countryside basically, in a really small village so my job prospects would be like zero. But his house has been owned by his family for generations so all they have to pay are the electricity bills and whatnot, which is really good.

Well I think his heart was in the right place when he told me this but his head was not. Me moving in with him is no longer a good idea because of his social anxiety? Not sure if this is considered that. I just came back from visiting him and he just told me that as soon as I left he realised how much more relaxed he was. It's not me specifically but he just tenses up around people and can never truly relax around people. He told me how he got more easily tired when I was with him, and how when I was at another part of his room away from him and when he was driving, for example, to work alone he felt a lot better. He also said he slept way better without me beside him.He actually told me about this problem of being around people before we became a couple, to which I replied that if he ever wanted space he could just tell me and I would move away. But everytime we were together I didn't notice him being tense and I thought everything was fine. He also said he didn't notice it until I was gone aswell.

So if I were to move in with him I would feel not only guilty that I don't have a job but also guilty that I am making him feel so bad in his own house.

He said he thought about it and that his ideal situation would be if I lived 30 mins - 1 hour away from him. Normally this would be fine. We don't have to be living together just yet. The thing that I am most worried about is if it is even possible to support myself. Since I cannot speak Swedish, and I've studied fucking Japanese, the only job I can see myself getting is a cleaning lady. Which is not a bad job but I don't think I can afford my own place with that job alone?If I were to work various jobs, plus attend Swedish classes, I am not sure if it is worth it to throw away everything and struggle so much. Let's face it, while it is a really beautiful and nice country, I have no real interest in Sweden apart from my boyfriend. I would be doing all this just so I can see him a few times a week. Not to mention that I won't have any friends and will know nobody.

And with brexit going on (fuck brexit btw) my chances of finding a job would probably br even slimmer than it should be. It will probably be even harder to legally move to Sweden.

Ive even looked at Master degree programmes in Univervisities around Sweden but none have caught my eye. When I asked the University closest to my boyfriend they told me they basically have nothing that someone like me can study. I don't know whether to laugh or cry at this. Like am I that useless? Have I dug my grave this deep already?

I'm sorry if I sound dramatic, I just feel really hopeless and am kind of freaking out that we can never be together and that I will never get a good job. And overall I just feel really useless.

So please somebody, what kind of job can someone like me get in Sweden? Someone who knows 2 asian languages and English, which everyone is already super good at in Sweden. Or should I not move to Sweden, take my chances elsewhere and do long distance until god knows when.

Thank you for reading this long ass mess and thank you for any help.",14Sep2019,1
579,"Theres an adult site that I'm worried is employing underage models and lying about their ages. One of the models uses the alias 'Monroe'. I'm worried if I mention their name here my comment will get blocked. There's rumours all over the internet that this model was under 18 when she was in the industry. She herself posted that she was between 15 and 17 at the time (story always changes) and she sued the company. Having asked her myself on social media, she claimed that these posts were jokes but I'm just bo convinced. I have reported this to a foundation that deals with abuse material here in the UK and they've said its not illegal and the site themselves have (unsurprisingly) denied it.

592,"Please don’t tell me to drop my friends or call the police. My friends are great people, it’s just I’ve been really upset over this and I need help.

Starting this summer, my friends began coming over to my house a lot. I have the whole basement to myself so that’s why they enjoyed being over so much.

I’m a small woman, 5”3. Im weak and I don’t like fighting back. Most of my abusers are my guy friends who are taller than me and stronger.

It started small, my friends would “lock” me in the shower (putting chairs in front of the door) and leave me in there for a while. Sometimes dumping water on me or something.

Then it escalated to where my friends were dragging me into the shower, pushing me, pulling me, leaving marks and bruises.

Then my friends kept forcing me into my closet with another one of my guy friends, and that guy friend would keep “wrestling me” and it left bruises on my knees.

This went on a lot. One day I had a sleepover with a bunch of people and it went too far. My friend bought duct tape and duct taped my hands, ankles, fingers, my joints, and my mouth. They then threw me into the storage room and locked me in there. Ended up getting a bruise over my spine.

I’ve gotten numerous bruises and scratches from all this. I’ve shared with them that it made me sad and they stopped. But now they make memes out of the photos they took when I was duct taped and it makes me so sad and angry.

Some of them apologized, but it still really hurts.  I’m constantly scared and paranoid. What do I do?",14Sep2019,2
593,"long time lurker, first time poster.

okay so um. here it is.

I was asked by these guys a while ago to write some songs for them. They compose music but can’t write, so I wrote two songs for them which I also recorded with them and preformed. 

we were a makeshift band, and it was okay but they kept getting mad at me for not writing more songs, I found it difficult to write songs to their music because it was... bad? In my opinion anyway, I found it really disjointed and difficult to write to. I didn’t appreciate the constant anger at me, and recently they got booked to play a gig for free, but I was working and couldn’t get the day off, which resulted in me getting guilt tripped and verbally beaten up over it. After that I decided that next time they ask me to do something, I’ll decline and get out of the band.

Then I see they hired a new singer, which is cool, but she’s singing my songs. These are songs which I felt were personal to me, and I wasn’t given so much as a heads up or asked for my permission. 

Of course I understand that they wrote the musical composition of the songs, but in my mind, those are my songs. I don’t know, is my anger and shock justified ?

And how should I go about asking them not to use my songs without my permission in the future?

598,"In the past two weeks, the vast majority of my ""official"" appointments and interactions have been flaked on or not followed through by people I interact with.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance:

\- Different friends: ""I'll call you Monday to catch up!"" (no call), ""Let's meet for happy hour at 6 pm"" (twenty minutes beforehand cancels due to not feeling well), ""Come on over now to my place"" (as I'm getting in an Uber friend says another night is better since they are tired)

\- Dentist: ""Great, I've changed your appointment from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at your request"" (result is the appointment is still booked at 11 a.m. after I get a reminder message)

\- Pharmacy: ""Your prescription refills are in"" (but they're the wrong prescriptions, I tell them, and they say 'oh, you're right')

\- Health care: charging hundreds or tens of dollars more than what it was supposed to be

\- People I'm selling furniture on apps, Craigslist, and in my apartment building to: ""Confirmed...Wednesday 7:30 p.m."" (they don't show up, I even confirmed it an hour beforehand, wrote them 30-60 minutes after our appointment time, and the next morning receive a text of one word quoting the price of the furniture $20 cheaper than what we agreed to with no apology, I say where were you last night and I'm not lowering the price we already agreed to since I already compromised on the price earlier with her, and she says 'family emergency')...the flaking of people who are interested and commit to buying my furniture and even set up times is a 70-90% flake rate.

\- Apartment management: ""We set your apartment unit inspection for XX \[certain date\]"" (but they never show up)

\- And more instances. School, moving companies, maintenance...it's literally the majority of interactions I have that SAY ONE THING and DO ANOTHER THING / DON'T FOLLOW THROUGH / DON'T SHOW UP / DON'T DO IT THE RIGHT WAY / DON'T KEEP APPOINTMENTS / DO THE WRONG THING ON MY ACCOUNT BY NOT EASILY REVIEWING IT CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME / ETC.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this all normal??? Each time I set aside time to actually meet, be home, or take an Uber to go to them but then have to reschedule things over again. I'm getting tired of having to do everything DOUBLE, like again in terms of my time and effort, whether it's friends meet ups, appointments, health care. It wastes my time because I set aside time in my schedule to actually COMMIT and SHOW UP and FOLLOW THROUGH...but the vast majority end up being flakes. I don't think I'm exaggerating at all. For people who will question it, this really happens. A lot. The past two weeks have been more but it's generally around a majority flake rate or not followed through promise where I then have to go back and correct people's mistakes.

By the way, I live in Washington, DC if that matters for anything.

I was really caught off guard and so I tried to laugh it off and be like uhhh idk I guess I joined the cross country team last month and I’ve been really getting in shape recently. She kept eyeing me weird but I kinda brushed it off tans forgot about it till my mother came to pick me up. This is where things went south quickly, because when I ran inside to grab my sweatshirt that I accidentally left, I noticed my coach run out to talk to my mom. Five minutes later I go to get in the car and my mom tells me that my coach ran out to tell her that she’s concerned I have an eating disorder, and my mother said that now she’s worried about me to. To be clear, I do not and I have not ever had an eating disorder, but recently I have been trying to eat a little healthier (more fruits and veggies, less super sugary junk all the time) and I have joined the cross country team and started running regularly. I have lost some weight, but that wasn’t really my goal, and my doctor has actually recently commented on how healthy I look. Anyway, my mom starts going off about how I need more carbs and calories, and I really didn’t want to upset her anymore so I tried to just say that I really am ok but if she wants me to eat more I will gladly oblige. Cut to twenty minutes later we are home and she literally makes me eat two pop tarts, finish off a box of cereal and drink some weird protein shake drink in front of her. She then proceeded to tell both my dad and brother behind my back about how she’s so concerned and how I have to eat more. Now both of them think that I have an eating disorder, and she even made my brother go with me to the store to have me pick out high calorie protein bars. I honestly feel really violated and self conscious right now and I kinda want to cry. I feel really sick after having like 900 calories of sugary junk for lunch, and she’s now asking me to eat more protein bars.

I really don’t know what to do or say to her or my coach for that matter. I’m dreading my dad coming home and I just feel really gross and terrible about myself.

603,"TL;DR at the bottom.

Background: I'm 29m, she's 28f. I've never been married, but had a serious relationship that I have son from. She's never been married.

So from the start of our relationship, she's been really big on communication. Hard for me, I don't like me, I don't like taking about me, or how I feel. I manned the hell up and started talking to her about pretty much everything.

 Every time we get into an argument or she gets upset (which is painfully obvious when something is bothering her) she either denies something is bothering her, or she just shakes her head and doesn't say anything when I ask her what's wrong. Then I sit there in awkward silence because something is clearly bothering her and I don't know what to do.

So last night she's like, ""We should watch a movie."" I'm thinking, ""Great. I'm tired after a long day and this is a good opportunity to watch one of the two dozen movies I borrowed from my parent's house because I want her to experience these."" She says she wants to go to Redbox and get something new. She doesn't want to watch something ""old"" (a chunk of the movies are oldies I grew up watching).

I get frustrated because we just bought a house, are paying for a wedding, we ate out once already this week, and we're just poor in general. I glace over and look at a stack of board games that I have because I love board games. She hates board games. And this continues to snowball.

Look at my computer and PS4. She not only doesn't play, she's gotten frustrated when I've played games lately.

I brought my dog in this morning because she's very much a people dog and had spent a lot of time outside by herself this week as we've been busy. I get in trouble because fiance doesn't want dog hair everywhere.

I love playing d&amp;d or magic to decompress and destress. Fiance refuses to play with me. 

I love cuddling but am not a PDA person. Fiance doesn't like cuddling with be because I'm too warm and then she is always touching/leaning on me in public. And I don't mean trying to hold hands. Putting her hand on my arm/shoulder/back etc.

We have completely opposite tastes in food/dessert/treats. 

So after all of this goes through my mind I feel like I just want to be done. I've always heard you should marry your best friend and I feel like I'm marrying a toddler that throws a fit when she doesn't get her way. I pictured myself with someone who would play at least something with me, but instead I'm engaged to an artist that wants me to do shit that my son's mom wanted me to do and I get uncomfortable being reminded of my son's mom. 

I still love her and she's been great dealing with me. I'm under no false pretenses that I am a kind person. I'm an asshole and she's been great dealing with me. She's made me a better person in some ways. I don't want to walk away from her, but I also feel like if I marry her, I'm just signing myself to live with someone who won't want to do anything I'm interested in with me.

What do I do?

TL;DR I'm getting married in two weeks and I finally realized my fiance and I have almost no similar interests, tastes in food, movies/shows, or preferences in pretty much anything. Questioning whether or not I should call the whole thing off from lack of common interests and general frustration.",14Sep2019,0

606,"(First off, this is my first post on this subreddit, so please feel free to direct me elsewhere if my content does not belong here...)

Backstory and relevant information: 


I am clinically depressed. I am on medication and in therapy. This is unfortunately not always 100% effective in treating me.

Every so often, I sink into a hole and have some very rough episodes. I am currently in one of those episodes and fighting suicidal thoughts.

I recently let my morbid curiosity get the better of me and watched some YouTube videos about disturbing things, hoping they would be paranormal in nature...this was not the case.
The videos I watched contained content focusing on child abuse, domestic violence, etc. Fucked up shit that makes me lose all faith in humanity. 

In hindsight, I should have stopped watching when things got too dark, but I guess I was hoping for some kind of happy ending?

Anyway, here is where I need some advice...

I want to change the world. I want to end the kind of suffering that disturbs me so greatly.

Now if you recall, I am depressed and easily triggered. This is where my problem lies.

Am I selfish for this? Does protecting my own mental health and sheltering myself from the outside world make me selfish? Apathetic?

Is there a way I can help end child abuse AND maintain my sanity? What can I do???

On mobile, sorry for formatting or whatever

Trigger warnings for substance abuse, Transphobia, homophobia, physical abuse. I'm not sure what else to put here so if you think I should add anything else to the top of the post, let me know please. I don't want to fuck with anybody's mental state so please don't read this if it's going to trigger you 

(F, 16 in five days btw)

I'm almost certain I'm going to be running away from home soon. Part of me doesn't want to, part of me is scared out of my mind, but I don't think I have any other options. 

Last night I was ripped out of my bed at 3AM by my mom because my sister (27) and her girlfriend (35) were fighting. It got physical and we had to leave the house until damn near 6AM. Her girlfriend flipped the fuck out and started smashing shit, and eventually threw my sister out of their room. From what I could tell, it was unprovoked but they were arguing a bit before so I dunno. 

Point being, being in the house at all is being in danger. They fight almost every night. Her girlfriend, while sober, isn't physically abusive by any means (emotionally abusive is another story. She's manipulative as fuck). Its only when they're drinking that things escalate that badly, but they drink almost every night now. 

I've tried to talk to my sister about it, and she see's the issues and knows that the situation is fucked but she won't do anything about it. They've went one night in the last two weeks without drinking and that was because they couldn't afford to buy any beer, because they spent the rest of their money on it the night before. I don't know what else to do. If they can't drink without fighting then they shouldn't drink, or at least not together. But they dont listen and do it anyway. It's gotten to the point where we have to hide all of the knives so neither of them try to kill each other, or themselves. They've seriously tried before and I don't have a doubt in my mind that my sister could go through with it if she had the chance. I'm afraid to be around either of them. I've had a bookshelf pushed over onto me twice and I was slammed into a door frame last year which has caused me continuous back pain. I can't even count the amount of beer bottles I've had thrown at me because she didn't like something I said. I almost called 911 last night and let them get arrested because I was that scared that they were gonna hurt each other.

They're both extremely violent. My sister specifically is extremely Transphobic and Homophobic (which makes no sense to me because she's a lesbian?) And will regularly come into my room talking about how disgusting the LGBT community is and saying that Transgender people deserve to die, and gay men deserve to have their balls cut off. She compares them to fucking pedophiles.

The drinking and fighting is probably the worst issue I have to deal with, but I have so much other shit going on that just adds on and keeps piling up and makes me wanna kms because it's so overwhelming. 

I clean everything, everyday. Sometimes for up to six hours a day, aside from Saturdays. I can sleep for eight hours, get back up in the morning and the kitchen will be trashed out to the point I can't walk on the floor without stepping on trash. The sink is full of dishes, the trash cans are knocked over and haven't been picked up, there's beer bottles all over everything and there's food in the sink and spilled in the fridge. It's disgusting. 

I've set my limits for cleaning and haven't let most of them be crossed yet. I won't clean the garage and I won't clean the living room. I won't do the litter box because it isn't my cat that uses it and I won't clean my sisters bedroom anymore. 

As a result of me setting these boundaries, the living room hasn't been cleaned in about six months. The litter box hasn't been done in two months, and I was the last one to clean it out. The living room is covered in cat shit and the furniture is past the point of being cleaned or fixed. They refuse to clean it themselves even though it's their animals that did it. Its a fucking biohazard. I'm limited to one bedroom and a bathroom aside from when I'm cleaning because of this. 

And they still want to keep bringing animals in despite not being able to take care of the ones they have now. 
When we moved in here four years ago, there were 11 animals.  Most have died or we've gotten rid of them. I'm considering getting rid of my dog because I can't properly take care of him here and I wouldn't be able to take him with me if I were to run away. I love him, I love him more than anything. But he deserves more than I can give him right now and it's getting to a point that taking care of him is too mentally taxing for me. 

My mom has too much anxiety to get a job. She won't let me get a job either so I can't save up to get us out of here. She expects a way out of here to just fall into our lap without having to work for it. She won't call her parents and ask for help, and won't get a job yet constantly complains about being stuck in the situation. She has a car, but she doesn't have her license or insurance. We've tried to get her license taken care of but my mom always runs out of money before we can because my sister manipulates her into buying beer. We've tried to come up with ways to make more money, aside from the child support checks she gets, but none of it will work. She's naive sometimes, thinking that by selling fucking tie dye T shirts online we'll make enough to support a household of four. Rent, food, bills. It isn't realistic and she gets angry when I point it out. 

I don't want to burst her bubble or seem pessimistic, but the only way to make money without working is to scam it or steal it and I'm not that type of person. 





TLDR, my sister has a major drinking problem and so does her girlfriend. I'm sick of being around drunk, violent people all the time. I'm sick of cleaning after everybody and all of their animals and they want to bring more in for me to clean up after. Mom won't let me get a job to get out so I'm thinking of running away. The situation is unbearable.

So I need advice and hopefully this is the right place to post it. 
Should I run away? I don't have any family I can stay with and only one friend in the state and he lives two hours away and I'm not sure if he can even let me stay with him right now. I'm not sure but I might have someone I can stay with in the next state over. I cannot stay here anymore. The only reason I didn't leave at 13 was because I don't want to damage my relationship with my mom. But she's had four fucking years to get us out of the situation, and that's her job as a parent. She hasn't and still won't do that, so I'm taking care of myself since she won't. 

Is there any other advice you could give? Anything is appreciated. Thanks xx",14Sep2019,0
611,"My (14F) 6yo brother just started first grade a few weeks ago. Everyone from kindergarten was in his class except they had two new girls. Most kids were nice to him in kindergarten, except for a few, but this year the're all being so mean to him. Yesterday he told my mom that kids were slapping his legs on the playground and saying they wouldn't' play with him at recess the day before. Only one girl whose been his friend since they were babies was nice to him. They're mean to him because he's different. He's really hyper and sweet and sensitive and he really loves dinosaurs. Like he LOVES dinosaurs, it's practically all he talks about besides Goosebumps and his pet goldfish. 

What makes me really sad is that this one girl who adores him (they even went to the children's museum together over the summer) was being mean to him because everyone else was. :( He did talk to his teacher and then the principal, and all the bullies had to go to the principal's office, but it's still making me sad. He's a really sweet little guy who loves school and learning and I don't want a bunch of bullies to ruin that for him so early. I just want him to stay happy forever.

612,"So I have been with my bf for the past year and a half. The relationship is great, we love each other very much.

A big source of conflict in our relationship, however, has been his former roommates. They are a couple (I’ll call them Tom and Jan) and he was living with them for the first year of our relationship. 

When we first began dating his roommates and I got along really well. I felt like I had made some new friends. However, after a few months Jan started become very passive aggressive towards me. You see, prior to my bf meeting me he was in a way a fill-in bf for Jan. Tom isn’t the most thoughtful or loving partner. My bf is an extremely caring person and so whenever she was on her period he’d buy her chocolate and tampons. Things like that. So when I came around my bf stopped doing those things for her and she clearly resented me for it. It got to the point that I started to dread going by my bf’s apartment because I knew to anticipate passive aggressive comments and, at times, straight up abuse. 

Further, tension with Tom got pretty bad when it had been revealed to us that he was pretending to be an ethnic minority for the past 5 years, an ethnic minority I happen to be a part of. It was something he and I had bonded over and finding out it was all a lie was painful for me. I figured he must’ve been a very sad person to lie about such a thing so I tried to be kind to him but I couldn’t help but feel very very uncomfortable about it. It was tough for my bf because Tom and him had been best friends for years and he had no idea.

Things continued to be pretty bad. Jan kept on telling my bf she missed it just being the three of them. I tried to introduce my close friends to Jan and Tom in hopes that it would somehow unify all of us but, instead, Jan and Tom would then be very rude to my friends and actively try to prevent my friends from interacting with my bf. It was as though they were threatened by the idea of my bf making friends other than them. When they would go out they would insist on having “family” photos taken and intentionally leaving me out. 

My bf sat them down telling them how uncomfortable they were making me. Their solution was to have all four of us get an apartment together. They claimed they felt they would view me as more part of their little family unit if I lived with them (my bf and I were planning on moving in together anyway). And for a little bit I decided to go along with the idea...until I noticed that I wasn’t being treated any differently and the apartments they were considering were luxury apartments they could only afford if I was also pitching in on rent. This, combined with the fact that Tom was unemployed and my bf was already covering a big chunk of his rent, made me change my mind. Further, I still felt a certain kind of way about tom’s lie. 

So I told my bf that I understood that Tom and Jan were his closest friends and if he wanted to live with them I would not be angry or judge him, but that I personally did not feel like it would be safe or healthy for me to live with them. I truly did not want to grant him an ultimatum of any kind but rather wanted to protect myself. My bf told me above all else he wanted to live with me, and thus was ok not living with them anymore.

When he broke the news to them they were really angry. He gave them 3 months notice before their lease was up, and agreed to pay his portion of rent for the remainder of the lease.They accused him of forcing them into a bad financial situation and of “betraying” them. Tom went onto social media saying pretty horrible things. I felt so uncomfortable and unsafe with the situation I stopped going to my bf’s apartment. My bf felt so much anger and animosity from them that he basically moved into my place to get away from it. He not only paid his rent but also the utilities, as they were all in his name and they wouldn’t pay him their share. When my bf finally moved out of his place into mine they screamed in his face the entire time.

I guess what hurts is that despite the fact that my bf has moved our, and despite the fact that they now have their own apartment, it hasn’t stopped. They contacted my bf’s abusive ex and encouraged her to call and harass us (which she did for days straight). I blocked them on all social media accounts for my own peace of mind after all of this and they have gone on a complete smear campaign against me. 

And I guess that’s what is the most frustrating. My bf made his own decision regarding this. I in no way forced him into making the decision he made. But they have made out like I am some kind of sociopath hellbent on isolating my bf from his friends. They have spread rumors about me being somehow emotionally abusive to my bf. They have claimed I was dangerous (ironic given they were the ones screaming in my bf’s face when he moved out, not me). They have completely portrayed me as this monster of a person and my bf the victim. When my bf bumped into one of Jan’s friends the other day, she was sweet as can be to him. When I bumped into her the other day, she was incredibly rude to me. I don’t know why but this really really bothers me. 

I feel a lot of anger. I’ve started going to the gym regularly in hopes of letting my anger out in a healthy way but it really hasn’t done anything. I feel anxious in certain parts of town. I find myself internalizing a lot of what is said about me and feeling like maybe I am a bad partner to my bf, maybe I did ruin his closest friendships, and I feel so guilty about it. It makes me worry and wonder if I’m bad for my bf because of this. I don’t know how to let all of this go. Every time I begin to heal from this I hear something else that has been said about me. 

So idk what to do. I’ll take any advice.",14Sep2019,1

626,"TLDR at the bottom.

I am looking for some advice because i have been in a weird situation for quite some time now and i have nobody to talk to about this. Thats why i am reaching out to you on this sub. Excuse my English.

I am in a very happy and absolutely fulfilling relatinship with my girlfriend for 4 years now. We got to know each other when we were around 18 years old, moved together 1 year ago and work really well together in general. My girlfriend grew up in great rural upper middle class familiy and has never really had any contact with drugs apart from alcohol, which is absolutely fine for her and everyone in her family. 

Around 1 year into our relationship (3 years ago) she found out i sometimes smoke some weed with my closer friends instead of having a drink at a bar or going to the club for some binging. It was a shocker for her, especially because some drunk guy she knew told her about it. I do realize it was my fault for not telling her i smoked weed, but well... i was more or less naive. At this point i have never met a Person that had a really negative attitude towards Marihuana in general. Altough it is still illegal in my country, barely anyone thinks of it as a bad thing. Most accept it is way healthier (in moderation) than drinking or smoking tobacco. This includes all of my family and friends. There is nobody straight saying ""weed's bad"".

She was in tears because i did not tell her and she begged me to not do it anymore. She didn't explain her reasoning, but i suppose she put it on a level with methamphetamines or worse. I agreed and for a long time i didn't touch Marihuana at all. 

After that i asked her once or twice if she would mind it if i smoked some weed with my buddies when we are gone on our ""Best Buddies Holidays"" together. E.g. we rented a little boat in the summer and just spent some time on rivers in our country with 1 Horse Power. Fun times. No Alcohol needed. She agreed and i could see she wasn't really minding it that much since i asked her beforehand. But still it seems like it is a taboo topic... She really isn't that open minded about it like other people.

The problem is, that i have struggles integrating her into my circle of very wholesome friends. I keep up a strong relationship with my high school buddies and now their girlfriends joined us, too. The thing is, their habit of having some joints when meeting for a party or just a lazy evening didn't change at all and i for my part dont mind it. It also is a rather common part of electronic music / rave music which we love to party to. (Techno etc.) I really prefer it over the heavy drinking some college students my age do.  Since my girlfriend doesn't like that music at all and most of the time also doesn't have the time to join us (time consuming hobbies she is really into), she really doesn't know anything much about this friends circle habbits...

Sure, she is part of gatherings when its more formal like a birthday party or when someone moves in somewhere and invites people over. But never the kind of events where a joint is passed around. And sometimes i also participate in smoking. My friends do know my girlfriend once really disliked this, so they dont really mention it when she is around.

I think it is a bad trend, because i want her to be part of my friends circle as tightly as everyone else. I dont want to have to separate her from my other friends.  She needs to know about this or i always feel like keeping a secret from her. Some nights i just lay awake next to her and think about this bullshit.

I realize there is no way around of explaining the situation to her. That me and my friends still smoke weed from time to time and we do enjoy it and it just replaces the alcohol on some evenings. We're still young, don't have family and kids and want to enjoy our lives as much as possible. :)

I need your advice now: 

What is the best approach for this. How do i start this. I dont want her to feel betrayed too much. I am sure she doesnt mind the smoking too much but the important thing is she wants to be handled with respect. If she keeps hating on weed i am willing to quit it for her. But i want her to be part of my friends circle. She is definitely wife material and we talk about every other topic openly.

Should i just tell her what was happening all the time on a evening after i serve her some nice dinner?

Should i ask her if she'd like to have a mild joint on my upcoming birthday together with me?

Should i quit smoking, leave friends and girlfriend and live in a siberian forest?

Please help. It's just weed isn't it...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

HOW do i tell my girlfriend who was mad when discovering i smoke weed 3 years ago that i continued to smoke weed with my friends? i want her to join my circle of best friends more often (she doesnt need to smoke and i am willing to quit if she insists). I suppose she might have changed her childishly scared mind about this topic from 3 years ago...She had no idea what weed was. Is it stupid to ask her if she wants to try it once with me in a private setting on my upcoming birthday?",14Sep2019,2

I've been trying to find a way to bring it up without hurting his feelings, but he's very self conscious and I really don't want to hurt his feelings. I've left it this late because I didn't know if it was just a temporary thing, or if it was a sensitive topic. At first it didn't really bother me, but now it's gotten to the point where I just can't ignore it because it's so bad. I really like him and I don't want something like this to mess it up.

634,"I need people to tell me if I’m completely over my head or if he IS acting like he likes me.

There is a boy my best friend really likes.  She told him last year, and he respectfully said he didn’t like her back, and now they’re very good friends.  There is nothing awkward between them, but my friend really likes him still.  She’s told me she’s not over him and she’d be upset if he dated someone else.

When him and I talk she always gets jealous and tells me that it seems like we’re more than friends.  Yesterday I could see where she was coming from.  He pays the most attention to me in a group setting, he looks at me a ton and we always end up having mini side conversations or joking around.  The reason why I think we’re friends-friends is because he knows I like someone else and is trying to figure out who it is.

After all of us hanging out (very casually, it was our high school’s football game) he asked HER for my snapchat over snapchat.  She joked around with him about his asking and didn’t give it to him because she didn’t want us to talk outside of school.

She got very upset last night about this and is convinced he likes me.  We both know he doesn’t like her, which is truly, truly unfortunate, and now she’s stressed out.

Do you think he likes me?  What should I say to my best friend to comfort her?",14Sep2019,2

643,"My partner has an amazing job offer with a union that would change our lives, but the problem is he has to get a urine drug test AND a physical at basically the same time... but he has smoked marijuana for years. HE IS ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO STOP FOR THIS JOB. However it stays in your system for like 2 months. Previously he has always been able to smuggle in clean urine, but this time it is complicated due to the physical. The union rules also say if he is caught trying to cheat, he will blacklisted forever. However, the alternative is using the detox/dilution method, which he has zero faith in, but the union rules say if he fails a drug test, he can reapply in 6 months.

I really think the most important thing here is not cutting off this opportunity forever. If he tries to smuggle in urine, he *might* get away with it, but more than likely he will be blacklisted from this amazing job for the rest of his life. That is not an acceptable risk to me, so I have been pushing really hard for him to do the dilution method, but he won't listen to me, and I don't know why. There are not that many opportunities like this that he qualifies for, so getting blacklisted would likely trap him in entry-level minimum-wage jobs for the rest of his life. 

Does anyone have advice or suggestions on either trying to convince him to do dilution instead of subbing urine? Or advice on exactly how a union physical works? Or advice on how to smuggle urine through a physical? I don't know what to do. I'm really afraid he will get caught and squander this opportunity forever. I'm also afraid if he gets caught he will fall into a deep depression at the loss of this job opportunity.

We were laughing and dancing the whole time and at one point her friend was trying to leave. She was leaving with her and I figured I'd head back to the dorms with them since I was having fun with this girl and we live in the same dorm. Her friend then said ""No we're meeting up with people"" which I took as meeting up with other guys. I was pretty upset but got over it quick and figured it was mostly her friend pushing to leave since we had a really good time. I texted her later saying I had a lot of fun and she responded saying the same agreed that we should meet up again soon.

Once there she sees me, gives me a hug and after a few minutes says she needs to go get a drink and leaves (Big uni bar where there's hundreds of kids so it's not your traditional table/counter bar). After about 15 minutes she doesn't come back and I end up seeing her talking to some other guy. I go up and say hi to her and she says she'll meet me at the outside part of the bar in 10 minutes because all her friends are in here.

The reason I’m choosing business is because I was homeschooled so I’m pretty much dumb as fuck when it comes to mathematics and science so I wanted something that wasn’t too heavy in either of those aspects, and figured business would be pretty flexible and a well paying non-STEM major. 

I took a leap year and just worked, kinda made me want to go back just so I wouldn’t be stuck doing a dead end job fast food job or something for the rest of my life. 

Then when I did return to school I had a lot of family telling me several times how “proud they are of me going back to school” made me kinda feel like I was just a waste in their eyes if I’m not working towards a degree. So that made me feel some type of way. But I just have no clue what I want out of my future.

A few months ago, I met a guy through some friends. We got along so well, and we hung out (w/o our friends) once a week for almost all summer long. Recently, he confessed to me that he liked me, and wanted to get to know me better.
The thing is, I don’t know if I like him. My immediate reaction was to tell him that I wanted to get to know him well too. 
But I didn’t specify if my intentions were romantic or platonic. I think it’s the latter.

Here are the reasons why I think I might not like him:
•Maybe I’m just lonely: I’ve never been in a relationship, and being in one makes my heart race. But it’s not specifically with him I want a relationship with. 
•I don’t think I’m attracted to him (physically): I absolutely love his personality, but I don’t find him attractive. Like, I don’t feel butterflies in my stomach whenever I see him. I don’t feel the symptoms of attraction.

And here are the reasons why I think I might like him:
•I get a little jealous whenever he talks to other girls.
•I don’t like the thought of never dating him. Again, for context: he’s ill, and he’s having surgery this winter. He might not make it. And whenever I think of never having a romantic relationship with him, I get a little bit sad.
•I like it when he holds me in his arms. Like, his arms are so strong and fit well into mine?

Middle and high school were very very hard on me, I’ve always wanted to escape. When I found the college that I’m at now, it seemed perfect to me. Everyone seemed as if they were like me, but I was wrong.  

There’s no one I can connect with and I can’t make friends. Everyone else here already seems to have their groups which makes it even harder, I think I’ve lost my window. I don’t have time for clubs or anything, I’ve been putting myself out there and talking to all kinds of people, I’m really a very social person and in theory have been doing everything right. It’s so lonely here that I’ve become very severely depressed. I’m on meds and have been for years, but those don’t seem to help and Ive tried therapy and hate it, so that doesn’t help. It all seems almost hopeless. People tell me that I’ll make deep connections with friends at the end of the year or later, but that doesn’t help me now.

I've only been volunteering for Z for 3 weeks; I go in once a week for a full 8 hour day.The first day I spend at the clinic, Z had already found a way to ask me if I had a boyfriend:

Z, talking about dealing with clients who come in with their spouses to appointments: ""...The husbands can be stubborn sometimes, the wives are always much more concerned or details about their condition...You have a boyfriend, right?""

me: ""yeah I do""

Z: ""Okay, right so he can be stubborn sometimes right?""

(I reply yes and the topic is changed)

Later that day when I was about to head out at the end of the day, he decides to bring up some small talk and asks what my weekend plans are; I casually reply that I'm not sure//I'd love to just relax and have a lazy weekend. He then goes: ""What? A young 22 year old like yourself should be having fun! Going out on the town and going to parties, all that stuff."" I just laugh and say ""yeah I guess we'll see, I'm so drained by the end of the weekend."" I wrap up the convo from there and head out.

Next week rolls around and when I come in for my day of shadowing him, the clinic hasn't opened yet so we are just making small-talk. 

Z: ""How was your weekend? Any fun plans?""

Me: ""I actually don't remember what I did on the weekend! Guess that means it was pretty uneventful.""

Z: ""What? Your boyfriend didn't take you out on any fun dates or treat you to anything? That's not right!""

Me: \*nervous laugh b/c I don't know how to answer that\*. 

At my most recent shift at the clinic, I was talking about how I bus everywhere//I have about a 45 min bus ride home to and from the clinic. My sister usually picks me up, and at my most recent shift she did happen to pick me up. We are about 10 minutes into my drive home and I get a call on my phone, it's from Z (I guess he got my number from my resume?). I pick up and he goes:

Z: ""I feel like a complete jerk! I should have offered to drive you home, I can still give you a drive! You just waiting for the bus right now?""

I am polite and say thank you very much for offering but that my sister had actually picked me up, we closed up the conversation and said goodbye/see you next week.

Am I right to be feeling a bit uncomfortable with all this? I find it a bit unprofessional and not really like an expert-student relationship, especially since I have known Z for less than a month. Any advice on how to handle this?

I have known this guy since kindergarten and we are neighbors yet I hardly see him anymore when I used to see him multiple times a week just outside our homes alone. He hardly texts us or interacts with us in any way. We have tried to talk to him about it but he always shuns the conversations and makes some sort of excuse. It has been nearly 5-6 months since he last hung out with us and has missed out on a lot of memorable moments of our lives. We are still teenagers and are living the highlights of our lives right now and wish he was there with us.  We spoke to his sister and she said she hasn't even spoken to him in two months(possibly seen him yet not exchanged any dialogue) which is really bizarre since they live together. 

We have never even met this girlfriend of his and the only information we have received of her is that she is not social and doesn't have that many friends.

I'm in my 30s, and I'm only just realising how much the events of my childhood are impacting on my adult life. Recently, I casually mentioned in conversation a couple of incidents involving my father when I was a small child (he shot me one time, and deliberately electrocuted me another). I brought them up thinking that they were strange but amusing anecdotes - but my friend was visibly shocked that a) it happened, and b) that I didn't think it was that weird.

&amp;#x200B;

There are other incidents I remember, which my mother told me for years 'never happened'. One of these, where he dislocated my jaw with a punch after I accused him of cheating at a board game (I was 8.5 years old), she was particularly adamant 'didn't happen, and he would never have laid hands on you like that'. A little while after he died, two lads who used to work for him and would occasionally drink with him, mentioned (unprompted, and in front of my mother) that he had told them about that incident one evening. After over 20 years being told I was 'either lying or had some kind of false memory' - I felt somewhat vindicated and wanted to get some closure, but she still refuses to talk about it. At the time, anything she was present for or couldn't ignore was generally covered up with ""Yes, but you don't hurt now, so how bad could it have been?"" or ""Other families don't have these things and/or opportunities - they wouldn't understand"" or ""There are kids who have it so much worse, so don't go out moaning about it or kids with bigger problems will be jealous that that's all you have to moan about.""

&amp;#x200B;

I can count on one hand the number of times I was allowed to go to friends' homes as a child. I can count on one finger the number of times I was allowed to have a friend over to mine. I was not allowed to use the phone, go into town, or walk to the shops on my own until I was 15. If I took the train home, my mother would insist that the bus was a better option despite costing twice as much. Once I got a free bus pass from college, she insisted that I should take the train because it was faster. Her flip-flopping continues into the present - where the last time I brought a car she insisted that I get a certain make and model because my father had a couple of them and they would be 'your ideal car'. A friend then turned out to be selling his at a good price, full service history, great condition, low mileage etc. - at which point she flipped to ""Why on EARTH would you want one of THOSE unreliable heaps?"". For reasons which I won't bore you with, she had some measure of control over the portion of money I was going to access for that purchase - which made it impossible to proceed without her agreement. I eventually bought a different car.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a year ahead at school, undersocialised, and had rubbish trainers because we were poor (""smart arse, shit trainers"" might end up being the title of my autobiography...) , and so didn't have a lot of friends to start with. There were incidents at school which could have killed me on several occasions - including significant head traumas, being stabbed, shoved out of a first-floor window, and pushed in front of a speeding car. Two incidents resulted in permanent (though thankfully small) facial scars. This was not a bad school, or in a bad area. It was bullying which started small and crept increasingly out of hand. I finally got into the geek crowd at college, where it was a lot safer, and I made some friends (including my first boyfriend) - but wasn't allowed to socialise with them outside of college hours. At one point, an argument with my parents about this situation resulted in them declaring all of my friends (who they had never met) ""freaks and weirdos"". I pointed out that they had never met them, to which one of them scoffed ""Well they'd have to be to hang out with you..."".

&amp;#x200B;

Even as an adult - my (generally ill and morbidly obese) father would periodically call me at work, then berate me for answering the phone 'instead of doing work'. He would also call me a slut at any opportunity he got - somewhat ironic as I remain a virgin to this day, and he spent nearly his entire adult life having one affair or another. He hated the boyfriend I liked, he tried to guilt me into getting back with the boyfriend I felt uncomfortable with, and repeatedly told me that I ""look like a lesbian trucker"" due to my short hair and practical style.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all - it's only recently that I've begun to realise quite how absurd and abusive my childhood was. I struggle to trust people, and because I wasn't allowed to socialise much when I was younger, I have to manually think through social situations and plan them out in advance. I'll often have a dozen different versions of a conversation rehearsed before I catch up with someone, and parties are extremely draining. I've had a few relationships (2.5 years, 1 year, and 7.5 years \[but that one was complicated\]), but while one of them had some sexual activity - none of them resulted in doing the deed. While most of the time it doesn't bother me, there are sometimes periods when I get insatiably horny, but even then I deal with it myself as the idea of going out and using a man purely for casual sex seems to repulse me. I would have to find someone I trusted, but I also value my freedom and don't want the responsibilities of a full-time relationship. Even maintaining meaningful friendships is difficult. People seem to like me well enough, but I struggle to get past a certain point. I would be there for a bunch of people if they called me at 2am and were in trouble. If I were in that situation - I honestly don't know who I'd call.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. I sort of feel like I'm being selfish sometimes, wanting the best of all worlds. Sometimes, I think maybe I'm being too picky or needy. Sometimes I worry that I'm being unfair, expecting others to live up to the standard I hold myself to. I want to 'fix' this. All I ever wanted, back since my school days, was to be normal and to live a normal life with normal relationships. I know I'm going to have to make efforts and compromises - but I don't know where to start. I've been single for nearly a decade, as it's just been easier that way. How do I even start to look for someone, get them to wait long enough for the trust to be there, and broach the subject of my 'first time' in my mid-30s? How do I find a way to accept that some people might just like me for me, not just what I can do for them?

&amp;#x200B;

669,"Alright a bit of back story me and my friend are super close, we hang on skype basically all day (I'm 22 he's 21, we don't work cos stuff) and have done that for the last 5 years or so cos we both just enjoy being in call

I want to chime in here and say I suffer with a lot of self love issues, I hate myself, I hate how I look, I hate who I am I hate all of that so I feel like these issues might relate to the issue im writing about

Anyway, I've had a longtime issue of being incredibly bitchy and moany when I play video games, enough so that sometimes he just steps away from the call for a couple of hours because he says I give him a headache, I've tried working on it but it's hard so I fully understand his complaints

Sometimes he decides he just doesn't want to be in call with me for a while, ok fair enough i get that that's fine I can be irritating as fuck to deal with sometimes

The way he does it though is after we both go to sleep I'll message him when I wake up and he'll just not respond, he'll be active but intentionally ignore me, not saying anything about that he doesn't owe me a response although it does kinda bother me like I feel he could at the very least just be like 'yeah I dont wanna speak for a few days because you're fucking annoying' but that's besides the point

Me, in my stupid self hating brain, when he wants to just not respond for a while my brain instantly jumps to OH MY GOD HE HATES ME THATS IT WERE NEVER SPEAKING AGAIN IM SUCH A PIECE OF SHIT IM SUCH A BAD PERSON I FUCKING HATE MYSELF and then I try to seek reassurance that he doesn't hate me and I message the poor kid fucking excessively asking if we're fine and double triple and quadruple checking we're ok with each other which pisses him off immensely, but then I notice im pissing him off and I think OH GOD IVE PISSED HIM OFF HE HATES ME WERE NEVER SPEAKING AGAIN so I message to seek reassurance again and you see the issue

He wants a break from me, I'm an ignorant asshole sometimes I get that, but I get stuck in this horrible cycling of constantly feeling he hates me, then pissing me off by wanting reassurance he doesn't hate me

I do this stupid thing, where I convince myself he doesn't like me so much that if I'm not the one to engage in the conversation he'll never message me and we'll never speak to each other again so that also leads to me feeling inclined to message even when I know I shouldn't its like I just feel constantly anxious until I sent a message

How can I help myself to get over this stupid mindset so I can stop bugging my friend excessively because it's not fair how much I bug him sometimes and I take responsobility for that it's something I genuinely want to work on because ya know there's clearly an issue when he doesn't wanna speak to you for over a week ya know?

I don't get close to people often and I have few people in my life I can say with 100% certainty I would trust with my life and who I'd genuinely take a bullet for and he's one of them, I just kind of don't know how to act sometimes in these situations because I'm not used to being close to people ya know? but that's not fair on him having to deal with how stupid I act sometimes

Sorry I kinda went on a tangent, any advice is greatly appreciated",14Sep2019,1

673,"I have no idea how to handle this situation. My parents are in general not good about health problems, big or small. My mom tends to go to extremes, either treating it like it's nothing or becoming over invested. 

My brother in law has Crohns, which has recently caused complications and he has to have chemo to treat some growths which may become cancerous. Neither my BIL, or my sister (his wife) have told me anything about this; my mom has informed me that my BIL has been sending out updates to my parents and my older brother. I'm not included in this email ring for whatever reason; I'm 10 years younger than my older sister and BIL, so maybe the age gap is part of the reason.

Still, about every week, my mom spends about 20 minutes updating me on my BIL's health problems, which I did not ask for, and afaik my BIL and sister did not ask her to. This week my mom gave me her standard 20 minute update, which I said I hope it turned out well, and that as usual I am not in this email chain so I didn't know about it. She offered to send it to me, as it has information about his treatment and such.

I felt like this was way too much information and begged her not to send it to me. She said she understood, as my SIL does not send out any information about her health problems either. 

But now I'm in a conundrum. I feel like not only can I not ask my mother to stop telling me about these health problems, I feel like I need to reach out and offer condolences to my older sister, which I'm somewhat horrified by. On one hand I feel like since she hasn't been telling me about it, I would be over reaching these boundaries by saying something. On the other hand, now that I know I feel like I'm under obligation to say something.

My BIL and sister and I are not close. I don't really talk about my life with them, and they don't share much with me unless I see them as a family function. This is another reason I would feel it would be extremely awkward to reach out to them.

675,"Ok, so.. Basically as I said, I've started texting with someone I like.

However, we only talked a few times over reddit but it has been hours we have talked with each other each time. Now we have finally switched from reddit to whatsapp as he has no issue handing out his number to me.. 

He seems generally interested in me and we have a natural flow, we talk about deep and meaningful things. 

Anyway, everything has been smooth sailing and talking to him is incredibly easy. It feels natural and light.

Anyway, these past few times we've settled and spoken I have been the one to initiate the conversation. He does however gladly answer and talk to me after. 

So my question is.. Would it be best just to not write to him and wait and see if he really respond first?

Ive read it's important to let someone miss you and see if they actually do wanna talk to you by letting them text first sometimes.

It's just hard. I know the basic advice here is just to tell me to focus on my own hobbies and give him time to respond so I don't ""pressure"" him.

It's just feels like a game and I hate playing it.

676,"I visited a nearby hotel a few weeks ago because my best friend was staying there, and I got to chatting with the lady at the front desk. She told me that they needed more front desk agents because they were short staffed, and handed me an application.

I was really excited about this because I've been looking for a job for a while, the hotel is very close to my school and home, and small, which is good because I like to help customers but not in a stressful environment, and they have a great starting rate. It's just exactly what I need. So I filled out the application, attached my resume to the back and returned it to the hotel 5 days later. 

I gave the app to a lady who was standing in front, and she said that she was the director of something, but that the hiring manager wasn't in today so he'd look at it on Tuesday when he gets in. I thanked her and left. 

Tuesday comes and goes, no word. So I call back on Friday (a week after I gave the application) and ask if the manager is in so I can see whether my application was received. Front desk says they'll transfer me to his office. So I wait, and it goes to voicemail. I leave a nice message stating why i was calling and that I hope to hear from them soon.

5 more days go by, no word. So I give them  a call again, talk to front desk again, and ask when the hiring manager will be in. They say he's gone today and should be in tomorrow, they don't know what time. Maybe the morning. 

(Maybe?? You don't know the schedule?)

So I thank them and say i'll call back tomorrow.

I call back the next day around noon. They tell me the manager has gone out to lunch and if I could call back in an hour, he should be able to speak to me. I say okay, sure, i'll call back in an hour then. 

Call back in an hour, a new front desk person picks up, and I explain why I'm calling. He says that he thinks the manager went home for the day, and maybe he can transfer me so I can leave a message on his phone.

I'm frustrated now, and I sadly say that I'd rather not because no one got back to me the last time I left a message. He apologizes for that and offers to take my name and number and leave it on the manager's desk so that he can call me in the morning.

That was on Thursday. He didn't call me Friday.

Should I give up? Should I go visit the hotel this week when I think he'll be in? Am I being annoying or crazy? I just really really want this job and I don't understand why it's so hard to speak to someone, especially if they need help and my resume is pretty good. This is really disappointing.",14Sep2019,1
677,"I’m 18, and I just graduated from high school in June. Before I graduated, I was accepted to a few colleges and I ended up picking one that was out of state because of family pressure and problems. The tuition was pretty high because I’m an oos student, but I ended up committing to it. This got my hopes up, as well as my family’s. The only person that really questioned my decision was my step-dad, but I was too blindsided by everyone else's opinion. I’m a people pleaser, which is something that needs to change. Anyways, I didn’t end up going to this college because it was too expensive and mentally I wasn’t ready after recent events.

I ended up getting raped by a guy I was seeing before graduation. It was just a really horrible situation, and I didn’t come out to other people about it until 3 weeks after it occurred. I felt so guilty and responsible for what happened, that it messed me up really bad mentally. It ended up getting tossed under the rug after I went to the police, and all my mom told me is to “not let it take over my life”. I’ve been seeing a counselor weekly, and while it has been helping, I just don’t know how to get my life back.

I also lost my “best” friend as this was happening. I found out that she was talking shit about me during our friendship and was using me. She was the first one I told about me getting assaulted because I got scared of how my parents would react. She was even the one to encourage me to tell them in the first place. It shocked me when I found out that she was telling everyone I “deserved” what happened to me. I have no clue why she would say that, and I have no clue what I did to piss her off that much. It just makes me laugh because she was trying to act like everything was okay and texted me asking to hang out when I hit her with the screenshots of the conversations of her saying disgusting things about me.

Lately, it’s also been really hard to watch all my friends go off to college while I stay at home and go to CC. There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s just not the path I ever saw myself going down. I was supposed to be the first one in my family to go straight to a 4-year college, and it just breaks my heart that I let everyone down. Since I was young, I’ve been so excited to leave home, but I guess I never put in the full research to make it happen. I didn’t have very good guidance around me because most of my family hasn't gone to college. But part of the reason that I wanted to leave was my mom. She has this “victim” mentality, and I cannot stand it anymore. I’ve even found myself taking it on at times as well, which is not how I want to live my life. It’s always everyone else’s fault but hers. She has this viewpoint that she does everything for everyone, and we all owe her the fucking world. My step-dad use to tell me all the time that he doesn't want me to end up like her (unmotivated and stuck). She sits on her ass, but complains that no one does anything. Not to mention, she only works 4 days a week because she “has to take Friday off to do household chores”. It’s funny because when I’m home on Fridays, she does like 2 or 3 things and then sits on her ass in front of the TV in her room or is asleep. Idk, it’s just frustrating and extremely toxic.

I’m also taking 18 credits this semester and I’m going to be volunteering at a hospital regularly soon, as well as joining a few clubs. My dad wants me to get a job, but I’m not sure how I would fit this into my schedule. I spend so much time studying because I’m taking heavy classes, not to mention my classes are split between morning and night because I take care of my sister after school so my parents don’t have to get a babysitter or pay for after school care (this saves them a few hundred a month). I also have to figure out how to get enough money in the next 2 years to transfer to a 4-year college because my parents won't co-sign a student loan if I end up needing one.

I just don’t know how to get my life back together, or where to start. I feel like I’m drowning, and I have no one to turn to. Any advice would be great, no matter what it is. Thank you.",14Sep2019,2

684,"So, a little bit of background...

I'm 26(M) working as a Software Engineer in a small company (\~ 50 members staff)  and have been working in this company for about 3 years. I was one of the top performers in the company consecutively for these past 3 years.

Since, I have been a top performer, they started giving more work to me and making me to work in office for 12-14 hrs a day on multiple projects. To make things worse, I am working on 2 projects right now and I have to take my work laptop to home on weekends to support from home. I started feeling like they are taking me for granted. Our CEO doesn't even care. All he wants is to get the work done. No facilities. Not a good pay scale when compared to the work we've doing. My whole work-life balance got messed up.

Lately, they started micro managing the employees. They are taking away the freedom in the office. This has gone to such an extent that, they've installed CC Cameras all over the office, to watch over what people are doing during their work time. If somebody is taking a break/refresh time, they would be asked for explanation why aren't they working at desk and things like that. 

My company works in a totally different technology stack, which is pretty old and rarely used. I have been recently pulled into a new project which requires me to do some level of training specific to that project under this ""rare technology stack"". 

But, I am planning to leave this company ASAP. For me to leave, I should start learning the technology stack which are currently in demand to get a job such as Java, JS, NodeJS, ReactJS, etc., because I do not want my next job to be on this same tech stack which is pretty old.

Okay... now to the advice part. I am sooo confused in making a decision whether to take the training for this ""new project"" or to put my papers and give my resignation and just leave the company...

The problem is... If I take this ""new project"", I know for sure that I wouldn't get time to update/prepare myself for the interviews. If I don't, I would be given a negative review and would be thrown out, which I don't want to happen because I have loans to pay and there are people who are dependent on me.

I need advice on.. How can I handle this situation tactfully, so that I could prepare for the interviews as well as working in this project? How can I make them understand that I cannot spend more than 8 hrs a day in the office and do not want work on weekends, so that I get time to prepare for the interviews?

No matter what, I am leaving this company for sure. But how can I make this to happen smoothly?

702,"Hi guys! I need some advice on something that just happened to me... this turned out to be a long post so sorry in advance!!

So this coming March I will be going to Cuba with my very close friend and her family (it’s a fairly large sized group ~25ish people).  I have already paid my deposit for the trip which was $150 

My friends uncle is one of the people coming on the trip which until like a week ago, I thought was pretty cool since he was someone I actually knew and have spoken to before.  Our relationship (me and the uncle) up until a week ago was very chill, like he was one of those “cool” uncles that would let my friend and I use his place to smoke weed and do shrooms.  He never did anything weird, and would usually just let us do our own thing and maybe join us in watching tv.  I’ve met him like around 4 times, since his place isn’t the closest and usually my friend and I can hang out at one of our own places.  Our interactions were friendly and we had normal conversations.

So after being added to the group chat on Facebook, the uncle must’ve seen my profile and then friend requested me.  I added him back, thinking nothing of it, and was a bit surprised when I received a message from him like 5 min later.  He messaged hello and stuff and then was like “hi sweetheart how are you doing?? And please don’t say anything to [my friend], I have a question.” I responded a bit later saying hello back and that I was doing fine, and to ask away! (I thought he was going to surprise her with a gift or something). He then messaged me saying “I want you in a way I can’t say”.  Obviously I was shook and didn’t open the message and he must’ve got all nervous because he then messaged me more as time passed and I still wasn’t responding

“I’m all high and can’t believe I said that” 
“Want to get high??”
“Sorry”
“Hey I apologize for real”
“Shit say something?? Don’t worry this will never happen again”

After talking to my other best friend, we came up with a response: “for [my friend]’s sake, I’m going to ignore what you said... but I’m glad this isn’t going to happen again” to which he opened and read, and has not responded since.

Now my whole dilemma is this: do I tell my friend or no?  This will obviously ruin her relationship with the guy and they are really close... over the past few years she has talked to me about how they’ve grown so close and how he’s opening up to her and her to him. I don’t want to ruin this relationship for her, and so I have not yet told her.  Telling her might also ruin the uncles relationship with the rest of her family, depending on how she deals with it.  

However I am now a little uncertain about the upcoming Cuba trip - like it is gonna be in 6ish months - so maybe it won’t be awkward then?  I now have to be wary about his presence there, obviously I don’t want to assume the worst but you can never be too careful, especially when people are drunk.  I hate that I now am going to worry about what I’m going to wear and cover up my bathing suit... I also hate that he made this so damn awkward when I was looking forward to having a nice trip with my friend.

So guys, what do you think I should do?

I am hoping that Starbucks makes a quick offer as well but I’m nervous they will get back to me after I’ve already been training for a few weeks at the theater.

713,"Alright a bit of back story me and my friend are super close, we hang on skype basically all day (I'm 22 he's 21, we don't work cos stuff) and have done that for the last 5 years or so cos we both just enjoy being in call

I want to chime in here and say I suffer with a lot of self love issues, I hate myself, I hate how I look, I hate who I am I hate all of that so I feel like these issues might relate to the issue im writing about

Anyway, I've had a longtime issue of being incredibly bitchy and moany when I play video games, enough so that sometimes he just steps away from the call for a couple of hours because he says I give him a headache, I've tried working on it but it's hard so I fully understand his complaints

Sometimes he decides he just doesn't want to be in call with me for a while, ok fair enough i get that that's fine I can be irritating as fuck to deal with sometimes

The way he does it though is after we both go to sleep I'll message him when I wake up and he'll just not respond, he'll be active but intentionally ignore me, not saying anything about that he doesn't owe me a response although it does kinda bother me like I feel he could at the very least just be like 'yeah I dont wanna speak for a few days because you're fucking annoying' but that's besides the point

Me, in my stupid self hating brain, when he wants to just not respond for a while my brain instantly jumps to OH MY GOD HE HATES ME THATS IT WERE NEVER SPEAKING AGAIN IM SUCH A PIECE OF SHIT IM SUCH A BAD PERSON I FUCKING HATE MYSELF and then I try to seek reassurance that he doesn't hate me and I message the poor kid fucking excessively asking if we're fine and double triple and quadruple checking we're ok with each other which pisses him off immensely, but then I notice im pissing him off and I think OH GOD IVE PISSED HIM OFF HE HATES ME WERE NEVER SPEAKING AGAIN so I message to seek reassurance again and you see the issue

He wants a break from me, I'm an ignorant asshole sometimes I get that, but I get stuck in this horrible cycling of constantly feeling he hates me, then pissing me off by wanting reassurance he doesn't hate me

I do this stupid thing, where I convince myself he doesn't like me so much that if I'm not the one to engage in the conversation he'll never message me and we'll never speak to each other again so that also leads to me feeling inclined to message even when I know I shouldn't its like I just feel constantly anxious until I sent a message

How can I help myself to get over this stupid mindset so I can stop bugging my friend excessively because it's not fair how much I bug him sometimes and I take responsobility for that it's something I genuinely want to work on because ya know there's clearly an issue when he doesn't wanna speak to you for over a week ya know?

I don't get close to people often and I have few people in my life I can say with 100% certainty I would trust with my life and who I'd genuinely take a bullet for and he's one of them, I just kind of don't know how to act sometimes in these situations because I'm not used to being close to people ya know? but that's not fair on him having to deal with how stupid I act sometimes

Sorry I kinda went on a tangent, any advice is greatly appreciated

TLDR; friend wants a break from being in call with me sometimes due to my raging, I hate myself enough to the point I instantly think he must hate me, message him too much trying to get confirmation he doesn't in fact hate me + message him whenever I feel sad even if I dont want a reply just cos it feels like I'm talking to someone which helps me but the many messages dont help him and I want to be able to convince myself he doesn't hate me whenever he wants a break from listening to me whine at video games",14Sep2019,1

Year 13 started on the 5th September and I still haven't been into school. We contacted my previous therapist and saw a GP who told me to stay off this week and that they'll write letters to my school as medical evidence etc. 

My mum spoke to my head of year on Wednesday after school and she seems supportive. She has told my mum for now that she'll ask my teachers not to overhwlem me with emails on work I've missed and threw around ideas such as only doing half days, having somewhere I can go to be alone etc.

My head of year wants another meeting on Tuesday with me present and to discuss options which might it possible for me to cope this year but I'm struggling to think of anything. 

I've been trying to think about what is causing me to avoid school. A lot of it is the idea of another year of exhaustion. I barely have the energy to make it through a 6 period day, and by the time I'm home I'm too tired to do anything enjoyable OR productive. I can't handle the thought of that for another year. 

I'm currently taking maths, further maths and English language, and I want to study Linguistics at university. Right now my only idea is dropping further maths and doing my two exams this summer, then finding a way to do a whole A-level next year (maybe French) but I don't know if this is reasonable and I'm scared to bring it up and be, idk, judged?

717,"Haven’t used this sub in months but I feel it is time again to ask.

So, in May, my best friend of Five Years asked for one hundred dollars for lawyers fees in a [West Coast State] for a traffic ticket. I relented and have him the money, and he said he’ll pay it back. 

I let it accumulate for about 3 months and a half, which is seven paychecks. I ask him for the money. I was patient enough for this long, and he delivered $50 of the grand total. So far he followed through. 

Now I asked him last week to pay the rest back and he agrees. He texts me today and basically says this:

“I got a call from the District Clerk Of *insert Bordertown here* and said my phone number was connected to ‘solicitation’ of Sexual Services illegally, and relating it to a missing illegal who 17 y/o and female. They wanted me to pay for a psych test and I agreed and barely found out it was a scam when I paid. I didn’t want to look like a pedo so I did that. My girlfriends family knows and my own family knows. He even gave me a badge number and the phone number was legit.” 


There is inconsistencies in this story, because I think ICE and HSI would have to visit each possible suspect of a potential murder/trafficking/ sex Trafficking ring if the people are accessible. 

Secondly, If there was a crime involved like this, why is he even talking details of a case he could be indicted on if true? This would hurt his case more than help it.

I believe I have this man way too much time to pay it off. But he has also been my best friend for the best part of 5 years, nearing six years. 

He’s paid me back before, but I feel that he should’ve at least given the money in a timely manner. There were points where I could’ve really used $100 for necessities.

You see, I started band late and by the time I joined, everyone already knew each other and had friends.

724,"So this was originally going to be a post about how to deal with me not being happy with my job. How I'm having anxiety and deep depression. How my boss is abusive and discriminates against me. Which I will go into, but as I have thought multiple iterations of what I want to say... or in this case ask. I realized while i still need to ask about how to deal with my job. I realized my real question is, how do i be happy? How do i swing things in my favor ... how do i win for once in my life? .... let me give you a little context. 


So I work for a very small security company that installs cameras and other things. I am their IT guy, order managment and logistics guy. All around I need this done guy. The job is stressful some days but that is not the issue. The two owners are, one of them let's call her Karen is. She started off straight forward but nice. But as 3 or 4 monthes passed , she grew bored of me. She became cold, condescending, manipulative and all around rude. (that's the nice way of saying it) I have recently started taking ADD medicine as now that I am on my own insurance , I can get some of the mental help I need with out my family or my quasi adoptive family finding out. As my biological family is super religious ( Jehovah witness) and my adoptive family that took me in is old school Military. I started this 2 months into my current job. 

So as I started this medication, my lateness stopped and I was getting my stuff correct and I was getting better. But my treatment at this job got worse. Then a new person started who I was told to teach my job. At this point what I now realize as anxiety kicked in. And it has been everyday at work. This new guy is 100% cool and is on my side. He sees my anxiety and is helping me stay organized and making sure I'm on time. Which I appreciate, but I am treated cold now by both owners. For example, we are rolling out a new health monitoring service for clients camera systems. I recently went through a claim and went to my boss Karen about what the next step is or any advice she could give me. Her response was "" I pay you right? Well I pay you to be better at your job then I am. You should be able to come up with the next step. You should be creative enough. You shouldn't be coming to me. So figure it out. "" mind you this is in front of the new person as well. 
This put me into a depressive state all day. And I am not sure if it was the new meds or the situation but I could not get out of it. After starting this job, I've went from doing weed randomly for fun to everyday to feel something. I am having dark thoughts that if I was the friend of anyone else, would be red flags. I have anxiety everyday and depression. 

To top it all off , I am moving out of my adoptive parents place who took me in when my biological parents rejected me for not following their religion. October is my final date, there is no if and or but. I cant go to either family about this. Because both answers would be either, tuff up from one family or get bariated for bot being with Jehovah. I'm scared lost and dont know what to do. Only reason I dont end it is because I know it will effect other negatively. 

So my ask reddit question is, not just how to deal with my job. But more .. how do I become happy? I would love to go to school and get a degree. Or get a job that let's me adventure around. Have a truck and trailer/camper and travel. Something that isn't were I am now... how do i win? 
I am sorry to rant and make this long, but I truthfully dont know what to do. How to help myself and get somewhere positive in life. I see all my friends married and happy. I am just here pretending to be happy and going through the motions.

She and I would like to kind of do friends w benefits , neither of us want to be dating or even having sex, we literally just want to be able to make out and go to sleep next to each other every once and a while. I’m feeling extremely guilty and unsure about what to do next. I feel like I should tell my ex but also am so certain it will hurt his feelings so much. I guess I just want to know if it’s a really really shitty thing to do if we tell him and keep hooking up or if I should just stop this now before it gets messy. I’m conflicted between wanting to be with this person who I’ve wanted for so long and feeling beholden to my ex and extremely guilty. I’m just a wreck, any wisdom would be so appreciated",14Sep2019,1
729,"Hey guys this is my first ever Reddit post so I'm not sure how to format this. Anyways, on Friday September 13th someone tried to break into my apartment. Coincidence right? Didn't even notice it was till after. So here's my true story. I'm a senior in a new high school that's far from my school, so I ride the transfer bus home. I get home around 3:45 pm. My brothers are at work by then so it's just me and my mom home. I settle and do the basics, eat and whatever play a few league games.

I think around 5pm is when everything started. My mom comes in my room and tells me someone rang the bell. I told her to let me check maybe it's a package, even though I hadn't ordered anything. I check and no one is there. Strange right? Then a few min passes and it happens AGAIN. So I tell my mom to not go outside. Then someone knocks near my wall, and I yell for them to stop. At this point I'm irritated and just wanna watch YouTube at peace! Doorbell keeps ringing. I keep trying to catch the person in the act, but every single time I look at the peephole the person is gone! I text my boyfriend and he tells me maybe it's kids playing ding-dong ditch. Makes sense! I used to do that. My mom is getting annoyed so I tell her to ignore it, they just want a reaction from us. It was on and off anyway. 

About 2 hours passed and I'm getting tired. I wake up around 5 am sometimes 4 am to catch the bus for school. So I get ready for bed, and just as I'm gonna lady down I hear a loud noise that sounds like a gunshot and my window breaking. I scream so loud that my mom start comes from the other room and starts to scream. My apartment has weird room doors were you can open it from inside and outside with literally your fingernail. So, we didn't really know were to hide. We decided to do the laundry room because we can put rice boxes in front of the door. I call 911, and boy the operator was so fucking annoying. Had to tell that bitch my address 5 times. Then I tell her the story and it's like she didn't even listen -\_-. Then she transferred me to the police department and had to tell the other one multiple times. Also, my mom just doesn't know how to stfu. If the person was in the house and heard her we would have been caught. 

The police get here and want us to open the door. I was scared to go out because a min before that I heard the person trying to get in from the front door too. The 911 operator tells me to go it's the police. I go and tell the officer everything. We go outside to see what happened to my window. Turns out the person used a piece of fence and hit the window. Thankfully the window is double paneled. Guessing when the person heard how loud we screamed that it was time too run. Even though none of our bullshit neighbors came to help. Fucking pussy's they wanna come when the cops are here. The cops did absolutely nothing! As I assumed because they never do jack shit were I live! Fuck America right? They're were more concerned about the smell of my mom's food. They asked when it would be ready.

Anyways, I tell the female officer who I think may have done it. I assumed my ex-Best Friend and her family. Why? They've done someone crazy shit before, and they usually wait till people least expect it to do that. I won't specify what exactly unless y'all really wanna know then maybe. I haven't talked to her since July, when I called the cops last time. That's a whole other story to tell that I don't feel like typing right now. Officer asks me why I suspect her. I say, because the knocking was only on my bedroom wall and my window was the only one broken. She's been in my apartment before, she knows were stuff is. She also lives a 10 min walk from my house. She says she can't go to their house and ask any questions because they didn't see them in the act. She gives me the police stations office and says to call if this happens again. She's usually in the complex till like 8:30pm. She also tells me that if I really think it's her, then I should call them and make a complaint and they can investigate it. 

She leaves and I start crying. Out of nowhere this just had to happen. My day was actually going good before. I usually don't like A days at school, but today was great. During JROTC I ran 2 laps without stopping. Which I never do because I didn't know how to run. My AP LIT class didn't feel so awkward anymore( I feel like a dumb ass in that class + I don't know anyone in that).  Also, had a good time at lunch with my supposed best friend(I'll tell u why later) and other friends. 

My brothers get home and we talk about it. We all think that it's my ex best friend. I'm just like okay maybe it was, the really problem is this apartment. Just last month someone go shot right near the gate at our complex. People have tried to rob us before. People even steal packages. I live all the way in the back were the fence is. Anyone can stretch the fence and get in. Drunk people, and high people( god I hate the smell of weed). 

The only reason we hadn't moved before was because of my bitchy brother. He's rather live in a crime area so he doesn't have to wake up earlier to go to work. LIKE DUDE YOU HAVE A CAR WHAT'S WAKING UP 5-10 MINS EARLY GONNA DO TO YOU? I start to yell at him saying WE NEED TO MOVE OUT. He blames me for this happening. Even though I haven't talked to my ex best friend IN 2 MONTHS! I actually feel as though they probably moved, they move a lot. My other brother yells at him for blaming it on me. You may be asking why don't you, your mom, and your other brother just move out? Well, can't they both pay the rent. My mother is in her 50's and she doesn't know English very well, can't drive, pretty much stays at home and cooks. 

Anyways, my mom's friends come over to comfort us, not really me though. They left and I began to cry and think about suicide. I know this might be over dramatic, but I've dealt with a lot of crap in my life. I don't know how I'm alive by now. Maybe I should have just died. I don't wanna leave my mom home alone again, I need her. My dad passed 4 years ago I can't lose her. I don't feel safe at all. No one is really helping me cope with this. Every time I hear a slight noise I jump up. I  have bad anxiety now. Made a snapchat and instagram post saying I'm done with life and that I'm gonna kill myself. That's really how I was feeling last night. Today is the day after and I'm feeling somewhat better, I guess. After they leave I let the police station know who I think may be the suspect.

You know what's disappointing? You'd expect you ""best friend"" to respond or try to help you. I reached out to him but ig he just doesn't care or thinks my snap post was a joke. Maybe it was because we've only been friends for a month. Really upset about that. I feel as though I can't look him in the face at school anymore or anyone who's seen my snap and haven't tried to help me. I'm no attention whore. I usually don't even do that, but no one has helped me honestly.

Continuing on, I've been crying all day. I have a DEP meeting for the Air Force on Monday, but I'm scared to go and leave my mom home alone. It's from 3:30-5:00 p.m. My brothers will be at work. My neighbors aren't jack shit. What is she gonna do if that happens again? She can barley even speak English :(. You might say to just call my recruiter, but I already missed the last meeting. I didn't have a ride and school was getting in the way. If I miss this one there's a chance I'll be kicked out. I don't wanna piss my recruiter off anymore. I'm thinking maybe if it happens again I'll let him know. 

Today my mom told me that the fence he used, was near the dumpster earlier in the day when she went to throw the trash away. Also forgot to mention this weird creepy dude that's always asking us for money. He'll have the most fake reasons, like my mother is in new orleans and I need to go see her, or my aunt is in the hospital. Some are pretty bizarre but he's done this so many times we know it's fake. Like come one he doesn't even live in the complex. He just wants free money so he can sit on his ass. One time he even followed my brother to the door and when he tried to get in my mom shut the door on him. Apparently my mom thinks he's the one that has been doing this, because he's the only other person to know were we live other than the new neighbors in front of us. 

Anyways, please give me some advice.

Forgot to tell you I'm only 17 and a female.",14Sep2019,4
730,"Is it normal for parents to threaten to leave if you've been bad?

I always start to cry whenever I get home from school. And whenever I see them at school, they look so happy. I wish I was still apart of their friend group.
They decided to break me off because we all had this huge fight over text. I said something very rude to them, that hurt them so much. After a while I apologized, but they didnt accept it. I kept asking them after that, if they could still be my friend and apologized once again. They still said no. 
I dont know what to even do. I made new friends at school, but it's still not the same. I want my old friends back. 
I just need some help and advice. Please.

733,"(TW: Gun violence &amp; murder)

Throwaway account &amp; on mobile, so I apologize for any typos or formatting issues. 

A little under two months ago, a close friend of mine was murdered outside of his home. After a robbery, he wandered outside to try and look for anything suspicious and noticed a car parked closely to the home. Upon asking the driver if he lived in the neighborhood, he discovered his stolen items in the back of the car and within minutes was shot dead. He was only a few yards away from his home. His children were inside. His wife watched it happen. Both my boyfriend &amp; I were shattered, along with a very large friend group that were also affected heavily by his death. We surrounded the family in love. Donations paid for his funeral. He had so many friends, so much family that still does whatever we can to keep his children happy &amp; taken care of. He was my boyfriends best friend. His wife was mine. I always told them they were going to be out backyard BBQ family, the ones we still had parties with in 20 years with our kids running around the yard. Their little girl considered our daughter her cousin. They were our family. 

A month ago, the wife was arrested. There has been no court date set, there has been no statements released, but it was obvious within the first 24 hours after speaking to his family that she was involved. Heavily. It was everywhere for over a week. News articles all over facebook, nasty comments all over her account, too many reposts to even stomach being on anymore. I had to leave social media for the week. 

I’ve known her since elementary school. She visited me in the hospital postpartum. She held our child while she explained how he died to us prior to her arrest. She was one of my closest &amp; only friends. I’m still grieving from losing him, and when she got arrested it was like the scab was ripped clean off the wound. Everything was fresh and hurt just as bad. It’s unbelievable to me that she could do that to her own husband, her own children. There’s two babies that’ll never see their parents again, and if they do it’ll be their mother through a glass window. Everytime I think about them, I ache. Its like it hasn’t gotten any better. I still break down knowing we’ll never see him again. I’ll never be invited to stay for dinner with them again. We’ll never see another family picture. We’ll never have that backyard BBQ in 20 years. It breaks me, every time. 

Even at 23, I’ve never dealt with death this closely. My great grandparents passed away in their sleep when I was 10/11, but I was too young to understand the tragedy of it, because they went peacefully, together, and I was satisfied with that. It’s how they wanted to go. I believed wherever they went, they were happy. This, though... I can’t wrap my mind around, still. I don’t know how to cope. Does it ever get better? Will we ever stop missing him? Will I ever stop feeling guilty for missing her, too? How the hell do I even begin to deal with this properly?",14Sep2019,1
735,"So recently, I've found myself in a depression rut (I know, shocking right?) Like literally what else is new? But ANYWAY, I've been thinking a lot about starting up my own YouTube channel, but I'm not sure what my content would even be about other than just having a place to vent/where others would be able to vent as well. SO I guess I'm just really asking is, is this a good idea? To start a channel out of loneliness, I mean. Would anyone even watch?

I'll seriously work straight till Sunday evening not knowing if I'm needed Monday morning, that's how bad it is.)

I'm in California if it matters.

If I have to take those appointments Tues-Thurs, I don't know what to tell them. I was also scheduled in a way where if I didn't show up, it'd hurt the whole team pretty severely. I don't understand why they would do this if not to try and intentionally make me miss shifts that can't be missed.",14Sep2019,1

739,I just got into it with my mom and I’m so fucking livid. We got into a fight about my car insurance. So I recently got a new car and every month she wants me to give her $100 for the insurance. I recently gave her the $100 this week and when I asked her about my insurance to put in my car she was being very vague and said she didn’t have it. which led me to believe that she didn’t put insurance in my car. I confronted her about this and she started screaming at me and told me to “ go fuck my self” and that I am a “bitch.” Mind you I’m 21 and she’s a grown ass woman pushing 40 talking to her daughter like that. I slowly got up and left her house walking away from the situation before things got worse. She then slammed the door and proceeded to yell. I don’t know what to do. I try to be very respectful but when she talks to me like that I lose all my respect for her. I’m literally crying because of how angry I am. I don’t deserve to be treated like this for wanting to protect my new car. I don’t plan on speaking to her until she talks to me in a civil matter and apologizes to me. I do so much for her and for her to treat me this way literally breaks my heart. What should I do? Any advice is very much appreciated.,14Sep2019,2
741,"So a few days ago I was at a joint birthday party. I have this bright and charismatic friend who was also there. He's a nice dude and is liked by our other friends, but he's known to joke about and roast practically everyone consistently. He can dish it out but he can't take it. So towards the end of the night I split from the rest of the party to smoke up and started to drink too. We ended up playing Smash and the usual videogame trash talk began. We had a couple of matches, trash talking and laughing, and then wrapped it up. We were talking about kicking someone's ass awfully like ""damn bro you gotta move states"" and ""you gotta retire the whole game"". 

My dumb ass was faded and I said ""yeah fam when that happens you just gotta dip at that point, all your friends don't even like you they pretending to like you and you in the wrong function"". He immediately took it hard and walked out the place we were. Me and another friend went looking for him for 45 minutes and couldn't find him, and during that time the possibility of me hurting him sunk in. We found him back in the place later on chilling but separate from everyone else.

I tried to apologize but he said he needed to disassociate for a bit. I left early to give him space but he's been posting some introspective and troubling messages on social media and groupchats alluding to suicidal thoughts. I didn't mean for my words to be hurtful, I was joking. However I know that they hurt him and either dug up or triggered negative emotions and I just want him to be alright. I don't know if I should apologize again with more depth or just give him space. I usually handle my problems in private but I am remorseful and worried. I feel like I caused an unnecessary amount of pain to a friend and I don't know how to make it right without making it worse. What should/can I do?",14Sep2019,15

747,"know this is a long post but bare with me here, I met this girl online, we were hitting it off pretty well, she would always snapchat me pictures of her face and ask questions about me with legnthy captions, I decided to ask her out on a date to get sushi and go bowling and she said she would love to, she lives an hour away from me so I thought this was a good sign she is into me, when she arrived I hugged her and said nice to me you finally, it was a little awkward at first but I started to warm things up and talking about deep topics like passions, hobbies, our past all that stuff. At the end of the night she said she had a curfew so I just respected that, hugged her goodbye she thanked me for everything. The next day I snapchatted her asking if she got home alright she say yes she did and thanked me again, I told her I had a good time and we should get together again sometime she said she would love to do that. So then for a week we snapchatted each other as usual, I think I made the mistake of asking her about her childhood, she gave me a pretty long response to that and asked about mine, so for the next couple of days I was pretty busy with stuff and asked if she would want to talk on the phone instead and she said she would love to so she gave me her number and I asked when's she will be free to talk, I didn't get a reply to that, I snapchatted her to keep our streak going and it took her like 10 hours to open and reply with a picture of a wall and a short response, she's taking a lot longer to reply now and I'm not sure why, so I opened her last snap and left her on read, thinking about laying off for a couple days and then texting her again, what do y'all think I should do",14Sep2019,1

754,"Some backstory here:

I'm a 24 year old guy in university and for a while now I have had a crush on this girl whose been in several of my classes for quite some time now. Rewinding the clocks back, during second year and third year we were friends, we talked a lot and joked around nothing really came about. This girl has history with my ex-bestfriend because he fucked her over in first year; he went to her with a party, got head from her and he left with another girl leaving her sobbing because she had a crush on him. I had no idea my friend treated girls very poorly until he cheated with his ex about 3-4 times and I knew about all the occasions. Personally, I've had long-terms, I have had flings on tinder and what not but I would like to think I am not a fuckboy. However, when I found out about my friends cheating I told him to stop because his ex was one of my really good friends who was also friends with the girl I like. So, when the word got out about his cheating I was assumed semi-responsible and thus I was no better than my ex-bestfriend. As time went on I apologized and made things right between everyone except my ex-bestfriend. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem happened when I sent a message to my friend explaining my stance on his BS excuses of why he cheated and how against relationships he was and that he knew I liked this girl and ruined everything by placing me in that view. Of course, the message ended up on her phone because he sent it around like wildfire once we were no longer friends and she approached me giving me the friendzone talk because ""she cant trust me"". A few weeks pass and its exam time, I am really studious and try my best to do well and shes smart but gets really flustered during exam times. I wrote up an entire exam review and did all the questions + solutions for the exam and lied to her telling her ""I did this for myself and sent it to a bunch of my friends just to make sure everyone did well"". I actually never write notes I memorize through my laptop, also, I sat her down and drilled the material into her. She got an 85 on the final exam and overall 80 whereas she most likely would have had a 70 saving her average. I even waited for her after the exam just to see if she did well. I never said anything about helping her out, she really did study hard in the end and deserves the grades.

&amp;#x200B;

Her birthday was coming up in the summer right around june and I planned out a really nice card with 3 gift cards of everything she made me think of her and a sweet but not overbearing message inside. Time and time again i asked her to meet in the summer and she was ""busy"" or whatever even though I see on her snap or insta stories shes out. I said okay whatever, at this point I just want to give her the card I dont have a chance with her. Finally, she asked to meet up like 4 weeks later, I said okay and she stood me up. I never spoke to her again from that point on. Its the new semester now and I am still carrying that card in my bag in hopes ill run into her. I have never been this struck by someone in my life, never. ever. I dont know wha the fuck to do its driving me crazy inside. I really think i love this woman despite all the dodging and attempts to friendzone. That card feels like hope and it also feels like hatred.

p.s. the picture of the card will be linked in the comments",14Sep2019,1
755,"So, long story short, there’s this chick that I REALLY care about, and the only reason I don’t say I love her is because 

A. There will be plenty of people saying, “What you have isn’t love” and other phrases if the sorts.

B. Because I can’t stand when people just throw around “I love you” like it’s a greeting between strangers. If I say I love you, I want the person I’m saying it to, to understand that I truly mean it.

C. Because it’s kinda weird to say you’re in love with someone that you’re not in a relationship with. Even if you love them more than life itself, you still can’t say it. 

Anyways, I Really really like her. We’ve known eachother for years, and she’s honestly the only person I’ve felt like that for.

About a month ago, I told her how I felt. She said she felt the same way, but couldn’t mentally handle a relationship at the moment because she still had feelings for her ex and didn’t want to hurt anyone. 

So, I took that as “I’m not interested”

However, now that I’m not trying so hard to get with her, she’s started acting a bit differently.

She’s started doing things like...

*Writing me little notes with hearts on them that say things like “Hey Cutie”

*Always trying to touch me in some way. Weither it be hugging, tickling, or biting my nipples (don’t ask, she’s just weird like that)

*Asking me to do things for her. For example: she asked me to bring her some of the chocolate I had because she was on her period and was craving chocolate. (We live within walking distance of eachother)

She constantly confuses me.

However, I’ve tried to move on, and in doing so, I’ve become somewhat interested in someone else. I’m exactly head over heels, but i think she’s cute, and want to start talking to her.

The problem is, I don’t know if I should wait for the first girl to come around (Which May very well never happen), or if I should pursue the new girl.

Don’t get me wrong, The first girl will ALWAYS be my number one. I’ve never felt for anyone the way I feel for her, but if she’s never going to come around. I might as well start looking into someone else.

However, if she does ever want a relationship, I don’t want to miss that opportunity by already being with someone else.

I know this probably just sounds like basic high school puppy love bullshit,

756,"So first off let me say that I live a fairly normal life for a teenage boy but my whole life I'll have very realistic audio hallucinations, obviously people have that thing were they think there moms calling them but I've had a few times when that's happened but it felt SUPER real

Ontop of that at around 3am(ish) I used to be able to hear the TV playing fairly quietly but noticeable, louder as I was going down but only once did i say fuck you ti my fears and check and i noticed that nothing was happening

Anytime I was up late I'd hear the TV playing when everyone was in bed with no one with a TV in there rooms but me which was used for my xbox not watching shows

When I was younger and super super imaginative I used to have very real hallucinations, do you know like the devil and angel on shoulder from movies? Well imagine that but real, it was all my decision making but personified in something else, I'd also see those stars you see when your bodies low on oxygen but for long periods of time  for no reason 

As I got older the devil angel thing stopped happening so I put it down to being imaginative, but recently its started popping up again, like not too oing before writing this post while in my room I hear the TV fairly loud and a a light switch a few minutes later but everyone was already in bed

As for the visual hallucinations they can be anything, my main hallucination is pennywise (dont laugh) I'm not afraid of clowns nor did the movie scare me besides that one jump scare which btw was a super cheap cop out to scare people

But sometimes my mind will think to itself ""I'm gonna fuck with myself"" I try to stop it but I cant and the harder I focus on it the more real it looks and I can see past it and it's not opaque, it's like there but it's not

The paranoia sometimes pops up in the same state of fucking with myself, imagining people behind me in my own house or something staring over me and close to killing me, again dont laugh but asmr seems to calm me down while I go to sleep

Just while writing this a hillucianfion happened where my vision got cut off and something popped out at me, my vision didn't really get blocked off I could still see my phone but the hallucination was there it's hard to describe 

My mental health isnt the worse as far as diagnosed things, I have bad anxiety which could explain the paranoia 

I do have a fairly active imagination but it only gets put to use when my body denies anything I say and says to itself ""let's fuck with myself"" I try to stop it but I cant

It's not happening enough to affect my life, it only happens when I'm alone, I'm just wondering if this is anything serious or something I'm gonna have to deal worg",14Sep2019,3
757,"The older man I know is probably one of the strangest people I have ever met. He is a 40 year old gay black man who is one of the most intense Trump supporters I have ever met. Most of his friends are under 25, he hangs out with a lot of freshman in college straight guys. And he almost seems like somewhat of a small cult leader if you ask me.

He has these things he does called ""Readings,"" where he claims to be able to read your fortune and give you life advice for the future. Though the way he goes about them is perhaps one of the wackiest things I have ever heard. I swear I am not making any of this up, it is 100% accurate.

He has you take your shoes and socks off and he strips down to just these special underwear he has with a hole in the butt. He then lies down spooning position in bed and has you lie down behind him and stick your foot in the hole in his underwear. He then proceeds to press his penis against your foot and puts both of them inside the same sock. Then he puts a loose fitting shoe on over that. Next he has you reach up behind him so one hand can touch each one of his nipples. Then he tells you to wiggle your toes and rub his nipples with your fingers. During this time he will ask you a bunch of random questions and has you make up random stories and such. 

He did this to me when I was around 15. It made me uncomfortable for sure, but I knew a bunch of guys who were doing it so I tried it. I continued to hang out with this guy until maybe sophomore year of highschool and lots of times when I came over he would really want to do a ""Reading"". Usually I told him I didn't feel like it and he would just leave it at that. After a while I stopped going over. I thought the readings were creepy and only a way for him to get off. But I felt like I consented to it because I at least knew what it entailed before I tried it. So I never really cared to do anything about it.

But the weirdest thing to me is how many guys he has tricked into believing this fucking wacky ass scheme he has going on. I have friends who are smart guys who dont usually believe in supernatural stuff. But for some reason believe that that this random 40 year old gay guy has magical fortune telling abilities that are activated when you rub his nipples and wiggle your toes on his penis.

Do you think some of these people realize hes using them for his sexual pleasure and just dont want to acknowledge it?",14Sep2019,9
758,"It's not her fault. I just can't say no to an invitation to hang out.

I'll be getting really into studying, see her text, and head out.

I usually comeback super late and go to bed instead of studying more.

I literally don't like saying no, it just hurts my heart.

I'm currently studying for the MCAT :(",14Sep2019,1
