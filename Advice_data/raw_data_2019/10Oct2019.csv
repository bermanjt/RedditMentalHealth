0,"We've been dating for 1.5 years and we're both in our mid/late 20's. We broke up for 3 months because we were both too busy to spend time with each other, and decided it'd be best to focus on ourselves and our work. We just got back together because we realized how much we valued each other, but his family doesn't approve. Upon meeting a few of his friends and family, it's clear we are from different backgrounds. My parents are buddhist and I have instilled many of those values in me as well - so generally speaking, my family is very humble and zen. His is filled with lawyers, high-achieving business men, ivy grads, venture capitalist and has links with top universities and the cultural elite. He has 13 cousins and brothers, all boys, all super driven, and elitist.

His friends and family are nice on the surface level, but I can't get over the feeling of inadequacy, particularly because I know how much they value they put on education and monetary success. I went to a top school and just started my business recently. Its still very early staged. They tell my boyfriend to wait until I've achieved success before dating me seriously, and say right now that essentially, I'm not up to their level of ""caliber."" They think he's being lazy and settling. I worked at a good job, and am ambitious and focused on growing my new business, but I really don't think I'm good enough seeing that they come from high institutions and have achieved some level of success with their many businesses. We have a short vacation coming up with some of his friends, and even thinking about spending an extended period of time with them stresses me out.",10Oct2019,2

2,"It's right below the nail, off to the right a bit. It's this small lump that's been there for almost a year; my mom says to just wait it out but I don't think It's going away anytime soon and am starting to get worried.

I've been scratching and biting at it since I'm that type of person and because it bothers me so much, and I know I shouldn't be doing it but now it looks really torn up, having a deep line in the middle of it. When I just leave it it gets really hard and rough and that's typically when I go to town on it. 

Should I be worried or not, and, will it ever go away?",10Oct2019,1
3,"Hi, my grandma wanted to pick out her casket and services for when she passes years to come and expects me to pay for it all. She currently lives in CA LA and there was a place nearby called Dignity Memorial. Problem is when I met with a director he straight up asked for my Account Number, Routing Number and Driver License for a 5 year payment plan of 150 bucks a month, he told me needed this information so he can withdraw money every month for 5years. Now the problem is, I don't feel comfortable giving away my Account number, routing Number, Does funeral directors usually ask for these informations?",10Oct2019,1
5,Sooooo I’ve recently reconnected with one of my childhood friends we met in middle school and we became best friends growing up (duh it’s in the title) and we’ve been talking everyday since and we decided to hang out a month and half ago. We met at a city we went to the zoo (the zoo was lame but had a great time still with each other) we went out to eat and went to the beach (she still lives in our hometown and I moved away for college we’re like three hours away from each other) but ever since that trip we’ve texted and FaceTiming almost everyday and maybe like two week ago I told her I had caught feelings for her and she kinda friend zoned me but here we are still talking and FaceTiming everyday and she’s the one to text me in the morning first so I feel like I’m getting mixed signals and in just a couple of days we’re going to see each other again so I need advice from strangers! Like maybe she likes me too but doesn’t want to mess the friendship up?,10Oct2019,1
6,"Title. 

Now, I know it’s unhealthy to compare yourself with another person, but because he’s my twin every person around me can’t help but compare me to him. 

Throughout elementary to middle school people said that I was the “chubby one” (I’ve lost upwards of 40 pounds now so this isn’t my current issue), but now he’s the “funny one”, and assuming people mention me I’m the “quiet one”. It’s admittedly immature to let names like that get to me, but I can’t help it. 

Still, that’s not the particular reason I’m jealous of him, if anything I’m glad I at least have an identity to others, even if it is tied to my brother. 

I’m really just jealous because of the attention my parents give him. He’s always been distinctly more outspoken than I have, and I guess my parents just like more about him. 

There isn’t any particular thing that comes to mind when I think of this, it’s just little things. My moms much less hesitant to throw a passing insult my way than to his. For instance, when I first started driving my mom said I’d be one of those adults who didn’t drive. Just today, she yelled at me and said she wouldn’t be surprised if I failed my test.

Even outside of my parents, both of my older brothers have admitted to liking him more (I don’t remember the circumstances, I think it was a less-than-saucy game of truth or dare?). 

I don’t want my relationship with him to be strained because of this, really he’s super great, but I can’t help but feel jealous of him. Advice on how to get over it?",10Oct2019,1

9,"TW for sexual assault

I'm in 11th grade and I just recently found out there is an ongoing rumor that my English teacher has slept and had relations with her past (and maybe present) students. She always brings up sex and flirts with one guy in my English class so I am prone to believe the rumors are true. She only ever sleeps with seniors who are of age, but I know that being in an authority position can still get her in trouble. I have tried to get in contact with people who have claimed to have slept with her, but they either have no evidence or are raging drug addicts. I want to put an end to this cycle she's in because I think the obvious manipulation of these boys is disgusting. So my question is... how do I get evidence? I'm not her type (i'm a woman) so I can't flirt with her myself, and I don't want to risk the safety of any of my senior friends. I also doubt my school would listen to me without any evidence. I was thinking about making a ""catfish"" account and trying to start up a romance with her and build a case... but that is my last resort. So, do I have any other options to stop her?",10Oct2019,1

16,"My girlfriend spent some time abroad, and while doing so she found a guy who she started dating. (Before her and I were involved at all romantically) 

After she came back, her and I started getting involved with eachother, and she informed me she was actually in an open relationship with him, and that he was going to stay for a month at her house visiting our home country in a few months. I didn’t really want to be a part of this, so I told her. She decided then that she wanted to break up with him, and told me she had done so. (I never saw proof, or asked for proof either. I was *and still am* willing to believe her)

Fast forward a few months,  and the guy is still coming to stay at her house (for about 3 quarters as much shorter period of time) and just being around her and making silly snapchats with her, I have noticed that he is still her #1 best friend on Snapchat. 

Now, do I think she is still involved with him? No. But there’s still this tugging feeling in my head that wants some questions to be discussed.

I would like to approach her in the least aggressive way possible, and so that she doesn’t think I don’t trust her, because I do. I have never brought him up, asked questions about him, and really don’t know jack shit about the guy. What should I do?",10Oct2019,1
17,"I recently got my eyebrows microbladed at the place I’ve been going to for nearly a year. The guy who owns it is nice, but very young. 
Last Saturday, I had my touch up appointment and he cancelled last minute (within an hour of the appointment) citing “high anxiety and needing a mental health day and to see his doctor ASAP.” I was a little annoyed because I deliberately didn’t go out the night before and got my exercise in before the session etc but of course I said “no worries, look after yourself!” 
Later that day I saw on Instagram that a beauty influencer had been in to get her eyebrows done. He was shamelessly posting about it all over Instagram! 
I felt a bit down about it because it reminded me that I’m just some regular gal who isn’t really special.
I have my touch up appointment this evening and I’m not sure what to do. He does a great job and is the only person in my city to do this particular type of microblading. I don’t want to say anything before the session because he will he literally tattooing my face, but I’m thinking of saying something after he does my brows but before I pay? I don’t want to sound like an asshole in case I got it wrong and he did have a mental health day but I’m 99.99999% sure he lied.
Any advice appreciated!",10Oct2019,1
18,"So I’ve just turned 16 a few weeks ago and up until this point I’ve avoided drinking. It never really appealed to me and I’m obviously aware of the effects of alcohol, but I’m also aware of how common it is. I go to a public school its hard not to be aware of these things. Just about everyone in my school drinks pretty regularly other than me and my friends. I have this pretty large group of friends and the majority of us don’t drink, we don’t really feel a need to we have fun on our own. We’re all very close and only about 4 or 5 drink out of maybe 20 of us, and even then not that often. Im beginning to feel not peer pressured, but sort of left out. My girlfriend is one of the few who drinks and shes asked me to drink with her, pretty much with the promise that we would do some sexual stuff maybe. Ive told her before that I’m not too keen on it. My biggest fear on drinking is that it will fuck up my brain permanently bc its developing. She hasn’t tried to force me into it but as more of my friends want to do it I’m beginning to feel sort of left out, especially because my girlfriend really wants me to do it. On the other hand my like 5 bestfriends, the boys, who I’ve known longer than anyone, really look down on drinking with a passion. We all feel like its stupid and we don’t need it to have fun, and one of my friends has had a bad experience in the past with his girlfriend and alcohol, as she cheated. It kindve put all of us off. The rest of my friends in the group also look down on drinking but my boys really have a dislike for it, but i don’t wanna let them down either as we basically have this unspoken agreement that we wont drink at this point in our lives as we all kindve look down on it. For me its pretty much the fear of permanent damage that stops me from drinking. I still stand with them, and at the same time have this feeling of jealousy or being left out. I guess I’m asking for advice here. I feel so over my head and I’m trying to balance all of this with the rest of my life I cant even begin to decide what i should do or how to feel. Im aware that i want to drink as i know it will be fun and i would enjoy it, and at the same time i have this fear that i will permanently damage my brain and i want to stick with my bestfriends and i would feel absolutely terrible of I let them down. Can anyone assure me that drinking at age 16 will or wont damage me permanently, or offer some advice as what to think or maybe to tell my friends?

20,"Hi, posting this from a throwaway account. I would like advice on my roommate situation. 

Background: I am the sole person on the lease, we have lived together for just over a year, and we work in the same industry

 I normally love living with my roommate but recently everything he does is driving me crazy. He is a kind, caring person, who helps with the cleaning and is friendly. The major problems for me are, he does not pay his rent on time, which I find financially stressful. I often end up covering all the utilities and the whole rent as he slowly pays me back over the course of the month. This has been getting worse recently. We're both broke artists but I also work another job, and it honestly is really starting to make me quite angry that I have to budget the whole of rent and utilities until the third week of the month. Also, we have very different schedules. I am a morning person, he is not. We both do a lot of work from home, so this often means that he is making noise and playing music and drinking with friends while I am try to sleep, and I am bothering him when I wake up early to finish projects before I go to work.   


And then all the little things that I have spoken with him about that just set me off recently, like there always being beard hair all over the bathroom and painting supplies all over the kitchen for days when I would just like to cook. He was away for a week recently, and ever since he got back I have honestly avoided being at home because everything makes me furious.   


I need some advice on conflict resolution stat. I know I am being nit-picky and just letting things simmer, but I am afraid I'm just going to loose my shit over a pile of dirty dishes instead of handling this like adults. However, other than the money all my complaints seem so petty and arbitrary, but I can't seem to let them go. HALP",10Oct2019,1
21,"Ok guys I’m a bit lost on what to do following a recent event.

I just blew £40 on a crypto gambling site of money that wasn’t mine using the martingale method. I was convinced it was foolproof halfway through after seeing all the bitcoin going into my account. However, I got onto a loss streak and lost all of my money.

Now, I’ve got about $3 worth of BTC.  I owed the money I lost to a relative for helping them out with something.

Now I know what I should do. Be the bigger man, confess to them and hope they give me a few jobs to do or so to earn the money back for then. But I really don’t want to do that, my mom would go mad at me, and I would ruin a trustworthy relationship with my  auntie and uncle.

So I’m going to try and earn that $40 back, one way or another. I’m quite versatile at online things, I can do video editing, photo editing, graphic design, etc. I just need a way of getting $40 within a week or so. I can’t get a job at this stage as I need the money fairly quickly, otherwise I would try. Any suggestions greatly appreciated, thank you for taking the time to read this.",10Oct2019,1
22,"No matter how hard I try, I constantly recieve criticism from my parents. No matter how hard I try to be what they tell me I should be, they never support me. Any compliment I recieve is back handed (ex: ""your house looks nice today..... Maybe you can finally keep it that way""). My younger sister gets praise and approval consistently, despite the fact that she has a girlfriend (this is a BIG no-no in my parents religion, Jehovah's witnesses). I am constantly told how I need to improve and how everything that has gone wrong in my life or my children's, is entirely my fault. All I've ever seeked from childhood is approval, but I just. Wont. Recieve it. If my own parents dont love and support me, maybe I'm not worthy of praise. I hear others talk about their ""good dad"" or ""good mom"" and it simply further instills the idea into my head that the problem is with me. I am deffective.  My siblings (younger brother- former heroine addict, my younger sister- suicidally depressed) that were not baptized, get a pass that I don't. They have the potential to be saved.  However, I have not only doomed my 14 yo baptized self, but also all of my 3 girls to die at Armageddon- and with no hope of a resurrection.  I truly believe my parents are good, wholesome people.  .. So the problem has GOT to be with me, right? I'm scorned for questioning things because, to them, all I'm doing is ""making excuses to behave"" the way I ""want to"" and feel is right.  I don't think I will ever really be able to accept that the problem isn't with me. I feel with all my heart that I am truly flawed and worthless.  I don't know how I can change that.. I don't know what to do anymore.  My greatest fear and torture is the thought of losing my family. They are all I have.  My mom has made a point to tell me that she'll still stay in touch with my sister's (soon to be ex, but for personal and good reasons) girlfriend (a terrible human,.. Truly) but never any family member that's disfellowshipped.  I would have never married my first (intensely) abusive husband were it not for the fear of being disfellowshipped (he was also a member). I had to apologise to my childhood raper for accusing him (a baptized brother).  My brain can't wrap around any of this and I don't know what to do or where to start to not feel so gadDAMNED SAD anymore. I just want to be enough....",10Oct2019,1

Full disclosure: This post may contain clown shit and adult themes. Please do not make fun of me for being foolish and naive. I’m trying my best here. Also not suitable for children. 

There’s this guy I’ve been talking to for about 3 weeks now. We met on tinder. (Great start, right?) He seems like a pretty cool person, but I’m having a hard time getting a good read on him. This may just be me being insecure, but I’m completely unsure of what he thinks of me and what his intentions are. Us both being pretty shy and awkward isn’t making it better. 

I’m no stranger to flings, but right now I think I want something a little more romantic. This guy seems like he could have some potential as far as that’s concerned I’m just unsure if I should pursue that. Or what I should do at all as far as this is concerned.

He randomly asked me if I wanted to hang out last week. I agreed and we started planning for it. When the day came he suggested we go out, but I suggested we just chill at his place and watch Netflix. (In other words, I myself up for failure.) I went to his house and I told him I’d grab food on the way. He said okay and offered to pay for the gas I used driving to him and pay our food, but I ended up refusing. I got to his house and we just had some pretty basic conversations I met his pet chameleon and we started watching Big Mouth on Netflix. I saw nothing of it at first. We were just eating and watching TV so I didn’t think anything would happen (stupid I know). The trouble started when I started feeling the urge to get closer to him and try and coax him into getting closer to me. He followed suit all without saying a word. I found one of his stuffed animals and I started cuddling it and scooting away from him. He started trying to take the stuffed shark from me and would give it back if I just let him take it. After I started having to reach over and touch him to get the bear back it just went downhill from there. We were holding hands, ended up making out, and ended up performing oral sex on each other. We wrapped that up because I had to leave because a storm was coming. The next day he actually texted me first the next day and went back to our sort of basic conversations. He hinted at us hanging out again and I was pretty much on board. I also forgot my charger there so I’m definitely gonna have to see him one way or another. However, a couple of days ago he informed me that he had a one night stand like a week prior and it completely ruined my perception of him in all honesty. 😅 I liked that he was open with me about it, but if he’s sleeping with someone one week and the next week almost sleeping with someone else (even if they were the one who suggested to go to your place) is just too small of a timeframe. He seems like a cool guy. My style. Kinda nerdy, skinny with glasses. However I’m not sure of his intentions. Does it seem like he just wants to have sex or could he possibly be interested in me ? What should I do given these red flags ? So many questions 

Red Flags: 
- He literally had a one night stand with someone like a week ago. Says it was just a one time thing that wasn’t worth it but c’mon .-. 
- He doesn’t talk much. Seems kind of socially awkward. 
- Not having much initiative to contact me besides asking me to hang out, and texting me first the next morning after",10Oct2019,1
26,"Hello, for obvious reasons this is a throwaway.

Recently a new manager took over my apartment complex. This manager has moved into the same building as me, and few nights ago her and her boyfriend (?) were arguing pretty loudly, doors slamming, banging sounds, screaming as loud as possible with windows open, etc. Eventually he starts screaming ""You hit me first!"" ""I pushed you because you hit me with a broom!"" He brought up the broom at least five times. This went on until after midnight, stopping for a few minutes at a time then picking back up for a few minutes.

Of course, I understand couples have their spats, but when brooms start coming out to hit people that becomes a whole new ballgame. I regret not calling the cops, and I know I should have probably done just that. My concern with that was that they would suspect it was me who called them (again it was around midnight, there are only so many apartments with their lights on at midnight on a typical work night) and then me jeopardizing my own safety or some form of retaliation with me being able to continue living here. They're too new for me to tell if this is normal behavior. I haven't heard anything before or since. I haven't had a chance to meet either of them yet, but I've seen them walking in and out a few times. My question is should I relay this information to the management company and express my concern? My fiance talked with one of our neighbors about it earlier today, they heard the banging but not the screaming.

Another concern is that if I catch them at a bad time or make too much noise at some point they might retaliate. My lease has been up for a long time and we are paying month to month. Am I looking into this too much? It could easily have been they had too much to drink and this isn't normal behavior, but at the same time if they did have too much to drink, will it happen again? I'm not trying to get involved in other people's business. If this happens again I'm not really sure what direction I could take other than calling the police, and again I'm worried about retaliation.

Thanks for any advice in advance.",10Oct2019,2
27,"Normally, I’d always have said no to buying a new car. I’ve only ever had used cars and only financed one used car. But, I am seriously debating getting a new car I found for 18 to 20k. 

Here’s the background: I need to get a new car by mid November that has AWD. I accepted a much better paying job this year that includes frequent travel into rural, high drug use areas, 4 hours driving one way usually. The roads are often not paved well and a FWD in any poor weather will not cut it. 

The reasons why I’m thinking of a new car

-I need reliability. I am not car savvy, I have tried to learn, but it’s not grown on me except for basic things 
-I am now often in dead zones without cell phone service. If it breaks down coupled with minimal knowledge of how to fix it, I am vulnerable 
-I carry mace, but I still don’t want to be broke down on the side of the road in very rural and heavily drug abuse places 
-I had a mechanic inspect the car I have now before I bought it and it still stranded me twice. It took a couple tries at two different mechanics and googling on my end to figure out the issue. It’s been decent since, but There’s a lot of risk to me with used cars now vs a few years ago
-I’m not worried as much about car theft because where I park is safe. But it’s in between arrival and destination that worries me 
-on average, I drive 30k a year even before this job. I expect to be driving at least 40k in the coming year. 

Since I drive so much, I’ve always got low mileage  used cars that are basic models and cheap. But even with routine maintenance, I’ve found the repairs tend to build up quicker than what a new car would. Since I need an AWD with reasonable gas mileage and low miles, the price is jumping up. Cars that are a few years old are only a few thousand dollars less than newer cars. The ones that are under 10k all have 90+k miles or are pretty old which concerns me. 

But the con is that I’ve always had it drilled into me that new cars are often ridiculous. They depreciate in value right away and you drop what could be a house down payment on a new car. That’s a little frightening. But my gut says I need to spend more to get what I’ll need over the next few years",10Oct2019,1
28,"I'm going to start this story from the beginning. 

I started with a company as a regular employee at the same time as this girl. Idk what it was about this girl. but i still remeber the day she walked into work she was smiling and laughing with her friend. I dont know if it was love at first site or what, but she was difderent ther was something about her. And when we talked i didn't feel shy or anything i felt natural. 

SIDENOTE: I should mention the company i worked for had a lot of opportunity in it so it was very quick to become a supervisor if you were determined 

I was a seasonal employee as was she. On our last day of the job i thought i wasn't going to get hired on and neither was she. So i asked her to follow me on instagram i told her my name but something happened and we both got distracted so she didn't follow me at that moment. after work she got home and followed me. I tried to do my own little ways of shooting my shot by sending little corny ass memes and things along those line but she always took like 3 hours to respond, i kinda just lost hope after a while to be honest.  
Couple days go by Next thing you know my phone starts ringing and i look at it. It was my boss and he wanted to hire me on full time i was very excited because i was determined to move up at this company. So he tells me were the job location is and what my schedule for the week would be. That's that.

I show up to work on my first day and look who i seen. Her. I couldn't believe it. Fast forward i try my best to just talk to her and just hear what she has to say cause i felt like she didn't talk as much as she should. Months go by in the company. (I should mention i mad it very clear to all my supervisors and gm that i wanted to move up in the company. So i was doing everything i can to move up. Stay as long as they need me to. Come in on my day offs. Almost anything they needed i was ther) (she is also one of those females who sucks at texting like bad. Her best friend even told me the same thing) i don't know how she feels about me honestly. my birthday was coming up and i wanted to invite her to my bday because like seriously i really liked her. I wasn't even going to do anything for my bday honestly but then she asked me if i was doing anything special for my bday and i thought fuck it I'll throw the party just to have to opportunity to see here. (Ain't that some Ted Mosby shit) she did actually show up. I don't really know how to talk to females i think its a confidence isssue so i did the best i could with flirting. I don't know it just didn't seem like she felt the same way. 
The next day after my birthday party i posted a picture of myslef on my Instagram story and instagram had just added that heart scale feature to rate someone's photo with a heart and i added it just to see if anyone was feeling my outfit and i look and who do i see scale it with heart eyes IT WAS HER! I was so happy. (Im an overthinker so i overthink the little of things)  next time we worked together i was casual but in the back of my mind ive always wanted to love up so i liked her but i don't want to ruin this job for myslef yanno. 
Fast Forward 2 months i was offered a higher title and higher paid position from my boss and of course i accepted it. This was what i been working for from the beginning.
 You see were i start to run into an issue now right? I became her boss i couldn't be her friend anymore i couldn't flirt with her anymore but i really still liked her like honestly. I didn't really know were she seen me or if i was just thinking she liked me from the start when all she could of been doing was being nice yanno. 
Fast forward another couple months. I know i should of took the opportunity when i had it the first time but i really just didn't want to ruin the job. 
A new guy starts as seasonal and next thing you know he gets hired on and before they even met eachother i fucking knew that he was gonna be competition. Guess im just being insecure maybe not. Me and him never once talked about anything other then work. It was the day of her birthday. Her friend came up to me at work an asked me if i was able to go to her birthday party on Friday. Im over here happy as shit like oh damn she asked her friend to invite me to her birthday. Maybe after tonight it's all going to be different ill finally have her. Ill finally be with her. That was on a friday night her friend asked me on a tueday. That Friday morning the new guy texts out of work saying he wont make it cause he was throwing up. Im not thinking anything of it yanno. Next thing you know the girl i really like, her friend messages my phone saying heads up the new guy is here aswell. I mesaage her back confused like ok lol sounds good is ther a reason its a heads up? Her response is ""i dont know they are acting kinda wierd i guess they didn't want you to know"" (keep in mind she was under the influence when she was messaging me so she didn't know wat she was saying. Im just like whatever about it. I get out of work and show up. Everyone is fucked up and i see the new nigga from work and look were he is sitting at the head of the table and talking to the girl i liked!! Yup he fucking stole her i knew it before it even happened. My heart broke that night but my face stayed the same. They were holding hands and hugging and all that. Yup he was were i thought i was gonna be that night. 
I didn't say anything i just played it cool and stayed casual didn't leave to early nor to late. After i left her friend mesaaged me saying""thx for the smoke"" cause i brought weed. I think they just invited me to smoke em out. But like i said im an over thinker. 
Weeks go by and the new guy got terminated for what i don't know? 
Months go by me and her are cool but i just gave up tbh. I find a new girl and got over the new girl at work but she's still always popping up in my mind. Me and that girl didn't work out 
Fast forward to my birthday this year and i posted another pic of myself with heart eyes scale and she put heart eyes again . this time i went on her page n liked her pic and next thing you know she liked mine aswell. We work literally the opposite hours always. I kinda feel like someone knows watsup wuth us and told my boss and now he works us separate hours. 

Well i really want to ask her out because i really dont want to redo all of this again. Ther has to be something between us. But also i don't want to ruin the job if she doesn't feel the same. Please reddit help me out with advice

30,"Hi! I’ll try to keep this short.

So I live in a small flat with a few other people and share a bathroom with them. Said bathroom has limited hot water and a bathtub. I really want to get a good soak in a bubble bath once or twice a month, but the fact that the bathroom is shared is stopping me.

Here’s what I was thinking: If I went for it around 1am, when most people are sleeping, it should be fine and not an asshole move, right? After all,  even if I end up using all the hot water, no one should be needing it at 3am anyways. And it’s unlikely someone would need to use it that late at night either, since they’d all be sleeping.

So yeah, my question is - would you consider it okay if you were in my flatmates’ place if someone hogged the bathroom during 1-3am once or twice a month?

Since 2 month i cannot properly sleep and i'm going insane since i'm super tired the past 8 weeks and i'm getting other issues like physical pain as well as mental pain.  
I talked about it with my parents but they don't do shit (and rather get mad) and don't have any solutions either.   
There is no other room that i could go unfortunately. So i tried a pretty simple method of getting earplugs but that's pretty uncomfortable even if they are made for sleeping and i could still hear the garage door since it is a pretty deep sound. Plus after long time earplugs would get really expensive and may also cause health issues like infections etc.  


I'm someone who plays a lot of games (and streams sometimes) and therefore i stay up late at night. It would be the worst case ever going to bed at 9 pm instead of my usual 12-2 am (because my parents always go out to work at 6am). But it seems like i have no choice.

(one close friend who’s really busy and one mutual who i just got to know recently.) i don’t talk to my family about my problems because they tend to ask a lot of questions (i don’t blame them) and they don’t understand the extent. i’m afraid that soon i will start hallucinating, it seem likely for some reason. i have a therapist but after some time i stopped being able to talk to her, as in i would go lessons without saying a single word. i don’t know why, but i just can’t. not sure what to do honestly, as for the bathroom situation, i think i’m gonna try to get my dog and hopefully get some sleep but until i get the courage i’m gonna sit here.

I'm holding off on the idea of dating for two reasons, though: I don't like the idea of potentially making a coworker uncomfortable coming to work if things were to end poorly, and I'd be her first boyfriend.   


We're both in college (22 M, 18 F), and she's a very academically-oriented girl from a religious family, so the idea that she hasn't really dated isn't that strange to me. However, while I like her a lot, I'm not confident that I'd make a great first boyfriend. While share many of the same interests, opinions, and core values, our personalities are distinctly different. She's pretty pure (energetic, upbeat, maybe a little naive, doesn't swear or drink), while I'm generally more depressive (always a little sad, darker sense of humor, pretty regular swearing, kind of nihilistic, non-religious, occasional drinking).  


She's made it clear that she's comfortable dating outside her religion, and nothing I've told her about me (negatives included) seems to have deterred her. Still, I can't help but feel like she needs someone better for her first boyfriend, and I wouldn't want to make her uncomfortable working in the same place as me if things don't turn out well. Are these even my decisions to make? Is it wrong to not give it a chance because I'm arrogant enough to assume I know what's best for her?  


As it stands, I'm leaning towards not risking it, because I'm worried about causing any harm-- but I'm also worried that I'm letting my fears get in the way of something that could be good.

He’s 24, just started an undergrad at a school, and assists in teaching music classes to high school and middle school students. Some of the issues that came up when we were dating: 

-watching porn that depicted high school girls being taken advantage of, plus a medium porn addiction 

-deliberately searches for young teen girls who looked truly 12 

-admitted finding one of the kids he taught music to attractive (16 years old) 

-snapped that 16 year old girl daily for months

-would flirt with clearly young girls on video games/discord

-once went on tinder when we were dating. When I saw it, he had only matched with 18 year old girls (the youngest possible on the app) 

-admitted to having sex regularly with a 17 year old right before him and I started dating (legal age of consent in our state but still odd to me) and would sometimes reach out to her when he was mad at me 

-really seemed to like anime which sexualized young characters 

-pleasured himself to (and reached out to) ASMR girls’ videos, who seemed young

63,"Hey,

I am a 30 year old globetrotter from Germany, currently living and working in Australia on a Working Holiday Visa.

I am a Personal Trainer and have previously studied Physiotherapy, did not graduate the latter though. I managed to design a beautiful life here, working as Personal Trainer and running my own Massage business. I want to immigrate to Australia, however with my current education, my chances of doing so are slim to none. 

What do you think I should do?

I divided my course of action into three main roads:

1. Stay in Australia on a student visa and try to establish myself with mixture of education, support and maybe starting a de-facto relationship (expensive and limited to 20h of work/week; might have to study something that I am actually interested in to lower costs; might also have to move from my current spot because of studying regulations which would ruin my current customer base; overall appears to be unreliable)
2. Return to Germany and go back to school/university to finish my education in Physiotherapy (will require me between 2 and 3 years to finish, unsure how to finance myself during this time, as I have to account for possible tuition fees, living costs, etc and the studying is done face-to-face, full time, about 38h/week; seems best long term option and would even allow me to immigrate to Australia, but very hard to finance)
3. Return to Germany or other parts of Europe and apply for a job as Personal Trainer, use that as a foundation to study smaller things while working, such as Yoga Teacher and Life Coach

70,"My roommate vapes. She told me about it when she moved in, but said she would never do it indoors.

Now, a month after she moved in, I had an irritated throat and a couple of days later I started a severe cough (I still cough every 30 seconds at this moment). And then today I saw her vape in our common area stealthily. 

Our common area does not have a window and my bedroom window is the closest to it, so I think the vape just left through my room. 

I don’t know how to tell my roommate to stop vaping indoors - I can politely sit her down and tell her to never do it again, but I’m afraid she will not follow my suggestion. Because: 

1) I have discussed the reason for my coughing with her just before I realized she vapes indoors, and she did not even think of offering to suggest that it might be her vaping that caused it, and she is still doing it today;
2) its going to get colder in my area so there will be less incentive for her to go outside to vape.

So, how can I tell her to stop vaping and make sure she follow through with it??? 

TL;DR: My roommate knows her vaping indoors might be causing me to cough, but she’s still doing it. What can I do to make sure she never does it indoors any more?",10Oct2019,1

The thing that bugs me as that some of the things they said are true about me, but they're not things I would be open about, like the ""knowing a person who was a victim of human trafficking"", while that is true, it is not something that I have told people, and it is not something I would brag about.  
I dont know what to do, Ive already sent them a reply saying I dont know them and for them to only use my email for business related reasons.

&gt;\[OP\],  
&gt;  
&gt;Hi, this is \[name of person who sent email\]. (Yes, my email is under my middle name. It's a long story that we do not have time for.) Please stay away from me. Never speak to me again. Do not sit with me at lunch. Don't try to explain your insane points of view to me or convince me suicide is hilarious or whine about how you're a misunderstood woobie the world has mistreated. You are, hands down, the most cold-hearted human I have ever met, and I don't want you anywhere near me. If you ever try to talk to me again, I will contact \[person who runs dorms\] to get her involved in stopping your presence in my life. From bragging about knowing victims of human trafficking to acting like watching dark anime makes you a better person to giggling and smiling over suicide, everything you've done in my presence indicates a truly sick, unhinged mind. You may pretend it's a facet of autism, but what's wrong with you goes much deeper and is much more dangerous than that. I would be completed unsurprised if you, after your little spiel about how lives don't have value, killed someone. You give off literal, actual, honest-to-God serial killers vibes.  
&gt;  
&gt;I tried to hang out with you because I pitied you. You seemed lonely and sad, and maybe you are. But you're also unhinged, detached from reality, unfeeling, incapable of remorse and take joy in the pain of others, and have absolutely no concept that other people besides yourself matter. And I can't think of a single good reason to continue tolerating your presence. I would say seek help, but getting better doesn't fit your edgy, nihilistic, laugh-at-suffering mentality. So instead I'll just wish you good luck and hopefully never have to speak to you again.

81,"Hi , I'm a computer science student and work part time in a small company that has around 20 employees. I've working for this company for 8 months.  I'm a web developer and in the room where I work theres 3 more people.

One of the designers in that room has been bullying me. He's always making jokes about me , saying things about my sexuality (even when I'm straight)  the origin of this jokes is because in my college there's a high percentage of lgtb people.

He's an asshole in general , in my 19th birthday when everyone else was congratulating me. 
He was saying that I fuck other men when i go to college. 

This is my first serious job ever . At first I didn't say anything but is getting to my nerves. Today I got really mad and I believe he got the message. 

Because he stopped talking  , then he immediately started saying the music of my other co-worker is shit. 

So he just changed the target.

I don't think is specifically personal. But I'm a easy target because I'm young and don't response to the constant bullshit he's saying. 

When he went to eat , I talked to the other people in my office .

One of them  told me basically this : ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

That all is just banter and I should respond with the same types of jokes. 
But I'm not like him 

As I said before I got really mad today , normally I'm a pretty chill and easy going guy but sadly after certain limit I explode and afraid of doing something stupid. 

I saw one of the other guys nodding in agreement when I talked to them. 
As I was so angry I said some stupid things.

One of them said that I should be smart and if I don't like it I should talk with the designer. That if some type of physical altercation happened they will fire me before him.

But you know my contract doesn't say I have to handle this bullshit. I will not change my personality just because some asshole has insecurities or is bored. 

So I'm asking for advice. 
Thank you very much",10Oct2019,2
82,"I've known this one girl for maybe 7 years or so, but I've always found her annoying. It wasn't so bad, as long as there were others or it wasn't for too long. She's always been really friendly and a good person, but she's just... immature. Her jokes are poor, usually overused puns or stating the obvious. Almost like that grandpa that is trying their best to be relatable? That's what I can think of.  I don't hold it against her, in fact I feel guilty for disliking her. I've never been openly rude to her, there is no reason to be mean towards her. I should also mention she has Asperger's, and I understand that it affects social growth and abilities, another reason why I have never really spoken about my disliking.

Her and my girlfriend are really close, and I have never told her to not hang out, or turned out a little friend gathering with the two or other people. So this weekend we have a comic convention coming up, which I'm mega excited for but now I'm anxious due to now knowing that the friend is going to be hanging out with us the entirety of the two, and possibly three, days that we're going. Now I can spend a few hours around her, but the last time I went to a convention with her I wanted to rip my hair out and that was just a day and a half. I want to talk to my gf about it because I don't want to enjoy myself and not be irritated and possibly affect others, but I dont want to come across as selfish or a bitch. Again, I have nothing personal against her and I'm not mean to her, I just don't click with her. At all.

So, what do I do? Should I bring it up? How do I deal with this weekend? Or am I being a bitch for feeling this way?",10Oct2019,1

My undergraduate is in art and psychology, so super helpful there... since college I've had a couple different jobs mostly dealing with kids and I'm almost 30 now and I'm just tired of it.

Right out of college I worked at a daycare for about a year but quit because it was an extremely unhealthy and toxic environment where we had way too many kids per room and the leadership didn't care. Thankfully through that though I got a great gig as a nanny and did that for several years but the kids grew up and they no longer needed me. So then I tried my hand at art through Etsy and such but got burned out because of the pressure of having to pay bills through my creative outlet. Currently I'm working as an assistant teacher in a Montessori program, But after a day like today I think I'm just done working with kids.

So what can I do next??

I absolutely love learning and really want to go back to school to get a master's but don't know what to get my focus in so I don't want to accumulate lots of debt for a wasted degree.

I have a strong passion for reading and I thought about maybe being an editor or a reviewer or something like that but I'm not sure if it will be lucrative enough to pay bills or how to even start...

My husband and I have thought about opening a small business (game/bookstore) but never have because we don't have the capital to start. Plus we're afraid that we won't make enough to pay bills or it will be extremely time-consuming and difficult to sell enough to make ends meet, and therefore not worth it.

Eventually I had to deal with sitting in the library alone and did that for a couple of years.

94,"2.5 years ago DH and our than three kids took on a ten year personal contract with my parents to purchase their home. The house was paid off, they wanted to move out of state and did a refi on this house to purchase their new house. The agreement was we would make payments to them for ten years, on top of paying the property taxes and at ten years we would get a loan for the remainder of what they would sell the house to us for. If we decided in the ten years to move out and not get a loan on the house, they would return all the paid property taxes to us (my parents idea, not ours, they felt it was fair that way). 

Fast forward to today. In that time frame, DH got seriously hurt, lost a job, we unexpectedly had another child, he got a new job and thankfully makes much more than before we moved here and came to this financial agreement. We’ve put a lot of money into the house before the baby was born (40k+ out of pocket and we’re taped out now) but now it’s becoming difficult financially. The property taxes went up over 2k what it has ever been the first year and continues to go up. Being able to pay for that, pay our bills and afford four kids has us taped out. We had unexpected water damages and fixes the beginning of the year that had to go on credit. We are now working on paying that off. DH works every bit of overtime they throw at him. We are keeping afloat but we can’t afford anymore things to be done to the house.

It’s becoming evident my dad is extremely attached to this house. He wants things done to the house that needed done when we signed the agreement and we didn’t realize needed done so soon and he keeps pushing we do it (for example, the house needs painted and needs done this next year however I’m not sure how we will begin to afford that). It stresses me out and DH. As it is, we are still dealing with the hoard he left behind (he was a closet hoarder and we were left to clean up all of his hoard he just didn’t want to deal with). It’s becoming an expense just to dispose of it. We had a main water line burst the first year, a line upstairs burst and did ceiling damage we had to repair... needless to say, this place has been an expense... which I realize homeownership comes with a price and repairs...  but every time something happens he gets upset at us like we did sometime and then freaks if it’s being repaired properly. He always has a list of things he wants done to the house and can never come visit without making a list of things we need to get one. It’s a nightmare to be honest.

Right now, he’s insisted the house needs painted and the back deck needs rebuilt. Two things we cannot afford and probably can’t for another year or so because we’re trying to get out of debit to free up money that won’t be going towards credit card debt.

Last week they asked if we would want to move to were they live. Cost of living is much cheaper but DH line of work isn’t plentiful there and its summer year round. It also means moving four kids, three of which have been established in this school district their entire lives. What they are asking is we do all the minor fixes and clearing out and my dad will paint the house and do the big repairs he wants done and take the remainder after the house sells and buy us a house down there and we make payments yet again to them. That DH quit his job and make a leap of faith. Honestly, the offer is nice as in they want to charge us less per month to live down there, but DH doesn’t want to quit his job, the kids don’t want to move there, DH and I hate the weather there... plus, it leaves us financially tied to my parents still. 

I feel like they are doing this for a few reasons: they found out they have to pay taxes on the money we are paying them monthly and they don’t want to do that and they are regretting the refi. DH and I feel obligated to do all these things my dad wants done to the house when he wants them done as technically it’s still kinda their house. However, we can’t do them as quickly. If we had known we might walk away from the house we wouldn’t have put so much money into the house. 

DH think it’s best they sell the house and we walk away but not move down towards them. The next issue lies in there is no where affordable for us to move to around here. The cost of living went up so much that we can’t even rent a place big enough for a price in our budget. I feel like they know that and it’s forcing us to have to move down there. They keep saying if we want to stay here that’s up to us and they aren’t trying to force anything but I feel like they honestly are. It’s to the point I’m so stressed out and can’t hear another day of “you really need to paint the house, taxes are much too high now you need to move down here”.  The more I think about it the more bitter I am that they left this stuff for us to repair knowing it needed done sooner than we expected yet would fix it this spring to sell it to a stranger... but that’s probably my anxiety speaking because I’m stressed. 

So my question is, as an outsider, what would you advice we do? Getting a loan for another house is out of the question as housing costs too much here. 

So far, dh have come up with a few options:

1. They sell the house, we move down there, he finds a new job and we just learn to like it down there.

2. They sell the house, we get all the property tax money we paid, use it to pay off our debt and to hopefully find somewhere locally to rent.

3. We tell them we aren’t 100% sure and to give us until spring and DH focuses on finding better work so we can afford the repairs and try to afford paying the property Tex in monthly increments instead of all at once like we have been (it was done this way as it would add $650+ more a month to our payment and that made it difficult to do all year round). 

4. Tell them to back off completely and we will get it done when we get it done.",10Oct2019,2

I'm now realizing that the confidence he seems to have only hides a sad, lonely person unable to form genuinely trusting friendships.

He told me he knows his fear is irrational, but at this point the idea has been drilled into him and he sees no way of changing.

He knows that this is causing him unhappiness, but he said I was the first to suggest that it is something that could be changed. I encouraged him to talk to school provided guidance counselors and he seemed open to the idea.

100,"I work in retail, and have been with my current company for 4 years. I’ve had this crush on my manager for awhile, as long as I can remember. For the sake of no one I know realizing I’m the op, I’ll call my crush Jack. Anyone else I mention will have a fake name as well. It wasn’t immediate but it just happened to hit me one day that I had feelings for him. I can’t exactly remember when it happened, but I know it was before I had been there a year. I’d been fighting it for awhile, and just tried to ignore it. I dated and hooked up with a few guys so that helped me distract myself for a little while. I stopped seeing anyone exclusively after the last guy used me big time and skipped town. After that I wasn’t really serious with anyone for awhile. 

I guess my feelings started to show cuz one of my other managers picked up on it. I’ll call him Dave. Dave was a laid back guy, kind of sexist. But he sometimes gave good advice and I knew he wouldn’t tell anyone so I emotionally dumped on him a few times. It was around February my second year at my job that he started saying since me and jack didn’t have anyone for Vday we should go on a date together. Jack joked he could only afford to take me to Waffle House and I joked back that I’m too high maintenance for that. Of course he was oblivious to what Dave was trying to do. I wasn’t sure what Dave was up to myself. I thought maybe he just wanted to pick on Jack because as far as employees knew he didn’t have a gf. So for months it was the go to joke for Dave. It didn’t bother me cuz I knew he didn’t know about my crush. But as time went one I started to doubt that thought. 

Finally I broke down. I asked Dave if it was that obvious I liked Jack and if anyone else noticed. He said it wasn’t hard to see I did, but no one else was talking about it. He doubted anyone else noticed, as I didn’t really talk much about Jack to them. I was relieved no one else had said anything about it, everyone talked to Dave about things in their lives. I went home that day and couldn’t get Jack off my mind. It was getting harder to ignore what was happening. And I was embarrassed. Jack isn’t a bad looking guy, but he’s not my type either. I tend to go for dark haired guys who are wrong for me. What was making it hard was how jack treated me. He treats everyone the same so I knew I wasn’t anything special in his eyes. Most of us at my job were younger than him. And he acted like a big brother to us. I was in a bad relationship and he would let me know I needed to get away from the guy I was seeing. The guy was the one that skipped town. He’d advise us on things even if we didn’t ask. I guess he had issues with siblings and wanted to make sure we didn’t do the same.

I finally told jack how I felt. I was too nervous to do so in person, and the only place we ever saw each other was at work so that wasn’t gonna happen. I finally sent him a text one night after wrestling with my decision for a few hours. I wasn’t used to having to clue a guy in that I liked him. I’m not gorgeous or anything. I met most of the guys I dated online. No one ever came up to me and asked for my phone number, like I assumed happened to other girls. I also didn’t go out and do much so I didn’t meet new people. But I felt I shouldn’t have to do this, that jack should be telling me he liked me. My pride is my usual downfall. Idk why I’m so prideful. Anyways I finally messaged him. I pretty much said I had feelings for him, and I’ve had them for a long time. I also said I wasn’t going to act on them so he didn’t need to worry he’d lose his job. I can’t remember what else I said but that’s the gist of it. He didn’t reply back until the next day. He’s not adept when it comes to technology. He has a basic prepaid phone. He doesn’t go online much and he has no social media accounts. So he’s not attached to his phone. He replied he had left his phone in the car so he was sorry to make me wait. He then said he liked me as a coworker and friend. He really appreciated my friendship. I was hurt but I  knew he didn’t feel the same. So I acted like nothing had happened and he did too, or so I thought.

Later I found out he had mentioned the text to my store manager. I was livid because I knew I could easily be fired. I confronted jack about it but he never gave me a straight answer and eventually I dropped it and accepted my fate. But my store manager never mentioned it. Later Dave told me Jack was just trying to protect himself from losing his job. Then later he also told me Jack was kinda bragging to the store manager. I let it go cuz I wasn’t going to get a straight answer from anyone. And I started seeing a guy I had fallen head over heels for. He was 40 as well ( I have daddy issues) and I had fallen for him at first sight. Somehow jack found out about the guy and knew who he was. He came to me saying that I needed to stay away from him because he was a womanizer. I stuck with the guy because jack didn’t actually know him just knew of him. Jack would mention him and try to convince me I needed to stop seeing the guy for months. It finally did end a year later after I discovered the guy was not exclusive to me as he had made me think. Ever since then Jack will give me unsolicited updates on the guy. Dave says it’s because he’s bragging and trying to prove he’s the better man. Which I don’t understand why he’d do that because he told me wasn’t interested in me. And he had told me before he did have someone who lives 3 hours away from where we live. He goes and sees her when he can but for some reason they can’t move in together. He won’t tell anyone her name or tell us anything about her.  Dave thinks he’s making her up to make me jealous. 

I feel like he’s giving me mixed signals and stringing me along. I’m tired of it. I know I should probably get another job and get away from him so my crush will go away. I just don’t have a lot of skills to get anything that pays well and I have a mortgage and bills that I can barely make it on what I do make. When I mention getting a new job to jack, he freaks out and lectures me on how I won’t find anywhere that will give me a whole dollar raise like my current job has, and that the grass is always greener on the other side. He even said I’d hate shift work and I wouldn’t want to work at a factory or plant. I don’t mind working a 12 hr shift. I don’t mind busting my ass, I do it at my current job for the little pay I get. Other than retail/ fast food and a few banks, most of the job opportunities in my area are at a plant or factory. I just need to get away from him and I need it to be a place that pays the same as I’m getting now or more. I’m just not sure on what to do.",10Oct2019,1
101,"
  I have two brothers and a sister. One in particular destined to be a spoiled little asshat. My sister is super sweet, my not spoiled brother has a rare disease that causes him not to grow mentally and physically, but he’s also super sweet. I loved basketball growing up but my parents never went to my games, neither did they go to any other event I tried to impress them with(baseball,art competitions, choir,etc.) Out of the kindness of my heart I took upon the task of teaching brat my passion of basketball(to which he still thinks that he got into playing himself and is naturally good 🤬). My parents were all over it. They told me to keep teaching him. He started getting good. They paid for his training, at around $300 a month, which is ridiculous since we are at the lower spectrum when it comes to income. They went to all his games, even recorded every one. They loved him so much. But they created a monster.

He is selfish, lazy, arrogant, conceited, entitled, disrespectful, dishonest and a whole host of other words that I shouldn’t say. He treats the rest of us like servants, always bossing around the other two and bullying them, making them cry. Telling them to do stuff for him and telling them what to do in general. Every day I come home from a long day of school just to have to defend them from him. Calling my sister dumb, ugly and always trying to get her in trouble. Hitting the two. Who the FUCK hits a girl, and a disabled weak boy? And it’s not like he’s a child, he’s in fucking 8th grade, grow the fuck up. The worst part is that even if I tell my parents they would yell at ME for trying to get him in trouble and I would get in trouble. He would annoy everyone every day, straight up harassment. But of course I couldn’t get mad because they would be afraid I would “hurt him”. Trust me if I could I would beat his ass to teach him a lesson but you guys protect him to the teeth. Because my parents don’t teach him any lessons and he has no discipline. 
     Every time he gets in trouble he gets forgiven in around 10 minutes. The longest they’ve been mad was a day. Even for BIG things like STEALING a phone and staying up past 11pm on it gets forgiven within a day. (He’s not allowed to have a phone). They threaten punishments but never do it(my favorite one is no more basketball, yeah right you wouldn’t be able to live without bragging about his basketball to everyone). This literally causes him to always think he’s right about everything, he doesn’t accept what he did wrong and never learns so he keeps doing it.
      He is a complete asshole. I cant even list everything he does. He forces my sister to buy chips for him(my parents don’t let us eat chips btw), and freeloads off his friends as well. He does a bunch of things he’s not supposed to and gets away with it. He doesn’t take showers and whenever my parents tell him to, he turns on the sink and wets his hair. My parents even asked him one time why his hair stinks and they still believe he takes showers. My parents believe all his lies. 
       He tells the other two to do everything for him. He even tells my old dad to run and get the ball so he can practice shooting. He’s very rude to my parents in general but they don’t bat an eye. He fakes a bunch of things they tell him to do including brushing his teeth 🤢. He thinks the world belongs to him. 
     My parents always brag about only him to others. They otherwise call me sensitive, call my sister dumb and ugly and never talk about my other brother. For Christmas he got in trouble and they said he wasn’t getting gifts. He got a literally closet full and everyone else got one. My parents felt bad for me so they gave me a gift that was from his pile 😑. There are so many other spoiled instances I can’t list. I want to but there’s actually too many to write down. 
    I can’t do anything. They ignore me when I try to talk about to them. They yell at me when I yell at him. My siblings are growing up in turmoil and I can’t do anything.",10Oct2019,1
102,"I recently graduated college in the PNW with a degree that is ""impressive"" but totally different from what I would like to do, and so I don't necessarily need to stay here (industry is good here for my degree, not necessarily for my interests). I'm incredibly lucky to have a mom who is supporting my rent right now, but I promised myself I would decide by Nov 1st what's next for me so I can be independent. I love the city that I'm in but I think I'm ready to move on. I've been applying to schools in DC and my hometown in the Midwest (where my sister is) but its been slow going to hear back. 

In a few weeks I either need to pick up any job I can get here so I can pay my own way, move back home with my mom until I land a job I want, go live with my sister and hope a job there works out until I can get my own place, or throw caution to the wind and start new in DC, again hoping a job will work out.

So that I don't have to get into a whole pros/cons list in this post, my question is really just ""how do I make myself do it?""

103,"So basically I've been talking to this girl online for the past couple of months now. I developed feelings for her and she did not reciprocate. However, every once in a while me and her will do flirty exchanges with each other and she most definitely enjoys said exchanges. She also made other hints that she may be interested (saying she finds me attractive and that she would look my way if we knew each other irl). 

Recently, I called her out on using me as a doormat because this shit has happened to me before and I'm not gonna allow it to happen again. Why would she return flirty exchanges and say shit like ""I'd be looking your way irl"" if she didn't have feelings for me? She ended up denying that she was using me. I'm currently taking a break from speaking with her while I take a breather, collect my thoughts, and figure out my next move. About 4 days after I cut contact, she sends me a message once again denying the fact that she was using me and said ""I appreciate you"". I ignored the message of course. I feel like she's lying and that she is indeed using me for attention, especially considering the fact that she flat out admitted that she has no friends other than me. Under normal circumstances, I would cut said person off after a rejection. However, the fact that she has no friends makes this decision even harder. 

I planned on going ghost for a little while and then coming back in 3 weeks. I've heard stories about girls changing their feelings about a guy after the guy takes an extended absence. I'm genuinely unsure if this girl has very, very deep subconscious feelings for me and just needs an absence to bring it out or if she is indeed using me for attention because she doesn't have anyone else. I just don't appreciate it when someone gives off subtle hints that I might be seen in a romantic light only to get clearly rejected. This whole situation sucks. What is everyone's input on this?",10Oct2019,1
104,"*So just a little backstory, I'm someone who generally has trouble making friends, and I'm not an overly social person, so I don't actually have many friends at all.*

&amp;#x200B;

For most of my time at school, I haven't really had any close friends to talk to or just to hang out with in general and recently I met a guy who was super nice and genuinely a really good friend. We started to talk around a year ago and since then we have become really good friends. That is, until pretty recently where things have happened that has led to us drifting apart and not even talking anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's what happened. As you may know, the school year has just started and my friend and I (lets just call him D) had stayed in contact all summer and had even hung out a couple times during the summer. It's the first day of school , and we figure out where to meet up, etc... I see him at school, and things seem normal. I'm just happy to see him and we start talking about what classes we have and just make conversation. (Some more information) Something very important to know is that D has a cousin, and D really dislikes him, and we both find him quite annoying. When we first became friends, I assumed that I probably would never be as close to D he is with his **own** cousin, because of the obvious blood relation and whatnot. 

But what became apparent as our friendship grew was that D **REALLY** did not like his cousin. We would be on the phone, his cousin would call him and he would often let out a loud sigh and say things like, ""Ah, sh\*\*, my cousins' calling me, let me deal with this."" that sort of thing. And as we talked he repeatedly confided in me that he much prefered me to his cousin, which to be honest, shocked me a little, but I didn't really question it, since I didn't mind being closer to D at all.

So when the school year finally starts (we don't share any classes except visual arts once a day) I'm excited to pick things up where we left off at the end of the last year. But what happened was **DEFINITELY not** that.

107,"My mom and I have very similar personalities but they often clash. When we’re both in good moods, we get along famously. However, in the past couple of years as I have grown up we have started to fight a lot more over super tiny things. I can take the blame for about 75% of these things because if I’m being honest, I always think I’m right about everything. This is my worst flaw. I am conceited at times and always feel the need to show others that I am smart. I don’t act this way towards acquaintances and friends as I come off as humble. But I judge super quickly and deem myself as superior. My parents have split time so although I see her often, i don’t see her everyday. I should use this time to reflect on a fight that I might’ve had with her but I usually just forget about any fights. I’m not saying I’m all to blame either. She thinks it’s appropriate to call me a bitch and does so pretty frequently. She also lies a lot and breaks promises. Anyways, things hit their breaking point the other day. One night she barged in the front door (from a night out) with her boyfriend (who I like and respect) and came into the living room where I was sitting. She told me sternly to go upstairs. I did because I thought something was up. As I sat there on my computer I heard noises from downstairs. I heard the furniture being moved a bit and I thought I heard a slap. I also heard a loud noise from my mom. I thought they were having sex. I started to walk around upstairs to make them hear me. I thought they would stop if I did. I heard the boyfriend say “I wish they [the kids] weren’t here. I feel uncomfortable.” I thought that was even further proof that they were doing what I thought they were. I couldn’t sleep because of the noise and when my mom came upstairs I screamed at her. I said “what you are doing is extremely inappropriate”. I said I would call my dad and tell him about what she was doing while I was in the house. She said I was wrong. That I was terribly wrong. She later told me that they were breaking up downstairs. She has barely talked to me in the two weeks since and she won’t do anything for me. She won’t pick me up from school or attend small little open mic that I’m doing that she knows means everything to me. I understand. I am so sorry for everything I’ve done to her.

Since 18 and my entire adult life prior to this year I've achieved nothing. I ran around the world drinking, partying and fornicating in different countries. Never had a real job in that time, I was without passion, directionless and depressed.

Until this year, I enrolled into a radio broadcasting course in my hometown in order to try and make something out of myself using the only skill I can solidly say I have: talking. 
I fell in love with it immediately. In my country radio is still super popular and I really threw my all into the course and gave everything 100%. 
I was approached to apply for a big internship, only the top few % of students get this internship offered to them and I was one of them! Wahoo! 
I spent hour and hours on my application and I didn't even get an interview. Everyone around me gassed me up telling me I had it in the bag. I didn't. 

Since not getting it, I've looked around for other jobs, called all the contacts I have, knocked on too many doors, I even went on a 3 day road trip to visit every radio station on the island to pitch myself. And nothing. Nada. Nobody is interested.

Before the transplant they did a special blood test called a Peth test that measures the amount of alcohol she had for about the last month prior to the test, which was a surprise for us. Her condition worsened rapidly recently however, and they had to perform the procedure before they had the results of the test. Today the results came back and they were not good, in fact one of her Doctors told  
me candidly they would probably not have performed the surgery if they had seen these numbers before the transplant. My mother was having about a glass or two of wine a night (to my best knowledge), far from an alcoholic but her doctor was clearly pretty upset about the numbers and the potential implications of that for her post-transplant future.

131,"Let's go back to this time last year. Me (21M) and my three roommates (21M) are all going to uni and things are great. Fast forward to summer and I decide I want to drop out of school and move back to my home city. This wasn't an easy decision and I was overcome with doubt, guilt, etc. etc. and I keep things to myself for now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I finally bite up the nerve to tell them \*\*one month before\*\* we go back to school. There was some tension, but we worked it out that we would try and find a sublet (I say we, but I was the only one making any effort to find one, which at the time I thought was fair). A month goes by, no sublet. They tell me to pay rent and I do because they were my best friends and I didn't want any drama. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was two months ago, I've been living with my parents up until now but I'm looking for a new apartment. I can't afford rent if I'm still paying for this other place, and honestly I've been pretty upset with how things have turned out. What should I do?

133,"More of an advice thing than a relationship thing.

Background, me (23F) and my fiance (28M) have been together for 4 years now. Lived together for 3.5 and already have 2 kids together. Engaged for 2 years now and we were waiting until I get a better job and we can get our feet on the ground before we had a fun big wedding.

Now my family is upper middle class, but they are very much a ""make it on your own"" type of mentality so I haven't been given any hand me downs and I'm expected to pay for a good portion of my wedding myself. My fiance is from lower middle class and have same mentality. Now my fiance and I and our families are expected to have a fun large wedding. It's what everyone in our family does.

Now I finally got a gig that pays great, in my field, steady income. Now we also get health insurance for the first time (yay!) And my finave desperately needs it. Hes never been to the dentist before and has had a broken tooth for almost a year but we couldn't afford to get it pulled or replaced without insurance. Plus I just dont want him without care.

So I want him on my health insurance plan, but we have to be married for it to happen. Now I want a big fun ceremony and he does too. I'm also worried about what my family would think if I told them we had a quick courthouse wedding in order to qualify for health insurance. I'm afraid if we get married now we'll never have an actual wedding. 

But the practicality of it......

I need advice, anyone have any experience with quick courthouse weddings, or if you regretted/really enjoyed having a large wedding? Anyone with the same experience share your story. I need to hear your voices and opinions.

TLDR; Should my fiance and I get married purely for health insurance reasons?",10Oct2019,2
134,"So about 4 months ago I moved in to a bachelors suite attatched to a very nice 2 story home. My place is located directly beside my next door neighbors kitchen. Our units are seperated by a door that is locked by both sides and its through this door that the insane amount of crying filters through.

 Ever since I moved in there hasn't been a single day thats gone by where I haven't had to listen to obsurdly loud scream-crying coming from my neighbors 3yr old boy and 4yr old girl. While I have a very finite space to move around in they rent 2 story home with a ton of space and yet it seems the kids are always sent to the kitchen (right beside my door) to moan. 

I understand that toddlers can be loud but this isn't my first time living beside/ near kids this age. The amount of noise the kids make is only matched by the yelling the mother and father do in turn. What the fights are about I couldn't say. My neighbors are fluent in English but when at home prefer to speak another language so while I can here every word they say I don't have the slightest clue what the fights are about. The crying usually starts around 8:30 in the morning and can go as late as 9:30-10 at night. I spend most of my time with headphones on but the noise from that family is so loud that it bleeds right on through.

The parents don't seem to be in a happy marriage so besides the loud playing the kids do i only ever hear there folks fighting or the kids losing there s***. 

I've only had company over twice since moving in and because i wear headphones all the time make little to no noise. I'm terrified to bring my friends let alone a girl home on the weekend because if I so much as leave the bathroom fan on the father will march over to ask me to turn fhe noise off. I have to go to bed early and wake up early for work so this familys behavior effects not only my home life but work as well. 

What can I say? Tell your kids to stfu? Fix your f-ed up relationship? I have 8 more months on my lease and can't afford to break it. I don't want to start anything because I suspect this family is related to the landlords and I know that the home owners would take there side if i brough this dispute to them. I want to crank the volume on some video game when the crying goes on for over 5 minutes but i know that'll only escalate things. If anyone has a suggestion on how I can handle my situation please let me know.",10Oct2019,1
135,"So today, someone said the only reason I am volunteering for a specific college event hosted by their club (Club A) was for self-serving purposes. They said apparently I am political and I am only volunteering to show-face and gain favors. 

I am in club B and we are technically an umbrella club under club A. My club advocated for rule change in the rules of club A and this friend implied it was self-serving our proposal. So the thing is, I acknowledge there is some weird tension between club A and B, but in my mind, it was something to resolve through conversation.

I am starting to wonder if I should still volunteer if they are assuming I am only there for our interest. I feel like I owe no one an explanation of my intentions (which to be honest, yes, I wanted to show-face and support this event because of all my years here, i have never gone to it. Partly because of busy schedules in the past and stuff happening in my own life).

Argh, I hate it when I rant on... but should I still volunteer or kindly inform them that I will not be volunteering citing other reasons?

136,"I'm 16 (F), and I got in a relationship with a guy named M. We were together for a year and a half, but had to break up as I am incredibly ambitious, and my schedule did not allow for the amount time that M wanted to spend with me. I am not as romantic as a person, with past traumas that make me a less than touchy person.  He wanted to go out every single week for several hours, and always wanted to kiss and hold hands and stuff. I made a lot of concessions, but there was a point where I couldn't anymore, and it caused me anxiety to be around him. We were compatible, but eventually realized that he had needs I couldn't fill, so we split up amicably. We have remained close for the past couple months. 

For the past eight years, I've had a best friend named B. We've always been close. During our relationship, M often felt insecure because of B's and my friendship, and I ended up consciously drifting from B. B understood, as he and I both have similar opinions on relationships and friendships. I was always faithful, both emotionally and physically, and M knows this.  


It has been six months since M and my relationship ended, and we've remained close friends. However, B and I have become incredibly close, and started dating. It is clear that B and I are more compatible, as we are a similar level of busy, have similar expectations, and are both asexual.

I revealed the news to M, and M told me that he was going to need time alone and has refused to talk to me. He also told me that he was sick of me and needed space.

137,"Some background: My roommate has lived in the same apartment as me and my two other roommates for about 2 months. She has a pug and from the week she moved in until now, the problems regarding the pug have only gotten worse. The pug has pooped, peed, and thrown up in the house multiple times. She brushes him inside the house and rarely (if ever) vacuums to clean it up. One of our other roommates has allergies to dogs and has repeatedly asked that she take better care to clean up after him. She works part time (maybe 15 hours a week) so she has plenty of time to take care of him and clean up after him, she just doesn’t.

The neglect: in addition to the above, the roommate who owns the dog keeps him in a crate in her room whenever she leaves the house (often 8 or more hours). While this isn’t exactly the issue, the issue is that she will go 12+ hours without letting him outside to go to the bathroom. Last night he went 18.5 hours without being let out. This happens almost every day. And when she does let him out, the longest she does is maybe 10 minutes. Along with that he is getting very little water and sometimes she forgets to feed him.

We’ve talked to her about the situation and how she needs to take better care of him, but she’s resorted to keeping him in her 10x10 room all the time apart from the 10 minutes she lets him out a day instead of actually just taking better care of him.

139,"I work retail at a pet store, I love animals, worked with animals all my life and naturally 90% if my skills are animal related in some way. 

I want to switch jobs but I’m uncertain of everything. I’ve been working at a bigger pet store in the US, not pets mart, for 3 years come January. I’ve got keys and I am a manager. 

I love my job but overwhelmed with the sudden changes and realized that all my previous higher ups did not train me..like at all in my field. I know about animals and making sure they are cared for but nobody showed me the business side and the policy side which makes me look stupid asf. 

We’ve had a lot of management changes and I’ve personally seen 3 general managers come and go. We’re on our 4th one who is EXCELLENT but things are still...well, it’s hard to ask questions to learn when you don’t know what/which questions there are to ask?

There’s also a new case of an old face coming back into this store...Not a good one. He was a bully,a asshole and a total fear-using manager. 

This dude, Mike, is a dick and makes people cry and doesn’t give a damn. He was once removed from our store and put into another after making 3-4 people quit and one of then called HR on his ass. He acted racist, homophobic and just a complete douche.

But he came back to our store with a promotion. I believe he had changed some but the ptsd still hurts from the past there. 

Mikes presence, the stress of having to be retrained constantly, I’m starting to think I could even have a learning disability besides my adhd. 😞 

A strong part of me wants to escape..the other part wants to stay for the education of animals to customers, for my otherwise amazing team, for my awesome discount on pet stuff and just the fun times I’ve had there.

Currently I’m making $11.00 an hour. I never Got an annual raise ever due to how shitty the store was in the past years and I can’t move out like I want too. I’m 27 and feel trapped in a retail life, granted I don’t think working retail is bad. I’m happy I have a job, but I feel stuck.

140,"This is going to be kinda long and has a lot of moving pieces to it right now so I’m sorry for the read and what’s probably going to be a bit confusing. I’d really appreciate it if you can read through the whole thing.

So, I’m in college at a state school that’s about two hours from home (gotta keep it cheap these days) and I’m going on week 7 now. I’m almost halfway through the first semester and I’m excited for the semester to just be done with so I can head home.

I’m gonna go a bit off track here to provide some context. My friend (we’ll call him Austin) is dating a senior in high school back home. Since home is so close by, he visits her almost every weekend. From what me and the others in our friend group that came to school here with us can tell, they’re still doing well.
 
Now I just recently completed my punishment for losing a bet with Austin from a few weeks ago in which I was to use a pick-up line on a girl. I’ve been pestered about it by him and our other friends for weeks in which I tried coming up with every excuse to not do it. I ended up doing it the other night (just to get them to stop) and was shot down (to my relief). Part of it was definitely nerves, but there was an underlying much larger reason that I’ve yet to share with anyone.
 
There’s a girl at home that I want to be with. More than anything. I’m going to call her Kylie from here on. 

Kylie is also a senior in our high school and she’s a friend of mine. I’ll call us “school friends” just because we became friends through school and that’s we haven’t really hung out outside of school or anything. I haven’t seen her since May, but we’ve kept in good touch through Snapchat for the last few months, so I essentially see her face every single day and she sees mine. Obviously, this isn’t the same as seeing her in person everyday but it’s the best I can ask for right now.
Anyways, Kylie has a sister that just so happens to be friends with my sister. From what I’ve been told via their interactions, whenever I’m brought up, she says, “Oh, I love No One’s King!” I know she doesn’t mean it in that way but it’s just some more context for our relationship. 

Now you’re probably wondering why I’m letting myself get hung up on a girl back home when I’m in college. The general consensus seems to be that college is the time to go wild, let loose, etc. That’s why people tend to break up before college or avoid getting into real relationships in college. I’ll explain.
I’m not a fate or destiny or love-at-first-sight sort of guy or anything. Those things are nice to think about, but I don’t believe in them. But let me tell you, the first time I saw Kylie it was like a switch flicked on in my chest. She was literally the only one in the room. That’s about as close as I think it gets to love-at-first-sight. At the time I was a sophomore and she was a freshman. I didn’t even know her name at the time. I would always see her around and just had this massive crush on her. Fast forward to junior year and I actually start getting to know Kylie a bit. Another friend (I’ll call him Jack) was the catalyst for this. Jack, Kylie and myself worked on our school paper which was a pretty tight-knit crew of loud, wild, fun people. We all loved that paper and the staff. Our junior year, Jack was working with some of the intro kids (including Kylie) so in hanging around him during the school day every so often I’d talk to Kylie and we’d joke around a bit. She was always with this baseball player on the school’s varsity team who I’d assumed that she was dating so I sort of buried my crush and turned my attention to another girl. Fast forward again and the three of us are all working together on the paper and my feelings reemerged full force and way stronger than they’d ever been before. I actually got to know her as a person and became friends with her, we laughed, and we talked and I just fell head over heels. A few months into this and I discover that she really was dating the popular baseball player I’d assumed she’d been dating the year before. They’d been kind of on-and-off for two years. It kind of broke my heart but I didn’t see the point (or moral reason) to keep being interested in someone else’s girlfriend so I buried my feelings.
It was really, really hard and I briefly moved on and became interested in a few other girls while still maintaining my friendship with Kylie. I found out near the end of the summer via my sister that Kylie and her boyfriend had broken up. Apparently he was pressuring her into doing something she didn’t want to do yet (can’t really confirm but I think you and I both get the implication). 

Within a week of finding out she was single it all came back to me. At first, I thought it might just be me missing home and hating college, but the feelings have persisted. I’m settled in now and while I do hate college (school is school) and such I’m more comfortable and less emotionally unstable about my situation. Every Snap from her makes me smile. Every time I have a conversation with her about anything rather than just a picture my chest swells. She’s always the first thought I have at the beginning of the day. I think about her all the time. Jack and I are planning on visiting the senior staff when we’re back home from school and I know as soon as I see her my chest is going to tighten up the way it does when you see someone you care about and I’m going to make a fool out of myself.
 
I have no idea what to do. There’s a bunch of reasons this wouldn’t work.

I’m depressed first of all. Who the hell wants to date the depressed guy that can’t even love himself? Is it even fair of me to ask? I don’t want me coming out of my depression to be tied to a relationship, that’s not healthy for anyone. My self-worth should be mine not tied to someone else, especially when we’re this young and I just don’t know how well I’ll do trying to keep those things separate.
 
I’ve also never been in a relationship before. I don’t know how well I’ll do there. I’m sure I’m gonna blow it if I even get so lucky as to have the chance.
I’m not exactly her ex either. I’m not tall or athletic. I might be downplaying myself a bit but I’m pretty average in terms of everything but my height. We’re pretty opposite in terms of personality too. I’m not a die-hard with sports like he is (or she is for that matter) I’m a casual fan. I’m not a partier like he is or as confident. I don’t even know if she’d want to date someone like me.
 
Of course, the big thing is long-distance. Again, not an expert or anything but I don’t think long-distance is the best way to start a relationship out. Hell, another friend of mine broke up with his girlfriend when we all went off to college after a week. Of course, she didn’t want to try as much as he did but still. If I got so lucky to have the chance, I’d be home with her every chance I got. I’d make time even if I didn’t have time. 

There’s also the fact that I have no idea whether or not she’ll find someone else back home. There’s plenty of guys like her ex back there that are more confident, funnier and better looking than I am. She’d have no issue getting someone to fall for her. She’s gorgeous and just the best. This is something that’s been haunting me but it’s not like I have any right to be jealous. Aw hell she just snapped me while I’m typing this and my heart stopped. It’s like some cosmic mumbo-jumbo told her to or something. Anyways I don’t own her, she’s never been mine so I have no right to be jealous.

The thing I’ve been holding out hope for is that we start talking a lot more over my long winter break back home and maybe start something then. I think there’s a good chance she comes to my school as her family and her are big on the school. The silly fantasy I’ve had is that we’ll try for that month, work it out for long distance and be together through college. Or maybe when (if) she comes here next year we’ll spend more time together and start something then.
 
Logically I should probably try to move on. But she…I just can’t get her out of my head. She’s inserted herself into every vision of my future. She makes me smile just thinking about her. I see her in music and stories and everything. I’m sure there are other people out there for me but I don’t want there to be. 
What do I do? Please, any advice, anything at all would be appreciated.

Tl;dr I’m interested in a friend back home and want to be with her despite the odds; please help",10Oct2019,2
142,"Here's my situation. I'm unable to maintain my aging car, so I have decided to sell it and utilize public transit. Unfortunately, the train stop is a little over 1.5 miles from my workplace. I'm mulling over my options of how to cover the distance efficiently, but for now I'm walking that segment.

Anyway, it turns out that a gal at work leaves at the same time every evening and if I catch a ride with her, I get to the train stop at a perfect time - about 10 minutes early. Also, she drives past the transit stop on her way home, so it's not out of her way. The extra time and fuel she will use to drop me off is negligible, but I feel I should offer her something because she is doing me a huge favor and this has alleviated a lot of stress for me.

A big concern is balancing trade-offs. My commute to/from work has roughly doubled (now a little under 3 hours round trip, used to be about 1.5 hours round trip driving). My transportation cost has literally been cut in half, but I am losing out on some hours at work (since I can no longer come and go as needed), so I will end up breaking even *at best*. Simply put, I need to make my commute as efficient and cost-effective as I possibly can in order to make this plan ""worth it"".

My initial thought was $10/month, but that felt kind of cheap because that's less than 50¢ per ride (based on an average of 22 work days in a month). $20/month is a little less than $1 per ride, which still isn't very much, but feels like a more reasonable payment. However, I need to manage my transportation costs carefully, so I guess I'm worried about emotion/stress clouding my judgement.

Given my situation and concerns, what would be an appropriate amount to offer each month, without being too ""cheap""? This is in the metro region near Seattle, so that may also be a consideration given the high cost-of-living here.",10Oct2019,1
144,"I’m a property manager of single-family residential homes and I found out this week that one of my tenants died in the house and they didn’t find her body until about a week later (three days ago). She was a hoarder and we didn’t know that until a little over a month ago when we did an inspection on 9/3. I was instructed by the homeowner to send a certified letter, which I did, basically explaining that tenant safety is our top priority and that the raw garbage, dog feces, etc. needed to be cleaned up and that we would be inspecting again on 10/10. He specifically asked me to put that we will be forced to contact the health department if she didn’t comply. 

I called her on 9/26 to verify that she received my letter and our conversation was very amicable - we were both calm and soft-spoken and she explained that she had been in the hospital prior to the original inspection and just didn’t have time to clean up (they get at least a month’s notice of upcoming inspections). I knew the situation was more than just the inability to “clean up” after a hospital stay but she said that it was all cleaned up and she got my letter and was ready for the upcoming inspection and I believed her. I really believed her, I was relieved that the call went well as I dreaded even having to send the letter in the first place. Then this all happened. I didn’t think much about it until I talked with her sister and that sister’s husband, I just suspected a natural death. They were the ones that had a welfare check done over the weekend and found out what had happened. She never had kids and was never married but they explained that she was just incredibly secretive and said that no family had been to the house in the 1.5ish years that she’s been renting from us. The sister is just beside herself because they never even had a CLUE that she was a hoarder and between that and her sudden death, she’s just in shock. The sister’s husband, however, has an odd sense of humor and has insinuated that my letter/call may have led her to commit suicide. I mention his sense of humor because today we talked on the phone after he entered the house for the first time and he laughed and said, “Wow! It really is a mess in there... I might kill my self too. Now you’ll have two dead bodies on your hands.” (I do NOT sense any foul play or anything like that, he’s just something else...). 

Based on things I’ve found out since yesterday I truly believe that this was possibly a suicide. The medical examiner let the family know that they can tell that the cause of death was not a heart attack, stroke or head trauma but that’s it. This lady was a registered nurse in her 60’s and never let anyone believe that the home was in the condition it was/is. She seemed so “normal.” 

I went in today with the biohazard clean up company and it was WAY worse than the last inspection. Everything she told me was a lie... the dog poop that had been on the floor previously was still there and was rock hard and somehow there was even more stuff than before. I do believe that I maybe pushed her to either face the fact that she was a hoarder or maybe she started to clean up and got overwhelmed. We live in Texas and she had turned the AC off... it was 89 degrees in the house. The mess was worse and I just really do believe that suicide was a possibility - should I tell the medical examiner? I left a voicemail for them after hours and I expect them to call me back tomorrow but just wanted to see if I could get some insight/advice from anyone that has an opinion, lived experience, or any other sort of advice. Should I tell them what I think? Does it matter? I know that the underlying cause likely comes back to the topic of mental health but I don’t want any more guilt than I already have. I just don’t know if it would even make a difference for me to say anything or not. 

TL;DR - My hoarder tenant died and I think the letter I sent asking her to clean up sent her over the edge and led to her suicide based on several details I’ve learned... should I tell the medical examiner my thoughts?",10Oct2019,2
145,"I (15) have been dealing with a lot of mental issues that have been affecting my school and my grades are slipping pretty bad.

I know that a lot of people will tell me that I shouldn't be worrying about this type of stuff. I've always seemed to want to do something. When I don't have something to do I get bored; however, boredom for me seems different from what I've seen through other people. When I get bored. I usually try to find something to do to stop being bored but then once I've tried something temporary that gives me no real satisfaction, I get upset that I've wasted my time. Then I try looking for things to distract myself from that and it seems to just loop. I think that having something to work towards and put all my effort into. (something that is not school or related to school because even though I am a pretty decent student, school bores me to tears and I sometimes just want to fall asleep because I feel that what the teacher is teaching will have no benefit.) When I do find something that interests me in the moment, I end up being excited about it and then shortly after (15-45 minutes) I get bored of it and go back to something that isn't helping me. I seem to do a lot of things that won't benefit me in the future. I live as if everything is in the present and I want to start preparing for the future, for what my life might be, but I have no idea what I'm going to do in the future. \\\\ Some thoughts about what I want in the future are: Enough money to live off of and support a family and live comfortably, start a company or organization specifically set to help people (I haven't thought that in-depth about it. Maybe that is one thing I should do. You people let me know)  \\\\ My parents make good money, but i want to be able to do better than my parents, live a happy life, make sure that everyone that I care for and love is well set in their lives, and help as many people as I can in the process and mainly have something to do in the future that does that.

I tried for so long to lose weight, but kept getting bored and going back to playing some stupid video game or watching a youtube video. This same situation applies with homework almost every night, and so I end up getting it done last second before class starts.

154,"My ex and I have reconnected. We hangout once a month for like six hours at a time and talk about anything and everything. He hugs me for a long time when we hangout and doesn’t go inside his house after saying bye until I am totally out of sight and waves to me until I am gone. He invited me on vacation but didn’t tell me details about it and now is going on the trip alone. Yet he always tells me a trip together would be nice because he wants to enjoy hiking and being outside with someone who truly appreciates it. 

He is dating someone and so am I. I think I would marry my partner one day, but my partner doesn’t “get” me emotionally like my ex does and we hardly share any interests (we mainly are always showing each other cool new things to do, but sometimes it’s hard to connect)

He always deflects the convo when I ask about his partner, if she’s going on vacation, if she is interested in what he does, and he always just trails off when responding to questions about her and gets upset when I ask for clarification. At times I feel he is flirting but I don’t understand why he can’t be open about his partner. I am with mine. 

I want my ex to be in my life as my best friend because he truly is the best friend I ever had in my life but my emotional instability broke us. I don’t want to date him because I love my partner but I still want my ex around as someone who I share common interests with and who just gets me better than my partner does. My ex actually listens to every single word I say whereas my partner ignores a third of what I say and it makes me feel

155,"Throwaway because my 'friends' know my account.

I'm a junior in high school in a predominately white town and I get picked on cause I'm a bit nerdy looking and sometimes for being Asian. It wasn't too bad, usual small dick and rice related jokes, until I got back from summer vacation (visiting my grandparents in Taipei). 

Since the start of the new school year, my friends have been distancing themselves from me and other kids have been increasingly saying things about China to me. Of course, I don't care I've never been to China and I'm American but that doesn't matter to them. My friends used to at least say stop to the other kids but now they laugh with them as they shout racial slurs and say things like go back to China or shit about Tiananmen and hong kong. 

For example, two weeks ago some kid jumped on top of me as I was waiting for the bus and yelled free hong kong. It didn't hurt but everyone laughed at me. I get it, everyone has their politics but I'm American and they make me feel bad for being Asian and that I don't belong here. I don't care about HK or China or politics in general but it seems to be everywhere. 

I've gone to the school admin people and principle and there's nothing they can really do unless they see it happen. 

When I'm done with high school should I just move to Taiwan with my grandparents? During my senior year should I just apply to universities in Taiwan?",10Oct2019,1
156,"Hey all. So I've been through some shit with this one friend over this year but I'm not sure how to handle this situation. (I'm Male, She's Female). We are both songwriters. I fell in love with the first song she ever performed for me, however she cannot stand the song and thinks it is awful. I was in a creative dry spell and I wanted to have her see how beautiful the song was, so I decided to rewrite portions of the song that I thought could be improved. I sent it to her and she lost her goddamn mind. I explained myself, but I ended up not responding to her once she started insulting me. (""I don't know why I ever had a friend like you."") The next day she unadds me from Snapchat and we haven't talked for a month and a half.

Now, I really want to reach out to her, however I know this topic will come up when we reunite. I'm not sorry for rewriting the song, but I am sorry that I ended up hurting her feelings. I am a person that flat out refuses to apologize for things they aren't sorry for. Is there any good way to word a sincere apology that won't end up pissing her off, or am I completely fucked on this one? Thanks.",10Oct2019,1
157,What are some good thought provoking conversation starters?,10Oct2019,1
158,"I apologize for any formatting errors I make, never post ever on any of my accounts too often. I’m a boy in high school and there’s a girl I’ve been recently talking to for the last month. We started talking all because she asked if I needed a partner for an assignment in English. The thing was, I was looking around the room, past her since I was intimidated to talk to such a pretty girl. We were able to speak with each other quite well, it was nothing like the awful conversations I have with others (You know, the people who never know how to banter/take things to seriously). 
Our second conversation was amazing, we clicked so well! I was ecstatic for how it went! Talking, laughing, joking and her hitting my arm and telling me to shut up playfully. We were able to walk out of class early one day, so we both went to the library together and sat in the top floor, next to the windows that overlooked the entire courtyard. We originally went up there to read one another’s essay, but we were too chatty and giggly that we never managed to get past the first paragraphs. 
After class, we would walk to the bus pick up area together where was the first time I’ve seen someone she had been mentioning very briefly within our chats. Her boyfriend. 
The guy was tanner than me and I think a bit fitter, but a bit shorter than me. I never spoke to him, I would make sure to say bye to her before we reached him. I felt awful for having these feelings for this girl. It felt like a gut punch to have these amazing first moments just to be tackled from left field, but I didn’t want to be “that guy” who steals another guy’s girl. If I had her, I would feel terrible to have her stolen, I know how it feels. If this girl was happy with that guy, I wouldn’t try anything to interfere with there relationship, though I would continue to talk to her as friends. 
That was a while ago. I just don’t know what kind of messages she’s sending to me. I always sit in the front of the school at a bench that usually confirms that I’m not going to be bothered by anyone since I’m a bit quiet. The thing is, everyday she has visited me at the bench and sat with me just to talk with me. The only time she leaves the bench is when it’s time for school to start or her friends come following behind her, which includes the boyfriend who seems to throw dirty looks at me. Not to mention, very recently when she was speaking to me, she told me about how she’s thinking about dumping her boyfriend and just talking about the relationships flaws. It was out of nowhere and I just sat there, apologizing/giving my condolences. 
Of course, I’m not that crazy. I’m giving whatever I have time. Ive only known her for a short time that feels long, so I’m going to give this a lot more time to digest. I just don’t know how to read her or this situation, I think I’m just blind because of my goo-goo eyes for this girl. Show me the truth because I feel too lucky to even have this girls attention. 

Additional Info: 
•She has a lot of guy friends, so I could be one of them. Since one of them gives her a ride home.
•She’s told me about past experiences in her life, personal things such as family members passings and traumatic experiences.
•She always finds the class that I’m in and walks up to me just to say hi. Even if I have my earbuds in and I’m fully tunnel visioned in my work, she’ll tap my shoulder just to wave at me and say hi. 

Question: How to read all of her messages (if there’s any) and this situation? Am I just desperately grasping at the air for something?",10Oct2019,2

161,"Tldr; Basically the title. 2 co-workers were curious of a notebook I carry and write on all the time recently. I found out they went through the journal and have CCTV footage of it. 

I've been going through a rough patch in life and I've started journaling to help me cope and track my mental health before I really decide it's time for me to talk to a health professional about it.

I wrote very private, somewhat detailed and random thoughts on everything I feel; coworkers, family, pet and even food. She (the coworker) and one other guy have asked about the note that I carry and write on when I feel the need to vent on the notebook. I've explained to them that it's a very private notebook of my thoughts and LOA stuff as well and they were interested so I gave them links to LOA sites. 

yesterday after writing some stuff and going back to my desk, I left my journal on my desk and went to the toilet, made coffee and chatted a bit with another coworker at the pantry. When I got back, the journal had the rubber binder off the book and I was concerned. Then I asked if someone went to my desk  and touched my stuff and my other coworkers didn't know anything about it. Then I found *her* earphones on my desk and I gave them back to her. 

Earlier I requested for access to go through office CCTV and got footage of her and the other guy going through my private journal. Not like opened and closed it immediately, but actually went through it page by page. I feel so violated and angry and upset and I don't know what to do. 

The reason that I'm waiting to see a health professional is to avoid an officially diagnosed mental illness on my permanent health record because of the prejudice of having an actual mental illness _which I'm not sure I have right now, or just usual level of sadness normal people have when they're going through some tough shit_

Should I confront them? I work closely with both of them ---was the previous question.

Now I'm just thinking of bitch slapping or hair pulling 🙄",10Oct2019,1
162,"I don't really know where to start, or if this is even the right place: I'm a male, and 31, but probably look closer to 25 (if that helps in the story). I was visiting my mum tonight for the first time in a while, and I rode my bicycle there. Got there at maybe 8:30pm. The area she lives in is quite notorious for being rough, but I've never had trouble walking around it before - night or day, until tonight.

I left her place around 10pm to go directly to a 24/7 shopping centre, and grab some food on the way back. The area she lives in isn't well lit at all, and rather than ride the bike, I started pushing it instead because it started raining and it was fucking freezing. Also, I pulled my hood over my head because of this.

I got not even 2 minutes away from her place and reached a cross junction; no cars on the street at all, dimly lit, and on the exit I normally turn on to, I see 3 dudes side by side (all probably a bit younger than me), walking directly down the centre of that road towards me like they owned it, all looking a bit shifty IMO. Normally, I wouldn't even think twice, and just carry on my way, but something in me said to walk on straight ahead adjacent to them.

As soon as I cross to the other side of the junction, I hear one of them shout from behind me, ""YO"". I ignored it, and then it came again, and I turned my head to look at them for a moment and they said nothing; we're all keeping pace still. It then comes a third time, and this time I responded with a ""YO"" back, but I already knew what was up, and as soon as I said that, my instinct was to jump on my bike and just fucking floor it out of there. They started giving chase, and I could hear the footsteps getting closer, but thankfully I'm a tiny little bastard with energizer bunny levels of energy.

I managed to get away easily enough, and started pushing the bike on foot again, and just sat in the adrenaline for a moment, and it was funny to me. But obviously, that's subsided and now I'm just processing it all at 100 miles an hour, and can't help but feel I pussied out. I don't generally consider myself anything of the sort, and although I may seem well spoken... I am capable of handling myself as well (no offense), but they were all a lot taller than me (I'm only 5'9), and I was outnumbered - I do believe that considering the situation, I acted correctly in the moment. But there's an element of pride involved as well, and I'm having a bit of anxiety about it too. 

What if it happens again? What if it happens again and I don't have my bike? Did I truly do the right thing evading them? I need to try and stay away from judging myself, or over thinking things, and I know I can't allow this to stop me living my life, but at the moment I'm suffering with anxiety in general anyway due to self imposed isolation, and this is just another layer to that cake basically.

Any advice would be seriously welcome.",10Oct2019,1

I’m working as a a bartender as a causal (Australia), which means I’m not on a contract etc. We have a private group Facebook page for the boss, managers and staff. I closed the main bar last night, which I’ve only done once before.

This morning I wake up to a post from the big boss on the page saying: “Who thinks leaving a bar like this when you close is acceptable? Enough water on tables to fill a swimming pool, menus stuck together, ash trays that haven't even seen a drop of cleaning chemical, dirty tea towels left on the floor or sink, bar mats just clumped in a pile all dog eared so they look fantastic sitting on the bar. If you feel this is above you or you wish for me to find you simpler tasks please just ask me and I'll find some fantastic new opportunities 🚽🧽🧹🧻” 

I’m fucking scared I’ll lose my shifts, and I’m terrified to go into work tomorrow. But also my manager on shift saw me wipe all the menus clean and approves me to sign off, so I’m also cut that he didn’t even bother defending me? I genuinely didn’t even know you needed to put the tea towels anywhere, as I’m going based off what other staff have done? Is this humiliation allowed? What do I do? I have anxiety in general so this has just made me feel like I can’t go back ever again... is this normal in the work force?

As depressed as I may sound, I decided to start a positive aspect of my life to get over a break up. So as everyone advises , to play sports. I did. But I am not a competitive/ aggressive person in general. I wouldnt attack so my playing style is more friendly and chill which would cause my team to lose. I noticed that recently my peers started to feel uncomfortable around me. They would leave me to the last when it comes to picking teams. I feel ashamed and embarassed of myself. I mean, thats an activity that I am trying to get over something major in my life. Now it had become a burden on me. I feel down and picked on . Maybe sensitive a bit.

I’ve had this crush on a girl in my school for a while now. We’ve been in the same friend group since 9th grade but I didn’t start liking her as more than a friend until recently.

Anyways yesterday me, my crush, and another girl were doing a group facetime to finish an (individual) project we had to turn in today. I barely got any work done, which is ok, because I wanted to make a good impression so I just started talking about random topics, playing music, and telling jokes.

174,"We've been best friends since 5th grade... we're in our first year of college now. Throughout our pre college years the friendship survived through some common interests and the fact that I had no one else in the whole school district to talk to or eat lunch with.

 It was fine mostly except during our senior year of high school where she made one horrible life choice after the next and came to me to rant about it, stress me with threats to kill herself, and get involved in her issues that she made herself. Majority of the time she was in the wrong in her problems and I somehow had to give her solutions to her issues while being fragile because she was suicidal. Her bothering me grew more and more until for hours everyday I was texting her and calming her down instead of doing well in school and taking care of my own life. 

But we graduated highschool and I muted her number and never looked back. She had gotten accepted into a nice university 3 hours away and I was going to community college. That summer was great without her I have to admit, it was stress free. She was so far away and I would never have to deal with her again- until on the very first day of community college I see her running up to me as I'm sitting down waiting for a class to start. She practically screams my name and I have to hide my horror and smile and answer her thousands of questions about where I've been making up lies to not upset her. 

When I finally get to ask her how she ended up at community college instead of the university she was so excited to attend and had paid the deposit for- she literally tells me she last minute had decided to come to the community college instead just to be with me. She even is an art major like me so we can be in a lot of the the same classes. I felt sick. 

In every class we shared she sat next to me and I had to unblock her number of course and now every day is the same as before, only worse. Her talking during class always even if I tell her to shut up and getting us yelled at by the professor, her texting me day and night about how she's still suicidal and can barely hold on, her stupid stories about how everyone at college hates her because they give her one wrong look or don't laugh at her jokes etc. She has even gotten to the point of belittling me and bragging about herself because she has much more money than me and recently I have fallen into financial issues. Even if I ask for us to not talk about money she still does. She also has been rubbing her romantic success into my face because she knows I have insecurities about being unable to date. 

If I try to explain how shes being mean she gets all defensive and says that shes just talking about her life and doesnt mean to be cruel when its obvious due to how frequent she brings up the topics and I share my discomfort with them. 

I want her to stop I want to never speak to her or look at her again. But she is always talking about killing herself. I can't end our 7 year ""friendship"" and be to blame if she does something crazy- because she is crazy. I also cant take 2 more years with her and based on what she has been saying so far she plans on doing everything in her power to follow me around even after community college.

I made good grades, but my depression and anxiety got the best of me and I had to drop out at the beginning of the next semester.

Even though I suggested she do it a week or two ago telling her it's important we spend dad's 50th birthday with him as it is a) a milestone and b) might be his last and she threw a fit saying that's how christmas will go if he's still alive too and when will it be her turn to have us, being very desensitized and disrespectful. 

How do people cope with toxic parents like that? I still love her and don't want to stop talking to her, but damn.. we have enough stress in our lives and we are emotionally drained from these rollercoaster rides. She's been doing this since we were 5/6 years old. We give her attention and communicate with her daily, we try to tiptoe around everything because she is menopausal so we constantly thank her for things and show her we appreciate her. I just have no idea how to deal with this anymore.",10Oct2019,4
180,"I had my eyes closed the whole night, but I still don't think I fell asleep. I had some thoughts which felt like dreams, but lasted for a few seconds.

181,"So a few months back I got involved with a group of much younger people who caused me a lot of issues to the point I had to call the police. Basically all started because some guy I had a casual thing with kept manipulating things and lying. He’d start things up, then change his mind, gossip and complain about his friends, then do the same about me (even when I was in hospital with pneumonia or my dog had just died). Lots of red flags of abusive behaviour with him and his friends. Looking at how they treated other people it was pretty clear this was just how he and his friends dealt with their mental illnesses so I kinda just put it down to “they need help” and focused on dealing with the university that this happened in and the police.

Before I moved to a new city, I had a similar casual thing with another guy. Obviously I moved and we got on well so we stayed as friends. Which again I was fine with. Lately he’s started similar patterns of starting something then changing his mind, and a few days ago he said something which implied he was listening to some of the stories being told about me by these younger people (he knew some of them). I really don’t want the same thing to happen again so I think I need to distance myself from him or maybe just completely cut him off. Is this unfair? Am I being over cautious?",10Oct2019,1

184,About a year ago I met a really cool girl. Long story we became good friends. A couple of months ago she became really flirty. At first I didn’t really think it was anything serious. Then she started calling me pet names and pretended to be jealous of other female friends. She even talked about how she loves me and she constantly talked about us having sex. Long story short I ended up catching feelings. Then out of no where she hard friend zoned me again and says things like “your like a brother to me” and now I’m pissed because I was perfectly fine being a friend but she kept flirting and playing with my emotions now I have deeper feelings.  She wasn’t joking or anything at the time. Now I’m genuinely pissed because this makes it hard for me to go back to being a friend I thought things were fine the way they were. I try to separate myself a little while still trying to be a good friend but she constantly ropes me back in. Any advice ? I’m only 19 btw,10Oct2019,1
185,"I've known I've had feelings for my bestfriend for quite awhile now but it's not just because I like the way he looks. I've known him for 7 years and I didn't start thinking about him romantically til I was 17 (I'm 19 now). Everyone has been telling me to just tell him but he has the tendency to be socially reserved and probably wouldn't want to talk to me about it and try to sweep it under the rug. Another factor is that I'm a gay male and he is a straight male. I'm just kinda in an awkward area and feel like outsiders to my problem would be beneficial to help figure it out.

188,"I’ve been in the process of moving for a couple of years, travelled most of the world, succeeded in an element of business, failed in many, dealt with a rotation of death since I was 13 (family, friends, coworkers) that’s been on hyper drive for the past couple of years, meaning at least one every three months. 

Cutting to the chase, I was co-parented by my Grandmother and Mother. My grandmother died in England in 2010, me and my mother were in California at the time, my mother was screwed in a business deal resulting in a car crash on the same day my grandmother died who was in palliative care. Ever since then, my mother and I came back to England and have had lots of traumatic events, from treachery within the family to dried up cash flow and health problems. In that, my mother reconnected with her father under the instruction and demand that my grandmother issued to him. I met him for the first time in 2010, he’s aloof, intelligent and an narcissistic alcoholic that hides it very well in public. 

I started an online business after my grandmother died and that was able to fill a void, I’ve been hovering all around the North Atlantic since I was 16, however I have not been able to face the idea of going back ‘home’ - Firstly, my first romantic relationship was with someone in NorCal and it ended very very badly even though it was long distance back when I was 14/15 which made me never want to go back, then I was offered the opportunity to work for a company (45 hr weeks) for a good salary (250-500k) at 17 in CA or go to college and experience what life is like for normal people my age (I was homeschooled and like I said, worked on my online business for maybe 100hrs/week to fill voids of grief) as well as work on my own side projects (people/companies I invested in/co-managed) and it took its toll and I came out worse for taking that option (wasting time at college, projects went bust with people either stealing stuff, going to jail or dying OR becoming a hit techie that every company (e.g. Apple, DoJ) wanted (what I call ‘Company Alumni’)  I ended up losing out on my health, gained no financial gains but experience from the projects, and gained pretty much nothing but a good grade in college).

I’ve only recently recovered health wise (still repairing from a surgery) and last year, me and my mother went on a journey of history (memory lane) and the trauma each area holds, now the only areas remaining are SoCal, and in the heat of an argument with my mother and grandfather, I decided that it’s time for us to complete the journey of memory lane and trauma, by going back next month. 

This is a battle of PTSD and the ability to move on, and for me personally, have my final bout of grief over my grandmother by going back to the area where I was first informed she died. 

I know the city like the back of hand even today, more so than the areas I’ve lived in for longer, so I consider it, in many ways, home. 

This is written on my Smartphone and I don’t want to accidentally write something that personally identifies me, as I’m tired but I’d appreciate some non-stupid advice. 

P.S. My home was burgled and we lost about $50k worth of stuff, along with family photographs and sentimental/family items and the insurance company isn’t willing to settle, so I have a court battle ensuring with them for the end of the year as well as institutions owing an outstanding $1.9m for various reasons that have to go through court or enforcement that was going to be initiated for this period (OCT-NOV-DEC) so I have a lot of my mind, as everything I’ve just stated above is about 30% of my life that’s ongoing as of today.",10Oct2019,1

190,"Hey everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me explain my situation a little bit. I'm a 25 year old who works full-time in the field of addictions treatment (a job I love). I have full benefits, a pension, and make around 55-58k a year. My educational background consists of a college diploma and a bachelor's degree. I love tattoos and have some and I'm planning on getting more. I'm saving for my own house or condo and will most likely be moving out fall next year since I'll have enough saved. I own my own car, and have a dog. I'm the first guy on her side of the family to go to college and university. I have no debt. So far so good, I'm happy about my life and where it's going. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where I need advice. Despite mentioning everything above, my mother who I love, critiques me on so many things and is still trying to hold my hand through everything (a helicopter parents). She is not happy with my current career and consistently nags me about finding something in the government, that doesn't have shift work (9-5 schedule), and pays more. She critiques my looks (ie. haircuts, beard styles, glasses, tattoos, etc). She always tells me to save my money (like I could find a $20 bill and she'd tell me to put it towards my house) but I have over 20k saved at the moment for a down payment. I'll be looking at houses or condos and she'd nit pick something wrong with the location or the house. I opened to her about my dream of having my own business as a barber in the future but she sarcastically laughs at the idea or isn't super supportive of it. I feel like I can't open up to her when I need to or ask for advice because of this stuff.   

&amp;#x200B;

I know she's only looking out for me, but it can be stressful and it does lead to arguments. I've tried setting boundaries a couple of times but my mother isn't respecting them. I love my mom but I need advice on how to tell her to let me be me.

193,"Hi, everyone. I’m in a low place in my life right now , and I’ve sunken into a deeper abyss of reflecting my entire life. I just want to vent and receive advice from people , anyone really. 

To start off, I’m a 21yo female . 
My life growing up wasn’t the best- but my single mother &amp; family made it work. My mom has always been emotionally , verbally, and psychologically abuse towards me my entire life due to her own mental health issues stemming from her past. My father is a deadbeat, never once cared for me or about me.  

I’ve been depressed since I could remember - stemming since I was in 3rd or 4th grade.  I never felt I was enough , wasn’t the smartest, the prettiest, or anything. I felt like I deserved the abuse my mother gave me - and that I deserved to die . I even remember once wishing to god I would get cancer , just so I would die and make the pain go away, and make her feel pain as I did.

Years later that nightmare came true when around 18 and fresh out of high school, I was diagnosed with cancer (how ironic, I want to die &amp; get this, now I want to live.) however that spiraled me down into a further depression. I felt I was a bother still, someone who always needed help and a burden to others. I was convinced god or whoever’s out there hated me . I beat cancer (3 years in remission now), and my life since then has gotten back on track .
Or so I would think .
This past month and a half have been trying for me. 

I failed a nursing exam (I’m in a nursing program- every exam counts), that same weekend I was arrested along with my best friend for larceny that I didn’t commit. 
I feel as though life isn’t in my favor. I know what I’m speaking about isn’t enough to be complaining and bitching (excuse my French) , but nursing is one of the things keeping me going, if I fail the next exam (which is next week)- I feel it’s over for me. This degree and job are my golden ticket to moving out and being free of abuse and psychological warfare with my mother. 

I’m ashamed and scared of the repercussions this arrest and charge will bring. I know I’m eligible for an ACD program- and I spoke with a lawyer . I just hate the stigma and the feeling of going to jail, having a potential past record, and having my mom shove it in my face that I’m a thief; a criminal; and how she’s never gotten arrested before. 

I only have my boyfriend and best friend to speak to, and they barely acknowledge that I’m in emotional pain and distress - I don’t have anybody else to talk to. I’m afraid of therapists. I’m afraid of asking for help, fear of being an “attention whore” , and people ridiculing me . The feeling of loneliness is unmeasurable. The sinking feeling in my stomach of realizing I am just ... someone so unlucky, hurts. I know there are worst things in life, however this is occurring in my life as of now. 

Any advice, any kind words, validation that I’m not alone in feeling like this helps tremendously. I’ve never spoken like this on such a public forum, but I’m in desperate need of just... anyone’s advice/words/thoughts.  Thank you for hearing me out.",10Oct2019,2

201,"Ever since I could remember, I dreamed one one day finding love and getting married.

After that I moved to another state away from a good paying job I had and a place of comfort. Even though it was kind of the same before I left, I’m vulnerable, broke, and utterly confused. The reason I moved was because of my mother. To be closer to her since I haven’t been for two years. Months after moving I was hospitalized and diagnosed with diabetes.

I haven’t been able to watch any scary movies as it puts me in a weird mood that is really hard to get out of where I get jumpy and paranoid. I have to take melatonin or Benadryl to even have a chance of sleeping. I usually resort to weed as that gets me to sleep the fastest. I’m worried because the more stressed I get the worse it gets. I have a baby on the way and I recently started a new job. With that being said my wife would like me to stop having weed altogether. I’m fine with that except now my sleep is lacking the quality it had before. I wake up more and when I do I am scared. I tense up to the point I can’t move and I have to clench my jaw to stop myself from making any holy shit I am scared noises. I’m not really sure what to do.

209,"So basically I've been talking to this girl online for the past couple of months now. I developed feelings for her and she did not reciprocate. However, every once in a while me and her will do flirty exchanges with each other and she most definitely enjoys said exchanges. She also made other hints that she may be interested (saying she finds me attractive and that she would look my way if we knew each other irl).

Recently, I called her out on using me for attention because this shit has happened to me before and I'm not gonna allow it to happen again. Why would she return flirty exchanges and say shit like ""I'd be looking your way irl"" if she didn't have feelings for me? She ended up denying that she was using me. I'm currently taking a break from speaking with her while I take a breather, collect my thoughts, and figure out my next move. About 4 days after I cut contact, she sends me a message once again denying the fact that she was using me and said ""I appreciate you"". I ignored the message of course. I feel like she's lying and that she is indeed using me for attention, especially considering the fact that she flat out admitted that she has no friends other than me. Under normal circumstances, I would cut said person off after a rejection. However, the fact that she has no friends makes this decision even harder.

I planned on going ghost for a little while and then coming back in 3 weeks. I've heard stories about girls changing their feelings about a guy after the guy takes an extended absence. I'm genuinely unsure if this girl has very, very deep subconscious feelings for me and just needs an absence to bring it out or if she is indeed using me for attention because she doesn't have anyone else. I just don't appreciate it when someone gives off subtle hints that I might be seen in a romantic light only to get clearly rejected.

Do I pull off one last Hail Mary attempt in her unlocking potential subconscious feelings by going ghost for a while? Do I say fuck it, deal with my feelings and just be there for her as her only friend? Or is she indeed using me for attention despite her claims that she's not and am I allowed to have my own selfish agenda and move on from her? This whole situation sucks.

I told my boss and he told me to take it back, and he would pay for the alterations to the sleeves. When I got back to the tailor, they said they would just get the next size jacket up and then take in the waist. I thought, problem solved.

ONE WEEK LATER, I go back in to pickup the new suit. Mind you its a 30 minute drive out of the city. I pick up the new Jacket, take it home and try it on. Thats when I realise: 

The sleeves are just as short as the first jacket except this time, THE SHOULDERS and LENGTH of the jacket are ridiculous. It's now wayyyyy worse than before. Now idk what to do???

26M, born and raised in New Jersey, the prospective job is in Chicago.

Facts on Chicago: Would be moving in with my best friend who has been in the area for 2 years. We'd be able to pool resources and get a BITCHIN'  appartment downtown. Job is in the burbs, would be doing the 'reverse commute' although I'll be carpooling with my new team. Job is in my industry, at a higher level, and for me very fulfilling. Offer has yet to be discussed but will likely be the highest salary I've ever seen by a fair margin. Start date is early January '20. This is the Adventure option, I've never lived in a metro area and the excitement/options for socializing and experience culture would be off the charts.

Facts on Jersey: Born and raised.  Just bought my first home. 2 family property, upstairs unit will cover almost my entire mortgage. Quiet semi rural area close to a  vibrant, albeit small downtown/city (Easton PA). I have been wanting a dog for a while now, only makes sense to take on that responsibility if I stay in Jersey. Currently I work from home which is a hell of a perk. Also worth mentioning that I recently (very recently) met someone who may be pretty damn special after a 15 month dry spell that followed a 5.5+ year nightmare relationship. Finally starting to see some stability in my life.

If I do make the leap, I allready have a plan ready to be put in place to manage my property. Father will be taking over rent and maintenance obligations for me. 

Discuss! A lot of moving parts here, happy to answer questions and apply clarity as needed.

216,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for just over 3 months now, so far everything’s going great we both love all the time we spend together. However she has this separation anxiety. She has told me in the past I’m the only one who can ever make her smile and I’m the only one who makes her happy. Which makes me feel good knowing I can be there for her and make her happy. I love being with her and being there for her. But this separation anxiety is just causing problems. The second I leave her house she’s crying cause she misses me. Which I find heartwarming knowing my girlfriend wants me that much and always wants to be with me. But it’s like she doesn’t understand that before we met we had our separate lives and we still have to keep those separate lives. She’s asking me every hour to come over to her house or pick her up. I mean don’t get me wrong I love her and I love spending time with her, but I need my space, and this separation anxiety just causes arguments or causes her to cry cause she misses me after an hour. I know there’s not much I can do, but I’m just looking for ideas on how to help her with it. I don’t wanna see her go through this, especially not alone. I need ideas on what to say or do to help. Thanks.",10Oct2019,1
217,"In around march, i met this guy online in a group chat, we got along really fast and we were kinda flirty but nothing too serious, we started talking in dm and he wanted to see what i looked like, i sent him a picture and in that week, he really started flirting and naturally, I caught feelings, he said that he would also like it if things would take off but they never did. 

The next day he said he didn’t really have any interest in me and that he couldn’t be sure if he liked someone or not over the internet and that he had a long-time crush on someone already. I told him all was fine but i never got over him.

A few weeks passed and he was flirting a lot with this girl who was also in the group chat, she never really talked but idk what happened between them, they eventually started “dating” and he would tell me that he had nightmares about her dying due to her condition and he kept bragging on about them being together knowing that I’ve never been in a relationship. 

Two weeks later they broke up i know shocking, i was so fucking happy and he said that he got over her in a few seconds (not even possible but i played along). 

So after a few weeks he started hitting on me again ( me still being into him i loved it ) he said that we would meet one day and get you know.. intimate. He kept talking about it and he said stuff like “i love you” or “i can’t wait to be with you for the rest of my life” and then he kept saying that we’re just friends. Or friends with benefits, i mean I don’t think anyone just says that do they? And this went on for about a month or two (started end of july-ish). He kept talking about it in explicit ways and i was talking about maybe going on dates and he said that he also wanted to date. He said that once he comes to my country, we would start dating and since i have a citizenship of his country, i could potentially even more there. 

Everything was great, i was definitely catching feelings and him saying that he would want to date seemed like it was going on and off, he kept slipping in that we were just friends and things like that, at some point he admitted to having a crush on me and so did i. 

Point being, i was being led on so fucking much i hated it but I couldn’t do anything about it. Eventually we didn’t talk as much, he just sent me the same memes, we didn’t have any conversations or anything and he stopped saying goodnight to me, i know it doesn’t sound like a lot but he really doesn’t care about me at that point and my feelings were only getting worse. He started leaving me on read, i kind if knew we were drifting apart and everything happened so quickly it was as if everything only lasted a couple of days. 

So he is obviously still in love wit the girl from the very beginning ( i forgot but he mentioned that he was still in love with her but he also wanted me really badly ). 
 
But i just don’t get it, why do i keep thinking about spending the rest of my life with him, it’s been about a month since we last talked and he’s unfollowed me and he most definitely has forgotten about me, i think im still in love with him or i might not even know what love is but i just got led on and im confused idk what to do someone pease help me I can’t stop thinking about him despite the fact that he doesn’t think about me and probably never cared as much as i ever did. 

Bottom line, i was being led on a lot by a guy and I can’t get over him and i keep thinking about him, please help",10Oct2019,1
218,"Hi, I am a 17 year old senior in high school. I have had a lot of problems with depression (not so much acting on any urges but have bad thoughts) and it has been on the down low until recently. I had a screening earlier this week for ADHD and it has gotten my mood and self esteem down in the dumps hard. My parents have always had super high expectations as I am the smartest of my siblings so they have told me that I am essentially not “allowed” to have ADHD. My dad had told me when I was younger and brought up the possibility that “no son of mine is retarded” so I have stopped bringing it up to both of them. With the college app process going on and my extensive school load (4 AP classes) I have been swamped with work and am not able to spend a bunch of time to relax which has helped me manage the depression in the past.

230,"So a bit of backstory I’ve been pretty much digitilized my entire life. I’ve been playing video games literally my whole life and been playing competitively since my Sophomore year in high school (I’m a sophomore now in college). That ultimately made me lose all my relationships including friends and potential partners in high school and college. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been feeling pretty lonely and severely depressed lately and it started to hit me as soon as I started to lose interest in gaming which was about 8 months ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

As of now I’m majoring in Computer Information Systems and I was wondering if I should change majors because in a way I feel like it enables my past and will end up feeling lonely for the rest of my life because I'll be dealing with technology plus I don’t really find it all that interesting to begin with but maybe that's because I don’t know all that much about it or because I've dealt with it my entire life.

&amp;#x200B;

Even bigger problem is that I feel like I don’t know what I’ll enjoy doing in life because I’ve just been spending time with technology for so long that I don’t really know what interests me particularly in real life jobs. I feel like surrounding myself with people is the way to go and find happiness and I don’t want to do online jobs. I might be looking for a job that has a higher chance of creating meaningful relationships and I want to do something that makes me happy obviously. Maybe I’m just going crazy from this solitude and panicking I’m not really too sure lol

&amp;#x200B;

the other weird thing is that if I make the smallest comment about anyone, even if I say I want a hug from my friend from my FEMALE best friend he gets mad. so theres definately hypocrisy which makes me kinda grumpy.

I feel like no one understands. I have the most negative train of thought of anyone I know, and very rarely let people in emotionally because I consistently expect the worst from everyone. Do people ever really want to live or does it just get worse? How do people have a content sense with their life? How do people have a positive thought process?

236,"Note: First post here, so please bare with me and apologies in advance for any misspelling or grammar errors, anyway here is the context.


So I have been in this relationship with my girlfriend for what is soon going to be 5 years. This is my first long term relationship, and we are high school sweethearts attending the same university (sounds pretty nice right?). Now here is the kicker.

During our senior year of high school, she cheated on me with someone who I considered my best friend. Unfortunately, it wasn't just a one time thing they would sneak off to some private corner of campus and get freaky. This stung me pretty hard because my prior relationship ended the same way, but instead of my best friend it was her step brother. I digress, since it was my first long term relationship I felt that maybe I could forgive and work on what was missing in the relationship. Now fast forward to university.

As we began our first year at university, I went to therapy to fix some issues that I felt affected our relationship and led to that event. We shared the same friend group so we got to see each other on occasion and even had times for ourselves and be together. However, near the end of our first year, we had broken up (it was mutual I promise) because we felt we were going in different directions and yara yara. It only lasted about a week because we saw each other practically every other day in that friend group so we just kind of fell back together. Now move to the summer.

I stayed in university to catch up with my degree and she went back to our hometown for the summer. Now we both got to deal with long distance. For as much as I can remember from summer it seemed okay, she would text me and we would Facetime when we could. However, I felt this urge to go back to therapy because I had this nagging thought at the back of my mind of her possibly cheating on me again. It's not like I would try to actively think about it, it would just pop up out of nowhere, or when scrolling through social media and just seeing posts about cheating in relationships. The therapy kind of helped as it helped me come to term with a few things and that not being one of them.

Now that we are both back up, it would seem that distance makes the heart grow fonder right? Not really, since late August of this year we live in the same apartment complex and haven't really been on a date, (just one for my birthday) and our schedules just don't match up as nicely as it once did. Lately, it seems like we are becoming more distant from one another. Right now she told me she was stressed and that was it, if you were to look at our conversation it seems to be one sided as even I get pretty busy I try to say something or send the occasional meme. 

So here I am. Confused. Because part of me wants to try and make it work, but another part of me thinks I should just let go and move on, as it does seem we are heading in different directions this time. At the same time, she has given me wonderful memories and has opened my eyes new things and experiences and I want to continue to do more, but I am just lost.

250,"This is a very long story with more to it but I'll try to keep it short. My sister has been dating someone for roughly 2 years. About 8 months ago, they were both going to move in with me, share a room, and get a great deal on rent. Lo and behold, he backed out AFTER my sister has already signed a contract (I was already on the contract as well). Either way, it resulted in huge rent costs that my sister hadn't counted on since his share was supposed to offset hers by a lot (this affected my share of rent too). 

So this happens, and I basically think that he's a coward and not good enough for my sister but still, for the most part, a regular guy. Yeah, not the case. My sister comes home FURIOUS and SHAKING and CRYING one day because she was using an old phone of his (hers broke) and found that he had attempted to film her sexually without her permission - gross videos of his adjusting and waiting and then her coming in without knowledge... horrifying. She was SOBBING and utterly disgusted. It was not something that she wanted or was aware of. I jumped into action - I called in to her work for her, called in sick for me, and helped her getting started on a police report while we still had things like the phone with the videos. We ended up both giving statements (there was other stuff that seemed normal but in hindsight could be indicative of his sick habits). I tell her (as do the police) that she doesn't necessarily have to press charges. I gently gave my opinion of pressing charges but didn't force it or try to convince her - she'd been through a lot and I just wanted to show her that I was there for her. Secretly I was hoping we could charge him with voyeurism. She gets counselling from a local group dealing with stuff like this, they separate, she gets all of her stuff back from him, and together we go through and get rid of his stuff (like old hoodies etc) that might ""remind her"" and make her miss him more. I think that it'll be a hard road, but that ultimately she's better off and she can heal and move on. 

Two weeks later they're back together. I'm losing my shit internally. He's obviously either deeply ashamed or afraid of me, because I saw him dropping my sister off one day by accident and he sped off RIGHT QUICK. I'm so angry with him that I haven't said or done anything, because I'm worried about making a stupid and emotional decision. 

My big thing is that he interacts with my parents semi-regularly and may have been around my youngest siblings recently (they're all between ages 4-14). Never with me around. My sister does these get-togethers in secret because I told her I won't be around him at all and she knows I'd call him out in front of other people. My heart breaks that they've bought him dinner, spent time with him, etc without knowing that he's sexually abused my sister and that he's continued taking very clear advantage of her. Where I absolutely draw the line is my youngest siblings. They are my entire world and I don't trust a single bone in this guy's body. I can't describe how scared I am that he'll take his voyeurism to another level somewhere else. I can't have him in my family's home and I want to tell my parents about what he's done so that they know exactly who they're dealing with. I have been torn over this for a while and the only reason I haven't been to counselling myself is because I'm waiting for spots at my university to open up. 

Should I tell my parents that my sister is dating someone who has sexually taken advantage of her? Should I keep quiet because my sister is a victim here and this abuse happened to her, not me?",10Oct2019,1
251,"So I just got catfished by someone on reddit. I should’ve realized that they weren’t who they said but it’s too late for that. Before I realized my error, I had sent a picture of myself in reply to one from them. 

Fortunately, this is a completely clean picture and not a nude or anything. It’s not one that I’d feel particularly bad about people seeing except that I don’t like being in pictures that others will see (oops...). 

Is there anything I should worry about going forward? I can’t think of anything someone could do with what is essentially just a headshot except for maybe show their friends like “hey look who I tricked” but just want to check.",10Oct2019,1
252,"Hi all, 

I'm really struggling with making some career/life decisions at the moment, so I'm hoping I could get some advice! I graduated about 2 years ago and have been working at a large well-known tech company in the south bay area. On paper, it's a great job. I really enjoy my coworkers, my boss is great, the office is nice, and the compensation is very good. 

Recently I went through a ~6 month period where the job got really stressful and it started to really bother me. At the end of that time I sent out some job applications to companies in San Francisco, and now a few months have passed and I'm expecting to receive some offers soon. I've wanted to move to San Francisco for a long time-- I have a lot of friends there and commute there many weekends. Part of the issue is I feel very isolated in south bay, since it's mostly families or highschool kids near me. 

I'm really struggling with what to do. When I sent out the applications I was very frustrated with my current job, but things have gotten significantly better since then. And now I'm expecting to receive some offers that will likely offer me some higher compensation / a better location, but with a less stable/safe company (especially with a recession likely soon). But the more I think about stuff, the more I feel like it would be stupid to throw away a job where I genuinely enjoy my boss/coworkers/job all to move to a more desirable location. Changing jobs is always risky and I feel like I just don't appreciate what I have now. Complicating matters is that my lease ends in a few weeks so I need to make a decision either way. At the moment I'm thinking about just compromising by moving to the city and commuting to work, but it's quite a long ride (~60-90 minutes shuttle ride each way). 

Either way- I'm really unsure what to do. Has anybody else been in a similar situation? It's hard to make a decision on a potential career change when there's so much risk involved (or at least it feels that way to me!). Has anybody else made a move to a more desirable location that resulted in a longer commute? Did it end up being worth it?",10Oct2019,1
253,Every damn time she comes over it’s always some bullshit like “Oh you didn’t clean this” or “you should fix this” I can get it in a friendly way but she says it about everything and my mom has mental issues at times so every damn time she leaves my mom starts crying so it pisses me off because my mom can’t get a job (she’s unable to due to medical issues) and her boyfriend (my parents are split) is in a wheelchair so that stresses her out even more because she has to rent the place of my grandma because it’s the only place they could afford with a safe way for her boyfriend to move around.

254,"I’m a young adult dating a man 2 years older than me (a year and a few months to be exact). We have been together for 3 years already and I am happy to say that I am very much in love and he does make me happy. Unfortunately, he has cheated on me in the past and I do feel like I was never given a chance. I say this because it had happened more than once and fairly recently (since January of this year). He has done everything right since then. I haven’t noticed anything suspicious from him. Phones, Xbox, passwords, and school/work life is shared. We share everything. He’s very loving and has even come forward to reassuring me he wants something serious between the both of us many times.

255,"So basically, I had this friend.  He’d call me every morning, night, we hung out a lot, and I honestly thought we were super close.   I guess not close enough to survive this.   He’s also gay, so don’t think I’m chasing after a straight guy or anything.   But yeah, I finally confessed my feelings after several mutuals encouraged me to.  And...  he only responded with 4 words, telling me it’s fine, but not really acknowledging the way I felt at all.  

It has now been two weeks, and we’ve only talked two times.  We’ve never discussed my confession, he pretended like it never happened.  He also doesn’t text me back anymore, so I’ve given up on doing that here recently.  But he’ll post all over Snapchat, Instagram, etc. so I know he sees my messages, and chooses not to reply.   Should I just block him out of my life since he’s going to eventually get rid of me all together anyway?",10Oct2019,1

257,"I have 2 best friends. We met in elementary school, but got split up when one of them (Let's call him John) went to a different high school than me and the other friend (Let's call him Bob), however we still remained best friends. John made some really close friends at his high school while Bob and I made our own.

Fast forward to now: I'm in my second year of college and John, Bob and I, as well as all our high school friends attend the same college. I'm a really shy person (not as much now), but this semester I've really been pushing myself to step out of my comfort zone and make new friends/be more sociable. The more progress I make, the happier I feel as a person overall. One of the ways I've been doing this is by trying to make friends with John's friends from high school. So far it's been going pretty well. I've made friends with quite a few of them and even hang out with some of them when John isn't there. During the summer, I went on a little outing with John and a few of his friends from high school whom I had never met before. One of those friends happens to be in one of my classes this semester. I was going to sit next to her the first class, but when I walked in I couldn't spot her and I wasn't going to stand there staring at everyone so I just sat down at a random spot. By the second lecture, a friend of mine had switched into my class so I've been sitting next to him since then. Meanwhile, John's friend has been sitting by herself all the way on the other side of the lecture hall. I've tried getting my friend to move to the other side of the lecture hall for a class, but he wouldn't budge and I wasn't just going to leave him randomly. One day John asked his friend if she sits next to me in class and she said ""No he sits on the other side of the lecture hall. I feel like he's avoiding me"". John tells me this and I thought it was a bit strange that she thought it was ME who was avoiding her when she's the one who sits by herself. Nevertheless, after that I felt more comfortable with the idea of going to sit next to her the next class since it sounded like she wanted to sit next to me, but just felt as though I was avoiding her. However, before I had the chance to do so, John tells me that she told him that I remind her too much of some guy who asked her out in high school and didn't take the rejection too well. Essentially she admitted that it was in fact HER who was avoiding me and not the other way around. She's told John this multiple times since then and still sits all the way on the other side of the lecture hall.

On top of this, I've been requesting to follow (or they've requested to follow me) John's friends on Instagram whom I've acquainted or made friends with and they've all accepted and followed back no problem. It's pretty normal for people my age to send follow requests with people they meet, at least where I live. However, John's friend didn't follow me back. I know this is kind of petty, but I figured it may be worth adding.

John even showed me a picture of the guy I remind his friend of and he looks nothing like me (not that it matters).

Do you guys find this behaviour strange? Am I wrong to think that it's kind of rude to avoid someone (whom you've met) because they remind you of someone who annoyed you one time in the past? What do I do? Should I say something? Or should I just leave it be?

All of John's friends from high school are friends with each other so she's kind of preventing any possibility of me going on group outings with them and such.  Which is one of the main reasons this bothers me so much.

TL;DR: My best friend's friend (whom I've met before and spoken to a few times) is avoiding me because I remind her of a guy from high school who asked her out and was rude to her after being rejected.",10Oct2019,1
258,"Seems like I’ve always been in a constant rotation of being with my ex’s/ talking to them. Whether that be for sex, working stuff out, trying to be friends. I wanna stop, I wanna just move on from all of them fully and not feel one thing towards them. I still keep some fragment of a memory like a picture or some texts or even something they gave me. I don’t know why I do this but I want it to stop. 

At times I might hook up with them again or might try to at least only cause I know they will want to or I just don’t even wanna bother with someone new. It’s been a hard process and I’ve been focusing on myself as much as I can but I feel like it’s something stopping me to do so. 

I don’t even understand as to why I’m not even in a good relationship right now. Being the person I am and always watching out for somebody, I used to think it was a good thing but now I think it’s not cause of how I care way too much. Pretty sure it’s due to my looks as well. Knowing that once I get to looking a certain way and they notice then people will wanna start being interested which is messed up but it’s mostly all about attraction within a relationship and how much you can handle from what I’ve been through.",10Oct2019,0

264,"For about 2 weeks I had a viral illness with a sore throat, coughing, sneezing, general pain etc.

I know it wasn’t the flu because I had my flu shot and it was most likely not bacterial (I took a strep test before it progressed beyond a sore throat, which was negative.) My mom often goes to Minute Clinic or gets those at-home strep tests because she gets it often. I didn’t go to the doctor because I didn’t want to pay a copay to have them tell me to rest and drink water.

Well, I missed 2 days of school and when I got back to school one of my teachers wanted a doctors note. I’m not really sick anymore and don’t have a note for those days. I won’t forge one because I’m terrified of legal consequences.

265,"This isn't about being outwardly emotional. I feel like I can suppress my emotions pretty well. People usually can't tell if I'm feeling down and I haven't actually poured out my emotions at somebody else in a long time—in years actually. The only thing that I show sometimes is laughing or smiling. I never cry in front of people.

I still like feel emotional though. I just don't show it. Like if I'm watching sad documentaries, I'll feel pretty terrible. And when people get mad at me, I'll feel lots of adrenaline. I feel like my antidepressants don't really work (been on them for close to a year now). I thought that they would sort of numb everything down but it feels kind of like nothing has changed. 

So basically this isn't about keeping a calm mask on since I think I'm already pretty good at that. It's about trying to stop feeling so emotional inside like how to stop even needing to put on a mask in the first place. A lot of the methods I've tried so far seem to be mostly about showing emotions, when I'm trying to stop feeling them in the first place if that makes sense? Thanks.",10Oct2019,1

We got along pretty well up until this year a few months ago when I found other people to play this game with and drama happened I won't go into.

He's always done this and it's bothered me before but I guess since we've drifted apart a bit it's become more noticeable. I've told him twice at this point to give me some space in the nicest way possible but a week later he goes back to it. I just recently got into an argument with him and literally the day after he started asking me random questions and complaining as usual like it didn't happen. I sometimes feel like i'm the one to blame since he genuinely cares about me (and I care about him too) and he invests more time into me than I do him, it's kind of one-sided at this point and it makes me feel a little guilty, but I'm honestly not really interested in getting too invested in this person anymore so I don't know what else to do except for cut him off. I feel like it becomes a problem when I start to get annoyed when I get a message from him instead of feeling happy to talk to a friend, as that has happened multiple times at this point. I would like him as a friend that's just there and we can message each other every now and then but that's not what he wants, he's treating our friendship more seriously than what i'm comfortable with.

269,"How do you go about dealing with old people/family members when they get to “that age” where they may need more help than they want to admit?

For context, my grandfather-in-law has a history of being a disgusting and filthy man, in general. I’m not trying to be an asshole, he literally has spent his entire life as a hoarder.  Like, he lives-off-fast-food-and-has-rocks-in-his-oven, genuine hoarder) He doesn’t bathe, he never changes clothes, and he sleeps in a bed that is mostly covered in garbage. The stench of his house and car can gag a maggot from a mile away. He hasn’t been able to drive for about two years and still has about 4 (non-driving) vehicles in his yard.  His wife died about 4 years ago and he’s gone downhill quickly.  We voiced a concern to family about his hygiene and his solution when it was brought to his attention? Dollar store “freshener” that he sprays on before coming to our house because we’re the jerks that said something. That’s also a horrible smell but honestly, it’s better than nothin’.  

The family has thoroughly cleaned and redone his home MULTIPLE times and every time, it goes back to filth and with a vengeance. This has gone on for decades. 
Recently, his plumbing went out. It no longer works. He can’t afford to fix the 10,000 pipe issue and neither can anybody else, really. His basement flooded, it’s filled with black mold, and shit water. His toilet won’t flush. It’s a serious, toxic place for any human to live. His daughter, one of my husband’s aunts, has a beautiful and spacious home, with a basement kitchen and living space for grandpa to reside. He refused and still refuses to move in with her, thinking she has some ulterior motive. My thinking is, she is a saint and has the patience of 100 school teachers in order to put up with living with this man. He is demanding, rude, stubborn and impatient with everyone. He lives in a terrible racist and sexist era, STILL, despite us correcting anything terrible he says. He watches Fox News all day, buys into the fear mongering about immigrants and told us Trump would make us rich when he got into office. (Don’t make this political, please, I don’t care. This is purely for context) 
THE AUNT WAS GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO BUY HIM A PORT-O-POTTY which now sits in his yard. That is how grandpa uses the bathroom, like a construction worker ON-SITE. I keep thinking about winter time, he already struggles walking outside his front door, long-term cost, privacy, all the things that make this situation not okay. 

Grandpa comes over multiple times a week during basketball season to watch games with my husband and eat dinner with our family. He’s been doing this for quite a few years, ever since my husband and I have been married. Each year, he gets worse with hygiene, (I’ve never seen the man wash his hands. My kids have a rule never to take food from him, *politely*, and to just say “no thank you”) memory, politeness, and I empathize completely that he is not doing okay. I know this could be dementia or something else, but I reached a tipping point tonight. Grandpa used my bathroom multiple times and got SHIT ALL OVER THE FUCKING PLACE. I didn’t realize it happened until my husband came home from dropping him off and began bleaching and cleaning. MY GOD the stench, the nightmare fuel, I don’t even want to think about the next time he comes over.

Reddit, please help me go about this in a decent way. I don’t know what to do. I seriously am not in a mentally healthy-enough place to deal with cleaning up shit multiple times a week from another grown human. Do we need a home nurse? A nursing home? How do we convince this man that a toxic home with a port-o-potty is not a good spot to be in!?",10Oct2019,0

279,"There's this girl who I've been around with for about 3 years who I always meet in calculus (but we're not together at all, we're just friend and I'm just such a good friend to everyone).  This year we got close. She was in a relationship with another guy and I tend to help her a lot in maths and even keeping their relationship together. I had no problem doing this because I had no feelings for her. Then, she broke up with this guy I was talking about.  

2 months later she started unusually flirting me or I don't know. I'm just confused if she's doing it unironically or I'm miscalculating. It's been 3 weeks and she keeps on doing this hugging thing and tells everyone that we're dating in a sarcastic tone. Every time she initiates these forms of interaction, I always keep my cool and nonchalance because I do not give a damn.  I think she's doing these things ironically and I don't want to commit my feelings to something yet.   

Until she got me. And my whole life it was my first time feeling infatuation (I'm a teenager). I felt like I am really happy when she's around me. But still, I kept my cool when she hugs me. I act as if its nothing but damn that felt great. I was being patient. I was waiting for timing. There's an event on our campus and I know for sure that this must be it. But I cannot somehow talk to her even when she's around my hand because of her friends and I wanted to talk to her privately. I was being so careful. So precise that I wanted my confession to be perfect. Then his ex-boyfriend showed up.  
And yep there goes my shot. She came back with the other guy or I don't know. All I know is that after they met at that event, they never showed up. And yes, It kinda hurts. I felt like my serotonin levels have decreased.  And I felt pitiful seeing myself being irrational because of these emotions.  
I know this one's very long but if you happen to reach this part, well I hope you will not make the same mistake that I did.  
If you're here to give me advice, our classes will be back by next week and we are surely meeting on calculus.   
What should I do? Should I ask her something? Or should I stop my pursuit and try my luck on someone else?",10Oct2019,0
281,"Hello. I am a 21 year old female from Canada and for the past couple weeks I have been feeling extremely empty. I'm genuinely not sure how long it has been but it has been enough to be concerning. I have been diagnosed with depression and I have recently over the summer finally found an anti-depressent that worked. I had tried about seven over multiple years and after multiple failed attempts I gave up for a couple years until I finally started eating better and exercising and losing weight and I finally felt ready to tackle depression with the help of anti-depressants, as opposed to hoping it would heal me. 

My weight loss started when I was 203lbs and I decided that was enough. I started calorie counting and got down to 170 then hit a platue that I have been balancing for a year. Always inbetween 170 and 175. I started to get really depressed when I was not losing anymore despite not tracking as acuratly as I was and almost entirely stopping exercise. My exercise being mostly walking for and hour or two a day with my dog and occasionally biking. Anyway, that is when I chose to go back on anti-depressants, hoping it would finally kick me back into high gear to really tackle my weight. 

But then school started. And my boss from work who I hate came back. She is extremely rude and picks on me and is an asshole but honesly either than adding more stress to my situation she's not too important to this story so I am going to skip over her. Anyway, my eating got worse and I started stress eating. I've always had a problem with stress eating before calorie counting but not since I had started and certainly not as bad as I am doing right now. I haven't been tracking but my estimate is that I am consuming around 4000 a day which is far beyond anything I have ever done. This past week alone I finally broke my platue but I went up instead of down. I'm back up to 180 and it is just going to get worse as I am non stop eating. I just feel so alone and useless and food makes me feel better. For that second at least, until I'm left with the result and then I feel more depressed which makes me want to eat more and so on and so on.

I feel out of control. I feel so numb that all I want to do is eat and sleep. I know for a fact that the majority of my problems with food and almost everything else has to do with my family and I want to finally be able to talk about all of these things with a professional. I want to seperate myself from the stress of my school, my work, my shitting roomates, and my parents so I can finally focus on myself and get some help. I am already making plans to go and have taken time off work and told my professors. I want to beat my head into a wall almost all the time. I want to create giant lashes across my legs but I can not because my boyfriend said if I cut myself again he will leave me. A perfectly rational decision imo for both of us. I have only cut myself 4 times on my thigh all of which were when I was with him and he finally told me to stop. If he didn't I would not be nearly as good as I am now and I would likely not be in a position to even ask for help. 

I know there are a lot of details that I am not getting into like my parents, who are giant raging narcisits and I just need to deal with the fact that they don't care about me in a professional manor, my cripling student debt which always fills me with a sence of helplessness, I'm in my third year of film school and yet I feel like a failure, i want to hurt myself constantly, I have enough energy in a day to pretend to be okay in school and then I just want to lay in bed or lay in the shower, I want to cry all the time but can't, and all in all I know this isn't normal and I know if I eat better and exercise I will feel better but I just don't care enough to do it so I believe I need professional intervention. 

The problem is though. That I don't know if I am bad enough for help. I don't know if I will be accepted. I want to go to therapy but the waitlists are over a year long but with admitting myself I get access to therapy right away, which I feel I deeply need right now with everything going on. I also have an issue of my mother not sending in important details to our insurance company to prove that I am still in school and there for still covered. I am planning on going into care on Sunday after I get all my affairs in order but if I don't have insurance I am fucked. If I'm not bad enough I am fucked. And I think the small bit of hope that is holding on to the idea that I will be okay because I will be getting professional help may disappear and I may sink so far down that I don't reach out for help anymore. 

I don't really know what I'm asking for here but if you have any advice, or really anyway I can make sure I am admitted so I can get the help I need I would deeply appreciate it. I am on my last straws here and I really need help.",10Oct2019,1
282,"okay so one year ago me and this girl were really close. I was kind of a salty ass bitch and would talk behind these 2 people’s back (i stopped, i didn’t officially apologize but we’re on good terms. But, near the middle of the year we drifted and she seemed annoyed at me for no reason and i just stopped talking to her all and all. This year she became oddly nicer as well as her friends which was a red flag but my dumbass let it go and still talked to them. One of her friends just told me she called me names during the summer like spoiled, annoying, rich, you name it. i would obviously drop her but she and her friend group are really the only people i’m friends with because the rest of the school i don’t like. i don’t know what to do help reddit please :(.",10Oct2019,1
283,"Senior in college trying to get a bachelors in biology, first two years were at a community college and paid out of pocket so I only owe around 7000 currently. I was originally planning on attending pharmacy school, but I don't see that happening anymore. With that, not really too sure if a bachelors in biology is necessarily valuable. I was thinking I could just drop out and stay in the apartment I'm at now, it's around 750 a month and that includes everything. Granted it's small because it's a student apartment but that doesn't bother me as I am extremely minimalistic. The only reason I'm in school right now to be completely honest is because of the pressure I'm facing from my parents, as they tell me they don't want me to struggle in the future. Although from my viewpoint, I'm content with staying where I would be in this small apartment for as long as need be until I find some way of being able to afford something better. I have an obsession with playing music so I picture my life being just working full time, and playing music or enjoying time with friends and family in my off time. My mom always brings up a potential future family and how incapable I would be of supporting them without a college degree. Although I find it pointless to be thinking that far in all honesty, if I fall in love and I'm not in a situation thats financially stable I don't think I would want to have children and hopefully my love would understand that.

To anyone who says why not just finish with the bachelors, it's getting ridiculously hard. I'm in organic chemistry right now and I don't want to do it at all. I got a 32% on my first test and the second one is tomorrow. I just don't have the drive anymore, I did at the beginning of college but it's went away. I think this may stem from my overall viewpoint on life, as its changing in that I'm believing less in fate and hard work and more so in the complete randomness of life. If you agree with me on the complete randomness of life I think you would agree with me in saying that theres no reason to take it seriously at all. Just live your life and have fun while hoping for the best, and for me that means dedicating as much time to music and friends / family as possible. I find it ridiculous when I see people getting so anxious and nervous about school and their future as if they can do anything about it.",10Oct2019,1
284,"I have a new professor who is kind of a jerk. I’ve been handling it fine but just received an email from him a few days ago that I will not be able to attend class until I bring the course materials I am missing with me. I am missing two books. I’ve explained the situation to him at length, attempted to borrow or come to another conclusion. It was no where in my syllabus that I’d be facing removal for not having these two books and I don’t want to miss class on the basis of that alone but working with him for another conclusion until I can manage to get my hands on them has not worked and he frankly is the only teacher I’ve had who scares the tarnation out of me. Not that it matters but he’s a retired paramedic and a no-excuses sort of person who openly laughs in your face when you provide a wrong answer so it’s already been quite stressful. I’m not really using any sort of ridiculous excuses here, just stated when I’d be able to purchase the materials and was basically given a “well come back then I don’t want to see you here without them and will send you out in front of everyone” speech when I tried to explain. It was originally three books but his kicking me out was in front of the entire class and a girl spent an entire day photocopying her copy of that book and binding it for me in a simple black binder because she felt terrible. Which was great, but even with that and a secondary laugh in the face over a photocopied “book”, he still doesn’t want me in there until I have obtained what he asked for. I am just confused and don’t know if this is normal. I am a straight A student and have gotten 100% on every test, quiz and assignment as well as hands on activities like meds training.  I passed my CBRF certifications with flying colors and also 100% on all tests. I make it clear I’m here to learn and work hard. There’s no reason for him to think I’m a slacker or just messing around. Missing classes I paid for as punishment just seems wrong to me and I don’t really know if it is normal so I’d like a perspective because maybe I’m wrong. I’m not someone who gets any sort of financial aid or state help with this and I rely on my work paying for some of my tuition but I’m pretty sure they will not do that if I fall below a certain letter grade or fail to attend classes. This is incredibly frustrating and I’m aware he probably doesn’t realize he could potentially be ruining my academic career with this but I also feel like I shouldn’t have to raise a pity party about that just to attend class I already paid for simply because I can’t afford the books I didn’t think we would need (they are not even in the syllabus!) at the exact moment he wants them in my hands. It’s a school that’s kind of full of well-off people so I already have to work hard to be taken seriously and I feel like I’m missing something because point blank speaking on it and attempting a solution was shot down. Sorry for so much text I am completely confused and don’t understand why this can’t be resolved in a better way that didn’t involve me falling behind, risking my grades or anything else over two books!",10Oct2019,1

So I am a single bisexual man and I recently got a little sexual with a married man.

So we met online and he confessed to me that he likes to crossdress.

He told me he was happily married but wanted to try sexual stuff with a guy.

I didn't think we would ever meet but we actually did. 

We only jerked each other some.

I am so very attracted to him.

It's time I'm finally admitting I need to go after being in pain for so long and incapable of doing normal tasks. My problem is how. I am afraid, I don't know any doctors, I don't think I can get myself to go. 

I guess what I'm asking is I have a phobia of hospitals and doctors (so much I won't even visit dieing family or friends in hospitals) but I need to go.

She has had it really rough and every single day she talks to me about how sad she feels or the anxiety she has.

I know the road might not be easy what so ever because is something I've never dealt before. So here's what I don't know what to do about. She says she started to like me, but I know she recently got out of a relationship this year. I actually don't want a relationship with her at the moment, because I feel like self love is important before she thinks of being with someone. But they are also days where she also changes on what she wants, one day she's like how much she likes me, then later gets all sad because she doesn't want somebody. That wants to be alone and she feels disgusted about herself etc. Should I just friendzone her and help her as a friend? So it doesn't hurt any of us, or should I be the person to show her that a person can truly love her and not get judged or mistreated so she can finally have a actual decent relationship when the time comes and get her out of all the nightmares she has had. 

I do live a bit far away from her, but I would love to get her to know that no hope is lost and I'm here to make sure there is always a door open even all her life has been a complete shit fest.

He was being incredibly disrespectful towards me and I stuck up for myself. He then pulled into a neighborhood far away from my house and told me to get out of his car. Thankfully my best friend talked him down and I was literally shell shocked from his bellowing. I asked her once I got home if he normally acts that way and she said YES. To my absolute horror.

295,"So this morning after reading all of the responses on my LAST post, I decided I was going to crack down on my daughter. When she got home from a school related meeting she went to earlier today I sat her down and let the cat out of the bag. I told her that I was really worried about her boyfriend and that I think he's a bad seed who's going to manipulate and deteriorate her well being. I explained to her about my ex wife who was very similar to my daughters boyfriend personality wise and told her about some of the abuse I went through and how atrocious it made my life for a long time. She seemed to been taken a bit back by what I said and did change her facial expression subtly to one of intrigue. She then dropped a bombshell on me that she has had unprotected sex with her boyfriend multiple times and plans on having kids with him as soon as she's 18. Even though her boyfriend is 18, I can't do a single thing about this. I live in Oregon where Romeo and Juliet laws apply quite heavily and a 16 year old could legally have sex with a 20 year old. Even if I did attempt to press charges my daughter would BE over 18 by the time anything actually went to court. 

I was pretty distraught about this honestly, I do NOT want Devon to be my fucking son in law. It's not that I'm even trying to judge this kid I wouldn't even mind if my daughter was dating someone with severe mental issues or with a criminal record, Devon just gives me the creeps in general and I do not feel comfortable around him at all. He's very narcissistic and superficially charming and gets extremely hostile when someone even slightly questions him. I'm not even just being a paranoid dad, Devon's own parents when were in private told me he could be a total shithead sometimes, and that he has almost been arrested for domestic disputes in the past multiple times.

I honestly don't really know what to say or do, I just know that one of these days I'm going to get a phone call at 2 AM about how Devon assaulted my daughter in her dorm over a dispute involving his Xbox or something. Devon's a manchild with anger issues and a control problem I can smell the domestic incidents from here. I love my daughter, and I love hanging out with her a lot.

299," My dad walked out on my family when I was around 6 years old. I don't remember much about him, only a few painful memories of an attempted suicide in a drunken rage and some instances of abuse. My mom raised me an my sister (30f) by herself while working and getting her Bachelors and Masters degrees. She was abusive towards us and has her own mental health issues, but she is the epitome of a strong and independent woman. She alienated us against my dad and would even cut us down sometimes by saying we have ""his blood"" when she was angry with us. She made sure we never spoke about him and erased him from our life. She is still angry with him to this day for cheating on her, ruining her credit, stealing a bunch of her money and sending it to his family overseas, and leaving us with absolutely nothing.

As I got older and into my mid 20s, I started to gain perspective on what it might have been like to be married to a woman like my mom and felt some empathy for my estranged dad, even though he had caused us so much pain. He's moved across the country and started a new family now, but he used to reach out to me on my birthdays or the holidays (he stopped about 5 years ago). I never knew what to say or how to respond, so I never did.

302,"I suppose there's several different angles to look at this from, but I'll start at the start: My ex-boyfriend invited me to his halloween party. Right now, I'm RSVP'd ""maybe.""

About my ex-- yes, it was a big age gap. It was also my first little attempt at polyamory, which I'm still not sure if I prefer monogamy or polyamory, but that's not the point of mentioning that-- the party is at his house, his main girlfriend/fiance (25 or 26) will definitely be there, I believe another current girlfriend (late 20s) will be there, and it appears that another ex-girlfriend (21 or 22) (they broke up even more recently than he and I) will also attend. (For those wondering how this dude is scoring all these young girlfriends, we're all involved in our local BDSM community and he's known for being very good with ropes, also age gap relationships are somewhat popular in my area's BDSM community?) 

My main reason I thought about doing the question in the headline is because I just purchased a brand new designer bikini (actually, my first bikini ever!) and I haven't gotten to wear it yet. There's going to be a costume contest, and there will be awards for scariest, best couple, sexiest, etc, so I can claim I'm going for the sexy award. I've put some thought into this, too-- I can also wear some elaborate makeup and carry around a smartphone to take selfies on, and then my costume would be an Instagram Model! I think it could be funny, if nothing else. 

Obviously this is a little bit bitchy, kind of like ""look what you're missing,"" I'll admit that, though if I'm honest, 95% of this is purely me wanting to wear this bikini, I'm very excited about it and haven't found any other excuse yet since I bought this at an end-of-season sale and nobody's jumping up to go swimming right now. But, what's holding me back from this, mostly, is that I don't want him to think that this means I want him back. I don't. I am more than 100% certain that I don't want to get back with this guy. We're trying to be somewhat friends, but it's about as awkward as you'd expect it to be, if not more. At one point he asked me to fuck his newest girlfriend, which he apologized for, but it does still bother me that he just assumed that I (his ex!!!) would be willing to fuck a total stranger for his amusement. 

The other thing though, is that truthfully, the reason I broke up with him makes me wonder if I should be going to this party at all. And, it just so happened to be about an incident that happened in a pool. In short, I splashed him, which I didn't know would make him angry, and his reaction was to grab my arm squeezing at pressure points so he knew he was causing pain, shove me underwater for about five seconds, and bring me up and order me to never splash him again. For those who aren't into BDSM, I should explain that it's common knowledge to not punish someone while you're angry (I mean actually angry-- play-angry is fine as you might guess lol, but this was real anger). For that matter, again, I didn't know that splashing him would upset him, and what he did was not a previously negotiated form of punishment that I had (or would) approve of. It freaked me out mostly because I realized that he purposely caused me pain and dunked me underwater-- a natural reaction to pain is to gasp. Luckily I didn't on this occasion, but what if I had? What if I had inhaled water? It didn't actually harm me, just scared the shit out of me, but what if the next time he got mad over something I didn't know would make him mad, he DID hurt me? (Hurt me in a way I didn't want, I mean.) So, I broke up with him. Not on the spot that day, as we were out of town and he was my ride home, but the next time I saw him. So, now that you know that, you can see that in more ways than one, showing up to his halloween party in a bikini might be a bit vindictive. 

But, bottom line, should I go to this halloween party in a bikini, should I wear something else, or should I not be going to this person's party at all?",10Oct2019,1
303,"A friend of mine asked me for advice and I told him I would ask to see what people say. 

Basically he is in pickle where he loses either way. He is a parole officer and one of his cases includes a mom with three kids on her own living off of one income. He found out that she is smoking marijuana on an almost daily basis which breaks her parole. 

All that being said, if he acts and does his job the woman will likely go back to prison meaning her kids will be without a guardian. He has been a mess the last few days trying to figure this out and he feels horrible. Any advice would be amazing because I'm at a loss and don't know what to tell him in this case.",10Oct2019,1
304,"I have to wake up for 9am classes on three mornings in a week. When I was in secondary school I'd stay up late and wake up at 5:30 no problem. However now getting out of bed is near impossible for me. I aim to wake up at 6 on mornings I shower and 6:30-7 on mornings I don't, however in spite of setting 5-10 alarms every morning I can never seem to; I always fall asleep again or sleep through my alarms. I work from 6-10 every night and have trouble falling asleep but generally get about 6 hours every night. I have depression and anaemia which probably contribute but I'm on folic acid and ferrous fumarate right now and see a therapist and feel like I'm getting on top of my depression (which I recently had a bad spell of after getting out of an abusive relationship), so I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do here.

305,"I’m 21 attending community college. I’m studying engineering but the process has been pretty rough. I was introduced to Solidworks a couple years back and I love it. This is a 3D modeling software that is taught to engineering students. Turns out I’m really good at it and I enjoy using it so much that I wouldn’t mind working on this 40+ hours a week for a career. What I’m not really good at is the math and physics classes. I keep having to retake them, some twice, and even if I pass the first time I never get a grade higher than a C. All of my other classes have gone well, especially the engineering courses.

 I’m not a disciplined student and I know that is a big part of my problem. I’m worried that I’m not cut out to be an engineer because I’m stuck at calculus 3 and physics 40. I’m considering changing majors but i don’t have a plan B. I’m not sure that I want one. Should I just stick with it or should I find a different career to work towards?",10Oct2019,1
306,"I just moved to a new city a couple months ago. I (32M, 5’7”) went out with my FWB (26F) a couple weeks ago. She had invited me out to a bar where “her and a couple of her friends” were going to be. I had nothing going on so I was more than happy to join. When I got to the bar, i saw her and saw that she was with a friend (27F). Turns out this friend that she had was a girl that I had hit on at a bar 3 YEARS ago. When I had hit on her, she and I had exchanged instagrams. We back-n-forthed a little bit in the DMs for about a day, if that. Nothing ever materialized, and i hadn’t talked to her since. We didn’t even get as far as becoming friends. So far so good. 

So as I got to the bar, I saw that they were hanging out together, thought it was funny that we ended up in this situation, but didn’t think anything of it. Laugh it off and go about our night. No big deal, right? 

Turns out the other “friends” that they were with was that girls boyfriend (M32, 6’0) and a few of his buddies. At first i was just like “oh cool! These are the people I’m gonna be hanging out with tonight! Some new faces!”

Things quickly took a sharp turn when the girls boyfriend openly voiced his opinion of me. That he had “seen the DM’s i sent his girlfriend” and that he didn’t like me. He was talking a lot of shit.

I was caught off guard thinking in my head... “why is this dude so angry? I don’t even know him? I don’t even really know his girl? I don’t even remember the last time i talked to his girl?” Checking my DM’s, i realized i hadn’t dm’d her since 2016. Then i check her instagram and the first pic i see with him in them is a couple months after I had DM’ed her. Why was he so mad?! And why is he so threatened by me? I went back and forth with him trying to calm him down and reassure him i wasn’t trying to get his girl while they were together. And i wasnt looking to get at her that night, either. And that i wasn’t in the wrong for doing what i did, when i did it, cause it was before they were even together...

His friends started trying to intimidate me as well, but i wasn’t really giving anyone any space to do so. I just went on being as friendly as possible. It actually took me a bit to realize they were actually trying to intimidate me. I eventually caught on and thought in my head “man... they’re really trying to do this right now...” again... “why? How old are we? And wtf did i do wrong??”

About an hour passes and during this time i got to know his friends just by talking to them. They kinda let their guards down and realized i wasn’t out to get their friends girl, so friendly convo started and they realized i wasn’t a threat. They were actually good people. This entire time the dude just angry, trying to avoid me, but locking eyes with me, and saying short lines about how he doesn’t like me in between convos with his friends.

Fast forward, as I’m leaving the bar, im walking past the patio area and feel a beer hit my leg and hit the floor. I already knew who threw it, and this was the last fucking straw. Ive been trying to be cool with him the entire time, and not take it personally that he wanted to pin something on me that I wasn’t wrong in doing. I definitely didn’t want to escalate anything, but I’m also not gonna be disrespected like that. I picked up the half-drank beer and threw it as hard as I could back at him. It hit him in the chest and beer exploded everywhere.

I felt justified but i knew he’d come after me. I didn’t want to fight, for a couple reasons. 1. The issue isn’t something to fight about to begin with, and isn’t even an issue. 2. Dudes hella taller than me. But after the beer thing, i was welcoming to it even though it was a losing battle for me. At least i hit him with the fucking beer. He came out and pushed me a couple times onto the floor. I think he tried to hit me a couple times but i covered up so he couldn’t really land hits. And before i knew it it was over, his friends pulled him back, the bouncer dude came out. I didn’t get hurt, but i also didn’t get a chance to put hands on him, so it was kinda annoying. Id’ve loved to have been on the winning side of the situation.

I was pissed. Just trying to come out, in a city I’m pretty new in, and have a good time and all this bullshit happens. Over nothinggg.

Im pissed but i’m still not even taking it personally. The disrespect, i take personally. Sure. But his attitude towards me, he can be angry all he wants but at the end of the day i don’t know who he is, don’t know his girl... so why should i even be mad at him 🤷🏻‍♂️

So from that whole story, i don’t even know how to move forward? What would you have done? How would you feel? How SHOULD I feel? 

I have other questions you probably cant answer but are something to think about: i wonder if my FWB knew he’d over react? I wonder if her friend knew? There must’ve been some kind of convo beforehand that went down considering how his friends were acting when trying to intimidate me.

Im still keeping my cool about the whole situation. Still not taking it personally, but it does still bother me that i got sucked into some bullshit i really don’t need to be a part of.

Its strange but any words that can help me clear this situation up in my head would help.


Thanks in advance!",10Oct2019,1
307,"she's 14. the problem is everyone in my family and extended family thinks being homophobic is a personality trait, except for my siblings. she's never talked about boys and always looks hella uncomfortable when there's a straight couple kissing on tv. she's super quiet even around me and very secretive. 

when we watched the part where Robin came out on Stranger Things she was hiding her face with her blanket because she was smiling so hard. another thing whenever my family is being homophobic she always gets angry, all my siblings do i think but we just don't say anything because it doesn't affect us. if my parents say something homophobic she'll argue with them and then be quiet for the rest of the day. one day my dad was saying ""why isn't there a month for straight people?"" and she said ""literally every month is for straight people"" in a tone that she didn't really include herself. idk am i overthinking?? if she is gay i support her 100% but my parents and uncles and grandparents have all said some really hurtful shit about gay people and i don't want something bad to happen to her. 

she is very sensitive and i think she feels like my parents don't love her as much as my siblings already because she wants to be an artist and all my siblings and me are studying to be engineers and doctors. our ages are 14, 17, 19, 22 and 24.",10Oct2019,1

310,"Some context. I moved into a new apartment 2 months ago. I was told it was freshly painted so I had to deal with that for a few days but it wasn't awful. But about ~3 weeks ago I've had a bad smell reemerge; it was almost ethanol-like at first, somewhat sweet, but now it's sharp and smells like paint or paint thinner. At first I thought it might have been an air conditioning thing; maintenance replaced the AC filter and that didn't fix it.

Over the past few weeks I've started to notice a few patterns emerge. The smell is always strongest in my room compared to my roommates' and the living room. It seems to be strongest at night, usually around 2am-ish.    I have bad health anxiety so I'm kind of paranoid about this kind of stuff but I'm certain I'm not making it up because it comes out of nowhere; it's not like I'm nose blind to it or something either.

I've had maintenance come twice to inspect it, I wasn't home when they did so I don't know if they even did anything but nothing has come of it. 

What the hell is going on here? Is it still residual paint smell after months? Is someone in my apt building cooking meth or something? And how do I get my landlord to take this complaint seriously?

315,"I rescued him over a year ago and since the day I brought him home he’s been a runner. At first I thought it was just his stray instinct because he couldn’t be left alone for any period of time. He literally sits and watches you until your not paying attention and he takes off. Over the year it’s become less and less. He started sneaking off in the middle of the night when everyone was asleep by using the cat door. I have met every damn crazy neighbor or random person who runs into him. He’s the sweetest dog and loved by everyone who meets him. My children adore him and I wouldn’t ever want to get rid of him but I’m so exhausted with dealing with this behavior. Just recently within the last month he got out in the middle of the night and Was returned to me by the guy who wanted to keep him. Of course that was out of the question and this guy lost his mind in front of me and my children when we went to pick him up. So now he’s inviting the not so stable people. 

That was my last straw so I’ve turned to putting tie downs all over my house and one next to my bed so he’s literally on a lead 24/7 on top of a bell so we can hear him anywhere he goes. We have three other dogs in the house who never have this problem and they get to roam free. It breaks my heart because I’m not the type to own a dog to tie him up. And he becomes very sad when having to be on the lead. He had been doing good for about a week and a half without the lead and I was hoping this actually worked. Unfortunately, I let my guard down tonight and he took off the second a window was left open in the kitchen. I drove my car around, nothing. It’s 1:30am and I’m laying awake freaking out about all the what if’s. At this point I’m terrified he’s going to cause an accident or worse and it will fall on me as the responsible owner. I don’t know what to do...I love this dog soo much. Our whole household does but I’m tired of the anxiety it causes me on the daily. I’m constantly having to keep an eye on him. I wake up and the first thing I say is where’s Finnegan!? I can’t keep up with this it’s exhausting in so many ways.

318,"Sorry in advance, I really wanted this to be a shorter thread but it all came out at once. I'm pretty upset about this, so sorry for the word vomit.

Long story short, I have a mental health disorder that causes me to sometimes react to situations inappropriately. I've improved a lot over the years with self awareness techniques, medication and therapy, but still slip up from time to time. I have a very difficult time expressing myself, especially when I feel hurt, stressed, or angry, in a way that makes people understand my point of view. Instead, people usually get upset with me because I express myself in a way that comes off as aggressive, and I end up  having to apologize for being upset rather than actually finding a resolution for why I was upset in the first place. No matter what happens, I always try to take responsibility for where I go wrong in any conflict, no matter what the other party does to me--it's important to me because I'm always trying to improve. Lately, however, I've felt completely hopeless, because in every conflict I've had in the last few months, I'm the one who comes out hurt, but also the bad guy.

Most recently, I was upset due to something within a group project not going as planned (my groupmates did not do their fair share of work, and thus, the project we presented was incomplete. Because I was the one presenting it, I was the one predominantly getting lectured by the teacher about it.) I tried to explain the circumstances to the teacher, but he kept talking over me, telling me that if I didn't like receiving criticism and didn't want to do the work, I shouldn't be attending school or trying to get this job we're studying for. This actually really devastated me, because I felt completely invalidated and misunderstood, but I'm sort of used to being misunderstood--now, I'm more worried that the teacher is viewing me as a lazy person who comes up with excuses and can't take criticism, especially when I'm the one pulling the most work in the group right now. I did get very irritated and mumbled some things under my breath, which was rude, but I was polite the rest of class--I did quietly leave early though because I was very upset and didn't want to cry or make a scene in the classroom.

a few months ago, I got into an argument with one of my closer friends at school over something so minuscule and benign. I was discussing with another classmate of ours that I didn't like one of our teachers because he was very strict and the type to breath down your neck while you're working. Our classmate agreed with me and said multiple people felt this way about him. The friend I got into an argument with pulled me out of the room and started lecturing me, saying that I'm being overdramatic and overcritical of the teacher. I explained a specific situation between the teacher and I made me feel this way, and my friend outright said to my face that I was exaggerating the story/claimed I was lying. I felt pretty upset after this and we both started actually arguing--I did say some passive aggressive things, but she kept saying that I was just too negative and that it was bad for her mental health--all because of a casual statement I made to someone that wasn't her about a class I disliked. She was saying very hurtful things, so I did raise my voice and get a little passive aggressive with her. Later in the night after I had cooled down, I apologized to her over discord and explained why what she said/did was hurtful to me.I did apologize for my wrongdoings sincerely because regardless of how upset I was, I shouldn't be raising my voice at people. I never received a sincere apology (got the ol' ""sorry you feel that way"") in exchange and she and I are no longer speaking. (For context, this friend has her own issues, so I actually think it's better we're not speaking anymore regardless, it's a pretty toxic friendship--but this conflict is an example of the consistent problem I have communicating)

a few weeks ago, I got into an argument with my roommate over her bringing an animal we specifically discussed her not bringing into the house. She had asked me a few nights before about bringing a stray cat into our house--I told her no, because our third roommate is allergic to cats, and we already have 4 other animals in the house, three of which belonging to her. Within the next few days, there were kittens in our house. I tried to not say anything about it because I wanted to avoid conflict (I was really upset and know I have communication issues.) Roommate kept bothering me with something benign (pot in the sink for less than a day she demanded to be washed immediately) and I told her that I was irritated and didn't want to talk to her because when I'm angry, I sometimes can't handle myself well. She kept pushing me to talk even though I told her multiple times I wanted to wait until I was more calm, but she wouldn't stop. Eventually, I snapped about the cat and she said the most ridiculous excuses, such as ""Oh you said I couldn't bring a *cat* into the house, these are KITTENS!"" and just kept going in logical circles, putting words into my mouth, etc. until I finally did get really angry and yelled at her. She puts on the waterworks and cries saying I'm giving her a panic attack. Later in the night, she demands an apology, claiming I'm accusing her of being an animal hoarder (which I literally never did), and of course I did apologize for yelling because again, not appropriate. I never received an apology in response, even after I explained calmly why I was upset. The cat is still living in the house, and I feel like I can't say anything without being demonized again.

I'm going through a rough patch right now in general mental health wise, so it's possible I'm just extra sensitive right now, but after these incidents back to back, I honestly have been feeling really suicidal. The only thing stopping me is my dog, but otherwise I'd have been long gone. I've skipped three classes already because I just can't get over the anxiety I have right now about being around other people. I honestly want to just drop out. I've deleted half of my social media accounts because I honestly just want to become a mute hermit so that I never have to interact with people again. The constant, nonstop pattern of conflicts in my life is this:

1) I am hurt or upset about something someone says or does to me

2) I first attempt to explain myself calmly, or don't say anything out of fear of confrontation

3) When I do speak up, my point doesn't get across for some reason--either because I'm saying something wrong or because the other person isn't willing to understand

4) When I am misunderstood or feel like I'm being ignored, I get really angry and respond by lashing out

5) People look only at my angry reaction instead and use that against me, never owning up for what caused the conflict in the first place

I don't want to be this kind of person. I want to be able to resolve conflicts in a way that's healthy, in which my feelings are validated and solutions are given. I don't want to be the kind of person that just shoves all of the responsibility onto other people either, because I know that's not right. I also don't want to be known as the girl who lashes out when I get mad as I enter the workforce, either.

I'm just not sure what else to do. I'm trying to be proactive, but it seems like all of my techniques don't work. I try to leave a situation or tell someone I'm not willing to talk at the moment, I keep getting pressed. I try not speaking up when there's a conflict, it still blows up eventually. I feel like every word that comes out of my mouth is a curse. a part of it is undoubtedly my mental illness, which is frustrating because there's fuck all I can do about it other than try to learn and prevent it and get better. To what extent is it the fault of others being callous, however--people doing what they want and then using my weakness against me to avoid having to admit fault? How am I supposed to deal with this? It honestly feels like it'd be easier to die.",10Oct2019,2
319,"I will ATTEMPT to explain this as best as I can, but I might not convey what I want to say.  If you get confused or lost, I will attempt to explain better.

The other day, I was instructed to act more responsible, which is fine.  But I don't get what the person means.  I know the scenario they are referring to, but it doesn't make much sense to me and would like some guidance.  
I will explain the scenario.

If a person was given a set of instructions so follow (me) and simply, I didn't understand those instructions or what was asked for me, I then proceeded to seek advice and guidance from people who have a larger pool of knowledge than myself.  But, the people in question didn't actually provide me with the support I was looking for and set about trying to break down and understand the instructions myself.  

Once I thought I understood the instructions, I relayed them and was informed that I have indeed understood the instructions as stipulated.

Fast forward three months later, I was then told I got the instructions incorrect.    
From this information, is there anything else anyone would have done differently, or, is there anything I could have done to assisted myself?

Onto the being responsible part, I have got the following information

 

**Developing Responsible Skills**

1. Practice self-discipline.
2. Remind yourself of the end game to stay motivated.
3. Learn to deal with the hard stuff.
4. Multitask like a champion.
5. Learn to commit.
6. Learn to manage your money.
7. Be consistent.
8. Being reliable, it's part of being responsible person that other people can depend on.

Apart from being reliable and multitask, which I am attempting to improve on, the rest I do within an extent or another.  So I am a little confused as to what that person means.  I have asked to expand on what they mean and their response has always been 'you need to act more responsible'",10Oct2019,1
320,"I've recently started my masters degree and in my university it is obligatory to do one semester abroad.

A while back I thought that's really nice and that I want to do it, I even already had plans to go to a specific country. Now my gf is gone for a month because of an internship she has to do and I have to say that I already miss her. And all that reminded me of when she was gone for over half a year which was a tough time for me. As I would be gone for \~4-5 months, that really made me think if I really want to go abroad for such a long time. In that case it wouldn't be only my gf that I don't see, but also my family and friends and I don't know how I would handle that, but the thought of it makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm not someone that get's to know people easily (and that is even a quote of my best friend that knows me forever). So I'm not someone who would step in the new university or go out and meet new people immediately to hang out with and do stuff. And I feel like I'm really not the guy who enjoys doing this. I kind of fear to be really lonely on the trip. Even at home I only really have one really good friend that I know forever and I don't miss anything. I'm fine with it and don't feel like I need more than that (I do have colleagues from university and work tho, I just don't really spend much time with them outside of that and wouldn't call them ""friends""). What I want to say is that I'm not a social weirdo (at least I hope so), I'm just really shy and a silent type of person.

Another point for me is that I like to be at home. I know that this sounds stupid, but I like my own home and my own stuff. I don't know if it's clear what I mean by this and I really don't know how I could explain this... Vacation is fine with me but then after 2 or 3 weeks I really like to return home and have my own bed and stuff. I know people who are the same and I'm curious if we're alltogether weird or if there's more people who feel like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have talked to a lot of people and many of them told me that a semester abroad is an unique experience that I shouldn't miss out on, it's a unique chance to do this, it forms your character, it's a lot of fun, and if I have the chance to do it, why not just take it? Well I don't feel like I want or need any of this in my life and am really not sure what to think about this. It really does feel like some kind of peer pressure, that because so many people like the idea, I have to like it as well. Many people weird out when I say that I'm not interested in studying abroad.

&amp;#x200B;

I would really like to hear your advice. Am I being childish, or do you think these are valid reasons to not do the semester abroad? I mean there are many people that didn't do it before, it's not like everybody on earth does it, so why would it be that important to do it, when I really dislike the idea? What do you think about this all?

Maybe I can tell you my thought on solving my issue, so these are the things I considered to do about this:

1. Obviously I could just do the semester abroad but you already read my reasons not to, so...
2. I could do the semester in a university that is technically abroad, but is just 100km away from where I live right now (I live close to the border of another country), which would mean that I wouldn't have to leave but would get my semester abroad. I would stay at home and go there the few times a week that I would need to to visit lectures and pass my exams. So I would basically keep everything how it is right now. (still have to figure out if this really works that way)
3. Last option would be to change to another university that does not have an obligatory semester abroad.",10Oct2019,1

322,"I’ve turned 20 today and I need help/advice on what I should do. It is frightening for me but I feel like I can't escape this situation. My sister only has enough money left for one more week of rent, and I only have enough to cover her for an additional 2 weeks. On top of that, we still have bills to pay. Let me explain my situation to you.

At 16, my sister and I left home because our parents were very abusive. We relied on welfare payments to survive and rented out a small bedroom. Everything throughout senior high school, we did ourselves; homework, laundry, paying rent, travelling to and back from school. It was embarrassing to me, people were gossiping about our home life because the one friend we trusted to keep our situation private went and told everybody in our grade. 

After graduating high school (2017), my sister and I moved out with a friend. She also grew up with abusive parents, so I honestly thought she would share the same mindset and ambition for wanting to succeed. However, living with her turned out horrible. My friend developed addictions (alcohol, gambling, and drugs), it was detrimental to our already unstable financial situation. The friend lost her job, so my sister and I took turns to cover her rent every week. At this point, I barely made it into university and still relied on fortnightly welfare payments. My sister chose to work instead and got a job in bartending, and then she moved on to work at a metal refinery. After six months, she resigned because of severe bullying by co-workers and this experience discouraged her from working again. 1.5 years after high school, my sister and I moved into our current apartment.

We finally got to live in our own place, and I also got hired in two jobs; babysitting and data entry but I had to stop studying because I failed all my classes after first semester. My right arm has a muscular growth deficiency and lifting babies every week while slouching over a computer took a big toll on my health. I was in constant pain from my back to shoulder muscles. So, after six months I quit both jobs and that was the end of August (2 months ago). Since my sister stopped working, I've been paying the bills and internet fees for us, bought furniture for our apartment and paid for the groceries. I did not save much up and have been using the little amount I did save to continue paying for utilities after I resigned my jobs. But it is all running out now.

After everything, I truly don't know how to keep going. Everything feels so hopeless, and I don’t know what to do to fix our finances. It's very hard for me to find a job without employers being unbiased about my arm. My sister and I don’t have any more friends that can help us. I don’t know who else to turn to but this subreddit, and if anyone has read everything I wrote, then I really do thank you for listening. I feel so scared that everything we’ve gone through will all be for nothing and we're going to end up on the streets. I'm not sure what to do now but reach out for words of encouragement and advice here.",10Oct2019,1

327,"Hello, i bought a pair of blockout curtains from IKEA, had it installed today. And there's this new texture smell ( naturally ) coming from the curtains. My question is, will the smell go away over time ? And is it safe to be in the room ( and to sleep ) ? My dad did mentioned that it's totally fine because that smell isn't like the smell that comes from painting. So I would like to ask for advice here.

329,"I hate men, but I havent always and I dont want to. My hate began during military service, the constant exclusion and sexual harrassment that came with being a female in the military ate away at me. I was never assaulted but I was stalked and harrassed constantly. I felt perpetually tormented,  especially since i lived in the barracks and males would make up stories about peeking through my window and watching me Jack off or seeing me naked in my room. I felt uncomfortable in my own room,  I felt uncomfortable on base, i felt uncomfortable at work.  It was a repair occurrence for guys to come up to me and tell me ""we should F*ck"". When i finally had enough and reported it the first sergeant's response was basically ""boys will be boys"". The harrassment continued.  It got to the point that i didn't even want my spouse to come on base for fear he might hear their dirty comments. Eventually it began to build a wall between me and my spouse because I didn't want to worry him more than he already was.  It tore our relationship apart. I pushed a Male friend away hours before he committed suicide because I was so sick and tired of the harrassment I didnt want to talk to anyone who was male. I felt so bad i cried for days and i felt angry because it felt like they (the men) were responsible, because if they were such pos i wouldnt have pushed him away I could have stopped him.

I know not all men are like the ones who have harassed me, but i cant help but feel disgusted and anxious any time i see a man now.

330,"The other aspects of my life are fine, as far as I can tell, but I feel extreme pangs of jealousy when I see my SO with a specific person, a classmate of hers. The thing is, I completely believe she'd never do anything to break my trust, but when I see them together (they're close, and often end up in events or competitions together), I feel awful, and that often shows on my face when I talk to her. This is really affecting our relationship, and I want to do anything I can to get rid of these feelings that I know have no real root, apart from maybe her only showing me affection in ways I often fail to notice.

331,"honestly i never thought i would be venting on reddit ever but i can’t really bring up this situation to my therapist because i don’t feel comfortable? anyways this summer was truly the worst. lets start when my ex hit me. he had smoked weed and slapped me, though very lightly, in public in front of his friend. we were all pretty shocked and i was upset that he did it. his reasoning was stupid, imo: he thought i was flirting with his friend and he said he was insecure. however, because i knew he could do better, i was willing to stay in the relationship and help him do better, because i definitely don’t think he’s an abuser even though friend A, as we’ll call her kept telling me “it’s a cycle and he’s going to do it again.” friend B on the other hand told me i had no self worth and that im setting a bad precedent for myself. friend B overall made me feel like shit for forgiving my ex even though none of them wouldve ever thought he would put his hands on me. i ended up not talking to friend B for most of the summer afterwards. in the end, my ex and i decided to stay single in the summer, which kind of fucked both of us up because it wasnt like it was a bad breakup, my ex just wanted to work on himself before coming back to me, which is nice. but what ended up making our relationship a bit toxic was that even though we were officially single, we still acted like we were dating in a way. when i found out my ex had kissed friend C, who had a crush on my ex when we were younger, and when i found out he kissed other girls and even fingered one, something just awoken in me. i suddenly was interested in exploring my sexual side, and it didn’t help that my coworker was interested in me. he was someone i knew i could explore myself with. obviously it didnt settle well with my ex. at the time, he wanted to get back with me, but i didnt want my freedom to end. i guess i was just enjoying the attention i had. i would go over to my coworker’s house a lot and be intimate with him. i only told my ex because i was planning on getting back with him in the future, and it was only right to have that communication with him. there was a point in the summer where i genuinely wanted to just go back to being allergic to sexual interaction LOL but for some reason i was just really attracted to the attention i was receiving from my coworker. i tried to be platonic with my coworker but it wasnt working out and i would always tell my ex that i was trying to be platonic with my coworker but it never really worked out in my favor. i had this urge to have intercourse with my coworker for some reason, i wish i knew why. obviously my ex didnt like that at all and i wanted to get rid of the urge but i couldnt. i knew it would end badly if i ever did have sex with my coworker. 
fast forward to me actually trying to get my coworker’s attention off of me, i was trying to set him up with friend B. and i told friend B and my coworker that i was trying to set them up so they were aware. i honestly wanted to get rid of friend B because they were really mean to me, the victim blaming from the summer, her insulting me and thinking shes better than me, and just having a lack of sympathy when i needed a support system; i wanted to cut her off from my life. i also wanted to distance myself from my coworker by having him be distracted by someone else. 
what ended up happening is that ,, i did fuck my coworker lol. it was such a bad experience. i told him i wanted to use condoms and he was disappointed but he listened? i guess. he put on the condom wrong and i tried to fix it but he wouldnt let me. i gave up and let him fuck me but when i found out the condom broke i wanted to puke. when i told him how i felt about the condom situation he asked me why i didnt say anything and obviously i wasnt going to tell him i thought he did it on purpose. he told me he wasnt the best at putting on condoms but like come on this dude has had sex with like 4 other people??? how do you not know how to put on a condom by then. so i didnt even really get closure from the situation at all. 
anyways after the bad sex experience i tried to get friend B with my coworker asap to get them away from me i guess. i dont know if she knows i fucked him and i guess it’s bad that i didnt tell friend B but honestly i dont even care she can find out thats not my concern anymore. friend B and my coworker are practically the same person and i guess that’s why im not big fans of them both. 
fast forward to this week though. i had stopped talking to friend B. i wanted to cut her off. she asked me if i were mad at her on saturday and i said no because i wasnt going to say “oh im mad at you for something that happened two months ago” because that’s stupid. i told her i had no reason to be mad at her at the moment. i guess she was feeling some type that i wasnt talking to her but if she really cared she couldve just spoken to me in person like i see her in homeroom everyday. 
anyways friend B is on student council with 3 other people. they were choosing a 5th person to be on the council. all of the council knew i really wanted to be that 5th person. one of the council members told me that they were about to pick me until friend B called me unreliable and mentioned my attendance and mentioned i wasnt talking to her. last year i wasnt in school for medical reasons. i was pissed because the other council members didnt bring in bias but she did. i was feeling really chaotic and i wanted to honestly just fuck up something in her life i guess. and i thought about mentioning it to my coworker. he basically agreed with Friend B’s side and didn’t even care to ask me about my side LOL. when i told him why i wanted to not be friends with friend B anymore and showed him the victim blaming from the summer, he was on her side yet again LOL. honestly i dont even know why i went to him in the first place seeing how i knew he would be on her side. he told me that him and her think more logically and i think more emotionally which i guess is true. but tbh i think it’s a dick move to think that someone who victim blames “cares” because theyre only seeing it from an outside perspective. 

to basically conclude this i just want to psa that i wrote this on a whim at 2am and this story might be all over the place but im mostly just wondering if im like in the wrong or if friend B is actually as shitty as i think they are idk. if i can edit this post later to make the story more coherent i will. please help me",10Oct2019,1

333,"So I’m 33 now, and have reentered college as of two years ago. I’m halfway through a Biochem degree, and have aspirations of pursuing a career in the medical field.

A little backstory-had young’s young(3 now and done), married high school sweetheart, and worked up the chain in a retail grocery store. I moved up management quickly, and became a store manager at 28. Realized I hate the job, and even though it paid relatively well( I started at 80k in the southeast), I had a setback and just completely realized this is what I wanted to do with my life. So at 31 I went back to college, stepped back to a department manager, enrolled full time.

Because I was always pretty ambitious, the DM quickly moved me from a lower volume store(I got to pick where I went when I stepped down) to the highest volume flagship they just opened. Also, the department I headed now grew twice as large because of a corporate restructure, and I got to work for a store manager that while good for some respects, completely micromanages. I get texts constantly, anytime there’s a visit I’m called in as if it’s an emergency, and I generally now hate my job. My grades have slipped some(still have a 3.8 GPA) but I sense a negative Trend. I now dread coming to work, and honestly don’t care when I’m there. 

I’ve contemplated just quitting, especially since I have only 2 years left. I’ve lost quite a bit of salary( make 22.20 now), but the constant nagging is rather frustrating. I haven’t taken a vacation since I’ve been in that store, because she complains that it’s not as good when I’m not there. My crew is overall pretty good, but I’ve lost the drive to be the best at that company.

I’m at a crossroads- rather miserable at work but still the primary breadwinner. I’ve thought of taking a lesser role but really don’t want to lose more hourly money. I’ve thought of asking for a transfer but was informed by the store manager that the DM told her he wouldn’t move me( even though I never asked to go there). I could apply to a competitor, but when I inform them that I go to school full time they lost interest quickly, as retail usually demands a flexible schedule. 

My wife is ok with me quitting, but I don’t want my family to fail in financial despair just because of me. Any advice? I’m currently on grants, but have been hurt by the fact that Fafsa looks at older w2’s, when I made more money.",10Oct2019,1

All my close friends are now in relationships making me feel like the loser. Am I ever going to have what they have? I know it’s stupid to think. But it feels like everyone I start to show an interest in starts to lose their interest in me. when I start to meet someone I get really nervous and it’s hard to be myself and maybe that pushes them away.

We have a really solid work friendship and I would ignore my duties just because I would be so invested in talking to her. Overtime I started to realize I had feelings for Sam. Nothing has changed between her and I, but I do find it harder to talk to her. Like if my brain randomly stops functioning in the middle of our conversations. Sam is a little older than me and I find her to be funny and a cute dork most of the time.

So a good friend of mine has been going out with a bloke, let's call him James. Well throughout the relationship James has seemed to be quiet aggressive and quick tempered, and my friend has recently had a kid with this bloke and when I've come around there has been holes in the wall what have been filled in. Which makes me think that some kind of abuse is going on and is getting worse, and it's not just holes in the walls what makes me believe he's aggressive.  He kicks the dogs,  he shouts at the baby when it crys and my friend in the past when I got into a fight with James told me ""leave it because he can get quite nasty"" my friend is no longer her regular self and she seems not to stick up for herself anymore.

We go out to dinner about once a week, with the client, and are expected to attend. However, at each of these dinners, my manager has four or five glasses of wine and then drives us home on the motorway.

 I feel really uncomfortable with this- I'm not sure what the limit for a man is, but I've only ever had friends that drove after one drink max. Taxis are prohibitively expensive (around £75) and can't be covered by expenses.

## Suggestions for Keeping your Relationship alive

**1. Have Specific Joint Goals. Discuss your commitment to the FIFO/DIDO decision and state and even write down your specific joint goals. Ensure that both of you can see the value in this decision and you both agree on the benefits and goals you will be gaining.**

**Consider whether it might work best for your family to undertake this type of work for a set period of time (eg two years) in order to achieve a specific financial goal ie deposit for a house, pay out the mortgage. It doesn’t suit everyone to continue this type of arrangement indefinitely.**

**2. Your Connection and Communication. This is vitally important, as your connection and communication is the lifeblood of your relationship. Discuss how you will keep the connection and communication going between you while you are away. This can be by phone, email, sending photos, agreeing to watch the same videos, or read the same books, writing notes and leaving them for each other. If at all possible, find a way to connect on a daily basis.**

**3. Talk about any problems early. Each time you are together, talk about what is working and what is not working for each of you, so that you can resolve any problems early, and they don’t build over time.**

**Acknowledge the difficulties the FIFO lifestyle presents for both of you. The at-home person may have to cope alone but the away person may be feeling distressed by their inability to comfort and support in times of crisis. Try as much as possible  not to lay blame on each other, as many of the problems are common to this lifestyle and need to be dealt with together as a couple.**

**4. Make your reunions enjoyable. When you haven’t seen your spouse for some time, let him/her see your enthusiasm for him/her.**

**5. Date Night. Plan a Date night during your time at home so that your partner knows you cherish him/her and your relationship.**

**6. Be considerate of each other in the little ways you know your partner likes, eg bring him a beer, or buy her some flowers or chocolates when you are at home together. Often these little things make a huge difference to feeling loved and special to your partner.**

**7. Bedroom nights. At least once a week when you are home together, make it an early night in bed, to just relax together, give each massages and loving touching and whatever else eventuates.**

**8. Your own time. Make sure you each get some time to yourself while you’re both together to be able to relax or do the things you like for yourself. A relationship has more fire if you have some freedom to also do your own thing.**

**9. Socialising. Be mindful not to book too many social or extended family activities during your time at home, as it can take away from your primary family time.**

**10. Jobs to do. Agree at the beginning of your time together on what jobs will be done this time, so that you both have the same expectations. Make it a realistic list that allows for these other important aspects of your time together as well.**

**11. Managing Jealousy. It is common to feel some jealously at times for either of you, as you are both spending more time interacting with others than with each other, while at the same time, still consider each other as your primary emotional partner. This can lead to fears about what might be going on when absent from each other. It is important to talk about your fears, as fears, rather than accusations, so that you and your partner can talk through these and you can be reassured.**

**12. Kids. Make sure you talk with them when Dad is away about how they are feeling, and that it is ok to miss him. It can also be helpful to ask what in particular they would like to do with Dad when next he is home, and accommodate some of these things when all together again. It is also important for Dad to spend some quality time with each of the kids, if at all possible, when he can.**

**13. Parenting. Even though it will be the Mum’s primary role in parenting in a FIFO lifestyle, discuss what is allowable, what are the rules, and what will be the discipline with the kids, so that it feels like a joint decision. Then, early once you are home again, have an update on kids and parenting issues, so Dad is up to speed as soon as he returns.**

**14. Keep yourself happy at home. If you are the one at home, make sure you make opportunities to get out and do things you enjoy too, including a hobby, so that your partner doesn’t feel like he is pressured to provide all the fun when he gets home.**

 **15. Continue to evaluate. Continue to evaluate whether this is still the best arrangement for the two of you and your kids if you have them. A lot will depend on the length of the swing and how well you are managing to communicate. Don’t be afraid to say “no more” if you feel you, your kids or your relationship is suffering too much. It is important to pro-actively choose this lifestyle together.**

i’m a pretty introverted person but i do enjoy company at times. more so now than ever though, making time for people has become somewhat of a burden and emotionally draining.  i do want close and good relationships though but whenever i get a message from someone or get invited to a social event, i’d just rather not and most of the time, i ignore it. 

i’m also starting to become bored of people (which makes me sound like an asshole). i’ll always meet someone new and we’ll connect really well but after a day or two i’m suddenly bored of them. this is starting to happen with literally everyone and it’s pretty scary and making me feel kind of alone too. 

so, yeah i’m really scared that i’m never going to have strong relationships or the ones i have are slowly becoming weaker. any advice?",10Oct2019,1

353,"(This is my first reddit post!!!!) 
I lost all hope in living, and I wish I could just disappear from all of my friends and family until I can become a better person. I feel so lost, and my emotions are filled with regret. I’m a 22 year old two timing college drop out, and is unemployed because I quit a job without a backup plan and now I’m sitting here suffering. I tried the whole “following God” thing and it was only a mask to reveal my true feelings deep down. The reminder that there is no hope, and there are no saviors coming for me. I can’t depend on my family any longer because they must provide for themselves and I understand it, but it hurts so bad. I can only depend on my roommate, who has helped me so kindly through these harsh times... I feel like I owe him more than money, but there’s no way I can repay him now... 
My bills are pulling up, left and right and my car brakes are worn out. My credit card debts interest and student loans are adding up. Had I been more mature, I wouldn’t have suffered this. My refrigerator is completely empty and I completely depends on my roommate for everything. I feel less of a man now... My pride doesn’t exist anymore it’s shattered, as I watch my peers whom I grew up with move on with their lives.  
Yesterday I finally scored a good paying job for $15 an hour! But I couldn’t even start because my idiotic self wore shorts in a facility that you’re required to wear jeans just to be allowed in the building. Actually, to be honest, I don’t even have any jeans... They were all ruined at the job that I quitter about two months ago. I’m not asking for help or anything, I’m asking for someone to vent to. I’m so tired of living but I know I can’t die yet. If I do my loved ones will all be in pain and suffering for the rest of their lives and I can’t do that. And I still haven’t payed my roommate back, the only real friend I ever had in my entire life... 
Please someone, anyone just give me advice, I’m
Not sure where to go from here. No jobs are calling me back either... I’ve lost all hope and is desperately begging to obtain my hope back.... Please someone, help me find the motivation to live because I feel dead inside...",10Oct2019,3
354,"I’ve been friends with one guy (let’s call him E) since I was pretty young. We ended up going to different high schools, but I still consider him one of my best friends despite not seeing him as much as I’d like.

E was there for me through all of the issues I had with my family. He was there for me when I was at my lowest. Whenever I felt like shit for breaking down in front of him, he always made it a point to make me feel comfortable. He was there for me at a point where I needed it most and without him I probably wouldn’t be here today.

This was all during a period where I had to look out for myself the most. I had to constantly keep myself in check in order to stay afloat. Because of this, I didn’t put nearly as much effort into the friendship as E did, yet somehow, he was still so loving and supportive.

Now that I’m able to look back and see how much E helped me, I’d really like to know how to thank him. I’m not really good with words and I find it hard to really convey emotional stuff without feeling kind of silly and awkward about it (I’m trying to get better at that but I haven’t improved much). So here’s my question: what is the best and most meaningful way to tell E how much I love him?",10Oct2019,5
355,"My 13 year old cat Pudding was diagnosed with Lymphoma about 3 weeks ago, vet couldn’t give a ballpark as to when she will pass. They offered surgery to give her an extra 6 months but it only had a 50% success rate and I couldn’t see the point of putting her through it. We took her home and were advised to take her back in when she stops eating, she’s still eating, running around, purring, acting normal but she can’t jump anymore, is extremely underweight and is losing her balance. On one hand I want her to live because she still has life in her and seems happy, on the other hand it’s selfish of me to keep her alive when she’s so ill. Do I wait until she stops eating whilst making sure she’s comfortable and happy or do I put my sweet girl out of this prolonged death?

357,"okay so this is super long but im in a bit of a situation. ill try my hardest to say everything i've done wrong too, to make it a bit more objective! 

i (20F) am currently at uni interstate (in Aus), and started living on campus for the first bit. made some friends with two guys, let's call them Carter and Marty, and eventually we decided to move out together. living together was a blast, lots of parties, fun nights and etc. Marty and i were best friends, he was like my brother. Carter was like a brother too (only slightly less close than Marty and I) and his girlfriend, let's call her Brook, came over often, she was also a uni friend of Marty and I, so all was well. 

anyway, we get to the end of our lease for the year and renew it for another year. Brook has finished uni by this point so can't live on campus anymore, and moves in with us (but not on the lease). Carter asked Marty and I first if that was okay, and we were both fine with it. I was a bit hesitant on living with another girl (drama, the boys are super chill like me and we dont get ratty or anything), but i know that it will still be a good time and i can deal with something if it annoys me by just sucking it up or talking to her. most of all, i want Carter to be happy! so Brook moves in. 

at the start of the year, my new boyfriend who was a friend of us all (in same friendship group) moved to another state for work, and so we did 8 months of long distance. throughout this time, if my bf and i fought, sometimes i would tell Marty and only once I told Brook. When it got to the end of that 8 months, my bf was talking about quitting his job and coming back to where we lived to study more because he didnt like his job, he missed me and his friends. this was definitely a better idea, especially because we fought a lot with long distance (didnt suit our personalities) and we are super in love! 

so, with only 4 more months left on our lease (and the other three people i was living with would be moving at the end of the year for jobs), i asked Marty if it would be okay if my bf moved in. Marty was fine with it, he was excited to have another dude around to hang out with, and happy because it would make his rent cheaper, and hes just super chill. I then asked Carter individually and it was a hard no. he gave a few silly reasons, like my bf leaves too many cups out when he visits, and that it feels like too much of a hotel when he is here. i was very confused but just listened to his reasons and respected it. he told me that if he didnt want my bf moving in, that Brook definitely wouldn't. he then went on to say that he didnt approve of our relationship, and didnt think we were good together. 

i understood how from his perspective this could have been conceivable, as two days prior my boyfriend and i had a fight in the house which eventually led to me kicking him out. i understand this was bad, but im just am an easily frustrated person (something which i have been working on so much) and i also wasnt taking the medication that i should have been, which likely meant that my emotions were a bit higher then usual. my bf and i worked it out that night and i apologised to my housemates and said everything was chill. 

anyway, so i was pretty upset, mainly because he didn’t even consider it for a second. i let Carter's girlfriend move in, but he wouldn't let mine. I didn't speak to Brook because Carter said in that conversation that Brook definitely wouldn;t be okay with it, so i took his word for it. I didnt have many options, but i knew that if my boyfriend was going to be moving back, i wanted to be able to be with him everynight and i knew that if we lived in separate places, it would be a waste of rent for one of us. plus after so long of long distance, i just wanted to be around him more. after some discussion, i decided to move out of the house and in with my boyfriend, and find a replacement for my room. the day after speaking with Carter i called a house meeting to let them know what my plans were. Marty told me that Carter and Brook made a $40 bet on whether i would be staying or leaving. this upset me because it made me feel like it was a joke to them, but for me it was a really hard decision. so i got to the house meeting, a little pissed off about the bet, and straight out said that i am going to be leaving and will find a replacement housemate. Marty was upset at how I said it, even though he knew before the group discussion what I was doing, and we had a fight that night. The next day I apologised for what I did wrong throughout the fight, and we made up, all was well. 

my boyfriend didn't feel comfortable being at the house after my chat with Carter, so we stayed at a friends house for the week before we were going away for holidays. i came back to the house to get clothes and stuff to find that Carter and Brook had wiped my name off the board which had all our names on it, and covered my face in all the pictures that we had in the house. I was really hurt, I thought they were my closest friends and I honestly didn’t know what I had done that was so bad. I tried to laugh it off because that’s who I am and just went on with my day. whenever I waked past Carter at uni or at home he would ignore me, and look down. Marty and I were still super close, he was sad I was leaving but said he would have done the same time. My boyfriend and I were keeping Marty in mind the whole time, trying to find a new place nearby so we could still hang out with him often and stuff. A few days later Brook went back home (another state) and I sent her a message apologising for not asking her individually because Marty told me that Brook said she would have considered my boyfriend moving in (contrary to what Carter told me). 

At the end of the week, all the other housemates have gone back to their homes for uni holidays, and my boyfriend and I moved everything out of my room, cleaned it properly and ready for the person we found to replace me to move in. when I was leaving the house I was in tears, I had so many amazing memories there and I was sad to be going. Mainly I was sad that they were angry at me. I wrote a note that said that despite how it ended, I love them all very much and that I’ll never forget the memories. I left a few days later to go back home for holidays. The person who moved into my room, let’s call her Kylie, informed me that the carpet had some stains from cleaning product, I told her I would sort them out when I got back. 

Fast forwards 3 weeks and the uni holidays are over. I went back to my old room to try to clean the carpet myself, but it didn’t go so well,. Kylie had been in my room for over 4 weeks and hadn’t payed for the bond, so I was starting to get a little upset because I didn’t think that that was appropriate and if she had a problem with the room, she should have dealt with it earlier. Anyway, I offered to get a professional to come in, but she told me that Brook and Carter said I wasn’t allowed in the house anymore, so I couldn’t come and see it or pay the person face-to-face. That hurt me as well. I don’t know what I did to not even be allowed in the house. Marty was pretty silent through all this, until he started talking to me on Kylie’s behalf because she didn’t want to speak with someone so ‘immature’ anymore. I told Marty that Kylie needs to contact me directly, he agreed and said that he doesn’t want to be involved so he will try to get her to contact me. 

To be brief on this part, Kylie started telling the real estate agent (REA) that I was being a hassle. When I emailed the REA, she told me that she thought I was the issue and that I needed to sort everything out (which I was trying to do but Kylie wasn’t contacting me and telling me when she was free to have a carpet cleaner come in). I got fed up and told the REA that I didn’t think it was fair that I hadn’t been paid for my bond yet because I chose not to be in a house where another tenant (Carter) was illegally subletting (to Brook). I didn’t do that in spite, I did it because I was no longer happy with carrying her liability when I wasn’t afforded the same right. I was frustrated that I was out of pocket over $1000 when there should have been another person (Brook) on the lease making my cut smaller. Anyway, maybe that wasn’t the best thing for me to do. 

A few days later, Marty messaged me, angry, asking if I told the REA that bella was living with us illegally, and he was mad. I was drunk and started getting quite annoyed, I tried to stay civil. Anyway, at the end I just got annoyed and said “water under the bridge, deal with it”. He let Carter and Brook cover my face in the pictures and rub my name out. Even though he didn’t do it, he didn’t stop them or tell them it was mean. Amongst the other things they did, which I haven’t explained, Marty never told them to calm down and just be nice, or to stop being rude. In my eyes, I would have never let someone do that stuff to my supposed best mate (Marty). 

So, about a month on to now, none of them speak to me. My boyfriend and I have basically been cut off from our whole friendship group (because they know that if the invite Carter and Marty then I shouldn’t be there). We don’t get invited places, we don’t even get a hello. I feel bad that my boyfriend is being cut off because of me.

I really miss Marty as a mate, he was my best friend and it sucks, but it’s been so long now and I don’t think its my turn to apologise. I don’t want them to walk all over me. Should I be the one apologising? Should I just accept that im going to lose and gain friends, just like anyone else? What should I do here!?
Sorry its so long, im just really needing advice 

tl;dr = completely understandable that you have come here, I wouldn’t want to read this amny words. Anyway, my housemates wouldn’t let my boyfriend move in for just 4 months, even though one of their girlfriends moved in part way through our lease. They started covering my face in pictures when I told them I was going to move out. After some more drama, none of them talk to me. These were meant to be my best friends",10Oct2019,1

365," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",10Oct2019,0

371,"Before you read any more, I would like to keep this thread civil as I know open marriage can be a sensitive topic. I would love to hear advice from people currently in open relationships, or who have had experience with it at the least. I also don't mind hearing views from people who are opposed to the idea. But please, let's keep this a judgement free zone.

Quick background, I (31F) and my spouse (32M) have been together for 16 years. We were high school sweet hearts and we waited until we were both out of college to get married. We've been married for 8 years and we have 2 children, 4 and 1yo. Our life is good. We have a house and we both have careers. Our oldest is in school and the youngest in day care. We aren't religious. Our marriage is a happy one, the occasional argument, but otherwise great and with good communication.

We have discussed the idea of an open marriage before when some of our friends came out as poly, but both agreed it wasn't for us. But that was several years ago and now my mind has changed. I love my husband, but he's all that I have ever known. Literally the only person I have ever dated, and obviously my first and only sexual partner, and I am also his first and only. There has never been an infidelity in our relationship. 

But lately I have been feeling like I want more. I never got to date other people, nor has he. In a way, we're lucky that we found each other so early. But also, we never got to experience the ups and downs and ins and outs of dating. I feel like I am missing out on a large part of the experiences most people get in their early adulthood. And I really WANT those experiences. I want the casual sex, but I also want the falling in love.

I want to bring up the topic with my husband again, but I don't know how to approach it. I don't know if he feels like he is missing out too, or if he is content where we currently stand. If he wants it too it's something we definitely need to discuss. But if he doesn't want it, I am afraid that I could damage our relationship by even mentioning that I want it. 

How do I approach this very sensitive topic in a way that doesn't hurty husband?",10Oct2019,3

385,"Last night. I mean this morning? 
I woke up yesterday to seeing my first high school ex followed me on Instagram. I’m freshly out of a breakup that absolutely destroyed me. I said hi to him and then the conversation flowed. Two hours later he asked if he could call. I said sure “ but your number is still blocked lmao” anyways long story short. He called. We talked until 5 am. Almost cried a few times. Which is funny because I never thought I’d feel anything towards that person. But he hurt me. I told him ways he made me insecure at (already a careful time with me in an eating disorder treatment during our relationship), the continual infidelities and his usual mood switches. Plus all the baggage he gave me with my trust issues: He apologized numerous times, where they were actually sincere,  and said that he has tried for over two years to stop thinking about me. Funny. He was the one that ended it. Anyways he did admit that he needed to grow up and get therapy (which he did) and to work on himself. Ironically he got out of a toxic relationship 3 weeks ago. To each their own. He also admitted that he has never been happy with anyone then when he was with me. Which is odd because yet again I was the one he hurt to the point I almost had to take all my online classes,  and pushed me to graduate early! So haha. I succeeded. I ended up talking about my ex, sad topic still. And then the funny times of when I lost my virginity and the sex life after. That was so hilarious. Honestly I don’t get how people think it’s awkward talking to someone about your old sex life. I died. LMAO. So I ended up passing out on ft and woke up to  it still being on. Then a morning text. He said that I probably still hate him and it’s valid. because although I’m not in that time of my life or even the same person I was. I always wondered why tf it was such a disaster. Then again high school always is ;) 

Tltr: moral of the story ex reach out. Haven’t talked to him in YEARS. Hurt my heart with his cheating and crazy mood swings. Apologized, got help, and I accidentally fell asleep on ft with him until this morning. What do I do? Like advice pls. I’m still healing from my last boyfriend who broke up with me 4 Months ago. To the point where I’m still sick over it. Do I go for coffee and see him? Or block and ignore. He did say that we needed to both grow up from this time in our life. Which is one of the many things he could never think in the future or outside his bubble when we did date.",10Oct2019,3
386,"The title is basically the TLDR of this post. Context below, in case you’re interested!

I graduated from university in July this year (finally, yay!). I did some festival work over the summer, so was kept fairly busy. However, once I got back home, that sweet post-graduate depression hit me like a ton of bricks. 

I was mindlessly scrolling through job sites for a couple of weeks before booking a careers appointment at my university. This helped me settle on a career path (teaching), and I found an agency that specialises in placing graduates in schools to get more experience in preparation for applying for teacher training. I had an interview last Friday, and was told yesterday that they want to offer me the job. 

I’m so excited to finally be starting my career, don’t get me wrong. But the role doesn’t start until next month. Remember I mentioned post-graduate depression? That’s not an exaggeration. Even though I’m making progress, I’m miserable at the moment. I’m irritable, unmotivated and exhausted. It’s affecting my friendships/relationships, where I’m either picking petty fights with people, or withdrawing entirely. To know that I have another month of feeling like this scares me.

Any suggestions of things I can do in the meantime? I considered picking up a part-time retail job to get me out of the house. I’m also currently trying to learn a bit of Spanish to keep my brain busy.

Any ideas welcome, maybe I’ll find my next hobby!",10Oct2019,1

I'm very consciously trying not to lead her on but its been a few weeks now and to no avail. I've never expressed any romantic interest whatsoever and have been very cautious not to because I don't want to lead her on and break her heart when I don't feel the same way.

When I got trained on night he stated hes a chuck and fuck guy which is fine because dont think I would want a relationship which him, but I'm starting to get feeling and getting confused on what hes doing.

But were best friends on snapchat we message everyday he didn't even get freaked out when he realised I told my best friend we were messaging and it's not all nudes its barely that its literally talking about our day and ourselves but it feels like a lot of effort for someone who just wants a chuck and fuck, and today I've realised I'm getting feelings and I don't want that.

394,"Hello all, first time posting, and really looking for advice on moving forward/what you would do in a situation like this. I have a few friends in life, but I’m not in a situation to go and be able to do things financially, so a lot of my time is spent at home. In my free time, I really enjoy playing video games. For the record, I am an adult female, this is something I do at night once my SD is asleep and I’ve spent time with my family/etc..
I have made a friend from playing, I have a few friends online, but I am actually very close with this friend. We follow each other on all social media, have each other’s numbers, know most close relatives/friends of each other’s, the whole nine. We’ve been friends for about a year now and play together pretty often with other friends sometimes, and sometimes just ourselves. There has been more than one occasion where this friend has been burned by people around them, and the way they take it out is being petty and mean towards me. We have a group message with another friend of ours, and when we’re all making jokes or something in there, said friend will take my jokes and be petty about them if we’re playing online together. Basically, if I was to text something like, “you’re not entertaining me” and then someone in their life was rude to them, they’d hold on to a simple text and then get online and talk to me like I ruined their whole day over jokes made by everyone in our chat. 
I have been diagnosed with anxiety/depression, and I take medication for it, but when I’m not taking medication I am extremely emotional, and every emotion makes me cry, and this friend knows that. The last time we were in a situation like this, I had been sick and had forgot to take my medication for a few days, and they were being rude, intentionally ignoring me if I said something to “get back at me” and have a laugh for whatever reason. They kept being extremely off just for the hell of it. All of it is extremely petty and stupid, in my honest opinion, and I’m at the point where I’m just kind of over it. After the last time, it really hurt my feelings, and I realized I hadn’t taken my meds in a while so I just got offline and went and did other things, to quick said friend started texting me why, and I did respond without holding back that my feelings were hurt. They have since apologized, and want to move forward basically like nothing happened, but like I said, this has happened before, and I just really have my guard up moving forward. Like last night, I got online, we played a couple of rounds but didn’t really talk, I got offline to get ready for bed because I have things to do today, I get a text saying “why are you seemingly mad at me, I’m trying to move past this, why are you acting funny”.. like my feelings were just hurt 2 days ago. 

I’m sorry for this length of this post, as said before, I know it seems like a stupid situation and just petty. Part of me just wants to block this person all together and move on with my life, but on the other I do really consider them to be a friend, it just bothers me that they are expecting me to continue on like they haven’t hurt my feelings several times in the past.",10Oct2019,1

397,"Earlier this year, I was hired by a film studio in my country to join their newly established writers’ room as a screenwriter. (FYI: A writer’s room is exactly as it sounds - where a bunch of writers get together in a room typically with wall-to-wall whiteboards to develop scripts for TV, film, etc.)

I was ecstatic; this had been my dream since I was in film school, but to be frank, I think I got the job mostly because my kind friend recommended my name to the boss. She’d been working there for the past year already, and we both had worked with each other on a previous long-form TV production in the year before that.

It’s been about 6 months now, and I have to admit: I’m really no good at this. 

It breaks my heart to say it, but I don’t think I was cut out for this job. In the writer’s room, we’re all roughly the same age with roughly the same film backgrounds, but holy crap, can you tell the difference in our skills. The others tend to be ricocheting ideas back and forth really quickly, and have developed a strong sense of communication with each other to the point they can almost finish each others’ sentences. Meanwhile, I’m there trying my best to catch up. And all this happens even though we all started together at roughly the same time. 

It’s not that I can’t contribute to the stories we’re developing, it’s just that it seems 9 times out of 10, my ideas are dumb or awkward or wrong.

They haven’t said anything about my performance; instead, everyone in the office, including my boss, has always been wildly encouraging to me and to each other. I feel like I’ve struck oil at this place, but at the same time, I don’t think I deserve it, and I feel like I’m hampering the progress of our stories because they trust me with writing at a level that's out of my depth. What should I do?

I’m weighing these options: 

1. Should I stay at this job and try to get better? Isn’t getting fired later on worse than resigning now?
2. Should I go back to film school to develop my skills first then rejoin the industry? Are the costs worth it?
3. Should I just quit this industry altogether and find something else I can get good at?

If you even made it this far, thanks. I appreciate it.",10Oct2019,18

401,"She was the textbook attention whore. She made up awful things (miscarriage, death in the family) and cried for attention - then went on the next day like they never happened. She also lied about pettier things, where she'd convinced my at-the-time idiot boyfriend that I was a golddigger, or that someone stole something from another and turned people on eachother. When these were disproven at a later date, she just pretended she never said it and that we're all good friends, and we swept it under the rug to keep the peace because our families were so tightly knit. Our parents were super close and her brother was my best friend.


This all happened from ages 8 to 19. I was always a shy, sheltered, gullible kid with very few friends and a social bubble that encouraged this lifestyle. Towards the end, I finally got tired of being upset all the time.


We last spoke over text when I told her why I was cutting her out and blocked her when I was 19. FUCK, it felt good. That was 7 years ago.


I blocked many more of her attempts to contact me when she made 3 new accounts and tried adding me. Every time after the first, I just blocked without a word.


7 years later, I'm now unrecognisable. Stereotypical lesbian look, confident, could count my friends on more than just my two hands! I am no longer tolerant of dishonesty and lack of decent communication. I'm beyond happy with my life as it is.


This morning, she contacted me with an account that has a name that isn't even her's this time.


Her- Hey its me kay lol im bored as lol

Me- kay [last name], Luke's sister?

Her- Yeah lol


Ok. I'd block without a word again, but I will see her at a mutual friend's wedding next year. At the engagement party of said friend, I didn't attend, but my sister did and ""kay"" approached her to chat. Now here's what my sister told me about that...


""She came up to me &amp; said hello. I asked how she been &amp; she was like not good her baby daddy is a crazy (drug addict) or something but now she has a new man &amp; I said well everything is better now yeah &amp; she was like no. So uncomfortable, ya know?

OP! She walked up to me and HOVERED AROUND while I wasn't looking and waited until I noticed. She was a freak.""


Nope. No thank you. A message needs to be sent. I had typed out a very long ""fuck off, here's why"". However, she's a dumbass and I'm not that interested in pouring my heart out to this shithead.

His tics remind me of Paulie Walnuts. He’s fat and had a hair transplant that makes it looks like he has pubes on his forehead. Still, somehow, he’s relatively successful, which infuriates me. He also had a much better relationship with my mother than I did growing up.

I’ve tried to make peace with him several times since mom got sick, but he keeps coming back with random, cruel comments - sometimes in front of the whole family. It’s all complicated by the fact that I was nearly killed by a 19-year-old driver while running two years ago, which yesterday he said was entirely my fault. 

If it were up to me, I’d never speak to this sack of dog shit again and just hope he gets what’s coming to him. One time in high school, a much bigger jock identified him as the asshole he is and bashed his head against his bedroom door, destroying the door and giving him a black eye for weeks.

Story cut short:

My best friend has been dating her boyfriend for about a year. I have always known of him to be an asshole. He smokes, vapes and drinks. He has dated my other friend before and openly told me that he kissed her sister.

# What should I do with my 401k money?

Hi all,

I’m new as a member to Reddit but I’ve scoured the site for years and have learned so much from the investment/personal finance posts here. I became interested in personal finance a few years ago so I am definitely early in my journey to financial independence or at least greater financial stability. I have a lot to learn and just want to be as informed as possible before making decisions that could heavily impact my future. I wish I had known some of the things I know now earlier! Anyway, I wanted some input as to a decision I need to make concerning my current financial situation.

I have recently been laid off from a job I have had for 5 years. For about 2 of those years I participated in the company’s 401K plan and they were matching my contribution at 4%. I have a little over $15,000 in my 401K at present. Not a lot, but I’m glad I participated. I’m 28 years old. Now I need to figure out where to put this money.

I have considered a traditional IRA, which seems to me like the most common route for a situation like mine. I’m inclined to go with Vanguard. I know not to touch the money. Here are my questions:

I don’t know if I trust my knowledge base about investment enough to try to manage the money myself. Should I consider seeing a fee-only fiduciary?

At present I would like to invest the money conservatively. Is there a general blueprint investment strategy that is relatively low risk and has proven successful for most people?

I have a Health Savings Account with Optum Bank. Should I consider stashing the money there? I’ve heard the fees are higher and I’m not sure about investment options within that bank.

Is there anything else I should consider or factor into my decision?

Any help is appreciated. Thank you!",10Oct2019,3
419,"Hi first timer here 

So long story short I moved in with a family member along with my two siblings towards the middle if this year because of family issues with my parent. Of course I am grateful for this and am understanding of the burden that technically took place. We are given chores and daily tasks which we try our best to complete, but it is NEVER ENOUGH!!! Our said family member is a full time partner, parent, and is currently a full time student. I understand that they are busy and preoccupied, but we can never do enough for them! No matter what and I try to be understanding, but what else can I do? Like yesterday we had to go to a food drive because we have been short with money (which I just found out) and they got mad that we didn’t get enough things? I had no idea of the financial situation that we are in, so to help I told my siblings to start eating at school in the morning. I obviously didn’t help because they told me that I always plan with my sisters and don’t respect their authors. Don’t really know what to do or if I’m doing something wrong? I try to help as much as I can but I can never do anything right. At this point I believe that if we’re such a burden just tell us and let us go back with our parent.

Doesn't ever get into trouble, rarely even drinks, excellent grades in school, studies a lot. Now, I have zero experience with this because she's not a usual street punk I hook up with. For this one I feel like I'm supossed to use different vocabulary and present myself as different. I am eloquent but I swear a lot, and she might not like it.

When I talk to her it's not usual convo about doing shit in high school, getting stoned with forest rabbits and such. She mainly talks about studying, college and other then that it's some random things that I don't usually care for. She's fucking beatiful, looks astonishing. Now, we were childhood friends when we were about 7 years old and younger. Today was some kind of a reunion, and I was shocked how hard working she was and how damn pretty she looked. She's not passive to me at all, was very happy to see me, but I still have a friendzone vibe if you feel me. I can really talk about anything, it's no problem really, but the problem is that I don't know what specifically should I talk about. And how to even let her know that I want something more than friendship? This is really not my territory fam, she behaves and acts like we are in posh English neighborhood in mid 19th century.

422,"Okay so for some backstory, I was placed in an orphanage at birth. My parents have raised me since I was a baby so they are the only family that I see as mine.

During my first marriage, my spouse always made me feel like having children was something only for idiots. Now that I am in a happier relationship, I feel like my partner and I could have a happy family.

Currently we are living with my fiance's family. This started because he is going to College and it would help us financially. It looks like we will be staying here longer because both his parents have health issues.

My fiance has a child from a previous relationship. She is lovely and the light of everyone's world. My fiance's mother has threatened to have him neutered if he has another kid before he's out of college.

I actually was pregnant earlier in the year but miscarried. It's been really hard. I haven't been able to talk to anyone except my therapist about what happened.  Due to my health issues, I've been working to get into better shape. My fiance actually has a good job right now and will be finished with college at the end of the year.  Since things are looking better, my fiance has been talking about trying to put a baby in me now. I am worried that his family will force him to get snipped if I get pregnant.

His mother has suggested that I should get my tubes tied recently. (My period was going long due to the miscarriage.)  Both of his parents seem to think his daughter is enough. I love his daughter, but her mother has her half the time.  I dont usually get any input into her life.  His parents, her mother, and my fiance often tell me not to worry about things as I am not her parent.  I cannot take her to movies as her mother gets dibs to do things with her.

Am I selfish to want to have children with my fiance?  

Part of me really wants to have a baby of my own. If we wait another decade I will be too old to carry a child.  I know that I could adopt, and I had a great relationship with my family.  I am honestly worried that his family won't love our children.

I have a lot goals that I've set with my therapist and doctor. My fiance is on board with having children. So I guess my real question is how do I approach this with his family?  Stay quiet and just oops the baby thing?  Moving out isn't an option right now.  I help clean, cook, and maintain the home.",10Oct2019,2

The offer is 30k more than I am making at my current job and includes PTO and medical/ dental. My first choice would be to stay where I’m at only with a full time position. Do I go to my boss before going through with the background check to play my card with a written offer?

Squeegeeing is a major problem for me. My supervisors have all showed me different techniques and ways to fix my issues but no matter how hard I try, I cant seem to get it. I always leave a smudge or two here and there, streaks here and there, and since that's happening my boss has to go back over my work, putting us behind for the day.

I'm putting my entire crew behind and I can tell they're getting frustrated and I feel horrible. Yesterday my super told me:

""You've been here about 2 months man, you got to start doing better, this isnt good.""

And that upset me, not because of the criticism, I welcome all criticism because that's what I learn from. It upset me because I'm truly trying my absolute best and I cant even do the simplest thing. I've had so many jobs since high school and I have failed at all of them aside from retail.. I'm a good people person. I thought I found ""my thing"" but I'm quickly realizing I might fail at this too and I dont want that to happen.


I want to succeed and stay here. I want this to be my career but if I keep going the way I'm going, they are going to let me go and if that happens I'm fucked. No income is never good.

I'm truly trying my absolute best and I am working very hard. 

I plan on bringing my tools home with me from now on to practice in my down time, but my 90 day review will be here soon and I feel like if I still dont have it down pat, I'll be let go.

430,"Hi!

So... I live somewhere where there isn’t a universal healthcare system, but I do have a  (rather expensive) medical insurance. Unfortunately I just found out that when I was buying insurance, I messed up. From my understanding, the one I got covers any and all types of doctors and issues and medications, but ONLY with new problems and emergencies (like falling down the stairs, catching a cold, etc) and not things that would be considered more of a regular checkup (like going to see if my eye prescription has increased).

Yeah. I blame the seller guy who assured me this is 1000% what I need, and also myself for not reading the small font closely enough. So please don’t judge me for getting shit insurance, I promise I’m beating myself about it enough.

I’m gonna change my plan to a better one when I have a chance. Right now I can’t though, and I was wondering if there was any way to present my issue to them so they’d agree to cover it. It is technically a “new” thing, but I’m afraid they’d refuse me if I don’t phrase it right.

I recently found out I have ADHD, and I want to see a specialist and perhaps get a prescription. It’s definitely a “new problem” for me, but because technically I’ve had it all my life (and just didn’t know about it until now), I’m worried they’ll refuse me. Any idea on how to phrase it to them when I call? And I don’t wanna lie (don’t wanna get sued hahah)...

My mother told me the only reason she isn't divorced is that she dons't want to leave me with my father, becuse she knows (and i do too) that he can't take care of me. Sometimes i feel like the father and he's the son, he can't cook so either it's me cooking or Mac Donalds, and then when we eat Mac Donalds it's my fault it's so expensive, i also do the dishes, take out hes beer bottle, and a bunch of other stuff, it's like i'm a slave.

My dad has crazy mood swings, and when my mom is not cooking, hes like to me, all sick sounding ""it's been a rough day today, you do the food"" and when he speaks with my mother, he says angrily ""well i don't want to fucking cook"". One time me and my mom went out to get lunch and buy food, and he became super angry saying we have no money.  And when ever my mom says something wrong to him, he threathns to throw her out of the house, and drains her cards. My mom is super smart, and she went to back to school to get a higher education, (since the one she had was too high so it was hard to get a job) and the money she would get from going to school he would take.

I love my mom, she teaches me how to make my own food and teaches me to be independet, so i don't end up like my dad, yesterday, they had an argument, and my dad dared to call my mom dumb, becuse she didn't get the joke, he said.

Sometimes i wonder if he is bi-polar or something. And he is very manupulative. - maybe he is having a crazy midlife crisis?

I feel like a huge burden has been put on me, and i don't want to tell my dad that i don't want to live with him. that i would rather live with my mother.

The job pays (for me) really well and after some issues in the first few months I finally got used to it. I have a co-worker, let's call her T, who happens to take things way too personal. Anyway, we often eat lunch together and are overall really friendly, except that today (yes I admit) she brought me to tears.  


It was as usual, we talked about how our company wants to cut down on cost of employees and that elderly co-workers might have to go. I laughed and said ""Or maybe they come to you!"" becase they can't fire her. When I started to add ""but you're needed and doing a good job so why should they?"" she immediatly cut me off and started to get real mad. She said things like ""How dare you to talk to me like that! You think you're something better than me!?"" To which I apologized, told her it was a joke and that I'm sorry if I said it wrong/if I hit a nerve, but oh well, she didn't listen. She went off even further: ""I work here for 10 years! When nobody came I WAS THERE! And now you think they will throw me out?!"" To which I replied that it was just a simple joke and I'm sorry, again. ""Oh I can't chill because unlike you, I don't live with my mom and dad! I'M ALONE! And now you dare to say you want me to go?! (no I didn't) Oh well, if somebody has to go I will make sure its YOU who will go!"" TBH I was stunned and pretty hurt, I thought we went along fine. I apologized again and said I'm sorry. Unfortunality she didn't listen this time either, went off again to which I simply got up and told her ""Seriously? It was a JOKE. I'm sorry if it hurt you or rubbed you in the wrong way. But it was a JOKE."" She still didn't believe me so I just threw out my food (I lost my appetite) and told her ""You're terrible. I said it was just a joke and you still keep on being so mean."" After I walked away she said something along to lines of ""yeah you don't joke about that stuff."" over and over again but I was already tearing up pretty bad. So what's my problem?  


She has to talk to my boss about my performance and if they still want to hire me tomorrow. Which means I am (sorry) truly f\*cked. Really bad. She also tried to start to get my other co-workers against me, telling something ridiculous over and over again. Luckily they all took it as a joke (wow who knew?!) and I was able to explain myself. She talks normally to me again, like a friend but I don't think she truly means it... I know she is known for lashing out. But that truly hurt me.   
So what can I do if she brings that up? I thought about writing everything down with the date, where, when blablabla. And if she tells my boss about it, I can show him what I wrote. Right now I am really emotional and can't handle to talk to her again.   
Any other advices? How can I make sure I don't lose my job? What should I do of she tells my boss about it? Thanks in advance!  


TL;DR: A joke I made rubbed my co-worker in the wrong way, they said they'll make sure that I got kicked out, I apologized but she didn't listen, they will talk to my boss tomorrow about my performance, can get me kicked out and I don't know that to do.",10Oct2019,1
459,"I am M24 and my coworker is F54. We have been working together for about a year and a half. 

Should confront my coworker about whether she’s into me or not? Also, my coworker is married.

I started think she was into me one day when we where talking about a black mirror episode (season 2 ep1) and she said that I would prob love to have a clone of hers so I could do nasty things to it. I jokingly agreed as I assumed she was just playing but then she started becoming more and more bold.


Now anytime I hand her something at work she somehow manages to touch my hands( not like accidentally but more like sensually) also when ever we are together and alone she teases me about not having a girlfriend. She tried to get me to take her out after work one time which I avoided because she’s married.

She does small thing like brush up against me when she walks past me and stares at me but when I make eye contact she looks away kinda thing. She also has this thing where she will say something really sexual and then just brush it off as a joke. One time I had a boner at work. I work in a warehouse btw and there’s only like 7-8 of us here mostly female. Which kept staring at and pointing out to me. There’s many other things that she does or has done to lead to posting on reddit. 

What should I do in this situation? She’s attractive enough that I don’t mind having sex with her but she’s married and idk how I feel about potentially destroying her marriage. Pls help",10Oct2019,1
460,"How do I get my wife to have sex?

So me and my wife have been married for a little over 2 years, everything was going great until after we had our first kid. Since that point our sex life has dwindled down to practically nothing. It’s to the point where we will maybe have sex once every month and it’s only because she thinks I’ll leave her if she doesn’t have sex with me. Which I’ve told her hundreds of times is not the case. She used the excuse that once I was on first shift it would be better because we would go to bed at the same time but I’ve been on first shift for 2 months now and we’ve not had any sex since I switched. Also she doesn’t do foreplay, she refuses to touch my penis at all, if I ask to go down on her it’s like a turn off for her. I just don’t get it. When we were dating she would give me blowjobs, she didn’t really touch my penis then either, but we would at least have oral sex. Now I can’t get her to do anything. And I’ve done all the normal things they suggest like cleaning the house so she can relax, buying her flowers and gifts, just everything I can think of to get her to have sex with me and she just doesn’t want to, and when we do have sex, she not into it like at all.

462," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",10Oct2019,1
463,"So this happened about an hour ago while playing basketball. So this guy used to play basketball with me and he was always a bit of a jerk, being a loner he made fun of me a lot, but it was alright. I'm not used to being around people and when someone does come my heart starts racing. I hadn't seen him for a long while. Today when I was playing alone as usual, I was shooting the ball pretty good. Then he comes along with another guy and I start getting nervous so I can't shoot the ball anymore and he starts making fun of me, again it was alright. We played two games of 21-up, I still won both. After the first one he was like I'll loose the second one for sure, I just gathered all my courage and said I won't. So after the second game he goes away for a while, me and the other guy start playing a one-on-one. When he comes back he starts making fun of me again..... but this time he tries to get the ball in the middle of our game, which he actually does and starts being the asshole, he dosent give it back. The other guy just stands there. He tells me to try and snatch it, to be clear he didn't mean basketball this time, he just wanted to tease me. I love basketball so I seriously hated it when he did that. I stand there, start getting angry, but don't show it. Then I catch him off guard and get the ball back, tell the other guy let's continue, score on him real fast and guess what? He gets the ball again..... Now I get really angry, bolt at him, manage to get the ball. He was still in his idiotic teasing mood, probably because he thought I wouldn't do anything since I never made him shut up whenever he made fun of me. But I turn back and hit him with the ball. Now he gets angry, comes towards me asking why I hit him? Then he slaps me on the face. I ask why he came here in the first place? If he didn't want to play he could've just left. We stare at each other, that other guy just stands there silently, so then he starts walking away. I ignore him and tell the other guy that we can play now.

So this has happened once before too, when I was with him and another guy, not the same other guy from the present. That time he was being an asshole and that other guy started making him realize that, and then the asshole hits him with the ball. That time I was the one who was just standing there silently watching. So after hitting him he walked away. But after that he apologized to that guy.

Back to the present. So he probably wouldn't be apologizing to me since he's pretty used to making fun of me with me doing nothing. I've already mentioned I'm a loner so things like this rarely happen to me but when they do, I just don't know what to do. So now I'm just sitting on my bed getting nervous about whats going to happen  next, cuz I probably will be seeing him again. When I do.... Should I just ignore him and walk away? Seems to be my best option because if I stick around he'll probably want a fight. I'm not afraid of that, but if things don't go his way, then he's the type to get too extreme, so if he sees a heavy stone or something he will hit it hard on my head. I'm not scared just considering the possibilities.",10Oct2019,5

He graduated before I was in high school, but I’m close with a handful of people who knew him along with the coaches. The wake is this Sunday from 2-5 so I said that I’d go, out of respect for his family and my friends and coaches who knew him. However, I am in college and about 1 1/2 hours away, and still planning to take the drive down. I have a class related event at school around 7 Sunday night as well. I have no plans on rescinding my offer to attend the wake, but I’d like to know: considering that I don’t know the family nor the person who passed, am I obligated to stay the entire time? I’m willing to show up to the event for class late if it’d be impolite for me to leave before the wake is over, but I’d also like to not miss any of the event if can. 

How long does someone in my position typically stay at a wake? Would it be rude or disrespectful to leave before it’s completely over?

About two months ago she attempted to commit suicide and was caught by her mother and the hospital is called she was in patient care for about 2 weeks then recently went to go stay with a family member who is going to help her get back on her feet with her two kids. Now 48 hours ago she left with a man and has not come back. We have contacted this man she will not get on the phone and she will not speak to us.

Everyone in my family is in poverty and has their own kids to handle already anyone taking on two more kids is just going to create and even more not stable home in their own environment. Unfortunately I personally think CPS is the best option as no one else is going to be able to care for them properly. Now no one else in the family really think CPS is the best option and that we should keep them in the family, so really I'm curious if there's any good stories out there of kids that went into foster care at a young age and were adopted out into a good family or what we should do?

469,"Full disclosure: In this post, you're only hearing my perspective. I'm trying to be fair, but everything written here has another side to the story.

In the last two weeks, I have had three instances in which some otherwise-close friendships have really gone on the edge. Here they are:

1) Ariana [21 F], whom I have known for two years and have been really close to, did something I couldn't tolerate. We were in the car together going on kind of a long drive to a place where we needed to pick up forms. On the way there, she dropped by at a friend's house really quickly, to pick up MDMA for a rave she was going to that weekend. If she goes to raves and does drugs when I'm not there, that's her business and not my place to comment. But she did this while I was in the car, and I could not tolerate that. What if something were to happen that we got pulled over for? What if the car was searched? I know these are unlikely scenarios, but I could not tolerate the fact that she did this while we were in the car together. The next day, I told her to come by my house because I needed to talk to her about something in person. She came, and I told her the incident had made me really uncomfortable and that I want her to be mindful of this when she hangs out with me. She was really irritated that (a) I was so paranoid about it (b) I made her drive to my house, about 10 minutes, for something we could have spoken about over the phone. I have asked her if she's free twice after that, and she has been ""busy"" both times. And she hasn't texted me even once.

2) Hunter [22 M] is convinced that I am a troll. We had otherwise been good friends for the last 3 years. Last week, he brought up how he wants to start a hospital in a developing country, and I told him that I think fraud/corruption could be a serious obstacle for these projects in developing countries. He thought I was discrediting his idea to starting a hospital, when I was actually saying something in general. I later sent him a followup message in which I clarified that I was not discrediting his efforts in particular, but just making a general statement, and I sent him some facts about health care fraud being a serious problem in developing countries. He is nevertheless convinced that I was acting in bad faith. I trolled this guy once 6 months ago, over something I thought would not have been a big deal. As soon as I learned it was a big deal to him, I apologized and it never happened again. A few things happened after that in which he thought I was trolling but I really wasn't. He nevertheless is convinced I was acting in bad faith in the hospital thing. This might just be a gap in our personalities making it hard for us to understand each other.

3) Andy [23 M] has really strong opinions about topics he does not have an expertise in. He has always been like this, in the 3 years I’ve been friends with him. Nothing is necessarily wrong about having opinions, but there have been several instances in which I have questioned things he's said, and he has tried to convince me without knowing any concrete facts. Just recently, he made the claim that diet sodas cause cancer, and he said this with great confidence. I said I wasn't so sure, and I asked him for evidence. He sent me a link to a study that he didn't read, and I know he didn't read it because to even access the full text, you have to pay $30, which I know he didn't do. So in the study, we have no idea (a) what else is in the diets of people who consume diet sodas (b) how the study was conducted (c) what other factors were controlled for, and so on. I straight told Andy that he had very weak evidence for holding such a strong opinion that he wanted to change my mind on. He actually agreed. It might sound harsh what I told him, but Andy has spoken to me in similar ways before. We're blunt to each other about these things. With Andy, it's different from the rest because I don't think our relationship has necessarily been hurt. The problem here is that I'm tired of this kind of interaction. I'm tired of talking about things neither of us know very much about. I don't know if diet sodas actually cause cancer, but I'm tired of Andy passionately trying to convince me on issues that both of us know so little about. This is not the first time we have had this problem, and it's in Andy's nature for this to continue if we keep talking. If this was just over diet sodas, it would be really petty and I wouldn't care. The problem is with the arrogance in this. I'm not a lawyer, but if I were always trying to give you legal advice that I couldn't back up with facts, it would get really annoying after a while - that's essentially what's going on here.

I don't know if the dearth of these friendships is really a good or bad thing. Some people won't like you as much when you're more authentic, and that's perfectly ok, because the people who still stick around you are the only ones who matter. I know that sounds really cliche, but I guess it's true and it might be the case here. So maybe this is all for the better. But losing friends is something that is always really painful and I'm really concerned this is happening at such a rapid pace.

TL;DR: I am losing several friends over things that I think might be really petty. Maybe this is a matter of me just growing up and being more authentic, and that might keep some people away from me. But the fact that this is happening in such a rapid manner is something really concerning to me.",10Oct2019,2

472,"I (23m) have a college degree and work on a masters. The problem is, I'm totally useless. I worked different jobs at times: I worked as game tester for several months, but then got fired. I worked at a fitness center, but the boss refused to pay me and fired me later though I am convinced I managed to pull this one job off quite well. I did some low paying acting jobs later for a small tv station. 

But when I finished the bachelors, I wanted a real job. I applied to countless companies, entering too many recruitment interview cycles. So far, I haven't been able to get hired anywhere and everyone tells me I awful or that I can't work part time.

474,"Hi Reddit,

So short introduction, I'm 18 years old and I live in Switzerland. I love PC Hardware and everything about it. I've built several PC's on my own and helped some people with advice and checking if the parts match.  I love Hardware and everything, but when it comes to actually building the PC together, God I love it. Some would call me an enthusiast but that is another story. 

So I recently thought of the Idea of building PC's as a Service for strangers, maybe with a website or a online advertisement.

Now, I really don't know about doing it. And that's where I seek advice. 

Should I do this? I mean I know quite some stuff and I have quite a bit of experience but I'm definitely not a professional or someone who does this for a living. I would probably also ask online from time to time for advice or tips, optimising the builds etc. It would be like a side Job or more like a hobby. But I don't really know if somebody even would come to a Stranger to build him a PC. I don't even have references(apart from friends and family or online ratings etc. Not that I would charge a big sum of money, I thought of 20$ to 50$ at max, since its also a pleasure for me to build the PC and I really have fun searching out the parts etc.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think of this? Would you give a random stranger money to build you a PC? I didn't really saw any other services in my region. And what about legal things and warranty etc.

481,"I don't exactly know where to start in explaining this, because there honestly is not a clear point of when this started. 

Basically my boyfriend and I got into a giant fight, at which point he decided would be the time to tell me he isn't happy anymore. He told me I needed to leave, and I started packing my things. About halfway through packing, he told me to stop and hugged me.

A few days later, we got into another fight because I picked up his phone to hand it to him, and saw flirty messages from another girl on there (I had suspicions that he was cheating - I still do.) He told me that maybe we needed to break up, but I didn't have to leave.

In the past couple weeks, he has acted no different. He wakes me up when he leaves for work to hug me, kiss my head and tell me he loves me. He asks if I want to go on dates, still grabs at me for sex, and still wants to cuddle before we go to sleep.

A couple of days ago, I started a new job, and one of my co-workers is someone my boyfriend does NOT like. When I mentioned that I'm pretty sure this co-worker is the reason I got this job, he said ""I don't like you working with him. But we aren't together, so I guess it doesn't matter.""

That was the first time I had heard him say out loud since ""maybe we need to break up"" anything in reference to us not being together, and he has not the first time acted like it.

I talked to my mom about it, and she said she believes he may just be acting like we're still together to keep me from moving out because he can't afford the bills without me (and she is right, he can't).

495," 

So I'll make it short. I already have mental issues and am a disadvantaged person mentally. I worked myself too hard and basically I had a psychotic breakdown due to stress of work, school and others. I was admitted to a ward some time later but a lot of events transpired before this.

I started becoming more unhinged and psychotic to the point where I became increasingly paranoid, suicidal and would often jabber on about nothing. I ended up having a mental break down in public and people filmed me begging them to stop filming. I don't know what happened to the videos. After this I was essentially living on primal instinct and I have a lot of gaps in my memory. I wasn't sure what was real, what wasn't and ended up doing a lot of weird stuff and saying weird stuff but never harmed anyone/assaulted etc anyone during this time I have been assured of. I was clinically (and diagnosed) insane for a time and though my psychologist and psychiatrist have been helping me through this....

...I am still being bullied, harassed and it is ruining my life to the point where I don't sleep for days, fear leaving my house and can't take it anymore. I have tried to kill myself due to the endless mocking, I have begged, pleaded, self harmed and even tried to make amends for any uncomfortable feelings my psychotic breakdown may have caused. I have even attempted to escape the mocking and have been followed by this group of people who seem relentless in wanting my life over. I feel like it might only end when I kill myself and they truly want blood.  


What do I do and why won't it end? Am I just damned for all eternity now? What do I do? Should I just end it?",10Oct2019,1
496,"So I keep going back and forth on this situation in my head and I'm just not sure what to do anymore. 

The issue involves my mother, my brother, and my brother's latest ex girlfriend.

Background:

 I will start by saying that my brother has this habit of dating women who are a bit mentally unstable. His first girlfriend (who he ended up having children with) was at war with my mother during her entire pregnancy with their first kid. She went full psycho on my mom and my family. Tried to pit my brother against his own family by putting things in his head that weren't true and stopped my mother from seeing her first grandchild.  My brother has a mental disability and has a hard time understanding logic and reasoning as well as the next person. So she manipulated him and he took her side during these arguments. Anywayyy, that girl eventually took his children and moved out of state to make a better life for them. My brother did not follow them. He stayed here and just started dating around again.  

He starts to bring this new girl around, and we all like her well enough. She also is a bit off, but very sweet and good for him. They live together for a while, but my brother starts to let his true colors out again. He mooches off of her, doesn't pay part of the bills while living in HER condo. He basically looks at it as a free ride and uses this chick. Once he figures out that he can't have children with her, he drops her like a hot potato. (He's got this weird thing about bringing children into this world even though he can't take care of them.) 

Current issue: 

So now, a few years ago they break up. My brother moves out and leaves this woman. This woman is in her 40's btw (looks and acts like she's much younger), and my mother has bonded with her over their relationship. My mother continues to have a friendship with this woman even after my brother breaks up with her. She helps her out with the dog that my brother left behind and helps her financially at times. Now, aside from my mother helping this woman out, she also insists on inviting her to every family holiday/function that my brother doesn't go to. (This woman lost her parents and has a brother who lives out of state, so she doesn't have anyone to be with during the holidays, which is why my mom invites her.) My brother obviously doesn't want to be there if his ex-girlfriend is going to be there. So my mom asks my brother if he will be attending, and if he says no, then she invites this girl. (IMO I think my mother feels guilty that my brother was trying to have a family with this woman, used her, and then left her when she couldn't get pregnant.)

None of us in the family have a relationship/friendship with this woman. My mother seems to keep pushing their friendship on all of us. The woman is very shy and has low self esteem. So my mother tries to put together girl's night's with her and invites me and my sister. I never turn down a chance to party, but it's like the weirdest situation. She seems so uncomfortable around us. And that's not even the worst of it. 

Over everything else, whenever we hang out she keeps bringing up my brother. She will just say comments about how their relationship was and how she misses him and would take him back. It's awkward because my brother has clearly moved on, he now has a kid with another woman. So the whole situation is just...odd. My sister and myself both keep wondering if we should bring this up to my mom. On one hand, my mom has this friend that she gets to hang out with because my mom doesn't have any close friends. But on the other hand, my mom keeps inviting us to dinners with her and family events, and we just don't care to be around her. She is not the type of person that I would be friends with personally, I am kind to her and nice to her, but I just don't want a friendship with her.  

So I am here asking for advice. What would you do in this situation?  

TLDR: My brother's ex girlfriend became very good friends with my mother during their relationship. My brother broke up with her. Now my mother invites her to all family parties/holidays whenever my brother can't come. She tries to get us to go to dinner with her and I feel bad telling her that I just don't want to hang around this woman.",10Oct2019,2

I don't know what to study, it's been almost 8 months and due to me being indecisive, I've decided to take a gap year. During the last few months was a rollercoaster. I'm scared because I have no idea what to study and all my friends are in university now. My parents (we're Asian though)   wants me to be a nurse because it's free and you get monthly allowance and bonded to a hospital after that. But I don't want to be a nurse.

If I become a nurse, I could've gone after I finished my OLEVELS (high school) but I just finished my ALEVELS (something higher than diploma) and it took me two years. you can use OLEVELS to apply for this nursing programme but I studied so hard for my ALEVELS and did not want to waste my years of studying. Plus, I can't stand the sight of blood. 

 I'm just really sad and upset because I feel like they only think of themselves. We're not VERY financially capable but it'll be enough for me to study anything I would want in the country my nationality is (for example X)  since I have savings in the bank. 

And another one is that he told me to just study any degree in the country we're living in (for example Y)  but I don't want to. While I know that what you study will not be the same as your job but it differs from case to case. And I want to live away from them because I'm tired of fighting with him everytime. I'm pissed and annoyed. He supports other people's children (source : mom) asking them to be a lawyer or a doctor and follow their dreams.

He told me to study a business degree (basically anything) and just get it over with.

And while I don't want to be a nurse, I just hope he'll support me in everything I do but he doesn't think a degree is useful and thats what makes it hard for me. I think I want recognition ,approval from him and I'm scared of disappointing him. What makes me angrier is that he himself went to the US and studied, travelled and did whole lot other things and he wants me to stay here and do what? 

I won't say which country I am from but it's boring. Nothing to do here and I just want to be away for university for some new air and maybe come back, if the time is right. Why isn't he supportive is something I will never understand. He experienced a fun and good uni life, why doesn't he want the same for me? I find this selfish and isn't sure what to do.",10Oct2019,1

I’ve always had great work ethic and shown passion for what I do and the company’s growth. When I started, I undoubtedly wanted to move up the ladder. Management noticed and I was always on the radar for the next promotion. I built a relationship with the higher-ups in the company and I’m told daily that when something is available the position will be mine. Well, recently a position did open up... but I don’t want it. Here’s why: the salary is significantly less than what I’m making now, more responsibility for little pay, I’ll be sent to graveyard shift for an unforeseeable future (no shift-diff pay), and in this line of work the night shift attracts crazy. There are several other reasons, but you get the gist.  Overall, I’m not sure if being in upper management is actually my goal for the future. I see what little work/life balance comes with the responsibility and I can see the state of my mental health being an issue in the future. 
I’ve basically made up my mind about the decision, but the pressure to take the position has been relentless.

My question is do I let my mom know I’ve been getting calls (she gets them too but always ignores them and has been as long as I can remember) and let her deal with it?

520,"A bit of back story, I finished 10th about 4 years ago and as stupid as I became, I decided to take a few online certificate courses in the same school as I wanted to take my college-level courses in the future. I basically had two options, continue high school or take the 2 cert courses that were essentially preparations for their college courses. I was so sure and serious about this course I wanted and the passion I have for my craft that I decided to take the online courses over finishing up high school. 

After 2 years, I finished those certificate courses which means I can now apply to the school at their college-level courses. I was happy, sure but it was an inopportune moment that our papers have arrived and the go-ahead to move to a different country came. Now, it was really hard to find a job where we moved. My parents and sister were really going to every job interview they could get into just to get the family stable financially. Luckily, my sister and dad did land a job, minimum wage but at least someone's earning. Up until now, it's okay I guess. Was and a little bit up until now it's a hand-to-mouth kind of a thing. 

Back to me, I was also ready to apply to the school(overseas) that I have dreamt of going to but all things considered, I realized that I could not really afford going there right now and at our current state, no way.  I know there are loans and things that could help me pay it off, but first, the fact that the school is overseas really makes my options limited. There are some loans out there I have seen but the amount of interest, I already feel it would choke me. I just had to consider these things and it broke me finding it out. It was an obvious well-lit sign in front of me saying, ""You cannot afford this."" 

It was hard because I thought my plans would just really go as smooth as I thought it would. I don't know if you ever have felt this type of thing before but do you know the feeling when you just feel so sure about this one thing? You feel so sure that you would do anything, literally anything, to really get it or achieve it in any way. That's sort of how I felt about this passion I have and it was just a big slap on the face when these real-life circumstances came up.  


At this point, I'm really considering to join the military to save up enough money for the school I am really dreaming of getting into but as a requirement, they would need at least a high school diploma or any equivalent type of document. It sucks 'cause looking back at my life, I have nothing but a failed plan. Now, I got two options, it's either I'd go back to High School and finish 11th and 12th to get my diploma or get the GED which is the equivalent level of an HS dip. I might go back to high school if ever but I would prefer doing it online to avoid embarrassment about how old I am being in this level of education. I could get the GED but I feel like being in the military, to be specific, I would not be given the same level of job opportunities as people who came in with their high school diplomas do.

What I am really thinking of now is how I could maximize the time I have at this age to really straighten and fix the future I am building for my life. I would not want to be a failure nor a person who gave up just because things were not served before him. I want to fix everything and the first thing I believe I should start with is getting my high school diploma. I'm thinking of doing it online but would need a bit more research because if I were to go to a traditional school, I feel like I'm really too old to start 11th Grade especially at this time, October 2019.

My brother in law is mildly autistic and has some interesting quirks and can be a major pain in the ass at times - I say that with all the patience in the world for people with autism. We understand that it's not always his fault when he says something that comes off as rude and doesn't realize it, but it still happens. My sister is incredibly smart and is working on getting into med school. My brother in law is also incredibly smart but in different ways. He can basically read a book and recite line by line from someone and who said it. He's very interesting in reading up on politics or economics and has the sources to back them up. I don't think my brother in law really has his ego involved in a lot of this and knows when to admit when he's wrong.

They always had those little issues in their relationship but it because a huge issue after moving into a house together. Money has always been a stressor for them and my brother in law can be pretty careless with his... their money and this stresses my sister out. But they both work and both contribute. But this move was a huuuuge catalyst for their money stresses and eventually some of their arguments would turn violent where she'd hit him and then sometimes he'd retaliate. Sometimes she'd be yelling at him about how she wished she was with someone with more money and he'd slap her. Sometimes they'd choke eachother and she'd kick him in the nuts. It's all very sad stuff, especially from someone who has seen them have a pretty solid relationship at times. I won't lie, almost all of these violent events have been escalated by my sister but my brother in law would react terribly.

But she has basically told me she doesn't want me talking to him anymore and if I choose to continue talking to him she won't be a part of my life anymore.

I understand her frustration, but the way she's been talking to me about it is ""why would you be friends with my abuser"" when everyone with knowledge on their relationship knows it was fairly two sided... sometimes leaning more towards her being the violent one.

It's painful, but I really need advice.

Thanks.",10Oct2019,2

This fractured our crowd and it has led to others slowing drifting away too as it all falls apart.

529,"A few months ago I moved to a new city to start a job and I've made no friends and I'm worried that won't change. I will say I know I don't put myself out there much - I basically work and go home. 

The people I work with are around the same age as me (we're all in our mid-twenties) and with the field I work in, I'm constantly surrounded by other mid-twenty year olds from different companies. They're all very nice and we say the usual small talk when we see each other (And I'll admit it's slightly intimidating trying to talk to them because they're all so much more ahead in their fields than I am because I'm just starting out). One of my coworkers has been working here for a few years and regularly gets invited out with the other workers from different companies and I wish I would be invited sometimes. I just don’t think I’m that likeable, but I don’t know why. 

It's lonely being in a new city with new people and I'm not trying to complain, I definitely contribute to the issue here - I'm constantly worried about what people think of me here and how I look (I'm in a very cut throat industry where those things matter) and my energy is just always off.

530,"There’s a few, what I feel to be, rather significant variables I am trying to juggle and assess here. 

So, my cousin is getting married out of state and my father and I are planning to drive down next week (he’s not keen on flying so we can’t shorten the excursion really and I don’t want him to drive by himself) to join in on the wedding festivities for that weekend. 

On the home front, my husband and I are set to close on our new home tomorrow and move in this weekend, which worked out perfectly because although I’d like to balance one of these at a time with more space between, it worked well enough that we could move in this weekend and then I could free myself up to drive down with my dad. It’s also fairly important enough, to me anyways, to note that there’s a few other family members that can’t make it from our side of the family, so in an already somewhat small-ish setting a portion of specific family sides would be missing. 

The other highly unfortunate variable here is that my husband and I are best friends with another couple and the husband’s father is declining more rapidly in his battle with a terminal illness. We have been alongside our friends as they have watched all the changes in his life and all the wife, as I am personally closer to her while my husband is closer to her husband, asked when I asked how we could be most helpful was to be there when they lose him. To be there as a distraction and for the funeral. 

My cousin’s family has made it clear to me that our relationship, despite being numerous states away, is important to them as they make sure to see me when they’re in town and they made the effort to come up for mine. So I’m not having an easy time just considering not going to his wedding because other areas of my life have their own levels of pressure. This also challenges my dad’s plans as he has said he feels it’s an obligation to go but would choose to hold off until I could go because driving 15 hours is quite challenging by yourself. I was thinking that maybe I could remedy, as best I could, by coordinating with my uncle for my dad and I to go down another time in a few weeks to still spend time with them even if we couldn’t make it to the wedding but I don’t know if that’s enough and I am really uncomfortable trying to pick priorities while not neglecting the feelings of everyone involved. Please let me know what you think, I’m swimming a bit in what is the right thing to do.",10Oct2019,1

532,"Hello! To give a little background to my situation, I am a recent college grad as of May and when I moved back home I immediately decided to work at a retail store until I started grad. I started the retail job in May and due to my retail experience, I was immediately promoted to part-time manager/key holder. 

The job was fine until a month in. The min wage just went up by this time so I only got almost a dollar more as a manager than a regular sales associate. But in terms of the job, the company would leave me alone in the clothing store (which is a pretty big store with two large entrances that holds a male and female section with fitting rooms and an accessories section) for several hours while giving me a bunch of boxes of clothing shipment to open and hang and put back before someone else came in for a shift. I honestly did not mind the workload. However, customers would bombard me asking for fitting rooms, help, and check out all at the same time. This made doing all the tasks and running the store alone very difficult especially when you have to wait until the store cleared up to even use the bathroom. 

On the Fourth of July, my management told me the mall was going to be slow. They put me alone for 6 hours. The mall was crowded that day and on top of that, everything in the store was 5 dollars except for new items. The lines were out the door (far from the register). I was not able to clean, open fitting rooms, or watch the store. When a sales associate came in, we were barely able to get off the registers making us miss our break. Customers were also yelling at us for not being able to assist. When the store finally closed the manager texted me saying I had one hour to count the register (we had to clock out at that time exactly) and recover the store. The condition of the store was one that needed 3 hours at least to fix, but my store manager said to do the most that we could. We left an hour later after doing the most we could and the next day I received long passive-aggressive messages from the other key holder and my assistant manager with pictures saying how my work yesterday was unacceptable.

That was the first strike. To be more general, I'm tired of being left alone running a large store and having to do multiple tasks with no breaks for a dollar more than an associate. Please let me know if I'm overreacting. I had the flu 3 weeks ago and since my store manager was on vacation and no other manager (there's 4) wanted to cover, I had to come in every day and work long shifts alone until a store associate came in to close. When people call out I have to stay alone and close for hours till midnight. My coworkers are a bit passive-aggressive as well, they always text me on my days off or about requested days off and ask if I ""realllyy"" need the day off. I feel stepped on and overworked. I even feel like they say things behind my back about me. Especially when they ask personal questions and demand reasons as to why I'm taking off. Furthermore, this is a part-time position but I always hit 39.5 or 40 hours per week.

Anyways, I found another retail store (a small store!) in the same mall and I talked to the store manager there and she offered me a position after I told her my situation. She said she'd give me part-time hours and a bonus and that I can start next week. 

I was about to give my 2 weeks or say that I can only work short hours when I got a call from my store manager today saying she got promoted and she's leaving the state next week and that the other keyholder can work only one day next week due to her new job. That leaves me and one other manager for all of next week and I'd have to open and close the store from 9 am to 10pm. 

So Reddit, my ultimate question is, should I give my two weeks today and drop off the letter in the store (and what should I say!) or not say anything and attempt to work the two jobs I have now (while applying to grad schools).

539,"Some backstory. My dad is an alcoholic, but he's been sober for the last two years. Growing up with a mom that didn't have much mental surplus, and an alcoholic dad, harden me, and I don't get sad or overly happy. When my parents got divorced about a year ago, I didn't really feel anything, I just thought it was better for all of us.
Me and my younger brother, who is 2 years younger than me, started living switching between my mom and my dad and his new girlfriend, about 9 months ago. I don't have any problems with either one of them, and I got two new stepbrothers.

Now for the story.

My dad is a bit more strict than my mom, nothing much, just that we all have to do a lot of housechores seeing the house is pretty big, and we are 6 people living there. I don't do much of it, because I was already helping with chores before they got divorced. My brother on the other hand, is what you would call really lazy, so the chores puts him off, and he's constantly irritated. He has some idea that our two new stepbrothers are trying to take his place, and that our dad's girlfriend is trying to take our moms place. These things combined makes him mad every time he's being told to do something.

My dad's girlfriend resently told my dad that if this negativity keeps going on, she's going to walk away. My dad went to go talk with my brother, and both of them became upset.

I love all of them I don't think my dad can stay sober if his girlfriend leaves him, and I can't mentally handle him starting to drink again.

What should I do?

544,"Hi Reddit.

My (F18) brother (M17) has been sneaking out almost every night. 

The thing is, he's so privileged- it's not like he's not allowed to go anywhere. He is allowed to go pretty much anywhere with our mom's knowledge. She's not strict at all. All she wants to know is who he's with and an estimate when he'll get back home. That's it. 

A few nights ago, he asked to go somewhere at about 11 PM. She was getting ready for bed and told him (very nicely) that it was a bit too late to be running around town. He got mad, stomped off, and slammed his door. 

About an hour later she's asleep. He comes to me and says, ""I'm going anyways. [Friend] is driving me, and if you tell mom I'll tell her [lie] about you."" So he snuck out the window. I was up until 4 AM (even though I had work at 6) waiting for him to come back because I was concerned about him. The friend driving him is not a good person and is known to drink/ hang out with people who drink and use drugs. 

He's waited until my mom's asleep countless nights to sneak off with this friend. Most of the time he doesn't tell me, so I'll go to look for him and panic when I can't find him. I'll stay up until I can't hold my eyes open just to make sure he gets home safe. Doing this night after night has definitely taken a huge toll on me. 

He has struggled with alcohol and drug use in the past and was sober for about a year, but I have evidence that the people he's been seeing when he sneaks out have convinced him to start up again. It breaks my heart.

Whenever he sneaks out I'm terrified he's going to do something dumb or end up in trouble with the police somehow. 

And my poor mom- she's done her very best to try to teach him what's right, to raise him well. She's made so many sacrifices for him and knowing he's doing this stuff again would just crush her. But at the same time I want to tell her, because it absolutely pisses me off that he would continue to blatantly disrespect the woman who cares the most and does so much for him. 

He just wants his way, and he'll get it no matter who he has to hurt. Even his family. He's been that way since he was 13.

I guess one thing stopping me from telling her is fear. I'm scared what this would do to my family. He's done things like this before. My mother would cry. She'll wonder what she did wrong as a parent. She'll talk to him in tears while he looks at her with a completely blank expression. I fucking hate that. It's like he has no emotions, except fake ones when he wants something or is using people. I can't stand it anymore. 

And it won't help- he'll do whatever he wants, and hurt whoever's in his way. 

I can't stand seeing my family suffer because of his actions and attitude. So should I tell her? Or should i bear the burden myself so my family can have peace?

Partying is not the only thing I need to have fun, I like seeing movies and going out to restaurants with my friends and shopping and things like that, but the only thing to do at this school is party because its in the middle of nowhere. On top of that, the party scene is dominated by exclusive sports teams and greek life and I am a part of neither. Seriously, I'm not allowed to get into frat parties because you need to be affiliated to. I'm serious. They have ""open parties"" about three times a year. Everyone is in an established clique, and they feel no need to budge. If you meet new people, they will be nice, but make no effort to actually want to include you. Is this a good enough reason to transfer? I need a bigger school with a different culture in the city, especially because I'm an International Affairs major and generally am just a worldlier person. I don't think it's a matter of ""I'll bring myself everywhere"" because I've always been fine with finding friends. Any advice will help, thanks!",10Oct2019,1
560,"Hey people of reddit, I've gotten myself into an odd situation...

ill try to be as brief as possible, basically i started talking to someone i used to work with, we got on really well and began to 'like' each other (she told me this), however i had a girlfriend at the time so this became very complicated, this happened during the worst time of my life as i was very depressed but didn't yet realise it (to the point i tried to take my own life).

Anyway after a month or so i decided that i was going to kill myself that night (for the second time), i was talking to this new person whilst on my own that night just about general things and i ended up falling asleep very very late whilst waiting for a reply. talking to her saved my life that night, the next morning i woke up and decided to talk to my friend about my problems and saught help. this is where the problems for our friendship/relationship started.

Because i decided to end my life i didnt know what to do when i didn't, this lead me to become rather creepy and a little obsessed with this girl, to the point she didn't want to talk to me and blocked me. i couldn't understand why at the time but since i have been having counselling i am starting to see the obsessive person i became and i hate it.

Now i have genuinely never met anyone like this person and we got on really well, basically, i never got to tell her that she is the reason i am alive today and i never got the chance to say why i'd become this person she knows me as and it hurts like hell. The only thing i''m not blocked on is Twitter, should i reach out to her and let her know what happened and that she saved me???? HELP!?!??!",10Oct2019,1
561,"I (20M) recently moved to a European country(Malta) to move in with my fiance and her parents, I was studying a Bachelor's Degree in Game Development and finished the first year, but decided to quit my studies for chance at being with my fiance and living in a country with better opportunities. (I am from South Africa)

I made the move a couple months back, got a shitty retail job and have been saving ever since. I felt the time was right for me to switch to part-time and pursue my education again. I applied for a 3 year Bachelor's Degree in a similar field (Multimedia Software Design), however as my qualifications weren't European, my application was rejected and I was advised to do the 2 year Advanced Diploma before doing the Bachelor's. I accepted this offer, as I thought there was nothing else I could do, and started school just over a week ago. 

After a week of this course, I am unhappy. All of the modules we are going through, I have done before in high school, or during my previous degree. Upon looking at the future modules, I feel this trend will continue for the next 2 years. All of my fellow students are 3 to 4 years younger than me and I feel I've really been set back. I tried to communicate with my institute that I am over-qualified for the course, however, they won't let me do the Bachelor's until I've completed the advanced diploma.

I have been looking at other study possibilities and have found something that interests me a lot. It's a part-time Graphic Design Associate course, which would take around 3 months to complete. It is MQF level 5, whilst the advanced diploma is MQF level 4 (The maltese qualification framework.) and I feel it would be more challenging and make me feel happier. There is also further study possibilities which branches into Digital Marketing or Web Development after I complete the Graphic Design one. 

I am worried what my fiance's father will think, as he values education and believes a Degree is a must for a decent career. I believe I would be able to get a job with the Graphic Design Course, or with one of the further courses. I don't want to disappoint my new family, but also don't want to waste potential years repeating things I already know.

I apologize for the word blabber, but I feel stuck in a spot where I am not happy. I would appreciate any advice on my situation and would be happy to answer any questions.

Some extra information: The Diploma I am currently in is free, but if I switch to the Graphic Design course, I would have to pay, However, I do have the savings for it. The Graphic Design course is 60 hours long but spans around 3 months with part-time lectures.",10Oct2019,1

We have a very good relationship and have been living together for a bit over a year now in my house. We are both artists, I tattoo, paint and do digital design for a living and Riley designs clothing and furniture. We have a lot of things in common, hobbies, views on life, and a lot of other stuff. We have an okay sex life, not as much action as I would want but adequate. In short, almost eveything is going perfectly. It’s just that recently her sister (22) let’s call her Rain had recently graduated college and is having trouble finding a job and is staying with us in our house since she can’t afford her own place. It’s been a bit over two months now and inevitably we’ve been getting to know each other (Riley and I have our own studio at home and so we work from there) and she seems like a pretty nice person. Rain and I have very similar personalities but don’t have a lot of common interests aside from biking. Rain has recently been joining me biking every morning and we have gotten to know each other on a deeper level and we’re relating to each other more. The problem is I’m starting to develop romantic affection for Rain, and I know it is wrong since she is Riley’s sister. I have never once thought to act on these feelings of mine and I’m trying my damnest best to supress these feelings but they just become worse (partly due to Rain starting to do a lot more other mundane activities with me like cooking, watching Netflix, etc.). To add to my misery, Rain sometimes lays down beside me in bed while I’m on my tablet creating new designs (while Riley is in the room of course) and Riley just admitted today that she was becoming jealous of how close Rain and I are now. I want to confess to Riley about my feelings and thoughts about Rain but I don’t want to ruin our relationship (she is very emotional when it comes to our relationship as BF/GF).

564,"To start, I’ll tell a bit about myself. I am a 24 year old male in central Illinois, USA. I have been an orphan since I was 21. I do not have a relationship with most of my extended family. I have an associates degree in horticulture and I want to start a landscaping business someday. I currently work at a nursery with good pay and benefits, but it is a thankless job.

So, I was recently dumped by my fiancé a month before we were slated to get married. We had been together for 6.5 years. The relationship wasn’t perfect, but I had hope it would get better. She felt we had to many conflicts that couldn’t be resolved so she ended it. Since the breakup, I have been struggling to feel good about myself. I have had plenty of support from friends and, surprisingly, her family. There has been a consensus among everyone that is familiar with the situation that she was immature and verbally/emotionally abusive toward me. Despite knowing that she was so harmful to me, I’m still madly in love with her and would do anything for her.

Despite my pleas, she left me and moved a town over. Leaving me with an apartment I couldn’t afford alone. I had also amassed considerable debt during our five years of living together. Most of the debt is dental work I had done to be presentable for the wedding. 

In the past week, I finished moving out and in with a friend of a friend. I was intending to rent a room and store my things in an outbuilding on the property, and pay off some debt while I take advantage of the low cost of living. However, yesterday, I found out that where I was told to put my stuff is actually in the way of an RV that is supposed to be parked in the building over the winter. I was also encouraged to get an actual storage unit. In general, I no longer feel welcome here. 

So, my question is this: what should I do? Leave Illinois? Buy a house because a mortgage is cheaper than rent? Find someone else to stay with?",10Oct2019,1

568,"Hi,

Im currently in my 2nd year of pursuing a computer science degree and was looking for some advice on how to handle the workload.

Since the start of the semester (start of sept) I have had to put in around 80 hour work weeks to keep up with my work. At first I was okay at keeping up and to keep the stress down I was smoking weed every night before I went to bed (destructive I know). The problem now is I've been doing this for a little more than a month now and its starting to take its toll. 

Weed isn't really keeping me motivated anymore so i'm probably going to stop smoking every night since the negatives outweigh the positives at this point. 

I really just need some advice for keeping stress down and not burning out.

Some other information:

-I cant drop any courses or I will be kicked out of COOP (need it to afford school)

-I'd prefer not taking anxiety pills as some of my friends have started doing

-We have a on campus therapy building that is free to students that I have been looking into attending

-Another option I have thought about is skipping some classes I dont desperately need to goto every week (would save about 6 hours/week)



Any advice is appreciated!
Thanks",10Oct2019,1

I (m27) met bob (m26) during my time in the army. Spent 3 years in the same unit and then I got out. We've been friends for about 6 years now and I'd do anything for the guy. He's my kids godfather and we travel across country to see each other's family's. He's definitely family to us.

Recently his twin passed away. He was hospitalized with some issues and given about a 30% chance of making it to 30. From diagnoses to death it was about a month. I know it's been extremely hard on him and so I've given him some encouraging words and the space and time to deal with it on his own.  

The funeral service is in a few days and I feel like I should be there.  His wife has said they didnt want to be a burden by asking us to be there. As well as he would like to see us for happier reasons. The funeral is only 6 hours away and I feel like I should take the time to be there.

576,"A couple of months ago, I was gone away for the weekend with my friends, and we ended up going to a house party around 2am after my boyfriend was gone to bed, I always tell him everything I do because I am insecure myself so I don’t ever want him to feel that way so I tell him stuff before it happens, and I didn’t really get a chance to as he was asleep. 


anyways, all my friends were trying to get with guys and I was in a relationship so I sat into the sitting room on my own and enjoyed the peace as people were doing drugs in the other room, and a guy came in and asked was I okay, I told him I was fine and he sat on the other couch in the room, he asked why I was alone and I told him I didn’t like drugs and told him a little backstory to why, he was the nicest person and he was so caring and empathic, which at the time, my boyfriend didn’t know how to be empathic towards me, it’s got better, but we are still working on it. 


Anyways, me at this guy had an amazing talk about life, and he asked me was I single, which I straight out told him that I was in a relationship and he told me he was too, we spoke about our partners and he told me he was finding it really hard because his girlfriend moved to another country and I told him the struggles I was having in my relationship and he told me that I seem too nice to be going through struggles in a relationship, we spoke for a while and I really enjoyed it, and I felt so guilty because not only was I talking about my relationship and my struggles behind my boyfriends back, but I really enjoyed talking to this guy, he was able to communicate and care in ways my boyfriend wasn’t able, it wasn’t really a romantic thing, I didn’t want to kiss him or anything, but I just wished that my boyfriend could be more empathic and made me realise that I felt unhappy in my relationship. 


We spoke for a few hours and I had my location on and my boyfriend seen I was still online once he got up for work, he tried ring me when I was mid conversation with this other guy and I instantly panicked because firstly I hadn’t even told him I was at this house party yet and secondly I was talking to this guy I really enjoyed talking to for the last few hours, so I hung up and turned off my location in a panic because I felt bad for enjoying taking to this guy. I felt so so guilty to enjoy another guys company. He rang again and I answered and he straight away asked where I was and I told him I was in the hotel I was supposed to be staying in because I felt so guilty for not texting him telling him I was going to a house party. Then I told him I lied and he got really fishy with me, I thought our relationship was done, so I just tried to be my best and I told him that I lied because I felt guilty for being there and that was true, but I didn’t tell him about talking to the guy because he told me that he thought I was cheating when I was acting so dodgy. 


So then I definitely didn’t want to tell him about speaking to that guy because I was 100% certain he would think I cheated, so I just left it as it was, this was 5 months ago and to this day, if we have a fight, he always brings up “but I didn’t break up with you after you lied to me about what happened on your holidays” and we watched a video the other day where someone broke up over a girl cheating and he looked straight into my eyes while saying “she deserves that because she never should had kissed that other guy”, I still to this day think that he thinks I cheated and I hate when he brings it up or when anyone brings it up because I feel so guilty for enjoying that conversation with that guy and I feel like anything I say will just contribute to him thinking I cheated , I don’t know what to do to please help.

577,"Me and my girlfriend have been living together a little over a year and a half, and until recently we have had no major issues, no fights, and had a strong relationship all around. Recently my girlfriend got full custody of her 5 year old, and put her in school. Her school runs from 12-3, and we both work during those times with no way of getting off, this problem is only compounded because the school has no babysitting programs, after school programs, or anything. We didn’t want to shell out the extra money for a babysitter, and of our options there weren’t any with hours that worked, or that I would trust anyway. So her mom would come down, stay with us for the week, to help get the kid back and forth to school and babysit. Then her mom’s boyfriend broke up with her, and was all around a dick, leading to her mom moving in with us. 

My Girlfriend: I love her dearly, she has any awesome personality, very outgoing and extroverted, and is a very giving, sensitive, caring person. She lost her dad a couple months ago, and is still recovering from that. Her biggest weakness is that she has a tendency to take everything personally, even if your talking about a completely unrelated topic, she can bring it around and make it sound like its an attack against her or somebody she loves. Her family is very poor, and most of them are living off of disability, welfare, and live in the projects. She is a hard worker, and is far above her families caliber!! 

Her Mom: She is in her early 50s, and I like her mom a lot, she has what I would call a chill, cool, personality. However, she hasn’t held a stable job for a long time, and has relied off of her boyfriend’s social security, disability, and government aid programs to get by. My girlfriend also sends her money and buys her things. Keep in mind she is in good health, and recently got a bachelors in finance, but has put zero effort into finding a job, even part time. While I appreciate her help with the child, and her help around the house with cooking and cleaning, I am slightly worried by her track record, that we would wind up supporting her for a long time. 

Me: I am a logic and data driven personality, give me a spreadsheet with data on a topic that I find even remotely interesting and I’ll poor over it. I am always trying to learn something. However, I don’t do well with emotions, and try to avoid them and repress them, if I’m feeling something I’ll push it down, leading me to avoid conflicts, and expressing emotion. 

So currently her mom feels like a third wheel, which in a way sucks because she is helping us a lot with the kid, on the other hand I’m somewhat pleased because I don’t want her to be living with us for the next 10 years. We really only need her help for this school year, next school year everything will be straightened out with schools and daycare. I feel like a third wheel in my own house and relationship. My girlfriend just lost her dad, so she is trying to cling to her mom and get her to stay with us long term. I don’t think that is healthy for our relationship, or for her. My girlfriend is a hard worker anyway, and being with me has helped lesson what influence her family had over her and made her more mature. Now with her mom around she is acting less more mature, more emotional, and more insecure. I can also tell that she isn’t doing as well at her work, because I used to manage the store she is managing now...which means I have connections still and some insights. How do I address this? Any way thatI think of addessing and talking about this, I’m going to sound like a dick, and like I’m attacking my girlfriend and her mother, when all I want is for me and girlfriend’s relationship to mature and grow and for her to mature and grow.  My girlfriend is exceptionally tenacious and stubborn, and it won’t be easy to let her see my point of view

TLDR My Girlfriends mom, who has relied for years on her ex’s disability and government aid to survive, has moved in with us to help with babysitting for a school year, now I feel like a third wheel, my girlfriends mom feels like a third wheel, and having the lower income, project dwelling family influence in her life is influencing my girlfriend in the wrong direction, a direction she had pulled herself up from. I have no clue how to say I want more time alone with my girlfriend and that I don’t want to support her mother indefinitely without sounding like an asshole! Please share your thoughts!",10Oct2019,1

But it slowly grew into me not paying attention in class at all and desperately trying to catch as many glances as I can. This is where I realized I might like guys. I started getting awkward boners in class and some guys would notice me looking at them. I found out that I was attracted to guys with masculine features: mainly body hair and large shoes. I didn't have anyone to talk to and the urge to find a guy got stronger and stronger.

Now I started my freshman year in the same school with the same group of kids but a little older-looking. The first day was definitely a ""kid in a candy store"" situation for my eyes. The upperclassmen definitely was a sight for sore eyes. One of my friends began transitioning from F to M over the summer, I found out. They definitely suspected I was gay for a while when they inevitably asked me about my sexuality. I replied, ""I don't know."" After that, they invited me to come to the school's GSA (gay-straight alliance) the next day and I became really open about it. I began to talk more in the club and I found out another of my friends was bi (14M) in a long-distance relationship with a guy he met online. I also embraced my interest in the furry fandom and I found out that my bi friend was in the fandom as well. We have conversations every day and mess around during lunch and GSA. After all of this happened in these short weeks I have almost found my place. There was just one thing-

What now? My family had no idea that I was gay. My sisters suspected it but they weren't sure. I keep denying it to this day and home is very different from school.

I'm usually a good worker who gets along well with others, works hard, and if I call in I give notice. Its the first time this has happened. I do hate the job, but I want to keep it because it's a good experience for me (I'm going into healthcare).",10Oct2019,4
586,"This will probably be all over the place, since this just happened today and I'm  it cooping with it well.. 

My ex and I lived together and have a dog. After our relationship ended I went living with my grandmother and her cat, and he stayed in his apartment with our dog. The agreement was, once I graduated and lived on my own, he would let me keep our dog. 
Today he told me he needs to be operated and can't keep her anymore, but I still live with my grandmother and her dominant cat since I still study this year. 
I know that if I don't find a solution myself, my ex will probably leave her at a shelter and then I can never see her again. She deserves all the love, and I could never forgive myself if she ends up in a shelter... 
I'm at a loss, asking everyone I know if they could keep her (my dog) for a year or so, just so I have the time to graduate and get my own place. After calling my step-dad he told me it's better to just look for a permanent new place for her and it destroyed me. The thought of never seeing her again is so painful, but I don't know what the best solution is...",10Oct2019,1
587,"I’m recently separated from my ex-fiancé and we were together for six years. We met in college through a group where we had several mutual friends, and a friend that we saw as a mentor (I think she’s 8 years older and worked at the college) who kept us in line and called us on our shit when I made stupid mistakes, etc. Lots of late night talks about anything and everything under the sun. We kept in touch mostly with this mentor and two other friends after leaving the college, but eventually, we all had a falling out. The falling out hasn’t really been discussed—there wasn’t a big fight or anything. I have my own reasons for breaking off contact, as does he, and I’m sure our former friends have their own reasons as well. We all kinda ghosted each other. 

Right around the time we were separating, our mentor friend started following me on social media and initiated contact after 3-4 years. I was really torn about this at first, especially without having cleared the air about why we hadn’t spoken in 3 years, but the fond memories came flooding back and I really needed a friend. I’m a new mom on top of everything else and she has two small children, so we mostly talk about them. I hesitated to even tell my ex about this because he’d openly called her names and ranted about her in the first few days after I started talking to her again and it was clear that he was still bitter. 

We made loose plans to meet up, as I’d found some old art supplies that I thought she could use for her older kiddos. Then my ex and I broke up for good. I went to her and said something like “I wanted our convos to stay lighthearted and fun, but here’s what’s up, and that’s why I’ve been pushing back plans. I know you want to see [my ex] when we hang out and I encourage you to reach out to him separately because he probably needs a friend, too.”

Fast forward about a month. My ex is now living separately and I learn that they’ve been talking, but at my ex’s request... right after he learned that we were friends again (weeks after she initiated contact). In the back of my mind I feared that he’d unloaded completely and let her know about all of his resentments and issues we’ve ever had, because he’s an open book like that and still very bitter about the end of our relationship. I tried to ignore those feelings and just nicely asked him to please not jeopardize my chance to rekindle our friendship, and there’s a lot I could be telling her that I’m not (he’s been emotionally abusive and cruel for years) in order for them to reconnect. I genuinely have not shed him in anything but a positive light. He agreed.  

Last night, the friend and I were talking and laughing (as one does on the internet I suppose) and I asked if she had any plans in the next couple of days to finally get together. The first question was ignored while she responded to something else I said. I asked again but more directly, and she left it on read and hasn’t responded in almost a day. 

My heart has been sinking all day and I’m pretty confident I know what’s going on. My ex is very manipulative. But I’ve also been accused (all of those years ago) about being a little bit jealous in friendships (fair) and jumping to conclusions, so I’m really trying not to. She’s just not really one to isolate if it’s a bad mental health day and has otherwise been active. 

I want to send her a message along the lines of “hey, so I know that you and [ex] have been talking, and I genuinely think that’s great. You and him were close and for longer than we’ve even known each other, and I can imagine he’s relieved to have a friend who knows both of us and that he can vent to. He doesn’t have a huge support system right now. But I fear that his anger and resentment towards me will jeopardize any chance we have at rekindling our friendship and I’m scared that’s why you haven’t responded. There’s two sides to every story and I’ve been through it all with him, but I’m more than my failed relationship. I’m trying my best to be better and stronger every day and having you as a friend and mom-friend has been a huge blessing. I just kind of want to know where we stand and if we can clear the air over coffee or something.”

Should I send something like this? Should I wait or not send it at all? Are there any amends you’d make?",10Oct2019,1

I’ve been working at my sisters restaurant since it opened, which is 3 years ago. I love catering and enjoy what I do, especially when I make very decent money for my age. I argue with my sister a lot, and it’s mainly due to the fact that she refuses to give me leadership despite me being basically the manager, and running everything when she’s not at work which is most of the time.

I get paid the same as everyone else, and this is what annoyed me. I feel that if I do more then everyone which is handle complaints, run front of house and put in my own time to grow knowledge of wines , fix broken items in the kitchen, I should be paid more. My sister claims that I make good money and shouldn’t complain. I’ve never received a bonus (all other members of staff did) and have never been given any special treatment. I do make more then others overall but that’s because I do more hours. I’m at work 6 days a  week, 10 in the morning till 10 at night, and don’t even have time to go to the gym. I still make the same amount an hour as everyone else

612,"Last year I was incredibly close friends with a girl we will call A. Me and A were practically inseparable and she was, I thought, very supportive. At the same time, my now ex-boyfriend was becoming increasingly neglectful and emotionally manipulative. This alongside both of our poor mental health led to a messy breakup which consisted of breaking up and getting back together, because although it was a toxic relationship, it was very comforting to know someone who was going through the same thing. This, as well as some other things, led to me being hospitalised. 

After a long time of being stuck in this cycle, I finally ended it and moved on to a much healthier relationship with my current boyfriend. Originally, A was very supportive of it, but gradually went on to become very malicious towards myself and my boyfriend. A lot of it was talking about me in very horrible ways to some of my close friends, including very private details of my mental breakdown which I had shared in confidence with her. I, however, did not immediately realise that she was doing this and was becoming more and more upset that my once close best friend was now being distant, and frankly mean towards me. I started at a different college to A, my boyfriend and our mutual friend group (which A was also a part of) which made her distancing even more apparent. On the occasions that I would try to meet up / talk to her, she would either cancel or be very dismissive with me. I realise I sound very needy, but I was still recovering and I would like to note that I actively avoided putting the strain of my mental health problems on her and instead put this into therapy.

I thought that I should give her space, but that only gave her a platform to say that I was the one who was being dismissive etc.. I felt like shit for ages, but luckily developed a really tight friend group at my current college. I pretty much ignored her after finding out all the horrible things she'd been telling my friends (seen in receipts) about me and my boyfriend, though she soon just focussed her attention on me. something I couldn't understand, given how much I had both trusted and loved her.

I forgot her and everything for a while until February when at a party, my ex-boyfriend told me he had broken up with his current girlfriend because he still loved me, and said he couldn't love anyone more. Which was a bit of a fucking joke considering how horrible he was in the relationship. This was also said in front of my current bf and A. I noticed that A and my ex seemed a lot closer and was quite aware of the fact that something was going on. A few weeks later I find out that they're dating, and it hurts- a lot. two people I had placed a lot of trust in that had treated me so poorly, felt like they were conspiring against me, not to sound overly paranoid though. 

when I see her or him now, the conversation often moves towards their sex life and each other, even if they're not in the same convo. aside from being uncomfortable its also quite cringe. anyway, she messages me and it seems as though she's being friendly. it comes along in convo, and I say something along the lines of ""its been quite hard for me to see you with ex, but I'm happy for you. I don't want there to be any animosity, I'm happy with my bf and im glad things are going well"". after some questioning from her as to why I feel like its been weird for me, which I thought was obvious seeing as she'd seen how badly he treated me and the aftermath of that. I find out a day later that she send my message to three girls, who I fortunately happen to be good friends with, talking about how weird I am for feeling that way and that I'm essentially a freak. cheers babes. 

so, I ditch the rekindling idea and again just put her out of my mind. at a party that my ex is at, and A is not, he tells me to be nicer/friends with A to which I reply something along the lines of ""She's not been good to me, I've made efforts to reach out \[there are more that I haven't included in this post\] and she hasn't reciprocated, I'm not going to make an effort to be friends with her if she's gonna keep rejecting it"".

now today, I get a text from her asking me to call her when im back from college. I am not at all comfortable with this, she gives me extreme anxiety and also I don't know who's going to be on the other end of the call. so I say that she can ring me now bc im on my break at college (and surrounded by friends). she says she'd rather do it tonight so she can think about what she wants to say, I reply and say that I'm going out with friends this evening. she then says we can talk at a gig we're both going to tomorrow.

I am worried she will accuse me of ruining our friendship, still caring about my ex and later framing me as the bad guy. although she could be apologising. either way, I want nothing to do with her. **is there any way I can tell her that I don't want to be friends because I don't trust her / she makes me uncomfortable / she's just not a nice person** without her thinking I'm jealous or ""being weird""

I can’t conceive naturally and in my area they stop offering IVF at 40. Even then, it’s a year on the waiting list, you have had to be living with a partner for two years, and to be referred to IVF you need to have been trying for two years. You need to be referred by a fertility clinic, and in order to be referred to that you need to be trying for a year. So basically I’m very quickly running out of time.

Although we had a private inspection before we closed (found only minor cosmetic issues), we had another private inspection yesterday because we wanted to catch anything that the builder needs to fix before the warranty ends. 
       
The private inspector found several issues, including structural. Some things were obviously wrong such as a gaping hole between on our front porch into our attic where bats and squirrels could enter. I am certain that isn’t up to any building code. 
       
But he also found, for example, that the nails going diagonally into the joists in the attic are only 1.5 inches when they should be 3 inches. Wouldn’t the city inspector have caught this during his building inspections? Is it possible the city only requires 1.5 inch nails but the International Building Code requires 3? I’m so confused...",10Oct2019,1
619,"To keep the story short, a couple months ago in a meeting my coworkers and myself were joking around and gave me a nickname. Usually these things get joked about for a day or two and then go away. This has stuck for a couple months and is getting really annoying and I'm getting some resentment towards my coworkers. 

The name is not rude or harassing or necessarily negative, but I think nicknames in the workplace should not be a thing. I have a name, I expect to be called that. My view is, nicknames are for middle school and high school sports, not in the workplace. Plus, nicknames are never positive, there is always seems to be some underlying negative idea about them (no one gets nicknamed super cool person).

How do I get them to stop calling me this nickname? I figured it would blow over after a couple days, but at this point I think the only way to tell them to stop calling me this is if I just tell them to stop calling me by my nickname. I've tried to ignore them when they call me it or try to not reinforce them calling me the nickname, but that's not working either. I've tried everything I know to get them to stop calling me this nickname.",10Oct2019,1

T/W: assault, sexual violence.

Hello,

So a few months ago I was sexually assaulted when I was abroad and living with friends. They were super supportive and looked after me but then I left the country and nobody ever checked up on me. I was in a bad way for a while and am now on the up, but I have to see them quite regularly. I feel as though they are now avoiding me, they don’t talk to me, i stopped texting them about 6 weeks ago and they haven’t started messaging me. They really seem not to care. When I have had conversations with them they have asked me how my ‘holiday’ was (6 weeks in which I was suffering the effects of trauma, didnt leave the house, slept an unhealthy amount and my social life suffered), but they never ask me how I am. I have even mentioned that it wasn’t really a holiday and that I had a really bad time and they just change the topic.

I want to tell them how much their behaviour has upset me. Whenever I see them in person the conversation is awkward, and now I’m not being invited to things. I left a class and nobody noticed, and many of them haven’t responded to my invitations to a party. Before this summer we were so close, they were my little family, and I care about them so much.

When we were living together I took care of them when they were sick and ensured we had a really happy household and I made food regularly and I would do special things for them like make breakfast or buy them foods they liked. I just feel so lonely and lost and like I’ve done something to upset them all, when I’m also trying to juggle my overwhelming anxiety and the post-trauma symptoms. Not only has the assault affected my self esteem in a big way, but the painful death of my social life has me feeling so guilty and like this is all my own fault. I don’t know how to tell them their behaviour is so inappropriate and disappointing, as I’m scared they really genuinely don’t care about me.",10Oct2019,1
623,"Ok so me and my boyfriend have been together for almost a year and it’s been magical. We lost our virginities to each other. 
It’s established that I’m into being overpowered and dominated and he’s fully aware of it. It’s a turn on when he’s somewhat aggressive. 
Problem is, due to dumb bad experiences, I can’t take my bra off during sex. Don’t get me wrong he’s seen them bare many times via pictures and videos. 
So I suppose my question is, how do I tell him without seeming like a prude. I’ve told him before while being in the act that I’m too insecure and would much rather prefer to keep it on and he said stuff along the lines of “you’re beautiful” and shit like that to maybe make me ease up but it’s not about me being uncomfortable cuz of him or what he may think, it’s just I’m uncomfortable. 
Idk if that’s too much to ask for but if not, how do I make it clear without killing the mood?",10Oct2019,2

625,"  Hi, Advice, sorry if I mess any of this up. First post, literally made an account to post this. Maybe it belongs on a mental health Reddit page instead.

Meat of the issue:
   I've been in a bit of a tight spot as of late. I've lived with my girlfriend for about a year now. I love her dearly, and there's no one I'd want to spend my life with more. We got a dog and everything.
   She has severe anxiety that she does take medication for, but I suspect it's either not working, or not the right dosage. This month in particular is hard for her because it's the month her father passed away about 12 years ago. Today, she was getting ready to drive to work, and tapped a tree just off the driveway. It's a trailblazer, so the truck itself was perfectly fine, but the plastic cover for the tail light cracked. She immediately flew into an anxiety attack. Started hitting herself, screamed she'd never drive again, threw the keys in the trash, and tried to lock herself in the bathroom after I stopped her from getting back in the car to ""do much worse to herself"". 
   For some added context, the car was her dad's prior to his passing. I tried to calm her, assure her the truck was fine, and that it was easy to replace the cover. Literally a $30 part. She proceeded to tell me I was wrong, that she's worthless, and a fuck up. 
   I called her work, telling them she wouldn't be in because she's sick today. I stayed up for a while longer, until I figured she fell asleep on the couch I moved her to. Her mother was around, so I didn't have to worry about anything happening to her, but I still felt terrible going to work (just started a new job, can't take time off). 
   I'm an EMT, so my natural instinct is to call, and send a patient to the psych ward. But I know she was there when she was younger, and it honestly might only make the situation worse. I'm kind of at a loss. I don't know what to do.

TL;DR Girlfriend whom I live with had the mother of all panic attacks because she damaged her late father's car where she threatened to kill herself. She is medicated for anxiety, but I don't think it's enough. If I put her in psych, she's not going to appreciate it, and it'll likely just worsen the situation. I don't know what to do.",10Oct2019,1
626,"Lately i'm feeling awful. My friends are mean, i have issues with my dad and i'm really fucked up over a boy. Because all of this, my school is going sh*t, real sh*t. 
People calling me stupid because of it, and me actually believing them. 
Fail after fail I don't know how to get out. 
I don't want to go to school anymore but i really want to study psych next year. 
But I'm so done, it isn't healthy for me. Non of it is. 
Nothing is going well i really don't know anymore...",10Oct2019,1
628,"TL;DR Friend has made up several HUGE lies (that were reliably fact checked to be false) and they are not handling the situation well when confronted with questions. What's the best way to approach them as a friend?

I adore my friend, he is a wonderfully nice person, but he makes these elaborate lies like ""I'm in the guiness book of world records for highest red blood cell count and highest kick flip"" or some dumb irrelevant nonsense. (No, he's not, we checked. When he started these lies we thought he was joking, but he brings them up constantly and uses them to argue with people who try to outdo him.) He also claims he's CEO of a (famous AF) shoe company. (NO the fuck he's not! How can you be dirt poor and hourly if you're a CEO of (famous) brand!?) He talks about being this bigwig in the shoe company daily, as if he'd actually worked here. He talks about how people try to steal shoes and how he's had to follow people out of the door personally to stop them. (Why the hell would a CEO be on the sales floor ringing people up on a Saturday?)

So the lie that got him in hot water last night was he claims he has been to Australia several times for business trips. He even showed us pictures of some vague beach which could honestly be ANY beach given the pictures. He told us last month that he'll be gone for the rest of the year (until Jan something) on business in Australia, according to him he left 2 weeks ago. A friend ran into him at Wal-mart last night (which he claims he never ever shops at) and he acted like nothing was wrong.

When asked ""weren't you in Australia"" he backpedaled and said he flew back to the US for ""family reasons"", but his family lives in Oregon and we're in Missouri?? He has no relatives here and he's mentioned that a few times before. Suddenly this morning there's a massive post on his FB wall saying how he got ""let go"" from (famous company) and they took all his money away. His own sister replied with ""I never knew you worked for (famous company)!"" Like he didn't even tell his own sister this lie?

(For the record I know for a fact he actually works for an HVAC company. I've seen his work truck in his driveway many times and he has a ""HVAC Company"" logo on it the same as the truck and he knows and obnoxious amount about furnaces and stuff and bragged how he fixed his own last winter. The one brag that's probably true.)

A mutual friend asked him the obvious questions like ""how does a CEO get ""let go"" and ""how were you such a high rank but still making $16/hr""? He got defensive saying things like ""why are you questioning MY life?"" and ""no one respects me for my life's achievements, I've done more in my life than most will do in 100 years"". (Keep in mind he's 26 years old.)

Just now he confessed to me that he's actually dying and he's been hiding it from his family and he made up the lie about australia so no one would question where he went when he dies. THIS is the part I'm so confused about. Is it just another mindless lie for sympathy, or is he legit dying and just trying to leae this earth with no one to mourn him? I'm so fucking confused on what I should even say in response to it. (I haven't replied to the message yet.)

The thing is, aside from the lying to brag about himself 24/7, he's a genuinely nice guy and hella fun to hang around when he's not defending his honor. I don't wanna lose him as a friend, but how can I talk to him and tell him gently that we KNOW he's lying about everything and it's upsetting and making it hard to be his friend? Especially after the dying comment. Another friend said it's just not worth it to bring it up and to just nod your head when he brags. He said he hasn't told anyone else about the dying part yet. Is that really what's best though?",10Oct2019,1

 I want them to leave me alone, and no ""move out""comments because im still 13.

631,"**Basically**, I think I fell in love with a friend of mine I've known for roughly two years now.  I kinda want to tell her about this because I don't think it's right to not let her know but she's barely ever online and I feel like I'd ruin her friendship.

We currently maybe talk once a month, sometimes once every two months, I do think of her daily and wonder when the next message will arrive. The thing is. I'm not sure if this is actually *love or not.* It could be just friendship I think?  I have two friends and she is one of them, but I only kind of ''miss'' her, not the other one. thought I talk to the other one on the daily, so I just assume it might be love.

I'm not sure if I should just, outright tell her, or dorp hints or something? especially since I'm not sure myself, she recently outed herself as being bisexual, so that gives me a chance I think. but even after 2 years I don't know everything about her, I see myself as being asexual and I know that is probably the biggest turn off for everyone.  

Another thing that makes me think she might like me back is the fact she always jokes about being forever alone and just being content with my being her only friend, she claims she cannot connect with anyone else but me. she tried but failed and said she really only wants to talk to me too ( I actually feel the same). I also think I might have a chance because we live at the opposite positions on the globe, so we don't know how the other one looks and it'll make me more genuine because idc how she looks?

&amp;#x200B;

SO should I just tell her next time she is online? or drop hints or just... idk, make her do a move to discover if she is interested or not?

&amp;#x200B;

On the mental thing, I did not want to make a separate post about it because that would probably be flooding or something. But I think I should maybe get some sort of mental help, I generally don't seem to feel any emotions for 95% of the time, not even stress or anything when my papers are due the next day. It's been like this for roughly 9-ish years now, or frankly as long as I can remember. The 5% that I would actually feel emotions, come completely out of the random for me, one moment I'll be dull, sitting in my chair, and the next I'll feel so angry I just want to throw everything off my desk. seemingly without any trigger.

I've also noticed a significant loss of concentration, school has become a pain because I cannot concentrate in class or remember anything at all. It goes in one ear and leaves through the other. 

I used to think I have some sort of social anxiety, but never went to test it because it isn't really a thing to get diagnosed for where I live, and I still find myself in situations where I act as I have it but unlike back when I was a kid the emotions are completely lacking from it. 

&amp;#x200B;

but my biggest bother by far is that I have lost interest in everything, I used to like gaming, reading and what not but right now my favorite past time is just starting blankly at a wall. This doesn't help seeing as how I'm attending an art school that requires motivation. 

My only reason for staying alive is the fact I have pets and am generally a coward, besides that, I just feel worthless and think its pathetic how I'm alive, healthy, while others who want to live are sick and dying.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if any of this is normal or not basically, I'm afraid that if I do seek some sort of help or advice the person will tell me this is normal and idk what's worse, living further like this or living like this knowing it is in fact normal. so that is why I ask.

&amp;#x200B;

this kind of ties into liking my friend too I guess, she made me feel happy once or twice now and it was such a great feeling, that it can seem frustrating to not have it more regularly. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what would you say? do I confess or not? do I go to some person to get help or not?

&amp;#x200B;

note: I'm not too good at English if anything grammar wise annoys lemme know and I will correct it.

641," 

Well,  i was sexually abused by a cousin when i was a kid, and it bothered me  for most of my life, it went on for some years, my family lived in a  house with about 15 people. It stopped when my mom met my step dad and  we moved in with him, i was about 10. Basically that is all the memories  i had about my childhood, there is some good memories too but not a  lot.

As a teenager, i abused a lot  of alcohol and some drugs(i died one time), and avoided all the family  meetings i could, and they happened at least once a week until 5 years  ago, when my grandparents died(they owned the house where everyone lived  and where the meetings would occur). My mom always told me that i was  being an asshole because i was the only one that would not go, i kinda  of agreed with her because most of my family is really nice, and i would  not go more because it always made me feel uncomfortable to be around  them, and angry sometimes.

So when  i was about eighteen i moved out of my home cause of a fight i had with  my step dad. Until this point my life was basically shit, i never   connected with almost anyone, i had one girlfriend that was killed when  someone stole her dads car, so i was really in a dark place most of my  life, after that i didn't dated again for some time, I did all that  party stuff, get fucked up a lot, slept with some girls, but there was  never more to it.

The thing is  after i moved out i didn't talked to my family almost never, i visited  my mom sometimes. That when things started to change, i found a job i  really like, i  didn't stop drinking, but i got it under control, i have  made really good friends, that i still keep in touch regularly, i met a  girl and we lived together for some time, she won a scholarship on  another country and had to move out, but that was not a problem for me, i  was actually really happy for her because she wanted it for a long  time, we don't keep in touch anymore, but i always wish everything turns  out the way she wants to. First time i was really happy, i mean  completely happy, there were bad days, but there will always be, for  everyone. i lived like that for some years.

Then  things went bad, i had a job that needs some specific tools(expensive),  and they were stolen, twice. so i had no money, no job, i sold  everything in the apartment to pay the bills, so i didn't have to go and  ask for help to my family, i was sleeping at the floor for two months,  than i had to move back to my mom house, until i could save some  money(my mom is living in the house that all my family lived, just her  and my uncle. Then all came back the drinking the anger, and we have  been arguments for the 2 months i am living here. So yesterday we  started discussing a lot, she says that i always had been given anything  that i wanted(that isn't a lie), and that she doesn't get it why i am  so distant from all my family and why I am in a bad mood all the time,  and that my life has been a cake walk. so i told her about my cousin and  what happened, and she just looks at me and say "" everybody knows it  happened, that's a normal thing, it happens,  this  happened before in  this family, get over yourself"".

So  I have been here for two months, and i saved the money i needed, bought  the tools i need, made a financial plan to never get in this situation  again.  But i still have a lot of resentment for my family specially  after my mom told those things to me, so i thinking that i am moving out  next week, and i will never speak to my family again, being around them  makes me feel bad, now more than ever, and really angry, this is not  healthy, they are not bad people, but i think they have problems that i  cant solve, even if i tried. And that makes me sad, like, to never talk  to them again, and that i will always be the a\*\*\*ole of the family,  specially because if i asked for financial help, or them to do something  for me, they probably would do it. But i cant live like this anymore, i  cant be happy around them. What are you're thoughts on this ?",10Oct2019,1
642,"Hello all,

I found myself living next to a domestic abuse situation. Tonight I called the cops on them for the first time, as their argument got violent for the first time.

It's a Chinese couple in their late forties and their teenage daughter who never leaves the house alone. I think the mother is seriously abusing the daughter, at least emotionally, now I also think physically. 

Since I moved in 8 months ago I can hear them get verbally violent through our shared wall multiple times a week, every week. So I finally also called the domestic abuse hotline and told them everything. They've made up a file along with my call to the emergency services and they're going to put this family in touch with certain organisations.

They dont know any of this yet, just that someone (likely me) called the police.

How am I supposed to act when I see them in the street?

She told me I was sweet for understanding, and were gonna be good friends, thing is I realized I still have feelings for her but I dont wanna risk shit again by telling her I like her(plus that would be too much she’ll think im bypolar or shit), so I had a mutual friend say that I dont know how I feel about her.

649,"Hello, I'll get right to it. I work for a high end men's store that specializes in custom clothing. It's a very small business, with a small staff (less than 10 people). I genuinely love the work I do, and menswear is a passion for me that I want to have a career in. 

I have been working for a year and have not received a pay raise, though I plan on asking for one tomorrow morning. As of right now, I make 12 dollars an hour, which is 90 cents more than my states minimum wage. I used to have an hourly sales job before this that was at 16, so I took a pay cut thinking it was just a starting wage, and knowing I would be working for a substantial business that looks better on resumes. 

To be honest, I was very shocked at the starting wage I was given. From the outside, you'd think that a commission program would be used for pay, or at the very least, wages in the 20s. I've reached out to other people who work in this industry, and they all make well over 20 dollars (whether base pay or commission) an hour. I spoke with a coworker the other day, and in the same position, he makes 7 dollars more an hour than I do. He has been here a little longer, and naturally produces more than I do, but it seems way off to me. 

It's pretty obvious that at great as this job looks from the outside, it is not a long term career opportunity. The only problem is there isn't any similar opportunities close to me within my city. 

So my question being, should I continue to work for more time build a skillet and strengthen my resume? Or am I being fucked in the ass and should I pursue something else, even if it's not something I enjoy as much? 

Something just doesn't seem right about selling 3000 dollar suits and barely being able to afford to shop at a department store :/",10Oct2019,1
650,"Today is World Mental Health Day.

My depression has become unreal and I don't even recognize myself anymore. I've been feeling like I've reached a tipping point - I either deal with everything ""face to face"" and stop hiding or I swear I may end up killing myself. I didn't even know what depression was when I was 18 and now I totally get why people commit suicide. 

I was happy and fine until I reached around 21 and the real world hit and everything for the past ~8 has been a huge long stretch of awful memories and pain. I really really feel that the root of everything is because I just have a brain that's not typical and it's causing myself and others a lot of problems because I haven't been able to understand that I function differently. 

I'm not diagnosed, I've actually sought diagnoses but I've been told unofficially that therapists don't think I have it. I am 99% certain that it's because I mask well and aspergers in women still isn't largely understood. I hate being in the grey world of maybe because I feel like it's insulting to women who 100% are diagnosed but I'm telling you, I'm very sure I fall under the spectrum. 

SO, the advice I need:

I'm in a bad place now and I need to admit that. I am seeing a therapist as a crisis center once a week and I've been open with them about my suspicions. There's something breaking inside of me though and I just feel like I'm dying to just be able to tell ONE person in my life about it - someone who actually knows me so I can stop feeling like a ""patient"" when I talk about it. 

There's this guy who I (ok, fine) met through a dating site in 2015ish. We did end up dating, and I was severely depressed then. I knew depression was affecting everything but I kept thinking it would lift and I also didn't realize how bad it was. I broke up with him first of all because I was moving to a new country, secondly because I was unsure of how I felt about us being together, and third because I felt unable to handle things.

Then, after more than a year, I ended up coming back here. We ended up bumping into each other and reconnecting as friends. I started to care much more deeply about whatever relationship we had then because I felt I could kind of relax a little more around him. We did a lot as ""friends"" for a long time, he hung out with my friends and I did find myself feeling really really happy when I was around him but they would come in bursts because my depression was still so bad. I was more aware of my own issues then but just didn't feel that they were important to talk about, I wanted things to be casual.

Finally, he ended up admitting he was hoping we could try dating again. He said he really cared about me and he felt I was keeping him in ""a revolving door"" of maybe. So I'm guilty of friend-zoning him, which wasn't good of me. I think I was because I just didn't feel I could handle a deep relationship at the time. And towards the end of our friendship, I had actually attempted dating someone else which I think hurt him a lot. Anyway, when I turned him down when he asked me to try being his girlfriend again, I know it hurt him and we stopped talking even though he SAID he was ok with continuing to be friends as long as he wasn't in the ""maybe"" zone for dating. 

I 100% know that my issues came up so much during our relationships as both bf/gf and friends. He'd sometimes ask me whey I was being so quiet, why I was staring off in the distance at a party, why I wasn't continuing a conversation, etc. I'd go downtown with him and remember being soooo uncomfortable when we'd join with his friends who were strangers to me. I think I knew these things were really uncomfortable for him back then but I wasn't ready to tell him why I think I was acting that way.

So, he's the one person who I know has picked up on my issues, who cared about me in one point in time, and who SAID he was ok continuing to be friends although we didn't. I think it's because I never explained things and ever since we stopped talking I've deeply wished I had been able to tell him why all of this was happening. I just wasn't ready. 

We haven't talked in 2 years....this would be really really out of the blue. But he's a mature guy and I wonder all the time that if I explained things to him, he'd be less hurt about everything that happened. And maybe we could continue being friends or at least I could make things more clear for him. I don't know what to do, I don't want to be selfish. 

Should I reach out to him? Or keep that door closed.

TL;DR: 99% sure I have aspergers, I want to be able to just come out to ONE person who I know and ask their advice and what they think, the person I have in mind is someone I know was negatively affected because of my issues but he and I haven't talked in 2 years after I awkwardly turned him down when he asked me about re-taking our friendship to dating. I felt safe around him and have wanted to explain things to him for a long long time, but don't want to be selfish or be ""using"" him.",10Oct2019,1

We then explored our city for a bit went to her place she cooked and we chilled in her room watching movies but she sat on a chair while I sat in her bed I asked why so far away she was like it’s more comfortable on her chair. I then went home cause it was kinda late. We then met up again but ate at a cheap restaurant went back to her place just hung out this just seems like things friends do. Then there are other things she does which makes me think different like she always sends me snapchats of her family, her taking care of her younger cousins, etc. She’s also sent me snaps of her trying on different dresses that she claims she “found” but they look really good and show off her curves. Also old pictures of her looking good. Furthermore, when I make physical contact she doesn’t seem to mind it but will make very little of her own. When I hug her she hugs back.

660,"My SO of 6 years has been running into some bad times lately. The past year and a half, he's struggled to find long term employment, he will find something and the contract will run out, the place ended up closing and a few he quit bc of some issues he apparently had. I can tell it's starting to wear at his self confidence and tbh, it's tough on me to be paying all the bills by myself... my savings are pretty much nil and all the progress I made paying off my debt is going to shit if he doesn't find something soon and start helping out. 

I feel like such a bitch for even considering leaving anymore bc who leaves someone when they're hitting rock bottom? Only a bitch. But honestly at the same time, how can you help someone who REFUSES to help themselves? He won't even consider upgrading his education, even a 4-week program to get a specific license, he won't do. There's a program where he can be certified in something (sorry, I'm leaving out specifics for privacy) in 8 months, 1 class a week. He won't do it. I even offered whats left of my savings to pay for it! He always talks about getting rich and how unlucky he is,... and it drives me crazy bc you need to WORK for that, winning the lottery to get rich is stupid (I mean like, counting on winning money is stupid... everyone wants to win lol!) 

I understand he's having some issues right now and I've been as supportive as I can, but I'm tired. I feel like he's dragging me down with him. Because HE'S unhappy, I'm not allowed to go back to school, I can't even take a fucking sick day when I need one bc I can't afford to lose 8 hrs off my paycheck. 

I know, I feel a bit shallow for giving up so easy just for something like money... but it's not jst that. There are other issues as well that are contributing (His temper, towards others not me. He can be SO RUDE in public and people think I'm the same way... He's got me in trouble at work, numerous times. He's made me cry on my birthday and 2 christmas's in a row bc he didnt like the guests attending) 

I'm tired. What should I do? Should I give him time to get his shit together and I'm overreacting bc of all the stress? Or am I justified in considering a divorce?",10Oct2019,2
661,"Me [20 M] and my 2 friends moved into an apartment 2 weeks ago.
The man living below our flat has complained to the property manager about hearing our footsteps. The property manager asked us to put a rug on the floor and perhaps walk with slippers in the house.
At first, I was going to comply. But then I realized that isn’t this a “normal” inconvenience of living in an apartment building? Not saying it’s inevitable. But if you don’t want to hear people’s footsteps above you, then live in a house. Why should I change my habit just to because you don’t want to hear my footsteps.

By the way, this man has been living there for years, and he has never complained about any footsteps before because he claims he did not hear any with the previous tenants.

Should I really buy slippers and change my shoes every time I enter the flat? Or should I ask him to buy us all 3 slippers and rugs if he insists on it being quiet?",10Oct2019,1
662,"TLDR at the end. Sorry for any spelling mistakes, english is not my first language. This is a throwaway, since I don't want my friends to see this. 

This might sound childlish, but my family is favorizing my two cousins, aged 7 and 5. And by ''my family'' I mean my neareast family: my parents, my 5 aunts, my three uncles, and my two cousins. I am the only one in my family to dislike them. They were born when I was 8, and from that moment my family treats me like trash. They (mostly my mom) shout on me almost every day, they blame me for EVERYTHING, either it is my fault or not, they sometimes slap me in the face but not so often. And I am not jealous of my cousins, I just dislike them. They are spoiled brats, if they do something wrong and I say that to them, they tell my parents and their parents, so I get trouble. I tried to talk about it with my family, but it usually ended with fights and words like ''you are so selfish'', ''don't be jealous'', ''yeah, show us how you tell someone about us, your family, who was always here for you'', ''don't lie''. ''you dare to betray your family like that?'' etc. Since my parents fight pretty often, I became really protective, and I got anger issues. So yeah, my family screwed me up.

I began going to a new school two months ago. There is this teacher who asked me is everything is okay, and I responded with ''yup! everything is fine''. Now I feel really bad for not telling him. I feel like if I don't tell him soon, I will harm myself because of my anger issues. I got many ways of telling him, but telling him like, to his face, is not one of them. He is not my contact teacher (he only teaches my class english, he is not the teacher we contact when we get sick for example) and I am scared that I will cry/have one of my anger outburts when we talk. I don't want to talk to anyone else. 

I can e-mail him, call him (teachers at our school have job-phone-numbers that we students know), text him, write about it in one of my essays (I think he will be kinda mad tho, idk, my friend says he is really strict), basically everything that does not involve telling him personally. I want him to know about it before we talk. 

TLDR: My family is treating me like trash, how do I tell my teacher about it? I don't want to tell him, like to his face, scared that I will have an anger outburst or will cry.",10Oct2019,2

667,"I (23M) feel completely lost on what to do with my life because despite weaving in and out of various careers I've never found anything I enjoy doing. Worse even, I've never found anything I didn't actively dislike. I've worked in restaurants, for a magazine publisher, for a film studio, in a library, and currently I am a freelance video editor. 

I have moderate social anxiety, and that's part of the reason I have hated every job I've had so much. The stress of making mistakes, wondering what your boss and colleagues think of you, and being afraid to ask for help have made every position a cesspool of stress, but even if that weren't the case, my complete disinterest in work deprives me of any passion or drive. I feel like there's something wrong with me because my friends all have either found something they love, or are working day jobs they don't mind while pursuing what they love. 

The only thing I've found that I enjoy doing and can be monetized is writing.  I've written three feature length screenplays just for fun, but that is a near impossible career to break into and requires so much more than just the writing aspect but also cold calling agents, competitions, the politics of show business, and all of that also drains me of any sort of drive. I've written a novella, memoirs, and am starting on a novel, but even if I somehow managed to publish anything it's not like that could pay my bills unless it was a best-seller. 

I thought being self-employed as an editor would be an ideal compromise because I could largely work from home and it's creative and there's no office politics, but again, the anxiety of dealing with clients and the competitive nature of the work has left me living paycheck to paycheck since I don't fight to obtain new clients and instead just take whatever comes along. I can manage rent and groceries but with other bills, like car stuff, popping up, I'm starting to fall into debt. It's now dawning on me I need to actually find something that I can make money on or else I'll be in trouble, but the thought of that fills me with dread because I have few marketable skills, the job market where I live is dwindling, and I'm afraid to commit to something just so I can slave away and hate my life. 

I've considered something low stress and then just working on my writing on the side, but every job like that, say retail at a bookstore or something, pays minimum wage and I can't sustain myself on that. 

I'm well-aware this post probably sounds whiny or immature, and you may be thinking ""Just grow up and find a job, it's what everyone else is doing"" but I just can't see the point of wasting the majority of my life on something terrible just so I can afford to live.",10Oct2019,13
668,"For the past year and half I’ve been having strange symptoms including shortness of breath, chest pain when walking around, and whenever I try to exert myself (even small things like grocery shopping) I’ve gotten dangerously close to passing out more than once. I always immediately sit down before I faint and don’t move until the chest pain and lightheaded dizzy feeling goes away. I’ve gone to a number of specialists and am currently on my third cardiologist. We definitely think it’s heart related (despite my being only 21) and I’ve had countless tests but still no answer. I’ve already had a bad experience with my first and second cardiologist but this third one is turning out to be the worst yet. He’s busier than I’ve ever seen a doctor be. His assistant even said offhandedly that he only gets in one meal a day because he has so many patients, too many to be doing a good job in my opinion. I always wait several hours when he has me come in for an appointment. I’ve done a stress test and couldn’t even do it properly, I was on the treadmill for my two minutes only and then I insisted they stop so I could sit down, I came very close to passing out during the test and the doctor couldn’t get any results because I was on it for so little time. Now we’ve done several more tests and when I mentioned my frustration at not being able to do anything for over a year and half because of my undiagnosed health problem my cardiologist has told me I need to start doing rigorous exercising, because sitting around all day (even though I physically cannot do anything more) is probably only making my problem worse. I told him I used to exercise and do housework until I started getting these symptoms and feeling like I would pass out so I had stopped doing them for fear of fainting. He still insisted I start doing major huffy puffy sweaty kinds of exercise. I asked what to do if I pass out while exercising (hoping he would get the message) and since I live with my mom still, he said that if I pass out to have her see if I am still breathing and have a pulse, and then to check my blood pressure (we have one at home) because we’ll get more data that way. He didn’t even mention how to revive me if I don’t wake up or tell us to call 911, I was so shocked and horrified I didn’t manage to think of anything more to ask. But now I’m scared, I don’t want to exercise because I know I will pass out and I’m terrified I might die or break something from falling when I faint which will hurt so much. I know doctors are supposed to know best and I should do what I’m told in order to get a proper diagnosis and a cure of some sort, I’m still wary to take this risk. I’d really like another opinion from a different doctor, but since this is already my third cardiologist my insurance won’t let me go to a fourth doctor even if it’s for a second opinion. Should I exercise and hope I don’t seriously hurt myself in the process? What do I do?",10Oct2019,1

*i often catch him staring at me in class. Sometimes i see in the corner of my eye hes looking at me. Sometimes i catch him looking. And sometimes we look at each other without smiling tho,wich i find a bit weird

*we have a class groupchat and he always defends me in it like when we have arguments always saying im right and talking good about me
*he talks good about me behind my back. He told his friends that know me that i was nice and he liked talking to me

*he talks about me in class, this only happened twice or so but let me tell you the stories. 1)  today for english (wich is the second foreign language we are taught at school) we had to go in teams ,the teacher made those team. I wasnt in his team. Me and him are the best in english of our class. So i heard a guy from my team speaking to him and saying i wish u were in my te i want to win and then he said ahahha dont worry you have *my name* idk i tought this was really sweet and he didn't say it in a rude way. 2) we were in french class the native language of my school but not my first and the teacher asked me if i was french ( my name is not french) so i said no and then my crush told the teacher ""but she's really good at it"" 

*he finds excuses to talk to me in class

The negative points aka the pints that make me doubt it all

° he refused giving me his snapchat (4 days later he texts me his snap username tho so idk this might be a positive point because we werent talking after he refused to give it and send me that text randomly)

°when we text he's rather dry and only replies to my question, unless its about a topic that really interests him.

° he's always texting someone but it could be his friend tho idk

° eventhough we texted ,we dont say hi to each other in the morning (u usually do this to ur friends)

°the times we talked in real life out of class was always my initiative

First of all I’m sorry if this is not the appropriate sub for my story but I couldn’t really think of one which would have fit better.

So long story short while my father was in prison we met the guy through a long time family friend. The guy saw what condition we were in(my mother and I didn’t work at the time) and offered to help us out with everything that we needed without having an ulterior motive. So all is good so far he’s visiting frequently and keeps giving us money to get by - he’s an all around great person.

My father got released a month ago and as soon as he heard about this he immediately threw a tantrum about how she obviously cheated on him with the guy etc. He then proceeded to threaten him that he would kill him(not literally)
if he ever saw him around our flat again. After a while he calmed down and we talked this through. Haven’t seen the guy ever since.

Everything was going relatively well until tonight when the guy called us to check up on how we’re doing. Well you can guess how my father reacted. He started shouting and saying how she doesn’t even love him anymore etc.
He eventually started getting physical with my mother but I intervened by pushing him aside. He considered retaliating but he changed his mind. He then proceeded to take a portion of our money(don’t know how much I don’t even care anymore) and took off saying the guy will be taking care of us from now on.
Right now he’s possibly fucking himself up with drugs and hopefully won’t ever “hunt” the guy.

My father has had problems similar to this regarding jealousy without proof.  Also its important to note that he likes to talk big but not actually deliver. Things have been worse before but I felt like it was enough since this is starting to take a toll on my mothers and my mental health. 

I’ve considered getting the police involved but could never do it because... well no matter how bad my father is I still love him.

When I was younger there was someone who was just flat out evil to me. She made me feel like I was going crazy. She would be so nice to my face and then lie to people about me behind my back and make it seem like I was being mean to her. It got so bad my mom would scream at me and call me names because I was “being mean” to this girl. 

Well the girl finally showed her true colors to my mom so my mom apologized for not believing me. After this the girl spread rumors about me and my mom to all our mutual friends. This caused me to lose pretty much all my friends because she was older, richer, etc. than I was.  just being honest no one wants to lose their rich friend that buys them things. 

Recently this girl has gone on FB and started talking about how her last partner abused her and he got arrested for domestic violence against her. No one deserves that.

And so there’s a spot in the corner of the room and she just throws her pedicure stuff like the foot soak machine, all her pedicure supplies, mannequin head, and two tote bags of craft stuff that she makes jewelry with and sells it in the salon. And it just makes the room look cluttered. But I’m lowkey afraid to tell her as I don’t want her getting mad or thinking I’m being mean about it like “get your trash out of the corner now 😡” cause I’m not I want it to be a nice looking spa room for the both of us. So how would I go  about telling her? I thought to maybe just buy a storage unit to put her stuff in the bottom drawer and then just put most of my stuff on it like things I can sell to my clients and what not so that way I can clean it without having to tell her to get her stuff out. Idk any suggestions?",10Oct2019,5

683,"Ugh. 

Just needed to come on here and talk, even if no-one replies, before I do something stupid. So I've been with my girlfriend for 8 solid months. I quickly learnt she was bipolar with depressive symptoms, due to her rough past full of her family issues, abusive Dad, and ex's cheating on her. So I decided to still stay with her, and we got together when she was a bit more stable. 

We had the best relationship, something neither of us had. We both loved each other deeply from our souls, made each other happy, stayed through any issues we had. We had built many great memories and had the best plans for the future, used those as motivation every single day. She was the girl I someday wanted to marry. 

So here is when the issues began. I had met her 2 months ago, like I usually do every month or so (we are sort of LDR 2 hours away by train). So the day before we met, she had an argument with her parents, and she was just about allowed to see me. We had a great day, but then she stupidly decided to stay out all night with me, and didn't want to go home because she didn't wanna go back to her abusive dad, who'd probably hit her for going out in the first place. As a result she got her phone taken, and completely lost her parents trust, as she had built it up (from losing it in the past due to doing more stupid things with exs such as running away from home), then lost it again. 

So her parents thought this was my fault too, when I never did want this to happen. I never managed to talk to them, as they didn't want to talk to me. My girl got her phone taken, and then had to use her sister's so we used to talk rarely during the day after that, didn't meet since too. We had loads of nights just crying, she had loads of breakdowns, and used to barely talk to me. She used to think that it got to my head, when I always stayed positive, reminded her of our love and our future. I just remained a positive person in her life, always giving her love and respect her family didn't give her, due to her being neglected.

Recently things have been better for her, due to her family realising something is wrong with her. Her family are getting back together, her Dad apologised and told her that she can talk to him about anything. So this is when she broke up with me, and told me that she loves me deeply, but she wants to focus on herself due to her depression, and carry on getting better with her family.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know how to take this. I feel so empty, I've helped her through the worst, and now when things get better she decides to leave. Tbh, it's the best for her, but idk how to feel. Just feel empty, lost, so so low that I've lost a girl I had put my entire heart into, and planned my future with. I'm happy for her that her issues are getting better, but I lost her. I lost my everything.",10Oct2019,2
684,"I've  (20F) been on a long and tiring journey of all kind of issues; (family problems, mental health issues, sexual assault, moving continents and continuing education in an entirely different language, emotional problems, loneliness, financial problems) and haven't been stable in any way (mostly financially, mentally, and where I'm at in my education) 
I still have to do the A-level equivalent in the country I'm living in to inscribe at University, and the language is extremely difficult. I don't have an option to skip the mothertongue language test, and I'm considering giving up. 
Back when my head wasn't filled with all this sudden but huge responsibility and big problems and shit to worry about, I used to be ambitious, passionate, and curious about science and maths (and in general life) now I don't have joy in anything and just want to have a normal life without more difficulties. I'm by no means a genius but I was enjoying figuring out phenomena and proofs. 
I don't know if I should continue my education or just go into some normal simple job. 
It helps to mention that sometimes, when I'm relaxed I still have those questions running through my mind (I wanna figure out how this or that machine works for eg.)
I don't know if I can afford to have that anymore.
Now I landed a part time job and registered as a listener for a semester at University. Because I haven't been doing much maths for the last 3 years, I lost a lot of knowledge and gotta redo a lot.

I am at a huge turning point in life where I got myself (with help of some Family and intensive Therapy) out of a long lasting crippling depression. I started an apprenticeship again, so I work and go to School one day a week, and I am slowly making may way to become a functional member of society.

There is many goals I've set my self to but I am pretty uncertain how to ever reach them, since there is a lot of factors in life that are out of my hands.

One of them is to get into a real relationship with a proper partner I can count on, work together with to spend our lifes together happily and to support me as I support her. But I actually would want to know how to find such a person. I mean I had some Girlfriends over the years but no relationship was long lasting or fulfilling.

Another would be to get a handle daily/monthly chorse, the things everyone should be able to handle like cooking a proper meal, eating healthy, keeping my flat tidy, keeping up with my studies, paying bills on time and so on. (Rent is exempt from this because I always pay my damn rent don't wanna be sleeping under a bride lol) 

I want to be able to continue to do my hobbies, playing video games, reading, doing outdorsy stuff, going out with friends for dinks or a movie or what not. 

How do normal people keep a handle on all of these things and more I can't really juggle mor than one thing at a time and since I moved away from my home town its especially hard to keep up with friends longtime ones and newer ones. And apart from all the things I wanna keep tabs on I also kind of want to be able to have time to relax but from my point of view right now it seems there is not enough time im a day/month/week to properly juggle these things without exhausting myself. And everytime I want an evening or a weekendday just to laze around and do nothing I feel like my friends try to butt in telling me I need to do stuff with them since they wanna see me and do stuff with me. 

Like seriously how does one Adult I am 24 now and been trying to get a handle on things for a couple of months now with work, School, Freetime, enough sleep, doing stuff with friends and keeping my hobbies and it seems kinda impossible to juggle all of it.

700,"I'm in over my head, my family and I need advice. Serious replies only, please.

I'm too tired to be lengthy. Here's my situation:

My younger (21yo) brother has autism. He is a gem &amp; I treasure him, okay? But for the last few months, the amount of conflict he has directly been causing is absolutely more than my family can deal with. 

My brother is high functioning, an intellectual, and responds well to logic and reasoning. But on top of his autism he has OCD, and one of the biggest facets of his personal OCD is that it makes him corrective and combative. 

We've been in an unavoidable situation since July where his normal routine has been in shambles, and the family has been under a lot of pressure. He has been SO argumentative and SO combative and SUCH a jerk that he's on everyone's last nerve, regularly, despite how much we love him. He will pick little trivial nothings that don't matter, and argue about them with my parents until they are broken down, screaming and crying. And then my brother feels so guilty and distraught at what he's done that he struggles with thoughts of suicide. He KNOWS that he shouldn't be doing what he does, but is compelled to, anyway.

This is over stuff that DOESN'T matter, guys. We're talking like, he yelled at us for an HOUR because he didn't want to believe that water itself isn't actually wet. He rages about pronunciation of a word, or the use of an apostrophe. My parents are at their wit's ends. I am legitimately afraid that one of them might have a heart attack or stroke soon. We are all under an unhealthy amount of stress. 

How do I get through to my brother? How do I cut conflict down in our household? How do I get my family to calm down, reassess, and try again? What can I do to make their fighting more constructive and less DEstructive? I'm genuinely worried :(

My brother already goes to therapy with a psychologist once a week, has bi-weekly visits with a psychiatrist, is medicated for his OCD, and I take him to classes on social skills and mental health whenever they're available in our area. He is 21, but is currently at the cognitive level of a 16 or 17 yo.

Any serious advice would be greatly appreciated.",10Oct2019,1
701,"Re-posted from another sub as it was deemed to be the wrong one. 

To some, this may seem very idiotic. I'd like to firstly apologise for that.

Quite recently, on the 24th of September, my father passed away in hospital after having struggled with alcoholism for years. I hadn't had a close relationship with him and so following his passing, I've experienced immense amounts of guilt which have reduced me to tears at work twice now.

I've made management aware, though it all feels incredibly awkward. Sometimes I feel I've no right to grieve due to my father and I's estranged relationship. But throughout the day I'll keep thinking back to small things, and it'll make me incredibly upset and unable to focus on work. The place in which I work in (i.e. a call centre) doesn't feel so stimulating that I'll be distracted.

It's just, sometimes I feel like I'm using his death as a free pass, or that everyone else sees me that way. I try to mention it as little as possible and have only told a handful of people, but it's still a difficult situation nonetheless. I've already taken a day's compassionate leave and have four more remaining, though I don't want to take them as I feel they won't do any good for me personally, given that being at home isn't any better.

I feel like I'm on the precipice of being let go due to it. Only this morning I struggled to pull myself together and cried for half an hour in the toilets, before breaking down also in the staff room, and then another during my actual shift.

How do I go about handling grief at work? It may sound selfish, but I can't afford to lose this job.

I would like to quickly clarify that I am, in fact, not using my dad's death as a free pass, and that that is what it merely feels like.",10Oct2019,1
703,"The initial estimate said my driver was 1 minute away, then it toggled between 3 and 7 minutes for a while, and the gps seemed to be malfunctioning somehow. 

I guess she went to the wrong place, and I was standing out in the cold for 15-20 minutes. 

But she didn’t give up on me, she didn’t cancel and charge me (like some other missing drivers have done), and she was very apologetic for the mixup and the long wait. 

I don’t want to destroy her with a 1 star rating and no/low tip, cuz I’m not a monster and she’s been very polite and thoughtful since picking me up. 

On the other hand, I was standing at the agreed meeting point for 20 minutes wondering where the hell my “3 minutes away” Uber was, I couldn’t reach her, and she didn’t appear to be moving at all. So I’m not gonna give my usual 5 star and excellent tip for sure. 

What’s a good way to say “my driver took significantly longer to arrive than expected, probably due to some gps problems with the app that totally aren’t her fault, and she didn’t give up on me and was very kind and apologetic when she finally arrived”?

706," I don't know when or how did this start but it's been a few years since I've been undermining myself, not in general, but for relationships. Whenever I start liking a girl, the first few days I'm like, I'm the best for her, I can take care of her, I'm mature and responsible enough etc etc. But after that I start having the feeling that I like her because she's cute, smart, fun to hangout with etc etc., but why would she like me? I don't have any qualities that would make anyone like me and that she deserves someone far better than me, and it's probably great that no one's ever/and never will date(d) me 'cause of the jerk that I am. Now there's girl that I like (or I think that I like), for a few days, I was thinking of ways to approach her, talk to her etc., now yesterday I felt that why should I even bother if she's gonna reject me anyway? Then I convinced myself that I'll never be content with myself and might stay afloat in clouds of fake hopes, until she herself tells me that nothing will ever happen between us. So after getting to know her I'll just be like ""Hey I (think I) like you, but I also know that you don't feel the same way, and its's kinda hard for me to accept that, so I wanted to hear it from you"".Now, I know something's terribly wrong with me, but I ain't sure what. But I want my thought process to remain constant, i.e either somehow I make it sure that I'm just another jerk with average looks, not so great personality and low bank balance, or be confident and proud of who I am and stop undermining myself every other day and properly talk to and ask out that girl without fear of rejection and self doubt.",10Oct2019,0

708,"hello reddit, i come here for advice in order to kinda help my friend, we'll call her D. this is gonna be long so apologies, but i'll put a tldr at the end (there's also a lot of fillers, so take it as you will)

so D is 21f and has never had a relationship before but she has liked around 2 boys, liking one of them better than the other. as a little backstory, we met at work but we previously didn't know each other. 

she's shorter than i am (i'd say she's around 155-160 and i'm 164) but we weight almost the same. i am also on the 'fat' side aka i have big thighs but overall i am an hourglass (this comes in hand, i;m not just sharing this useless info for nothing) where she is more of an apple shaped, having big boobs and a tummy. so we met at work and one of the first questions she asked me, beside age and name, was if i ever 'fooled around with a boy and dated anyone' (not the exact same words, we don't speak english as a first language so i translated it to sound as close to what/how she asked, which sounded both like a fifth grader and an elder woman) and i said that i have previously dated, which she seemed shocked to find out, asking me if i looked like this when i first started date, which i more or less did. i did not took offense to it as i have never been insecure about how i looked but what i realized later was that these questions are gonna continue.

she then kept asking me, with a grin on her face, as if i were lying about previously dating, how did i exactly get into relationships and how i met guys. as a side note, i'm introverted but i'm not shy and i've always been pretty confident about how i look and i was never afraid to show interest in someone i liked, which again was a shock to D. she thought that all 'fat' (sometimes her idea of 'fat' changes so that's why i put it in brackets) girls are insecure and that 'some' people (the fat ones) are not meant to have relationships because 'no boy likes a fatty' and that 'some are just meant to be single forever'. 

i kinda got that she has 0 soft skills and was pretty awkward around all of us and made some jokes that came across as 'i'm making fun of this thing about me so you won't' and overall just insecure. she constantly put others down and whenever someone heavier had a bf she would talk shit about them and how they 'are uglier than she is but still managed to date someone', especially if the guy was skinnier and more conventionally attractive. it was often when she would say shit like 'i know why boys liked you, you have well defined cheekbones' or something about my lips being 'bigger than hers' but completely dissing my body or saying that it's still somewhat strange because 'boys would rather have a girl with an ugly face than a chubbier girl'. we had some boys at work that me and another friend (22f) befriended so they came around a lot and her bad side was quick to show. she didn't like the guys romantically but really craved male attention so she would often laugh at everything they said, tried to fit in with them by pretending to know the things that they liked and constantly made us, the girls, cringe, mostly because who she was with us vs who she was with them was completely different, going to the extend of her ignoring us or telling us to shut up (which is a theme with her) when we (my 22f, i and the boy friends) laughed together because she felt like we were laughing about her (we weren't, we just made a lot of meme related jokes which she didn't know about). we constantly tried to tell her that she's pretty enough to date (whatever that even means) and that she should see her worth, which she would agree with for like 5 mins and then go back to 'i need to lose weight because men will want to date me so my problems will be resolved' mentality. she has/had some money issues, which i also had, so we kinda got close based on that, but the mentality and the 'i see why boys like you, you have a pretty face/pretty hair/pretty eyebrow' etc (anything BUT my body) continued. her 'diets' didn't last long nor did they actually did anything so to her it was another failure in her finding a bf.

some time passes and we befriend a guy who she starts liking (the 2nd guy i was talking about in the beginning) because 'he's smart and funny' so the ignoring and attempts to flirt start whenever he's around. don't get me wrong, i'm all for 'teenage' ('m aware she wasn't really a teenager at that time, but she acted like one) love, but the guy was just racist, homophobic, misogynistic and overall a fucking cunt. he hated black people (said the n word multiple times after talking to black clients on the phone, called them all ghetto and so on), arabs/middle easterns (i'm also half middle eastern myself), indians, jews, gays, lesbians. you name it and he'll probably hate it. he often made 'jokes' about the holocaust, arabs, women and other things like that but not much else. you can call me a snowflake or whatever, but someone constantly asking you if your father abused you or why you're not wearing your hijab and saying that it's because 'you're a slut' kinda makes you get over the person fast, so i got tired of him rapidly and i started shutting him down, but not D, oh no. she was eating every piece of shit he was spilling and was so focused and so into it, as if he was speaking some universal truth and she was getting enlightened. i don't even think people looked at MLK when he was giving speeches the same way she looked at that guy when he was saying some fucked up shit. 

her 'crush' continued so we just told her to approach him and ask him or a date or something but the 'fat people don't date' mentality came in again so it again kinda fell on me and whenever the guy came around it was another 'A. (me) you're so lucky to have dated despite being chubby' or 'you;re so lucky to have find someone that's into you' and other stupid shit that made me feel like i was Quasimodo or some other hideous creature of the night that somehow managed to get some guy with poor vision to date her and ignore how she looked. i tried to ignore it and we again started with 'everyone has a different type of beauty, so you don't have look a certain way to date' but the response way 'well, i;m not gonna care when i'm skinny' but she never lost the weight so she never approached the guy. she then got tinder and got matched with someone and we decided that it would be best if i were to talk instead of her (she rarely responds and can barely hold a conversation, she often said that if she doesn't know how to answer or doesn't like something she will just ghost the person) and the guy was really nice and seemed really caring but guess what? she was not interested, he was 'too nice and too boring' for her.............. we told her that it's okay to not like someone but at least to let me tell him that she's not interested rather than start ghosting him. well, guess what happened... she started ghosting the hell out of him and that was that, or at least we thought. 

the guy friend (not the guy she liked) and i got really close (not romantically) and she began saying shit that made me feel like a whore for having a friend of the opposite sex (because i had multiple at that point, it's just easy for me to talk to people and get close to them, i just don't usually want to) because 'boys and girl cannot be just friends' and that 'boys only want to fuck and leave girls and are never interested in relationships/friendships'............. for someone who made their second male friend at that point she surely has a lot of opinions about what men think. i kinda 'jogged' around EDs around the same time, which she noticed (along with my other female friend who was very supportive of me and took my side whenever someone would joke about me not eating or whatnot) but D was not. she was often mean and joked about me not eating in order to try to fit in with the boys. whatever, i thought, i was trying not to get stressed out so i just let it be but i started losing weight and then the 'you're not eating and losing weight in order for boys to like you' and 'i wish i could stop eating' started. i got over that too, tried my best to keep her on track regarding what an actual relationship should be like and that she should not try to starve herself in order to appeal to a male. good thing is: she never starved herself, bad thing is: the 'fat girls will never date' was in again.

it's been almost 2 years sincer we first met and she still thinks like that despite our efforts to change her, but what made me ask for advice now was a convo i had with her regarding children. i have 45% of one ovary left due to PCOS and endometriosis so my chances of having children are very low, but it's whatever, i'm fine with it at this point, so we talked about this and she told me that i will have children and i won't need to adopt, but i told her that i was fine and that i really want to adopt and try to give some kid a better life but she didn't have any of it. it was really weird, she was both talking about how no one will ever date her because she's fat, to her having her 'dream' family and having 2-3 kids of her own because she doesn't want to 'raise someone else's kid' so i think i asked what any person who hears about her and fat people being forever alone would ask: how exactly will you have a kid if you think you'll be single forever? and her answer fucked me up: she said that she will try to have an one night stand and poke holes in the condom and if the man doesn't want to have sex with her a second time (in case she didn't conceive the first time) she will just continue to pay him until she gets pregnant.......... she also said that she would stay with someone who treats her like shit or cheats as long as she gets a baby, because she doesn't want to be a single mom and wants to have a little version of herself. she then said something along the lines of 'is2g if you end up having like 3 kids of your own and me having none i'll kill myself' which disturbed me but she then laughed. 

how can i try to change her mind and try to convince her that even 'fat' people deserve to be loved and that she should try and seek a healthy relationship instead of just seeking someone who will treat her like shit? i'm running out of ideas and she's 21 now and still has some hope regarding a relationship but said that she will probably become desperate if she will still be single by the time she's 28. i also would want her to stop dragging other people down just because she's insecure about herself. i told her that personality also matters and that she should try and change her personality because she is flawed but lacks the self awareness to realize it and i told her that i'm 100% that she would be a bully if she would have been skinny, to which she agreed, but despite realizing that, she still thinks her personality is perfect and that it's the boys/men that don't look for 'ugly skinny girls'. is there any way in which i can change her perspective on chubby/fat people and overall relationships? 

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; my friend is overweight and insecure about it so she keeps bringing chubby/fat/overweight people who are in relationships down in order to make herself feel better and still somehow thinks that she has a perfect personality but boys just want 'ugly skinny girls' rather than 'cute face but chubby body' girls and would be willing to enter a toxic relationship if it meant that she will be with someone and that she will have a baby. how can i help her change her mentality?",10Oct2019,1

717,"So, I’m not sure if ghosting is the right term for a non-relationship situation, but I ghosted a “job” I had.

Pretty much, during my senior year, last semester of college I got an internship with a financial services company (4 employees) thinking that’s what I wanted to go into. 
I interned until May, then they brought me on (no salary, all commission) to show me the ropes of becoming a financial advisor. First step was to get life and health insurance license. I passed the life test, but took the health twice and couldn’t pass.  Not because I wasn’t capable of remembering the info, it’s just because I wasn’t fully committed.

Then I spent several hundred dollars for my Series 7 books, supplies, and online work. I was studying while trying to get clients for life insurance, which I never got a single client or any leads. My work wasn’t being helpful in showing me how to actually do the job. So I wasn’t making any money, my wife was supporting us, and I wasn’t fully committed. So I got a job doing construction with my dad, while I “tried” to sell life insurance and study to become a FA. 

I stopped going into the office (because I had no clients and studied at home), then I stopped returning calls from my “boss” who originally brought me on and was supposed to teach me the ropes. 

Failing as an insurance salesman, studying for something I didn’t want to do, and never going into the office made me feel like a failure and became SUPER embarrassed to the point I figured ghosting and never showing my face to them was the best option. 

I didn’t have much at the office, but I never went back, stopped returning calls, and avoided all contact. 

My problem is, I live in a smallish city and love to be around town, so I’ve ran into my boss a few times and went to drastic measures to avoid her. I get severe anxiety anytime I’m walking around in public and I’m so mad at myself.

Unrelated, I moved a couple of hours away for my wife’s graduate school but we’ll be moving back to that same city next August. I can’t continue to live my life in fear and anxiety. It’s crippling. I just am so mad at myself for ruining my reputation with them. They are genuinely nice people but I’ve just done a terrible terrible thing. 

Btw, my last contact with them was around December 2017.

I just want to make this right but I’m so scared and my anxiety is always through the roof every time I think of the situation.",10Oct2019,2

719,Hello everyone. So my family is getting concerned with my dad because we are noticing a increasing decline in his memory. Some examples are; I currently can’t drive so I rely on him to pick me up and he consistently forgets to pick me up at school despite us having this routine for about two months now. Even when I remind him he forgets. Another example is he forgets conversations and stories he tells and will tell them multiple times a day. He will forget events that happened and he still forgets the names of friends that I’ve had for 6+ years. And if we ever bring this up to him he gets very angry. Dementia and Alzheimer’s run in his side of the family so it wouldn’t be random. We want to get him to go to a doctor but he’s being stubborn. Should he go or are we (my family) overreacting?

He'd always been the first person to start a conversation. At first I was kind of creeped out by him but I realised he's just nice and friendly. So I mean gradually we didn't talk more but I started to like him I guess. 

He came up to once when saw me looking in his general direction and I was blushing he came up to me and we talked for a few seconds and then the other time I was just flustered.

725,"They were basically the only friends i had as i would have always have a hard time socialising with others however, when we had an argument i become all alone. They were literally my only friends so i was devastated, i still couldn’t believe how my other friend had just left me for the one i argued with. At this point, i was really struggling and sad but thankfully i met some really nice new friends

From that point i started moving forward . However, they were constantly always there to drag and ruin my mood. Whenever they are behind me, they always comment on my clothes, my bag and my body. They do this in a lowkey secretive way but enough so i can hear them. They have code words tht i know are meant for me and one of them always says shit when i walk past or something. I wish they would just leave me tf alone, I’m proud of myself for finally getting guts to leave them completely but insults still hurt. I dont even do anything to them, i have moved on and i just completely ignore them and i don’t throw shade at them at all. They are now basically just a big gang 7-8 people who don’t like me and make me feel worthless, with only two of them being fake nice to me to save their reputation. Some of them don’t even know me as they’re new students but they seemed to hve been influenced. Not only that but ik they hve told my secrets whilst i havent even told a single person theirs.

One day when they walk past and say shit to me i just want to scream all sorts of stuff like how they are fucking ugly inside and out, considerably less good looking than me so idk why they making fun of me when maybe they should look in the mirror- and i just want to comment how the one i argued with only managed to get more friends because of the other extroverted one and how she would suffer like me- or even worse- if she didnt have the extroverted friend. Tbh, when i was in tht circle of friendship i too looked down on others and thought our circle was everything but after i split away from them, i realised how insignificant our circle was and how the people i looked down on were incredibly nice and i saw a new version of life. I developed much more as a person after i left them. They always make fun of others and act like judges to everything.

Also the one i argued with is very rude and comes off strong, she always tries to be like a tsundere u know? Like mean/jokey. She can also be bitchy af and lie a lot. I just want them just leave me tf alone and let me do my own thing. I don’t do anything to them so idk why they do this to me! Worst of all our parents are close with eachother. Not to mention, i go to boarding so i see them a lot.

I REALLY DESPISE THEM OML. My new friends and I aren’t the type to spread hate onto people so we just ignore them. They also call me lesbian just because i have found a new friend, like wtaf? I’m not lesbian, she is just my friend so stop trying to make further fun of me. If anything them two are lesbians, always sticking with eachother eventho both of their attitudes are horrible. I’m terrified for the school party where we will hve to wear dresses, ik they will be making fun of me.

726,"Some background info I would like to include is I am a seventeen year old girl and come from a not so well off home in terms of money, hence why my grandparents have a tenant in the house. Me, my younger brother, and mom live in the same house as my grandparent's. The tenant is a guy in his young twenties and has been taking advantage of grabbing food that is not his, like grabbing some of our milk and small food items. That doesn't really bother me, just ticks me off, but whatever no one wants to tell him anything. Then my mom got her toothbrush stolen from her two weeks ago. She was livid when my grandma found that toothbrush in the tenant's room. What did they do? Nothing! But that's not what I am mad about. My brother, who is a couple years younger than me had been missing one of his new shirts and he forgot where he last saw it. My mom claimed she saw it in the bathroom and tried searching for it in our room. The shirt was nowhere to be found for a month. Until recently my grandma went into his room because he was the only suspect. Turns out he had it in a pile of clothes. The shirt is kinda expensive, but I don't think how much the shirt costs is the issue. What is the issue is that its one's belongings being stolen.

I was sooooo mad when I found this out. No one wants to say anything again! My grandma and grandpa don't want me to say anything because they fear he will leave. REALLY??? I cannot believe they would rather choose a stranger instead of their own grandchildren. If some one steals my brother's things or messes with him, I am not staying quiet. Should I risk having problems with my grandparents or stay quiet? I am leaving for college in less than a year so I don't have to deal with the tenant anymore, so that's the good thing.

TLDR: Relationship failed and I need advice on staying positive

Long version:

The relationship with my SO (not married) is coming to an end after about 6 1/2 years, which is my fault for not investing enough time. She is moving out, and avoided me for a some time before that. Indicating to me that she doesn't love me anymore. Today she called out to me by my name, not nickname (which like never happened before).

Although I still love her, I'm okay with her leaving me, so she can be happy.


I just fear (and to a lesser degree already feel) that I'll become lonely and bitter very fast, as I'm not a very social/outgoing person.I know that I'll overcome the ""I'll never love somebody again"" feeling over time.

I just need advice on how to stay open and positive, so I won't bring to much negativity to my friends or colleagues at work.",10Oct2019,2

The thing is that everytime this happens my mind kinda wanders and makes up things. like very violent things.

Example: my dad telling me to stop complaining about school and not being so stressed (dont be depressed, be happy-.-). i can then imagine things like throwing a cup or my phone against the window and just scream, or picking in a knife and cut myself. or it could just be a friend/classmate being irritating and i imagine shooting them.

i feel ashamed of doing this and i would never acutally go through with any of my thoughts, but it just feels nice having that power in my mind.

My 84 year old grandmother who has been living on her own for around 30 years, has been gradually getting ripped off by my cousin (another grandson).

Things like taking her bank card from her, signing up for mobile phone contracts, credit cards, taking cash she has been given for food, money she was given veterinary Bill's, and then basically rinsing her of her pension each month. 

She is oblivious that anything is wrong and adores this grandson despite what he is doing to her. With what is happening, she has alienated her daughter, granddaughters and my own father/her son is close to giving up. The grandson in question has a history of problems, from drugs to crime, but especially lies. He is 40 years old.

So a few weeks ago, I posted here of the way my art teacher was acting towards me,  but I'm happy to say... She has left the school! 

I wasn't in her class when it happened but what I was told, she was arguing with another student (we’ll call him Sam, he’s an acquaintance of mine) which had been going on since the beginning of class since he came in with his AirPods in. I’m guessing she was already pissed off from dealing with her prior class. 

Once he sat down, she began to pester him about how he spends all the class on his phone and he knows the rules of the classroom about his cell phone. 

He really didn’t want to deal with her so he just put it away, and ignored her. I’m not sure what she said but it made him really upset, so he had flipped the table and tried throwing the chair at the teacher!! 

It was pretty ballsy tbh, and he has been suspended for a week. But when a sub has showed up since Monday, I just learned today she “Retired due to stress” which is what she’s been saying.

737,"I work with a non-verbal 3 year old with autism 5 days a week at a daycare. I am their 1 on 1 teacher. Last week, he was reaching to get into the teacher drawers and another teacher shoos him away. 

At this point, the child becomes frustrated and swings at the teacher. They reply ""Don't hit me.""
The child gets upset and begins to hit themselves in the leg. The teacher then says ""Yeah, hit yourself."" The child begins to hit themselves in the face. The teacher replies ""Yeah, do that."" The child continues to hit themself in the face until I run over and comfort them. The teacher smirked and I walked away comforting the child. 

I reported this to my supervisor and also to the childs parent. The teacher completely denies the situation and says they don't remember. However, later on that day the teacher recanted and says they remember ""telling the child to stop hitting themself"" As a result, we were both put on probation and my schedule was moved so I'm not able to work near that teacher. 

My boss is extremely upset with me and told me that child abuse is defined by hitting or striking a child. They became even more upset with me when I explained that child abuse has sectors; Verbal abuse, Physical abuse, Abandonment, Neglect, and sexual abuse. 

Pretty much it seems like I'm completely in trouble for bringing this to attention to the parent even though this child has been hitting himself in the face every day since this incident. This is something we have been working on very intently. I'm not sure what to do. I'm on probation and it seems like she's threatening my job for telling the parent. 

I'm not sure where to take this from here, because I thought with things like this CPS is to get involved.

Well in a recent relationship that i just messed up, I was hurt by something my partner said and I just took it too personally. I didn't tell her how I felt, instead i bottled it up and expected her to ask me what was wrong to fix the issue. She asked me what was wrong, but i ignored her because i didnt like the way she asked me so i just continued to ignore her. She got mad, which made me more mad and I ended up breaking up with her. I completly regret it but its already too late and she thinks im not ready for a relationship with these issues that i have. Its true, Im not ready, but will i ever be ready? 

This is how i normally deal with problems and I understand that this is not healthy at all. I have plenty of issues that I worry about, mostly confidence and trust issues, but the main point here is that I want to be able to fix these problems and not be afraid to voice my feelings. Im constantly overly sensitive to my partners actions or little things they say. How do I become more secure about myself. Is it even possible to renew the way i think? Is it too late? I just feel like theres no hope.",10Oct2019,2
741,"Hello all,

I am a 26 year old guy who in the span of 10 months has lost the ability to use my left hand, left leg below the knee, walk or do anything that requires both hands. Also have facial droop and trouble chewing.

I thought I had a stroke for months. No stroke. 

So then I started thinking it's ALS. I went to the neurologist about a month after this all started. Because you don't have much time with the docs in the appointment I told her right off the bat- this isn't a stroke- so I'm concerned about ALS. I just wanted to be upfront about my concern, you know? Mistake, I guess.

From that point on I've been treated like a psych patient.

She wrote ""Illness Anxiety Disorder"" in my chart when I was just expressing my very real concern to her. I mean, I can't use my hand! I am falling as a 26 year old guy. I am shuffling like a grandpa.

I'm not gonna get into symptoms- but I have every symptom of ALS and I am now- 10 months in very disabled. 

I can't walk without assistance, had to quit my job, can't shave myself, can barely shower (have to sit) and dress myself. trouble swallowing and speaking.

Neurologist #2 said it was anxiety which caused me to have foot drop (??), and that caused my left hand to dwindle to nothing.

Now, I'm an open-minded guy and know anxiety can cause issues- but muscle atrophy... come on.

So he did a blood test that would measure muscle breakdown - CK level- which came back way off the charts. I had not worked out in weeks (I can't-because I can't move). He said ""oh you must have worked out."" I told him I didn't- mostly because I can't move. He still shrugged it off.

So I trucked on and had neurologist appointment #3.

That was today. I can't walk without assistance so I am literally using my grandmas walker and had my gf assist me with paperwork.

Doctor asked ""hows your anxiety?"" right away. I don't have anxiety. Well- now I do about my health. But never had it before in my life. He also noted clinical findings and brushed them off saying ""all the ingredients to make a cake don't always make a cake."" Meaning ""all your symptoms of terrible disease do not equal said disease."" Ok... well there is no alternative explanation.

I told him I am open to that- open to what anxiety can do but I was not feeling anxious when this came on and I am progressing rapidly. I told him I had to quit work- I loved my job. He didn't take me seriously either. 

I asked to please be referred to an ALS specialist and to repeat the EMG to see if there were any changes because I am just so uncomfortable with the way this is progressing and he told me no to both. 

I can't see the specialist without a referral and can't get an EMG without the order put in.

We've ruled out ALL other diseases. This is either very bad, or ""nothing,"" and as much as I want to believe this is nothing- I know my body. 

So now I don't know what to do. I am 10 months, 3 MRI's, 100s of blood tests, 1 EMG in. 

So I just accept that I am disabled now for ""no reason?"" 

Am I really so crazy that I caused myself very localized paralysis and lab-confirmed muscle wasting?

What do I do when doctors won't refer me to the specialist I would like to see or repeat a test that I need done?

Do I ""push"" them with this- or do I give up and accept I'm crazy?",10Oct2019,2
742,"Okay, I've got a potentially life-changing, maybe even life-ending choice in front of me. What better way to make it than by taking the advice of random Internet strangers? Throwaway for anonymity reasons. 

The short story is that I work at a really, really awesome job. The job itself is fun, the pay is *extremely* good (maybe 2x the market standard for that position), it's in a convenient location for me, it's basically a dream job no matter how you look at it. So why would I want to quit? 

Well, because my co-worker has been literally giving me anxiety attacks every time she's around me. 

This co-worker, let's call her Bitch, is supposed to be my direct supervisor. She's not in any way a manager, it just so happened that she used to do my job before me, but is now in a different position and I do her old job, so it made perfect sense to assign her to me. At first she was perfectly nice, if you don't mind the occasional highly racist or sexist remark from her (which to be honest I don't, I'm not at work to make friends so I don't care if someone is a trash tier human being). It's worth noting that I'm gay, and while I don't exactly have a pride flag on my desk, I'm also not hiding it either because the closet can go fuck itself. Now, I don't know how my problems with her began *exactly* \- might be when she learned I'm gay, might be when she was literally bullying an autistic co-worker and I called her out on it, might be an incident that I have no idea of. Whatever the case, at some point her attitude towards me changed. She stopped saying hi in the morning, she stopped speaking to me unless she *absolutely* needed to (even refusing to answer work-related questions, pretending not to hear me). Her e-mails towards me would be extremely passive-aggressive (for example let's say that I arrived late - she'd write me a wordy e-mail about ""acceptable arrivals at the workplace"", basically reprimanding me despite the fact that it's not her fucking job to do so), and at at least a few points I was literally left unable to do my job because of her lack of communication towards me. 

That wasn't all. She started staring at me, a lot (our desks were next to each other). She'd look at my screen and I'd hear her moan or click her tongue while staring either right at me or at whatever I was doing. As the aforementioned autistic co-worker said, ""she's like a panther waiting to pounce on you"". I ultimately asked one of my bosses to move me into another room, and she implied that this isn't actually the first complaint made about Bitch's behavior. As a result, it was Bitch who was moved and I could stay with the co-workers I'd befriended. Her shitty behavior towards me continued, and ultimately her lack of communication with me led to me missing a deadline - which I was blamed for, by both her and the boss. I was *fuming*. It's like something exploded in me, and I fucked up big time - probably my biggest mistake in the company. I sent her an e-mail very angrily saying ""Yo, look, I get it, you hate me, honestly I hate you, but this shit you're pulling is damaging both of us and you seriously gotta fucking cut it out"". I didn't swear, but it was a highly unprofessional thing of me to do which I did in a fit of anger and which I basically instantly regretted. That e-mail got me called into a meeting with her and the boss in which basically the entire fault was put on my shoulder. Bitch's narrative was that she had to move away from the room because everyone was sexist at her (obviously not true), that I'm basically a shit-tier employee and don't even deserve to be there. She laid out a lot of criticisms towards me (some of which justified, most of which pure bullshit like the aforementioned sexism thing), and when I brought up the shit she did like bullying my co-worker she denied it all. I ended up having to call him into the room just to get a bit of support, because boss took her side. I was warned. Deservedly so, IMHO. 

For the next few months things went fine, and I learned to work around her ignoring me. Basically whenever Bitch has a problem with my work she goes and complains to my co-worker, who in turn relays the message to me like we're in fucking kindergarten. I'm completely out of the loop on most projects unless I explicitly ask someone about them, because the shit I'm supposed to be told that actively affects my work and my output is kept from me due to Bitch's wish to not associate with me (which is 200% shared, but, y'know, an e-mail would be cool when absolutely necessary). Again - her behavior is actively impacting my job and the quality of my work. Then the big bombshell happened - I was told we'd be moving into an open office instead of one with rooms, and I'd be sitting next to her. I asked politely if I could just work from home or be in a separate room. One of my bosses literally yelled at me for it IN FRONT OF MY CO-WORKERS despite me repeatedly trying to defuse the situation by saying stuff like ""Okay, cool, we'll discuss this later in private"", only to be met with shit like ""NO, WE WON'T, THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER, WHEN YOU PAY EVERYONE'S SALARY YOU'RE GOING TO SAY WHERE THEY SIT"". 

The move is supposed to happen soon, and my anxiety and depression have skyrocketed. I'm getting panic attacks, and I'm suicidal again for the first time since 2017. This is more than just me disliking her (which I do, very much) - this is her being actively detrimental to my mental health. The thought of her being next to me again, of staring at me, of having to listen to her voice... It's absolutely destroying me mentally. Work has become a chore because all I can think about is dreading the moment when I'll be sitting next to her again, and it's fucking me up. I don't know what to do. 

Do I just fucking swallow it and deal with it? Do I push through hoping my mental health won't deteriorate to the point where I try to kill myself again? Or do I just quit? I have SOME savings, I can probably last for about 3-4 months without too much issue. If I try extra hard and pinch every possible penny (cutting meals to 1 a day for example) maybe I can last about 6 months, until I find another job that's right for me. But chances are almost 100% that I won't find anything that pays nearly enough. It really is the money and only the money that's holding me back. I don't know what to do. Option A could end in me killing myself, Option B might end with me running out of money and still killing myself. I don't want to kill myself though, and ideally I'd be able to work from home or from another room, but that's almost guaranteed to not happen now.

My father is English and my Mother is Scottish and I somewhat take pride in both sides of my upbringing, however, increasingly I am being mistreated for being Scottish; it started as an odd joke here and there but it’s surmounted to almost constant comments and jokes among everyone I know, even my teachers at school.

I am somewhat used to receiving abuse for my background, as I’ve told to ‘go back to my own country’ whilst in Scotland for example, but the almost constant comments is somewhat grating. I have tried to sort it out but it is not taken seriously.

744,"Hello all,

 I don't really have anyone to ask for advice on this particular topic so I'm reaching out to get feedback from those who have done something similar.

 Basically I have a unique career opportunity to go overseas for 1 year. While gone I would have drastically reduced contact with my wife and son (10years old). The opportunity is excellent for personal and professional development and would assist me in meeting ambitious career goals. Financially it is a huge benefit as well.

 The downside is I am afraid of what or how significant an impact this will have on my wife and son. We have a strong and happy relationship and I am wondering if this would be a risk to that. Is it worth the risk? 

On one hand we only get one life and it's something I have always wanted to do...on the other, I love my family and dont want to bring any hurt to those relationships.

My wife is supportive but also understandably scared of the unknown.

I would appreciate any thoughts or input on this especially from military or police personnel who.have deployed overseas.

Thanks!",10Oct2019,1

 my waterbottle kept getting moved to rooms i didn't ever go into, or up onto places such as the fireplace. i could have just forgot where i set it

 the dogs kept getting up and growling at the door of the parents room. they were weird dogs and the owners said they would do stuff like that occasionally.

all of my belongings were moved from one side of the room i was in to the other side when i went out to make dinner (30 min time window) i have no explanation for this, since it was everything i had and it was just sitting on the bed even though i left it spread out all over the room because OP sloppy.

the room i slept in had a hall wall leading into it which i could see through the whole house, super unsettling. and the final night i saw something move across the hall 20 ft from where i was in bed. one dog was in a crate and the other was with me. scared the crap out of me, and i didn't sleep that night. ( it could have been an illusion from a cars headlights or a hallucination though)

also the day i was leaving the door to the parents room kept on getting opened even after i shut it multiple times... also when the owners came home they asked why their room door was open even though i closed it before i left. could have been a dog jumping on the door.

also coincidences that occured: ac broke, bird killed itself on the window and hot water decided to stop working meaning no hour long showers...

&amp;#x200B;

they asked me to house sit again and i don't know if it is worth it, maybe these are all just coincidences and i'm looking to deep at it. i was thinking about having one of my buddies hang with me for a day just in case. i am open to any and all suggestions about this",10Oct2019,5

761,"Hi everyone. I currently am a 6th year medical student in Kosovo. In a year hopefully I will graduate. I just came back home from Work and Travel program in the US and I really loved it there. I worked there for 3 months and after that my boyfriend came from Sweden to travel with me. We are both thinking of moving to US, me as a doctor and him as a software engineer.

 However, in order to get a residency there, I need to pass USMLE tests that have 3 steps and it takes up to 2 years. If I fail once, there's no point on trying again. I am scared that I will fail and I'm just prioritizing US, so I am thinking of a career change- programming. The benefits of it are that in two years I can succeed and find a decent job and at the same time I can work together with my boyfriend.

767,"Wasn't sure where to post this but it's been bugging me so much for the past... I don't even know how long... A year? Probably more as a duller thought in the back of my head. It seems to have been getting worse as I start to face turning 30, which for the longest time I was like, ""Pfft, not a big deal."" But with it about three weeks away, I seem to be putting a lot of pressure on myself.

My life has never been that difficult on the grand scheme, mild bullying in school, lost my father when I was 23, a bad relationship for a few years - but nothing exceptional, these things happen in life and they're about the only things that stand out as memories that sting. I have my own place, a wonderful partner, a job that pays well, I enjoy and am respected at. I'm doing the job I wanted to do as a kid.

Yet somehow I feel empty. I was high strung as a kid and set myself goals of: house, partner, job and this was when I was around the age of 6 (I wish I was joking, my family still tells stories). I've achieved them and should feel relieved I made it but instead I just feel lost. I have no ambition anymore, no goal. I only just realised the latter point today and got to thinking; do people actually have goals? Have I somehow lost my way?

I still see my friends, still have a good time and laugh but the things -I- enjoyed feel stale, the hobbies I've had smouldered out. Others around me seem to be starting families but my partner and I do not want children, something we agreed on very early on when trialling our compatibility. So now all that's left is to keep things stable till the end?

On a day to day basis my head is full of so many questions lately; Questions I do not have the answers to and cannot obtain the answers to either, yet expend so much effort on them. What if scenarios, things humanity hasn't answered, things where the answers aren't straight forwards or opinionated. It gets exhausting. And whilst I haven't felt suicidal (at least I don't think so, either way no means for concern), part of me wonders how much easier/quieter it would be if I could 'turn it all off' (quotes because I myself don't know what that means).

She just seems to be under constant stress and doesn't have the courage to divorce him and kick him out.

He was already reported for domestic abuse like half a year ago. Back then he was supposed to be out of the apartment for 2 months in this period of time my mom was supposed to divorce him but she felt sorry for him because he's an alcoholic and he promised that he'd change. Surprise, surprise he didn't. He came back in the house after like a week and a half and yet again my mom didn't do the right thing and call the police on the douche.

778,"  
Hi Reddit, 

  
This might be a bit lengthy, it’s hard to sum up because it’s been going on for years. 

  
I’m the youngest of 3 daughters (25, 27 and 29). 

  
Dad works at a fancy construction company and he’s one of the top guys for the business so he leaves for work at 4am, and goes to bed for 6pm. 

  
Mum stays at home, she did to raise us, and now raises my autistic nephew (more on that later) so she has her hands full outside of school hours. 

  
Oldest sister (nephews Mum) is a heroin addict and doesn’t work, she tries to get better but lapses after a few weeks, has the typical addiction issues and lifestyle issues that come with it, it’s very hard on her and we all try to be supporting, but when the addiction kicks in she becomes manipulative and has stolen several thousands of pounds in property and money from our parents, and up to £3,000 in property from me. We all love her, but it’s very hard when she's at her worst. She can be the loveliest and most caring person one day and the absolute worst person the next day. She doesn’t want professional help, she thinks she can do this alone, and we’ve tried to force her, it’s only made things worse. So we try to support her and edge her in the right direction, it works most of the time and has been improving over the last year. 

  
Middle sister also doesn’t work. After Mum and I looking in to autism to help my nephew we think she has a lot of similar traits, and she thinks so too, but doesn’t want to go through the process to find a diagnosis because her depression and social anxiety is so bad. She’s almost housebound, only goes to the shop (5 min walk) if it’s with someone. She plays a lot of video games and streams, thinks she can make a living from it one day, which means she doesn’t need a job, which means she doesn’t necessarily need to get help or support for whatever it is (if anything) that she has. Because of the total lack of socialising she comes off as very argumentative and abrasive. I’ve had complaints from our friends over the years, I just tell them she’s not used to certain things and doesn’t mean to come off like that, so to not take it to heart.

  
As for me I work full time and have since I was 16 (along with being 16 &amp; 17 in full-time college, I did night and weekend shifts at weddings). Since then I’ve been in a 9-6 job, so Dads out or asleep when I’m home, we never see each other. Mums putting my nephew to bed and joins Dad, rarely see her, middle sister is already streaming games, don’t see her, oldest sister is out (no idea where or for how long). 

  
My family don’t generally socialize much because they tend to have a lot to deal with, so their manners are nearly non-existent. They can be very unfair and demanding. Like I do more chores because they “trust me to do it because my sisters won’t” and I paid x5+ more in rent and household bills (oldest sister paid none, middle sister paid £100 per month) which I was fine with, renting alone can cost roughly that.

  
Now to the drama… Oldest sister has been violent with me in the past, worst of it was I couldn’t talk for over a week and wasn’t allowed to college or work because she strangled me and my neck was covered in bruises. Honestly thought in that moment that I was going to die. This was done because she was in my room going through my console video games (I only buy collectibles, the £100+ stuff) and I asked her what she was doing, she said nothing just wanted to draw stuff, and I asked her to leave, she started yelling that I’m accusing her and I said “no I just got home and want to get out of my uniform” and then launched at me screaming that I’m a liar and making her depressed…

  
Middle Sister isn’t violent, but she likes gossip… She kept taking my food (because I’m home at weird times I cook for myself and therefore have to buy my own food by house rule, it’s kept in my own cupboard), she denies it but leaves the rubbish out with her rubbish that she used cooking… When this happens she texts my boyfriend and messages online friends about how I’m bullying her, I’m a liar, total waste of space, if I say I’m upset they shouldn’t listen I’m only seeking attention, and that they shouldn’t be with me/my friend, if I ask why they should “hit me to teach me a lesson”. I was hit once, but that was when I was 15 (her 17) and by her friends. All my friends and any boyfriend has blocked her. 

  
So – I learnt what not to do by watching my sisters. I generally don’t talk much (I get concerned comments from colleagues sometimes for not talking much), I keep to myself, I don’t really socialise much and if I do my family do not know who with, and I focus on work and study. I’m the only one to finish school with B’s+ and go to and finish college with A\*’s as well as have a job and win free university study from my job. I’m very proud for what I’ve accomplished at my age, but I never talk about it in case it upsets anyone. 

  
To the now – the issues got very bad recently, Middle sister was causing gossip and I wasn’t reacting this time. She was basically very loud past midnight and I wake up at 6am for work, I asked her nicely to be quiet in a text. She swore and insulted me, I said I’ll get Mum and Dad involved and she said “fucking do it, I dare you” so I did. And they told her to be quiet past 10. So the gossip started. Thing is - I keep my messages polite so if my boyfriend asks why she was so explosive... He can see I was trying to be nice... And also my family tries to record each other's arguments, so I try to not be verbally argumentative either... 

  
Mum has no idea how to calm her down, so she takes her side. And even starts to threaten to harass my boyfriend (who was already being harassed by Middle Sister) and Mum even said she’s going to contact my boss. Middle Sister was avoiding me for weeks, refused to be in the same room as me, and whenever Mum and Dad mentioned me she’d go in a rant about me being a cunt. So Mum and Dad want me to fix it (again). This time I feel like I did nothing wrong, I kept it polite, and I want to focus on work to get away from this chaos, so I moved out suddenly. 

  
Today, I went over to collect some last items. Dad hasn’t spoken to me in weeks, Sisters haven’t either. Mum comes in and says “you’re such a fucking disappointment and a useless cunt, you know that right? You should of moved all this out when you first left” I’m taken back… Try to be polite and say “well… I’m working full time and coming over when I can” Then she says “you’re so fucked up, you’re a such a disappointing child” and then I got angry and said “well I’m your daughter so you must be a disappointing Mum. And at least at 25 I’m independent” (a comment towards my sisters who depend on our parents, I was angry and feel awful for saying it).

  
She said she finally wants nothing to do with me and hates me. 

  
In the past when we’ve had an argument she’s said in anger “having a third child was such a mistake, it shouldn’t be this hard” and that was over buying birthday presents… They typically skip mine anyway, my nephews and sisters are around the same time. And when we do argue I always ask why those things are said, they never give an explanation just a “because of how you are”, but I’m never around, and when I am they’re all asleep or busy, so I’m quiet and in my room… 

  
I feel like trying to achieve more should of gotten my parents love, but instead they always go to my sisters who have constantly needed their support with mental health or drug/alcohol abuse (alcohol issues from both sisters) maybe they think I’m so independent they can focus away from me? But I have no idea what I did to deserve this bitter or hateful treatment, maybe not being able to spend time with them? 

  
Whatever it is I don’t think I should care anymore. They’ve not changed in almost 15 years of acting this bitter and I need to detach from them, but I can’t help but feel awful at the idea and always go back, only to be verbally abused or threatened. And they’re literally only nice when they want money from me…

  
Next year I’m getting a mortgage, and due a big promotion at work. I want to go through these big parts in life without being so depressed over how my family treat me. 

  
Does this ever get any easier? Has anyone else detached from family and how hard was it? Are there any coping things I can try to help? Should I try talking to them again? Should I go to therapy?

  
TLDR – I have a bad relationship with my family and they emotionally abuse me every time we talk or see each other, I need to detach and get on with my life, but it’s extremely upsetting. Any advice on how to make it easier?",10Oct2019,1

I don’t play sports because I’m not athletic, I’m not taking any AP classes because I’d rather not have tons of homework every night. I got an invitation to the National Honor Society at school but didn’t fill out the application because I didn’t care enough to do it, when my parents found out they were upset that I didn’t jump at the opportunity, they said it would look good on college applications but I really just don’t want to do any of that. Although I am planning on applying to college when I graduate high school, I’m only really doing so because without college I feel like I have no chance at getting a good job. But am I ruining my chances of getting into college by not pushing myself? Am I wrong for wanting to just stay home and play video games like the kid I am instead of getting community service hours or joining clubs? If it makes any difference, I do work part time in fast food, but that’s just because I like to have extra spending money, I don’t have a savings account, so most of my paychecks go toward things that I enjoy.

784,"Alright, so let's say about two months ago this guy asked me out. We met on the first day of school this year, and when we met each other we just clicked. We had similar interests and tastes, we were already like best buds. I was proud to say he was exactly like the male version of me, actually, he could've been, I think. Let's call him Ruby. Two weeks after that day, randomly, in a class period, one of my friends was like, ""Woah, I ship you guys."" I jokingly refuted back with the ""Too gay for that"" response, I hadn't told either one I had a girlfriend. Ruby then just decided to go and say it. ""VocalsVocaloid, I like you."" once he said that, I was utterly and truly disgusted. I didn't know what to say, all I thought at the time was ""Please tell me you're joking."" he kept asking and the reply kept being a ""No."" until I just told him I already had somebody, in to which he responded with ""Who?"", I didn't tell him, though. He finally went away, earphones in ear, looking pretty depressed. A part of me felt bad, but another part of me told me that he deserved it. At the end of the day he apologized for it, I was pretty dismissive with the whole thing. He asked if we could still be friends, ""I don't know."" I said. Like -- I felt so weird because he confessed to me. I was angry. He was being so nice about the whole thing now. And a couple days after that, he kept his distance around me, (pretty sure it was because he knew I was mad), and again asked again if we could be friends, which I responded to with a ""Yes."" I would've just told him to buzz off or something, but the thing is. I know his mom. I don't wanna hurt her or anything for not wanting to be friends with her son. He's annoying, I hate looking at it, I hate seeing him, I hate his presence. He's only bearable when he talks to other people. He's like this weight on my shoulders. He follows me around every chance he gets. My friend even said that, on the day we met, he didn't have many friends for some irrelevant reason I can't seem to recall. What should I do to get him off my back? Am I being too harsh about this?",10Oct2019,1
785,"I started drawing really young (since I was 8) and have been off and on with drawing.

Last month I got into it again and wanted to do digital art so my roommate  (who is also my best friend) gave me a drawing pad they had (it's pretty cheap and they only got it to design their tattoo so they didn't need it anymore) 

Everything was going good but since a few days ago they keep criticising everything I do which I don't mind but when I say ""oh I'm not finished I know it looks weird right now but I know where this is going you'll see when I am done"" 

They automatically say ""no no stop you're doing it wrong"" then proceed to come over and start drawing for me and it always never looks good but they try to excuse their mistakes by saying the table is wonky or something. 

Anyways it's just constant ""I'm right your wrong"" attitude 

But it got worse yesterday. 

Yesterday they said because I delete my mistakes on a computer and don't know what progress I have made I should just draw from a book since I am a beginner and they know better because they're a ""senior"" (just to let you know this person never draws and they think they're a senior because they did art in GCSE (highschool) and are older than me- they think because they're older they know more about art) 

But even if they do know more about art I said I'm having fun doing what I am doing and I don't want my main focus to be learning but to just have fun and I understand seeing my progress would be good for me to see but as I said Im not looking to do that right now. 

Anyways now every time they see me using the drawing pad they always go on a rant and just won't leave me alone. I have told them countless times I just want to do what I want to do, thanked then for their advice and said I'll give it a go after I finished my drawing. 

But they're so insistent. They always have something to say and will go on about it forever until I do what they are telling me to- in this case start picking up paper and starting a drawing THEN they will leave for about 10 mins and then  check up on my drawing. 

Does anyone have any idea why they're doing this? It's really annoying and makes it hard to have fun. 

Also does anyone have any advice on how I should talk to them? I forgot to mention they have Asperger's  and communicating can be hard at times though even when I am blunt they still don't consider what I am saying when they think they are right.

It’s day 6 and I’ve noticed that the shaking has gone, insomnia is pretty much gone, and same with hot/cold flashes, and heart palpitations.

Only symptoms that still remain is rebound anxiety, my 5 senses still seem out of wack and vision problems. I feel like I’m in a dream and have poor concentration.

Lately, I've been struggling to handle everything. Extreme detachment to everyone and everything including life itself. I've felt suicidal before, and I've felt apathy but this is a whole other level where all my emotions have become extremely dulled and my ability to think past a single moment is difficult.

In fact, I'm struggling to type this right now. I'm in the U.S. so medical aid and mental health support is not readily available.

I'm afraid I'm going to do something I'm going to regret - even though I don't know what *that* thing is. I don't think I'm suicidal but my impulses are becoming near impossible to control.

801,"The school year just started and I just moved here and don’t know many people. 

I promised myself that I would do a bunch of clubs, but other than college credits, they seem dumb and pointless to me. Honestly I wish college applications only looked at grades instead of clubs because I would be perfectly fine if my whole life surrounded my grades. 

Everyone has all these friends and prance around with their little spirit day outfits while getting asked out to hoco, while I’m just stuck eating lunch in the bathroom everyday with no friends and no one to talk to. My parents ask me how my day was and if I’ve made new friends or not. And I always have to lie to them and say yes so that they won’t think I’m a loser.

Every time I step outside of the club room, I think about going in, but I change my mind every time. I don’t fucking feel like going into a room full of people I don’t know and doing a stupid ass icebreaker. 

Everyone assumes that if you don’t do clubs that you are lazy or an underachiever. But they are too stupid to realize that there are introverts in this world and not everyone is talkative and And even though that’s not who I am, I feel like I am starting to form into that lifestyle.",10Oct2019,1
802,"Hey there! I (24F) been with my partner (25M) coming up on five years and things are starting to come together for us in our lives. I've had a tough time for the past ten years with depression and anxiety, some of it resulting from trauma from events that occured in my late teens, early twenties. Due to the unstable nature of my line of work (year-by-year contract no matter where I work - working with children with additional needs), we will not be granted a mortgage and so my parents are graciously offering to buy us a home with a portion of my father's inheritance - they're maybe a couple of weeks off finalising the sale of land. This is so we can pay them back without fear of repossession if we lose a job as well as zero interest being charged. We've been saving for a few years to offset how much we have to loan off my parents and to be honest, we've had things very cushy over the past few years living at home and not contributing anything (our parents refuse any help with bills) as rent in Ireland has gotten ridiculously expensive and rental property is difficult to come by. 

We're hoping that we might be able to go looking for a home together in early 2020 and perhaps we might also get engaged at around Christmas/New Year time. We've always wanted to get married, it was just a matter of waiting until things started to fall into place (needed to pass driving test, get promotions at work, etc.) and we had some savings built up. But I cannot shake this irrational anxiety about getting engaged and telling our parents even though our parents pretty much expect us to get married. We keep putting it off and it's upsetting and probably making my anxiety worse. 

I guess it also doesn't help that we are in a long-ish distance relationship - it takes about 80 minutes to drive to each other's houses. Our parents have met informally a couple of times and formally once. It is expected that my boyfriend will move to the same county I live in as property is more affordable and there are better job opportunities for him here. I feel the logistics of announcing our engagement is going to be complicated because we both work weekdays, our mothers can work on weekends and getting engaged seems to involve a ridiculous amount of planning to align everyone's work schedules so that we can equally involve our families in the celebration in the immediate days after getting engaged. I would have loved a more 'spontaneous' proposal but I don't see that working out so well if our parents are working and wouldn't be able to go for dinner all together the next day or something. Hence the idea of Christmas/New Year.

The prospect of moving out is also causing me a huge deal of anxiety and stress and it's starting to dampen down any sense of excitement I have about it. From selecting somewhere to live, to all the legal stuff, any potential renovations and decorating, to clearing out my room and moving all the stuff I'm keeping to the new place... I'm making a mountain out of a molehill and can't seem to take a step back and see it in stages rather than a whole process. 

I basically have become very accustomed to a comfortable life because of my anxiety - I don't want to lose/leave my job because I find interviews very difficult (often start to get tearful during them). If I can get my partner to make inquiries/do the social stuff in day-to-day life, I will. I basically avoid everything that makes me very uncomfortable and anxious at the moment and I know that's hindering me rather than helping. So obviously two big life stages on the horizon is terrifying to me despite me very much wanting them. 

*TLDR:*
Want to get engaged and move out but struggle hard with my anxiety over everyday stuff and I'm very overwhelmed with overthinking all the stages I have to get through before achieving those goals. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with these kind of things, maybe using the info I've given to help with how to proceed? I am tired of struggling with my anxiety. I had counselling a couple of years ago but the therapists seem to hone in on the trauma I've experienced rather than offer any strategies on how to deal with my current struggles. Even if you don't feel qualified to offer advice on anxiety, maybe you could help me out with breaking things down into steps because I can't see the forest for the trees right now.

Thank you so much in advance.",10Oct2019,1
803,"I run a nonprofit. I founded it in memory of my daughter who was murdered by her exboyfriend. Finding her like that broke me. I found the strength to live again through my husband son other daughter and grandson. 

When the story of my daughter hit the news I began being contacted by victims and aggressors. Some contact was to offer condolences, others was to say her story changed them. Then thier were the ones looking for help. I began to help. I ended up filing for 501c3 and it was approved in February. We have a few clients and have made a difference in many people's lives.

The thing is I don't have a college degree. I learned everything I needed to do this online and with library books. People see me as a professional and I'm trying to be that. I have a board and they help me with big decisions but they don't have as much knowledge on nonprofits as I do.

Next week we have a very important meeting with the executive director of a huge organization. I'm scared of failing. I already started writing an agenda but then I realized I don't know what is appropriate to propose to this person. Can I ask his organization to be a sponsor to ours? To help us whenever we need to make copies of workbooks for our client classes? Or to make copies of our brochures? 

These are what we need help with because my printer runs out of ink too quickly. And the local copy shops are expensive. We also just ran out of funds because we helped so many people.

812,"In need of legal advice.  Someone I know was baited by police in another state on the grindr app.  My friend sends ""waving hello"" emoji to countless profiles. One person said hello back and eventually said he was 14.  From what I understand, the conversation went multiple places while the person on the other end baited my friend for a week or so, making innocent small talk. They talked about his mom, school, friends, sex and whether he was lonely and in need of support. My friend made the mistake of sending a dick pic. He stated it is not a crime to be friendly or offer advice in the LGBT community. There are many couples with large age gaps in our community. After many conversations the alleged underage person grew impatient and pushed to meet up. My friend told him it was a bad idea and they stopped talking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Several weeks later my friend received a phone call from the State Police asking him to meet up to give a statement, as someone in that neighboring state was trying to open credit cards in his name. My friend has had online accounts compromised as well has had credit cards stolen.  Although he suffers from diagnosed severe anxiety, depression and agoraphobia, he felt it was important to travel a half hour from home in order to help the supposed investigation. Upon reaching the agreed upon location, he prepared to give a quick statement and be on his way. Instead, several police officers exited vehicles and proceeded to cuff and arrest him. He was then taken to another state police barracks where he was booked, searched, fingerprinted, photographed and his phone was confiscated. He was then taken to a courthouse even further away from home, deeper into the neighboring state. There was a brief court hearing after being placed in a holding cell for several hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

All these events have caused significant trauma to my friend, who was already having a really hard time finding enough work despite his illness. 

&amp;#x200B;

After doing research online, I see that this sort of thing has been happening all over the country and now I'm concerned that he was baited by police to perform an act he would not have done.  He has no prior criminal record at all until this.  He has never met up with a minor.

I knew I was struggling a bit at the time, but I was trying to work my way back the best I could (Not that they justify the drop in productivity by any means, but I was in a rough patch mentally/physically at the time and my development partner was notorious for playing favorites - I shared him with a few other associates, and we all noticed the ones who shared his alma matter received a little extra attention and better feedback.) I didn't fight the transition very hard, and just told myself it was a learning opportunity, a chance to try something new, and to explore a new city (since it meant a relocation as well).

Fast forward to now, I'm in relatively better place mentally/physically (or at least managing it better) and doing a lot better performance wise (based off comments from my manager/supervisors). That being said, I really did like my old position and felt I was a better match for that department. Not to mention, my current position requires me to move every 1-2 years which I am not a big fan of (which is one of the reasons I picked my previous department). To top everything off, I'm currently at a company retreat and I feel like a failure compared to my old coworkers.

Backstory: I met RS at an after-party following a stadium rock concert we both attended. I quickly learned how she was powered as if by nuclear reactor, and her sweetness combined with her staggering intellect had me won over in a second. We spent the night dancing, drinking, talking, and stumbling around the city before going back to her hotel room. I left around mid-day after we spent the morning exactly how you imagine.  
We started texting, and having already been around the bases nothing really held the flirting back. Hearts and winky emojis were flying left and right. She lives in a different city, and given how we are both busy with work, texting is at this point all we -can- do. It becomes abundantly clear that she is quite infatuated with me. A few days in she lets me know the following:

**She's in the middle of a divorce to a man she's still living with.** Her soon to be ex-husband (EH), whom she refers to only as her ex, is moving out. Things aren't perfect, but they're just very good friends.

Okay, I figure. They are no longer in a relationship like that, so what RS and I are doing is just dandy. We meet for a date (not sex) after about a week in a city between our homes for a few hours, and sparks are flying. No awkwardness, no tension, just laughing and intimacy. During this time she tells me of how one of her old boyfriends once assaulted her with a knife after their relationship.  
This was about a week ago. Now last night I just learned a new detail that complicates everything:

**RS is actively hiding our relationship from EH**. Duh, you're probably thinking. Naive as i am, I had not considered this, and here lies the crux of the issue. She has made it clear that the secrecy is partly related to her previous experience with with assault, and doesn't want to repeat that escapade. At this point, i realize that she has never told me EH's name. Given that she is smarter than Holmes, my money is on her wanting to prevent a way of EH learning of what RS and I are doing.

I have another date planned with RS in 6 days, which will be a sleepover in my city. Sex is heavily implied.  
I don't want the title of homewrecker. I know I already slept with RS, but at that point I had no idea she was married. If I take this further, I will be doing so knowing that it is behind EH's back.

# A few facts of note:

**I don't care for sex.** I can take it or leave it. To me, it's more like a service I'll perform to please someone i like.

**On paper RS and I have little in common.** She has a prestigious career based on a long education, and is 12 years my senior. I work a low-paid job at the bottom of the ladder that I'm working myself up from slowly.

**Monogamy has never made sense to me**. It is not something I would ever pursue, but I get that it's important to some people. No judgement here.

Based on her version of events (which I trust), R**S's marriage to EH is only so because the paperwork is taking its sweet time being filed**, and he's moving out in about a month. In other works, a marriage only on paper (and not for long).

**I might very well be the rebound.** Just divorcing, and falling fast and hard into a new relationship with a much younger man? Yea the signs are there. I am aware of this, and am also fine with it. As mentioned above, the traditional relationship doesn't appeal to me anyways. If I am just part of her moving-on process, I'm happy I can help.

**So: What do I do reddit?**

I am looking for the plan of action that will hurt the least for all parties.

For **myself**, I don't want to waste time waiting around for paperwork to be filed. But, I am the lowest priority here.

For **EH**, I don't want to hurt him by aiding his sortof-wife's infidelity. I realize that everything I know about him (which is little more than described in this post), I know through RS.

Most of all, I don't want to hurt my lovely **Rocket Scientist**. I'm afraid that any attempt I could make to slow things down would be misconstrued, and I really don't want to push her away or hurt her. She -really- wants me, and I would hate to give the the impression that those feelings are one-sided.

Thanks for reading this far, I'll take any and all feedback!",10Oct2019,0
832,"I wish I had talked to that guy I was into today. He was talking to this girl he hangs out with in class though and my social anxiety spiked and I bailed. I did say bye to him as I was leaving but I want to get to know him more. We used to hang out some in my freshman year (I’m a senior now) but he changed majors and I don’t really remember what happened other than the fact that we stopped talking. I really wanna hang out with him again. He seems nice to me still. How should I go about this? I’ve only got two classes with him and he always sits and talks to somebody else in those classes. I’m very great at 1 on 1 but not in groups really. It’s weird. So should I try to awkwardly enter his group conversations with the other people or not? They’re always women so I feel like if I tried to chat him up near them, then they might try to metaphorically claw at me in a cat fight sort of way. Help?

I’m a 21F in college if that helps. And it’s always only one other person, who’s a girl. And I don’t wanna end up getting into a fight with them or something.

I posted this to a different subreddit initially but was downvoted and got no help. I don’t want to be downvoted. I want somebody to tell me if I’m being a goddamn dumbass or not.",10Oct2019,6
833,"I’m the breadwinner to a disabled man and I just keep spending and spending and hopelessly trying to make him happy. Also he feels extra bad from his condition and sad that he can’t provide so he often wants gifts to make him feel better. I feel the same but guess who has to spoil me, me, not him, because he can’t. I try to talk to him about how unhappy it makes me and he takes it very personally so I internalize my feelings to the point of feeling suicidal. Growing up some terrible things happened to me and one of my parents shamed me for going to therapy for them and the other parent would scream and punish and use the information against me when I opened up. I spent my whole childhood internalizing feelings due to that and now I feel like I have to do it in my adulthood. I also have some resentment because of how hard I work and my partner just gets to lay around. I feel incredibly suicidal and my partner’s response is to get me on medication, not to listen to me, or when I do talk to him, make it about him because of how touchy of a subject it is. He’s hypersensitive to his disability because he can’t control it and we are still waiting for government assistance since he can’t work much, it’s just frustrating. We have a plan to start a business from home together eventually so he can rest as needed but it’s just hard. I used to date a guy who was really lazy and I paid all our bills and he took a lot of advantage of me and my work ethic which really messed me up, so it’s triggering to that situation. How do I just get over it? I feel very alone.",10Oct2019,1
834,"I'm a part-time student in school, and one of my classmates I loosely knew passed away last year. She was well-loved in our town and there has been an outpouring of grief and support. I don't know her parents, but they set up a page where you can submit your stories about the deceased to memorialize her life. I'm not well-versed on how to be appropriate in times of grieving. I've realized recently I have a bad habit to make things about me, and I think in this case I want to make sure I remain as respectful as possible and really just do what they asked: remember their daughter. I need advice on this: After her death, I, like my community, was shocked and deeply saddened. Reading about her life and seeing how well she loved/lived inspired me greatly and shook me to my core. I remember her everyday and still pray for her parents, and I draw upon her face when I'm in difficult situations so I can act justly and with compassion. Remembering her everyday helped me change my life by seeking therapy and ending a year of drug abuse, and I'm finally stable and able to live my life for the first time in what feels like decades. I feel immensely grateful. 

**I told my friends about this, and they encouraged me to post on that page my experience. I need advice on whether this is appropriate, as this story feels too self-centered and the page is meant to be to memorialize all the wonderful experiences they've had with her. I don't want to make this about me and want to be considerate about her parents' grief, so I'm asking here first instead of posting there immediately because I won't do it if it's inappropriate.**",10Oct2019,1
835,"A couple nights ago me and my crush were singing songs together on a facetime call. We’ve been friends together for two years but that was the moment when I thought we wanted to be more then friends. We’re both in high school and have so much in common (almost perfectly coincidental) and laugh at each others jokes. I thought we both realized how great it would be if we got together. It was a one sided street. My crush’s view towards me changed after that night but she still feels the same way about me no matter how many attempts I make at trying to show my feelings. I feel like she’s been leading me on this whole time but I was wrong. 

Despite trying to be there for her when she needed help or making sure she had someone to talk to when she was feeling down she still chases the guy in our class who asked for her pictures of her ass. I’m so confused. Life HURTS. Anyone have any advice at all? Anything would help at this point.",10Oct2019,1
836,"I've never posted on reddit before and I don't really know how all of this works, so who knows; maybe no one will read this.

But I would really like some advice. If there is anyone out there who has been through a similar thing, and it has or hasn't worked out, I would really like to know. I know every situation is unique, but there's this huge sense of uncertainty inside me and it's not super fun.

So, became really good friends with this guy at uni, he's Indian (I'm white, female for reference), he explained his parents expected him to have an arranged marriage when he was in his mid-twenties. We got closer, started dating, so I've been fully aware of his family situation from the beginning. Been dating for six months now. I want to get serious with him. But I know how close he is with his family. And the idea of getting between him and his family makes me feel sick. He would literally have to choose between me and his family. They're very strict, conservative, religious, etc... But they're family. He's best friends with his two brothers, calls his parents every day, and his grandparents/extended family in India adore him (pretty sure he's the favourite grandchild).

Obviously we've talked about the situation. And he says he has never wanted an arranged marriage, but he's also said ""I'm really worried that, if the pressure gets too much...""

I don't want to make him choose. But everyday we're together, talking about getting an apartment, I know I am making him choose.

Should I pursue the relationship, his family be damned? Am I setting myself up to get hurt? Any advice?",10Oct2019,7

Ok. So i was drinking with my friends last night. Im not legal age yet - year under. We all got pretty hammered, but i got alcohol poisoning and ended up in the ER. I have very bad eyesight and I need my glasses everywhere I go. My friend gave my glasses to some campus security guy for safekeeping, but now they cant find them. My prescription is really strong, and due to that they are really expensive - $800+. I'm going home for a holiday on Saturday, and I'm going to have to explain ro parents why i don't have my glasses. I'm already paying 4 tuition, and we cant afford to replace them. Plus, i dont want to destroy their trust in me. This is a very unusual occurrence, they really trust me.

839,"me and my boyfriend have been going out for a few month. the first few months were great. but recently he said he doesn’t consider me his number one priority. he was staying over at his friends house last week, because he was having like a little party. he ignored me for the whole night. the next day he said he’ll dedicate a day for me and him. he said he’ll go home in the morning and do some work and come over. he ended up staying at his house until 1pm and then going home. doing all the work and he didn’t end up coming over because it was too late. haven’t properly seen him in a week. i had a fight with him about it and all he said was “i need a balance between my family, friends and you” and i understand that, so i just gave up on the argument cause i thought i was in the wrong. i’ve been making efforts to pick him up from school just to see him for a few secs. and i don’t get the same effort back to see me. i’d give up everything just to see him and he doesn’t feel the same.  also, i send him huge paragraphs every day about how much i love him i don’t get the same back. he saying he loves me but i don’t feel like he does. he’s going to his friends on friday again and is saying the same thing. he’ll come over to my house on saturday after he does the work but i feel like he’ll end up doing the same thing as last time. i feel very unappreciated and i’m really had broken. since he said i’m not his number one priority i’ve been crying every night.",10Oct2019,1

841,"Hi redditers! 

I need some advice as I have no one else to talk to. This might be a bit of a long one but I’d really appreciate some advice! 

I’ve been very mentally unwell since I was a kid with severe depression and General Anxiety Disorder (plus insomnia and crippling separation anxiety that’s left me unable to make friends to this day). I always thought it was something more (even if not I still needed help with my anxiety and depression etc) but my parents (despite knowing how badly I struggled) refused to believe me or help me with counselling/seeing a psychiatrist etc. My parents (happily married for 30 years and a Doctor and ex Nurse) felt that I was “lying, like a lot of fake mentally ill people do” -  being “ungrateful” - “attention seeking and spoilt” etc etc. Some background to this...I’m adopted because my birth mother was mentally ill with severe psychosis and bipolar and my birth father died a couple of years ago and despite struggling with grieving for him as a young adult (about 12/13 years old) my parents wouldn’t talk to me about it at all or help me through the grieving process. They felt that I was being “ungrateful” when I still have them and talking about adoption reminds them they couldn’t have their own kids which is very upsetting for them. They constantly remind me that I was “their last option” in regards to having children and how much “it was me or nothing” and I’m a reminder of their infertility. I feel so guilty and struggle with knowing that two sets of parents didn’t want me.
Obviously as I was still living at home and a young teenager I had no way of financing counselling or a visit to a psychiatrist on my own and couldn’t even see a GP to talk to someone and access mental health services through the NHS as I wasn’t able to get anywhere by myself (we lived in the middle of nowhere). 
As soon as I turned 18 I shipped off to uni even though I didn’t want to go and wasn’t mentally ready (I’m academically able but struggling to cope with declining mental health) just so that I could access some support. It’s taken me about 18 months even so to get a visit to the psychiatrist with a view to getting a diagnosis. I struggle with the feeling that I should be able to cope and that previous generations were stronger because to this day that’s what my Dad drills into me and he is my hero.He is a fantastic Dad couldn’t do enough for me as a kid when my mum didn’t want to spend time with me. His Dad (my grandad) fought in the Second World War and my Dad uses that to justify that I should be okay and I 100% agree, I feel pathetic as I have a wonderful life. Anyway, this week I was diagnosed (by the aforementioned psychiatrist) with type 2 bipolar and Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder  (basically a new term for Borderline Personality disorder) plus PTSD from being sexually assaulted at university (both my parents and the uni didn’t believe and despite it happening a year ago I struggle to cope with it, another story for another time really) but it was awful and I passed my mood swings and other symptoms of my bipolar as anxiety after the event and everyone just said I was being sensitive and weak. I feel much better with the diagnoses bc it alleviates the feeling that I’m to blame. Here’s the kicker: the psychiatrist said that the type 2 bipolar is probably inherited from my birth mother who had it BUT the BPD/EUPD is largely learned because of the emotional abuse I suffered from my parents. I love my parents and they love me, I have no friends and I’m not far away from home so I still see them regularly which is good because otherwise I’d be as alone as my mental illness make me feel. Here’s where I need advice....should I talk to them about this and ask for help in the way of paying for some counselling etc because I can’t afford it and I’m struggling? I told them about the diagnoses but they simply don’t believe in mental illnesses in teenagers and young adults especially. They have said that I shouldn’t “make my problems their problems” and that I need to sort it myself but after two hospital trips due to suicide attempts in the last three weeks, I really can’t cope by myself. I don’t want apologies or anything but they accept no recognition for their portion of the blame (maybe not the correct term sorry) and it really sucks. They just think I’m being ungrateful since I had such a privileged upbringing (I 100% did and I recognise the astounding privilege in this so please don’t tell me how ungrateful I am as I get enough of that already :). If I shouldn’t talk to them is there anything else I can do? My brain is telling me everyone hates me and I should just die and no one will notice. I’m in rubbish uni digs and I feel so alone and helpless with no friends around, I’m not allowed back to work because of the suicide attempts and so my family are my only avenue of help. What can I say to my parents to get them to recognise my very real pain and very real diagnosis? Does anyone have any experience with something similar and did it ever work out? Am I allowed to feel that my parents behaviour is emotional abuse and contributed to my BPD like the psychiatrist said despite my privilege? I feel that talking to them won’t change the past and I’ve worked hard to maintain a good relationship with them over the years and it might jeopardise that, should I bother speaking to them at all? Any advice would be appreciated please :)

Added info: I’m also battling low level alcoholism (to self medicate the bipolar as they won’t prescribe my any mood stabilisers until my next appointment with the psychiatrist in 2 months time) and a long term eating disorder with minimal help neither of which my parents know about. 

Extra added info: the uni are in the loop and very understanding and are doing everything they can to keep me here.",10Oct2019,1

852,"I'll tell you from the start.

She's(19F) my elder(two years older than me) cousin sister. Her father sent her to a bigger city (school fee there are more than 3 times than ours) for the studies of 11th standard (+1) . She was admitted to a school and took Physics, Maths, Chemisty, Computer Science and English as her subjects, but half of the semester was already over. She wasn't able to understand those five giants in such a short time as a result she failed.

Her father now rented a room near my house in the town where I live. And addmited in the same school in which I was studying(now we both are in 11th grade). She made a boyfriend there and after sometime he left her. After he left her, her studies started to affect badly (she took the same 5 Giants that she took last year when she was failed in 11th grade).

 I asked her whats the matter and after a lot of convincing she told me about her boyfriend and breakup. I helped her to recover and move on. But she failed again in the 11th standard. Now I'm in 12th and she's still in 11th.

I told her that if you don't like/can't understand these giants subjects then change them this time, but she refused. Her father this time admitted her to a dummy school (those who don't know what dummy schools are, they are the schools where you don't have to attend any class you just have to pay a high price for the 75% attendance criteria).

 This time she again chose those five monsters. After a few months I got to know from her friend (her landlord's daughter) that she again made a boyfriend. We had a fight over it, she stopped talking to me for sometime, and whenever I talk about her studies which are getting affected by her boyfriend she always hit me and starts behaving that I always wants her bad, why can't she understand that I'm her brother I can never think bad of her. She's change a lot since she have got her new boyfriend, she don't love me now as before.

Whever we teese her in public she always hit us, but there's no shame in clicking pictures with her boyfriend soo closely in the public. 

What should I do to save her from this? 
I love my sister the most I can't see her destroying her future like this.

Anyway, i will try to describe what I'm feeling in no particular order ( because I don't know which of my thoughts are more prominent)

I don't know if I ever feel real happiness, besides when im high on weed (Im not a regular consumer of weed mostly because I'm too cautious that I feel so good when I have it. and while I am high I feel like that is how I should be feeling things normally) . 

Actually, when I have weed, how I feel high is how i think I should feel normally. I feel like I am not high per se, but I rather have just been brought to a normal level of perception of some things that a normal person would have. 

One example is my desire for sex. When sober I hardly get excited for anything never mind sex but when I'm high I feel like oh this is how it's supposed to feel to be horny. I'm aware that physical feelings are heightened when high but I think my cravings and desires are merely brought to a normal level.

I feel like I need to force myself to feel anything or be interested in anything. I also feel like I have lost sense of humour. I can easily fake seeming normal though but I know inside I'm just not feeling anything real. or at least nothing feels real



Sorry this post isn't even making good sense I don't even know what Im asking. I guess just writing something about this is a start to being able to experience the human experience like a normal human whatever that may be. I also see upon reading this over is that it looks like I am comparing my sober state to high state. obviously high is going to be more enjoyable to sober but i only mention it because it makes me be able to compare how I'm feeling to something.",10Oct2019,2

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",10Oct2019,0

She’s done this a numerous of times. She doesn’t directly ask me, I have an idea because Im unapproachable and have a mean face, but idk why she can’t just ask me?
When we bump into each other we obviously stare at each other and smile, Idk why but we do it a lot of times. She is older than me im 22, shes around 27...
She’s really loud and always joking around, and she is bossy with everyone and even made a girl cry last time. I don’t really approach her because she is mean so i keep my distance. But I do have a crush on her, but I get so closed off when im near her, because she is loud.

860,"I’m in Uni, and for the past month this guy keeps sitting beside me, which would be fine if he didn’t keep making me feel uncomfortable. 

When listening in class, I can always see him staring at me in the corner of my eye. At first I didn’t think much but it just keeps getting more uncomfortable from there. He started to look down at my phone whenever I was on it, or when I lead forward on the desk he would too. Then a few times he ‘accidentally’ touched my knee, and then he tapped his foot on mine. I’m in relatively smallish class, so when I sit in a different spot he sits next to me. Usually I come to class early, but last week I came to class a bit later to avoid sitting by him. I sat farther back, and saw he kept looking back at me. Every time class ends he waits for me to get up, even the time I waited for a majority of people to leave he stayed. Today I sat down and almost immediately after he came in. However I was trying to adjust myself so my backpack was behind the chair next to me, and he just pulled out the chair and pushed my backpack aside. He didn’t even say anything, it was a pretty aggressive movement too. I just moved it back under the desk and didn’t mention it, I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it. 

We have a group project, and of course, he is in my group. We were all talking, and we started to plan out our project. He just kept referring to me saying “what do you think ____, what are ideas you have ____” it was just odd. 

I know people will say “maybe he thinks your attractive, he has a crush on you” but I’m not comfortable with new people, especially when they do things like this. I don’t think it’s very appropriately do things like this. I don’t think it’s appropriate to literally shove someone’s things aside just so they can sit next to you, or stare at you/your phone. 

I’m not a confrontational person, so I don’t know how to approach this situation",10Oct2019,1
861,"So...

I've been in a long term, long distance (we met online, but we see each other a few times a year) relationship for the past 3 1/2 years. Everything's going great, I love this girl to the moon and back, etc. etc. Sure, we've had our fights, but I can say for certain that I love her.

Now, I've recently moved to a new University after switching courses, and met someone who is almost identical to me. Not physically of course, but in terms of interest, we have the same thought process. Now, in my panicked haste of looking for friends, I've managed to get to the point of binging TV shows (not physically in person, just being active on messengers) every night, and on the following day, as I walked her to the bus stop trying to hide her phone from me as she frantically messaged her friend about how much she ' ""enjoys hanging out with me"" ', I realised that she very obviously liked me, and that I'm an awful person who's been leading her on. She does know about my girlfriend (I'm not subtle about her and have repeatedly brought her up) but I'm not sure that's been taken into account.

Now, I really like this girl, I really do. She's similar and we have the same interests and all of that... but she's not my girlfriend. And I love my girlfriend. I love my girlfriend so much that I'm tempted to just ghost this girl. But I also enjoy hanging out with her, and we really are good friends. I'd be lying if I said that if my girlfriend didn't exist we wouldn't be together, but I'd still choose my girlfriend every time.

If anyone knows how I can set her down in such a way that won't break her heart, (and hopefully our friendship) or has any advice, I would really appreciate it.

862,"I'm kind of in a tough position at the moment. My family just recently got a puppy and he's great. Really cute. 

However, my family is a real mess. Especially my dad. My dad has always been a toxic and unloving person. He habitually drinks and he is a very angry person (every night he watches horrible TV shows about real murders). All my life he has been mentally abusive, unsupportive, controlling and recently he has become borderline physically abusive. He threatened to attack me 3 times when I have confronted him about his behavior.

After the threats my brother and I had dozens of conversations with our mom. A few months have passed since these conversations and I have accepted she will do nothing about his abusive behavior...

When my parents suggested getting a puppy I figured it would be a good thing for my family. My dad's mood has somewhat changed and he loves to play with the puppy. 

However, being the controlling and angry person he is, whenever the puppy does something ""wrong"" which he doesn't understand my dad gets furious and punishes him. He will pick him up and squeeze him or smack him.

I had multiple conversations with my parents about positive reinforcement and how punishment is 100% unnecessary. And my dad simply doesn't listen.

869,"So I have these friends. They’re a couple, let’s call them Anna and James. We’ve been close for about seven years, since I was in my early teens, and they their late teens/early twenties. 
We have a long, complicated history, and I’ve recently begun to realize that our friendship dynamic is extremely toxic for me. 
I’ve tried to express to them some feelings about this in a gentle way, including words like “that thing you did and the way you said it hit a boundary for me” etc. 
but it seems like it hasn’t worked, considering that I am still constantly feeling as if I’m “in trouble” according to them. I’ve been having serious avoidance and communication issues, particularly with Anna, because deep down I know that I’m uncomfortable with the lack of boundaries in our friendship and the way she talks to me. 
Not only that, but she has some serious mental health issues that she needs to get help for, and as shitty as it sounds, they take a toll on me. I don’t feel comfortable communicating this, because Anna is in denial about a lot of things, and I don’t know if I’m comfortable crossing that line/having that confrontation. 

I understand that avoidance only makes things MUCH worse, and this is something that I’m trying to work through in therapy, but I can’t help but feel like there’s a reason I feel compelled to do it. 

I guess the point of this is that I don’t know what to do. Every sign is pointing to “cut the toxicity out” because this is really wearing on me and is giving me anxiety every single day. However, I don’t like the idea of cutting off friends that I’ve had for so long and have been through so much with.

I can’t believe he’s gone cause I was just doing my history test after school today and I came home and I saw this macaron video on Instagram which reminded me to ask my grandma about his favourite dessert so I could bake it for him for thanksgiving

872,"Hi, I've been friends with this guy since I was 15 when we met as colleagues in a shop I was doing work experience in.

We found a common interest in PC video gaming and I asked if he had a steam account where he plays games and he said yes.

Once I finished work experience, I remembered his steam name one day (around a month after I left) and decided to add him. We ended up just talking about video games and life mostly.

We've been talking on and off and now I'm 17. Sometimes we had months of not talking and it was usually me who initiated conversation so it's not like he's ever been clingy or weird?

Anyway, I'm really just asking from a strangers point of view if a friendship between us is weird? He hasn't ever asked to meet up or send pics of myself, we just talk about life and video games.

We have been talking quite a lot recently though, more than I do with a lot of my other friends if I'm honest.

Hey there! I've been having a problem, and Instagram is doing nothing about it.

So, recently, I went through my blocked list on Instagram and I noticed a person I had blocked had a photo of me that used to be on my page as his profile picture. I've spoken to this guy before, like several months back, and I don't remember what made me block them. So I don't even know how long he's had his profile picture as me.

I immediately unblocked him and then messaged him about it. I've messaged him several times throughout that day and I was given zero response. I reported his page for impersonation (If you could call it that, he didn't have any other photos of me on his page, just his profile picture.) I got an update back from Instagram not long after that, and they said that he did not violate community guidelines.

I've reported him several times after this, and Instagram had not given any update after the first time. He still has my picture as his profile pic, and he has not responded to any of my messages, they haven't been opened.

I never at any point gave this man consent or permission to use any of my photos in any way. At this point, I just want him to take it down. It's not like it's a provocative photo, it's just a photo of my face with a snapchat filter that I had archived at some point. Again, I don't know how long he's had that photo on his profile.

Is there anything I can do since Instagram doesn't seem to want to do anything about it? What should I do?

884,"Regularly I would post this in a D&amp;D sub asking for advice but several people in my D&amp;D group watch those subreddits religiously and I am hoping this stays away from their sight until I solidify my stance. I hope my post is allowed here please forgive me if it is not. I will remove if that's the case. 

I have a D&amp;D group that meets Bi-weekly and this started as a group of high school friends keeping in touch and playing together. We have been playing for 4 years now and rotating campaigns since we have several people that like to DM, myself being one of them. The group all contributes what they can to minis and books since it is can get expensive but I own a little more than half of all of it. About a year ago one member asked to bring in a friend he met through gaming online, we agreed to allow him in thinking the more the merrier. Since he has joined he has been invited to multiple events outside of D&amp;D since we regularly just invited everyone during a session. 

At every event he gets drunk and becomes aggressive and offensive instigating fights wherever he can. He is a living internet troll type that lives by the idea that he can say what he wants to regardless of what others think or feel because he has the rights to, quoting the first amendment. 

Recently in our group messaging he has been posting memes that I find racist and offensive. I messaged back that I dont like those memes and that I dont want to see them. He then started attacking me saying that i am a snowflake and that he can say what he wants where he wants and that i cant stop him. The rest of the D&amp;D group is reading the messages but not chiming in. Eventually I bit the bait and got furious with his trolling and told him that I will not DM nor play D&amp;D with him and left the group chat in my rage. 

Now I am here sitting with the entire hoard of D&amp;D stuff (it lives in my home) and my high school friends messaging me saying they take my side but following it with 'he is sorry and he sees how he screwed up'. They keep saying they are hoping to resolve it between us all but I feel like I need to stand to keep toxicity out of my life but I have an entire group that I hurt if I leave. 

I haven't posed a ""him or me"" ultimatum to my friends, I just keep saying that I need to figure out what I want to do. If I leave, I leave the group with about half the material, some of it essential. If I stay and let him stay though I feel like I am letting a hateful person have there way with no real repercussions. Any advice is highly appreciated.",10Oct2019,1
885,"some warnings! If you don't like reading about homophobia, religion, and anxiety, please feel free not to read!

Also please forgive any spelling mistakes and grammar issues, school/college is over for the day and I really can't be bothered.

I've never been truly a super religious person the way a lot of people I know are. I mostly prayed for salvation because I wanted to drink grape juice and eat those crackers during communion. I was also four and there is a shame/fear tactic around not accepting Jesus in the church, or at least the one I grew up in. I've had what some people might call spiritual callings to strengthen my faith, but every time I've tried to do so, I've only grown more doubtful. As a result, I decided to try and prove to myself that the Bible is true through means other than ""it's true because God says it is."" Something I've learned in composition course in college when trying to convince someone of something (in this case, myself), is to find counterarguments and defend your position against them.

That was the start of my more dramatic (I don't think that's the word I was looking for, but it will do) disbelief. 

I started looking into atheist content (as well as other political views). To my growing anxiety and horror, I found myself agreeing more and more with channels such as Mr Atheist (although he grew up in the Church of Latter Day Saints instead of Baptist denominations). The more I've felt myself distancing from Christian faith, the more at peace I am with my own worldview. I've never been able to fully reconcile my own sexuality (I'm bi/pan by the way, labels don't really concern me in that regard) with the Bible and what I believed to be God's nature. The conflicting nature of ""you can judge someone by their 'fruits' (actions) but don't judge, that's God's job,"" and other such messages really bothered me. The extreme guilt I felt over my own anxiety (""if you're ever anxious, clearly you're just not trusting God enough"") only ever fed my anxiety to an unhealthy degree. My ""role"" as a woman, how we follow some rules in the Old Testament but not others, the hypocritical nature of many 'good' examples of Christians, and just how disgusting I feel about a lot of Republican views that are supported by the Bible, really only further pushed my disbelief. There are so many other ideals held up by Christian belief that I can't stand. I would like to make the disclaimer that there are some morals that I do still believe in, but this isn't the post to talk about those. 

I don't regret my choice to stop believing in the bible, and ""throw away"" my faith. I cannot call myself a Christian when so many values go strictly against everything I believe to be true about the world and myself and the nature of humanity. However, I feel like I'm betraying everyone I care about. I live a double life, in so many senses. I live my performance life, where I'm a good Christian girl who can defend the Bible (with what I personally think are weak arguments) and had a brief ""phase"" of rebellion where I was ""just seeking affection everywhere possible."" Yes, that's what my family has decided me 'being' into other genders was, and what I let them believe for fear of awful consequences. Everyone thinks I read my bible daily, that I pray over everything, that I want to be a good, submissive wife and raise good Christian children and go to a good christian college and attempt to influence other people into following this religion that I've always had one foot out of. I also live my secret life, in my head, where I don't believe in so many things I used to and constantly feel guilt and anxiety over everything. There's not one person I can confess this to without fear of it accidentally being shared to someone who could cause me a lot of really bad consequences. I don't even want to schedule an appointment with my therapist, because I have to go through my mother to do so and I don't want to raise any suspicion in her that something is ""wrong"" with me.

I've been crying myself to sleep on and off for months because of how much I'm lying to everyone around me. A semi-anonymous post about it is some of the only relief I have. I'm really looking forward to growing as a person and learning to stop falling into some things I was taught. Internalized homophobia being a huge one for me, but I'm also trying to learn how to not immediately judge people, how to stop feeling guilty over things that aren't my fault, how to stop hating myself, and how to treat other people better than I have been. 

I hope that this post expressed some of my thoughts the way I was thinking them, I'm not very good at getting across what I want to say.

Please have a good day and respond if you would like to.",10Oct2019,1
886,"I don’t know wether i should drop my best friend

So i (f15) have two best friends (m15, f16) but today i’m gonna focus in f16, L. I’ve known both of them for years and they’ve felt like the best friends i’ve ever had and love them a lot. I’ve known m15, M, since we were little but got close about three years ago. I got close to L about a year later as M and L were already friends. 

The first incident happened a couple weeks ago. I was in our group chat complaining about my brother and his girlfriend (m18, f17) She said something about them being in love and how i wouldn’t understand, she’s also never been in a relationship. I said something and then talked about something else but she never responded to me. i texted her explaining why i was upset and that i was sorry if i offended her and she left me on read. I got annoyed and ranted to my other friend and got a little hostile with him but apologized because it wasn’t his fault. I kept apologizing but she kept ignoring me and i couldn’t figure out what i did wrong. She didn’t talk to me for like five days. It upset me a lot. 

The second thing happened a couple days ago. M and L went to Ls homecoming as friends but i wasn’t upset about that. I posted on my spam that both M and L follow, saying ‘i’m bored someone please talk to me’ L commented a clown emoji so i asked her what was up, and i can admit i did sound a little defensive. She asked me what the fuck my problem was and i explained. She said ‘i was acknowledging your post because i couldn’t talk. If i meant it like that i would’ve said clown:🤡’ i said ‘oh i’m sorry i didn’t know.’ she responded with ‘you fucking better be.’ Then she posted twice on her spam about me the first post being captioned with 6 clown emojis and the second saying ‘Did you just all of the sudden forget who i am ¿¿’ 
I apologized again saying i didn’t want to ruin her night and that i hadn’t meant to offend her and she ignored me and posted twice more something something along the lines of ‘I don’t take attitude don’t come at me with it i’ll dish it back.’ I kept quiet the whole time. On my spam i posted tik tok lyrics saying ‘it’s a little bit funny.’ not trying to shade her in any way. She posted ‘don’t even try to cover yourself up 🤡🤪’ 
I didn’t talk to her for two days and didn’t respond to her in the group chat because i was pissed off and didn’t feel like dealing with her. 
She later snapped me two days later and didn’t mention it or apologize once and we went on. 

So often i say uwu or owo as a joke. I had sent that to her after she sent me a post of something. She posted on her spam ‘Just a reminder saying uwu of XD doesn’t make you cute or quirky it makes you look stupid and illiterate and stuck in a 2007 tumblr phase.’ 
I texted her asking if it was about me, which i knew it was. She said no i’m just saying in general’ i said okay and she said ‘why would i just now be telling you to stop you’ve literally done it the entire time i’ve known you.’ i told her it was bc of her spam post and she said her and M were talking. I said okay i was just confused. 
Then she sends ‘I don’t think you want this smoke/catch these hands’ i said no why would it and she says ‘K didn’t think so. Would be a fun activity for a rainy day.’ i didn’t respond except for okay and didn’t talk to her for the rest of the day because i was pissed off and didn’t know i’d she was mad at me and didn’t want to start anything as it’s Ms birthday this weekend and i don’t want to make it bad for him with L and i fighting. 
Fast forward to today. She snapped me and i responded and she sent me a middle finger. I was like okay and didn’t respond. I dmed her and asked if she was really mad at me. She said ‘why are you asking what are your circumstances on that.’ 
i said ‘because i didn’t know if you were joking last night and the middle finger snap and she responds with 
‘Um i was obviously joking or i would pull up and i’ve sent you????? so many middle finger snaps ?????’ i said 
‘okay i just didn’t know. And i wouldn’t have thought much about the snap if i wasn’t confused about last night i just wanted to know.’ 

and she responds with 

‘I just need space right now honestly’ 
at this point i was pissed off because i don’t know why she would need space from me if there than me confronting her about something and her not wanting to face it. 

L is very confrontational and a ‘bad bitch’ in her opinion. Every time i disagree with her and bring it up she yells, shit talks me, asks if i want to fight etc. I think it’s because i’m more of a submissive personality and she’s more dominant, i also let people walk all over me until recently. I don’t think she like me ‘questioning’ her. This whole situation pisses me off so much. 

And she also like to make sexual jokes towards me and M. She says she wants to have sex with M and me, has had sex with M (they haven’t, he also used to play into it a lot until i made it known i didn’t like it.), she wants to have sex with me (she’s straight, both m and i are bi) or how she wants to be pounded by some celebrity. i’ve told her so many times it’s made me extremely uncomfortable but she hasn’t stopped or even started right back up after i told her. i’ve given up on telling her. It makes me really really uncomfortable and we can’t even go a day/conversation without her bringing it up. it’s annoying. 

also she’s said to me before that M is meaner to me because he knows i’ll take it, but idk if that’s true for him but definitely is true for her. I’m so fed up with her throwing tantrums when she doesn’t get her way (she despises her little sister for no reason and also has said she wants to throat punch her mom— her mom is a little mean and unreasonable but most of the things are normal mom things——she also doesn’t like authority and is never the problem. never.) Part of me wants to drop her and not deal with her but part of me wants to work it out. My school had a real lockdown today and i texted the group chat panicking it was an active shooter and she didn’t even respond. It turned out that a student brought a gun on a college campus by my school. Two years ago the shooting at Great Mills happened, That was fifteen minutes from my school. My brother was in lockdown. I was scared because i remembered. I don’t know what to do. I don’t even want to talk to her anymore. 

also i’m sorry for the bad grammar and bad layout, i’m on the bus home w my phone.

I haven't finished Algebra 2 yet but I want to stop cheating. I don't understand anything though so it is just getting harder and harder to get back in. I can't comprehend and understand any of my math problems, also I don't know any theorems, procedures, etc for anything. I want to stop but it has become so hard and I'm going to take my ACT soon, what do I do?",10Oct2019,1
889,"Hello! I've currently been in college for around 4 years and am nowhere near completing my bachelor's degree. I've recently become depressed over this and feel like a failure and a money pit for my parents who have paid for my education and housing all this time. Additionally, my sister has also started attending college this year putting even more of a strain on my parents financially.

 Currently, I have access to a decent paying job but it would require me to work full time and I wouldn't have time to attend school. If I were to take this job, I would be able to pay for my housing and online classes which I feel would help my depression by giving me a sense of autonomy. 

I want to know your thoughts before I confront my parents over the issue.",10Oct2019,1
890,"Me and a friend of mine had a problem recently, and I found out that I've been very negative and threw it all over her for help. She and I are very close, we talk every day, and it was a shock to find out that I hurt her by doing something I always did, and never knew it hurt her. She told me it's okay to count on her with my problems, just don't throw her at her. But I really just feel like a burden to her, I don't think I should tell her that anymore. What would you do in my place? Should I talk to her more about? Or just find some way to deal with my problems alone? I'm on mobile, so I'm sorry for typos",10Oct2019,2
