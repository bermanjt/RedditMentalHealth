1,"TLDR: my girlfriends parents are old fashioned and hate me. They try to keep my girlfriend from seeing me. How can I make them like me?


In April of this year my girlfriend and I started dating (we were juniors, now seniors in high school). For the first two months, she didn’t even tell her parents because if they didn’t know they couldn’t stop us from being together. During this period of ambiguity for them, she accidentally slept over at my house and they knew. So there’s one reason they don’t like me.

A couple weeks after that I was at her house for only the second time, and he dad walked by her door and heard me kiss her. He then opened the door and demanded I leave the house. 

In the summer we could only see each other every other day and she was only allowed out until 9pm because we are together (we’re seniors in high school!)

During this time she got in many fights with her parents about me. Recently we’ve been pushing the envelope again with her picking me up for school and then hanging out for a little bit after at my house. 

Her parents told her today she’s not allowed to pick me up and is grounded until they tell her she isn’t. 

The only way for me to see her now is during our one class at school. I really want her parents to like me because I really like her, but they don’t seem to want to give me a shot. The first time I met her dad I tried so hard to make a good impression but he seemed so uninterested in me. That’s the only time I’ve ever said a word to him. I’ve gave her family tomatoes and likes from my garden and they still dislike me.

What can I do to help them start to tolerate me at least? I don’t know what to do",21Aug2019,1

4,"I started preschool at age 3 with the 2005-2006 school year, but then I attended preschool again at age 4 with the 2006-2007 school year, then I started kindergarten at age 5 with the 2007-2008 school year. Now I'm in 12th grade, and all my life I've attended Hawaii DOE public schools. Back in those days, preschool was not part of the state's system; that was just kindergarten through 12th grade. If an elementary school had a preschool class, it was run separately by the school its self or whoever was in charge of that, I don't know. In my 7th grade year, 2014-2015, the state decided to add pre-K to it's system, but only in select elementary schools, and only for one year at age 4. So is preschool only supposed to be one year before kindergarten. If so, that means I started 1 year early, only to be held back anyway!",21Aug2019,1

6,"I'm sorry, i'd include a TLDR but I don't even know how. If anyone does in the comments thats totally fine, i'm just terrible with stories probably. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't really give the full story since it'd be pages upon pages, but here's the background: 

I met this guy in middle school, we were around the same age. I was raped about 7 months prior to us going into a relationship by another person older than I. Multiple times in this relationship he forced me to have sex with him, threatened suicide if I didn't do as he said (not with sex but with various other things) , manipulated me, isolated me, and convinced me that without him I was nothing. He had also cut me with a knife, pushed me, and bitten me until I bled (twice). He also used my PTSD as a weapon of sorts to keep me beaten down to submission (diagnosed at 15). I stayed with him from age 14 to age 18, and about 3 months into being 18 I told him it was over. 

During this time, and even earlier, I had reached out to some of our friends for help (I was friends with his friends since he hated all of my friends.) I told some when he cut me and when he was threatening suicide or hurting me. They did nothing. Later, after breaking up with him, I opened up to them about him forcing me into sex. Them, avid ""feminists"" apparently, said ""Well, only you and him know what truly happened."" How ""feminist"" of them to kick a rape victim in the heart and basically tell them they don't believe them, right? 

I tried to move on and cut them all out of my life. Nothing really happened until very recently. 

That whole group and I are pretty big anime/pop culture fans. video games, anime, comics, etc. You know. Well, about 2 of those people from a group among others created a hugely popular cosplay group. About 30K followers on IG, and with the town we live in that basically makes you a celebrity. 

Well, one day I get a call from a good friend of mine. They ask me if I saw what W (obviously fake name) had posted on a social media site. I said no, and she began to tell me the details. They were making fun of a cosplayer in the town with only 2,000 or so followers on tik tok, saying ""sorry our parents cant buy fame you spoiled brat"" and very descriptive instances and features that basically slapped a sign on my face that said ""It's me they're talking about!"" They also called me a racist for supporting Pewdiepie and a rapist apologist. They didn't go into detail on the rapist apologist part, I guess they just really wanted to hammer in that they were making me out to be a monster. 

I flipped. I cried, had a panic attack, and my DM's were getting filled with people that knew me going ""what did you do?"" Because again, what they said was very obviously about me. 

Now, my cosplay account on IG just started to gain traction with sponsors and companies. I had one send me free merch to advertise and a few other companies were offering as well. I got scared because I was worried about what companies may think if the public starts to believe what these people were saying about me. I didn't want ""racist"" and ""rapist apologist"" to be attached to me along with their accusations of me bullying them endlessly about their weight. 

I took up the courage and called one of them. I was as calm as possible, told them I just wanted to have a mature conversation, and I laid out my case. I told them I was sorry about how harshly I cut contact, that i'm scared of being called a racist and such since I am a very accepting person, and that I hope we can move on and the post can be deleted. I brought up being assaulted by my ex again and they cut me off saying ""Listen, I don't want to be involved. I know him. We are friends. Only you two know what happened."" After that nothing was done except them telling me ""Oh that wasn't about YOU you, it was sort of like an open letter."" I couldn't handle arguing about it, so I basically said ""Got it okay."" and ended the conversation there. 

Anyone remotely connected to me was then banned from their IG account, Facebook, and possibly other social media sites. I have no idea if the original post or posts made about me after (there were about 3 I was told) were deleted or not and i'm still worried about the impact that may have on me. A local convention here was coming along and I was really anticipating possibly having a panel. Now i'm scared they won't want to associate with the ""rapist apologist and racist"" I apparently am. They have a good hold on the cosplay community in my town and even my state. It hurts me. And now apparently my ex got slightly involved by saying he wishes I'd just get over the past.

I don't know what to do from here. I really don't want lies to be spread but I also don't want to be that girl that makes shit public.

14,"So Im not really sure what to do here. Im currently a sophomore in highschool, with an uncertainty about what to do in the future. I had been leaning towards art, specifically story boarding, but my parents convinced me out of it, not wanting me to try at something with a much higher risk that reward. So I eventually agreed and started a more realistic approach.

Ive written a multitude of stories before, I play drums and piano, I am an avid artist with experience in digital and traditional drawing, all of which I enjoy, but none of which my parents think is a good thing to pursue. I've taken it all with a grain of salt, thinking I'd have a free choice in the matter of what I chose until today.

Today I had just recently gotten test scores back from a class that, if i pass enough of the same type of class within a certain amount of time, will give me a free ride plus some money to any college or university within my state. I had gotten the highest available letter grade, and told my dad about it, and that I was seriously considering psychology as a field I wished to enter, that I felt I would enjoy, thought was interesting, and not to mention paid a lot of money. When I got home however, my dad quickly made me a list of 20 career choices to choose from, majority of which I had looked at, all of which I did not want to pursue, and none of which were psychology. 

My father then told me that I was going to pick one of these courses, and pursue it to the the furthest possible degree. After expressing I felt like I had found something with psychology, expressed how much better it was than my previous choices, and even mentioned how it fit his requirements, he ignored me and said I was going to do what he said. 

Here is where I dont know what to do. Im an excelling student following an academic track that, if im lucky enough, will grant me an AA by the time I graduate, and I dont want to waste my time if doing what I dont want will end up making me miserable and I end up jumping courses. I feel conflicted, especially because my dad has my best interests in mind, but has made me feel like I have a choice when I really dont. 

Do I just listen to what he says, or do I let me guide myself to what I believe is best for me? Anyone who read this far, thank you in for caring enough, and anyone who responds, thank you in advance for your response. Any advice is much appreciated.",21Aug2019,1

19,"My frienda been having a generally bad day, and decided to get drunk.

so he goes to a store, and the person working the cash register ask for his ID.

They are generally a dick, and without a doubt know him.

So, he asks what the price is, because he geniunely needs to know, and they say something along the lines of ""i wont tell you without ID"".

This geniunly pissed him off, because if you would of been present in person, according to my friend, you could of seen the smart ass, smug way they did this. It was purposely done to an be an asshole, and they conveyed this with body language. Plus, my friend has worked retail, and my friend KNOWS the cashier knew the price as soon as it was scanned.

Anyway, he quietly shows them the ID, and ask the price again.

At this point hes fuming, and they tell him the price.

So, he opens his wallet, and instead of paying with his card he agressively throws the money (1 dollar bills) down one by one so the cashier has to rake each up. And, my friend ""accidentally"" shorts him by a dollar.

Then, he pretty much yells ""keep the change"" and grabs the beer up and leaves.

About 10 minutes later, after calming down, my friend drove back, apologized for ""losing my temper"" and payed him the extra that he ""accidentally"" shorted him because prison records are no fun.

To quote my friend

""And on the way out, I loudly repeated to him how id see him around""... Take that as you will because the TOWN IS SMALL and he will see him around (if your reading this, cashier, ;-)

Some people, not my friend, may give a bullshit apology and do something on purpose to have an excuse to return and give a veiled threat to a piece of shit asshole only to later break their bones after watching what car they get into and follow them home. This does not pertain to me or my friend.

What is your advice, should I just stick with it for another 2&amp;1/2 years or tell them, if so what’s the best way to do it, I feel that this is going to be much harder than anything else because strict religious beliefs and atheism aren’t wholly compatible, as there is no social understanding for closeted atheism like there is with lgbtq so I don’t think I’ll get my parents support in the matter. I guess I could just live out the lie and stuff for a while until I can move out but I don’t think that would help me much. I feel trapped in a place of miss understanding.

29," 

I took time to reflect and realize that I have no friends. Ever since I could remember, I've had terrible luck making friends and keeping them. Nowadays, I'm usually the one who goes up to people and introduces myself. This is hard for me to do that because I get anxious and I'm afraid to say the wrong thing. I think people can see I lack self-confidence in my social skills and they tend to back away and stop talking to me.

Here's the thing: I really want to talk to people and meet new people. It's just that I can't let go of my past. I used to be bullied all throughout my life and people refused to sit next to me sometimes because of it. I'm still hurt by it as silly as it sounds. The only person I currently talk to is my boyfriend and I don't think it's healthy if that makes any sense. Also, I have this ""friend"" who I met in 2013 and we used to be best-friends. Nowadays, she just doesn't seem interested in talking to me or hearing what i have to say and she could literally go weeks without saying anything to me before I contact her again, it's basically one-sided now.

I start my final semester of college next week and I want to make sure this year is memorable. I want to make friendships or at least find people who I could occasionally talk to. I'm tired of this rinse-and-repeat cycle I have going on. Any advice is appreciated.

I currently live around 150 miles from my mom. After my dad passed, my mom started trying to fill the void by taking in as many ""helpless"" people as possible. See she is self employed, legit business, and needed help with the work. She took in 1 cousin, let's call him.... John. John (29) stayed around and actually did he lo p her through the rough times for around 6 months. After that, he pretty much started smoking weed and watching Ancient Aliens 16 hrs a day. My mom was still footing the bill mind you. I finally convinced him it was time to grow up and he moved back to his hometown.  Around 3 years ago another of my cousins... well call him Chase (27) moved in. All under the guise of helping her out. Of course he has never actually been of any kind of notable assistance. Has been arrested several times on drug charges, evading arrest and so on. Ok so... here is the fun part. I am a signer on her bank account. I get a call from the small town bank telling me that Chase has been stealing money via google pay and pay pal. She has changed her bank info several times but he continues to get it and take money. I have asked her if I file charges on him for this if she would back me up. She just say, ""ahhh, I just cant deal with it right now."" This past week he caused a major stir by going missing for a week, in one of her vehicles,  w no contact with anyone. My mom was worried sick that he was dead somewhere of an  overdose or been killed. He shows back up like nothing had happened. We had half the town looking for him. When I spoke w my mom, she basically said she didnt think he was on drugs because he eats too much... so hes back staying with her. In my dads old bedroom, mind you. So, I'm not sure what I'm looking for here... anything I guess. I've left out so many details, rumors he is running heroin (which she made a joke about afterwards), him working with the PD to get charges dropped and all of the houses she owns also being in my name, ect.

37,"Hi Reddit..

Some quick background info:
I work at a less than 25 person start up. I'm a manager but not of people more a manager of tasks. My company is based on the West Coast of the USA, however I'm the only remote based worker from London. This is not too much of an issue, there is mostly a lack of communication due to a lack of experienced professionals. 

My boss is looking to hire an assistant for me which I do need. However, he said it would be easier to just hire them locally. I raised my concerns about this mainly being I already feel isolated due to the lack of communication and often get undermined because I dont have all necessary information I require to make decisions. Having an assistant locally in the office makes me extremely anxious because it almost screams ""replacement"". 

The assistant would just naturally find out more information than me and before me, which would make me feel like I'm having to report to them. They would most likely find it easier to just quickly ask my boss for a decision, sitting across from them, rather than message and wait for reply from me. Anyone in the office is given a front facing company role which gives them opportunities and connections within the industry. This new hire would basically be shown to the ""world"" as my role and for anyone not looking too deeply into it, would assume they did all my work. 

When I said I raised concerns it was a very brief conversation that my boss brushed off for another time. When the time comes to discuss this again, what's the best way to approach it? Am I being unreasonable in feeling like this decision would make me look for another job immediately?",21Aug2019,1

40,"Okay, so here's what's keeping me up at night. My boyfriend too. It's 2 am. We're in bed, both pretty tired and just drifting off to sleep when suddenly we hear loud screams and cries of a child from the next door apartment. This, by itself, is alarming, but the fact that it's a regular occurrence is even worse. From what we've gathered the mother is apparently physically (and mentally) abusing her kid(s), actually not sure if there's another one. The child was on one occasion begging her to stop beating him/her.

43,"So, I’m a 17 year old dude. I have started collecting sneakers 2 years ago, and I currently own 12 pairs. Since I am still in high school, the majority of the pairs that I own were previously owned by my dad or bought by him. I have bought 2 pairs on my own. None of the pairs is exclusive or too expensive, the most expensive one was a pair of Adidas Ultraboosts bought on sale. As time passed, I realized that I prefer a more snug fit on my sneakers, and since roughly half of the sneakers that I own fit a bit big (either because the sneaker was owned by my dad or model runs big) and because of the fact that I find myself having only 2-4 sneakers in my rotation, I thought about selling or simply giving away the ones that I don’t use anymore. Issue number 1: I don’t how long it will take for my feet to stop growing making me indecisive in if I should keep the ones that fit snug or the ones that currently fit big
issue number 2: my dad doesn’t want me to sell or give away the sneakers because he paid for the majority of them and if they fitted well the moment I got them, I should simply wear them before getting more.
I would appreciate to hear opinions on this particular subject, and what should I do to adress this situation in the best way possible, given that my dad already got upset with this situation and I also want to stop this indecisiveness about having my sneakers fit according to my liking in the long term.",21Aug2019,1

I did get a (newspaper delivery) job because that can be done outside of wife's work hours (we have 1 car, in wife's name). I can't get another job without childcare and a second car. I do stuff to earn money online, but that only gets me a tiny bit of money. (I'm also going to college online, to increase my earning potential but I'm just in my first semester.)

My credit is bad, nothing is in my name so I have no collateral; I can't get a loan. No lawyers in the area will let me pay after I get my share of the marital property. No probono lawyers will help. I have actually tried all of this. I don't have possessions to sell. I don't have family/friends. Lawyers want a $4000 retainer to start the process. 


My wife is becoming progressively more abusive toward me and the kids, as well as taking away acess to the household money so I am having to use the little money I do have on surviving. 

 If i go to a shelter, I'd lose everything; I wouldn't be able to go to work, and would lose my job, I wouldn't be able to work online, I wouldn't be able to go to college.

I’m 21 and realize I’ve never actually had friends, just classmates, coworkers, and sorority sisters- none of whom particularly liked me. If they needed help with something or needed someone to listen or need a favor (borrowing stuff, money, a ride) or just wanted sex. But I wasn’t added to most group chats and often saw photos of them later on social media doing things when they said they were busy/staying in.
I really want friends I try to be thoughtful, nice, and interesting. But still no dice. I started a new job last week and found out that all the others on my team made a group chat without me and are avoiding sitting next to me (one tried to sit on the floor instead of the chair next to me during a lecture).  

Even the coworkers I have things in common with are rejecting me saying “I love to play table top games too, but I don’t know anyone who I actually wanna hang out with who plays” when I mentioned I was checking out local nerd hangout for a new table top group.

50,"Throwaway here for obvious reasons.

Long story short, I'm 30 years old, have been in long relationships my whole life (4 years and 10 years). We engaged up until 6 months ago, with who I thought I would spend my life with. Got dumped overnight, being told that she never loved me and that I never physically attracted her. She moved out our my apartment within 3 days and never heard or talked to her again. I recently learned that she is already in a new relationship. 

I was the type to do everything. I'd cook her dinners, prepare her lunches, clean, laundry, run her business pay for expenses and tripd and whatnot. I would have taken a few bullets for her and would have given her the world, although I had absolutely nothing in return. 

Here I am today, 6 months later, totally unhappy. I'm healthy, I have a great career, great investments, a beautiful car, no more mortgage on my apartment. I should be as happy as one can get. 

But I'm not. 

I'm actually questioning everything in my life. I'm in no way suicidal, but I have nothing to care for or to look forward too.

I've been brought up working. Since a very your age, I've put a LOT of efforts into building my future, spending a crazy amount of time working and investing. I'm not realizing that I have no hobbies: no actual life. 

I have no family : only an amazing father, who was adopted, so no other siblings or whatnot. 

I've tried a few things. I've tried hanging out with friends. Reading. Running. Drowning myself in work or in alcohol. 

But I can't find happiness. 

I find myself thinking about her at least 100 times a day. For the most stupid things. And I know I wasn't generally happy with her, but I... Feel so lonely, so empty and useless. 

I need advice, reddit. I could virtually do anything in the world. I have nothing stoping me from anything... Yet, I can't even find motivation to smile or feel alive. 

What should I do? What would you do if you were in my situation?

Well last night we got super high and went on Omegle with his friend. It was all fine until I started getting SUPER bad anxiety. Like BAD. I was freaking out and paranoid someone would get our location and stuff. That kind of anxiety. Probably shouldn’t have smoked but there was no turning back at that point. So anyway I go lay on the ground and they continue to go on Omegle. Every couple of minutes my best friend would look at me and ask “are you sure you’re okay?” And every time I’d say “No I’m freaking out I have super bad anxiety” then he’s say “dude you just need to breathe and chill” then they’d go right back to Omegle.

61,"I need some adult perspective on this potential opportunity in my life.

I am a incoming freshman as a state university. Technically, I am a sophomore so I am a year ahead but also technically I am still a freshman since it’s my “first year” at this university. 

So I got connected to an individual that helped me get my foot in the door for an internship at my university for a specific office. However, I am now being considered for a full time salaried position at the SAME office. 

The internships pays $14.40 (above minimum wage by $3.40) it’s flexible with school, no weekends. I’ll be able to work on school SOMETIMES during the job. 

The salaried job would be 27k-30k starting. Full benefits. M-F typical 9-5 jazz. This would be my first salaried job (of course, I’m 18). I would get a DISCOUNT on tuition in my university (so instead of paying 5.5k a semester, it’d be more like 1-2k). 

I don’t know what would be best, I can see pro’s and con’s in both ones. My college is already paid for (college fund), but obviously the fund only has so much, and a discount would be awesome.

I love the team I would be working with (the same for either position), my mentor really BELIEVES in me and would love to have me either way. 

Just so everyone knows, the internship/salaried is in more of the “business” world. I am interested in business, but also interested in health and life sciences too (which I’m checking this semester if I have the stamina/an actual passion for).

Like I drove to her place just so that I could pick her up because she didn't have access to her own car and I still made time for her even after I was in no mood to go out, but on top of all that she was ""punishing"" me?

79,"Hey everyone, this is my first post, so I am a little nervous. 
I recently moved to an apartment complex and I’m not really used to community living. I am a grad student (which means very little free time, especially during the day) and one of the things I really enjoy in my life is playing my cello. 
The only time I have for practicing is in the evening (around 8 P.M.) and I’m worried that by doing so, I might irritate my neighbors, but on the flip side I don’t have anywhere else I can go to practice. I try to be considerate with how loudly I play (keeping the mute on the whole time), but I still worry. Do you think it’s okay to practice at this time of night? I just don’t really know what to do or what is considered “acceptable community protocol”. 
Thank you in advance for any advice!",21Aug2019,2
80,"I am 24, have friends, though I wouldn't call any of them my best friend.  I attend school, part of clubs, an important member of the student government.  I play video games, listen to music, draw artsy things for my wall. I have a job, live with my parents, and every night I stare at the ceiling never satisfied with the day. In between classes, I read my books, wander the halls often alone and today a friend called me out and I cant stop thinking she is right... I am lonely.

I think I've been lonely for years since my best friend moved across the world (Literally, I live in the US and he moved to Taiwan).  Sure we talk every once and a while but I just don't have a best friend anymore.  I'm not freaking out like this is the end of the world but I cant shake this sadness from the realization that...

81,"I’m 18. Born in South Africa, moved to New Zealand when I was 7 and now for the last 10–11 years I’ve been living in Australia. 
I’ve found that in those last 10 years let’s say, my family and I have been fighting to obtain residency. But every year we’ve applied we’ve been rejected, whether it be a law change, our background or my dad’s age. You see my dad has been providing for my family for years, and in the last couple of years been difficult because he’s reaching retirement age. My mom is terminally ill, diagnosed with Scleroderma, or as most people would know it as Systemic Sclerosis. And autoimmune disease that’s killing her, and is without a known cure. I have an older brother, that ultimately wants fuck all to do with us. I have an older sister that as of this is married and ready to move on and start a family. And she too has an autoimmune disease, that’s slowly shutting down her thyroid. Then there’s me. Who has no where to turn, I can’t talk to some of the people that are in my life in fear of judgement, or being a burden. I can’t talk to my immediate family because they’ve got their own shit to worry about. I have so many dreams and realistic ambitions, that I found have seemed to feel virtually impossible. I’ve been diagnosed with clinical depression, severe anxiety, Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome and other things. And I’m just a high school student trying to complete my final year. Though due to recent events, my anxiety attacks, panic attacks, depression and decline in health, almost lack of immune system to fight off common colds and flus. I’m now failing my final year. The only other way for me to complete my finals, costs $800-$1200 a year to complete. If I was to go to a university through a pathway course, admission to most university are anywhere between $2000-$9000 a course. And in the last week I’ve found out that me fighting to stay in this country is splitting my family up. Causing a rift between us. And that my mother would rather go stay with my dad in South Africa, a country I haven’t been in since I was 7. Than stay here and wait for a possibility of us gaining residency in Australia. I’ve been told that I should just “Do what I want to do!” And that I’m being selfish among other colourful things. But I don’t know what it would mean that I go and complete my last year of high school in South Africa, the curriculum is different. I’m not familiar with the country like the rest of my family. Everyone I knew from there have either moved to other countries or died in the last 12 years. And let’s not forget the unemployment rate that’s still high for people drags out of high school and university. And the still increased crime rate. But ultimately I either stay in Australia and live by myself, I go back to South Africa where I don’t know it’ll benefit me. So my choices are I continue to live by myself or move to place that’s foreign to me, that holds nearly no sentiment to me, because of the racism I grew up
With, the hateful things said to me a black child, towards my family all white. I’m at breaking point. What do I do?

88,"A little information 

I’m a 20 year old female. I just got a new job about 4 days ago. And everything have been great until today.

Today I met a coworker and he just kinda made me feel uncomfortable. I have been sexually assaulted before so I put up more of a guard with men. So I’m post on here to see if it’s all in my head or if it is something I should worry about. 

If it is something I should worry about what should I do? I don’t want to cause trouble at my new job...

So this is what happened...

Today I had to work with a person I hadn’t met before. He is a older man about 40 I would guess. 

So i was working in the same area as him and he walked over to introduce himself. He held out his hand and I shook it... but he held onto my hand longer than a person should. Like I had let my hand go limp and tried to pull back but he held on.

Later on he moved his stuff closer to where I was and started chatting. He kept asking me a bunch of questions. He asked where I live, what foods I like, if I ever wore shorts or skirt or dresses (I was wearing skinny jeans) 

He then started saying that we should hangout when we aren’t working. I told him I was very busy with college about to start and work. He then said “well you said you live in ..... city right? That is an hour away from my house I can come pick you up and take you out to eat”  I told him no thank you and I was very busy and I didn’t think my boyfriend would like it.

After I turned him down he then said “well how about I drive you home and we can grab a bite to eat” I turned him down once again and he left it at that for a little bit. 

Later on the other coworkers had been called away so it was just us... 

He kinda lowered his voice almost a whisper
He then says “I will worship the ground you walk on” “I would show you new galaxies” “can I have your phone number” I said no to all. 

I’m a little worried because at some point I might have to work at night alone with him... I’ve never been in this situation with a coworker. So I have no idea what to do...",21Aug2019,1

Dad 1: When I was a kid, my bio dad didn't love or care about me at all. He was not mean but not nice or anything. He was obsessed with my mom. Turns out his dad was a pedophile and I think he had these same urges (I can give details if it helps). He had a lot of anger and paranoia. Lots of yelling and breaking things.

Dad 2: I got a step dad at 9. I was protective of my mom. We did not get along at first but eventually we got along great. Nothing to report until I'm in my 30s. My sister (1 year older, drug addict, borderline personality) says he is molesting her. We think it's bs. She goes to jail for 2 years. Last March,  I get texts and pics and videos from her. He was using her sexually for drug money. He was never inappropriate with me and I was shocked. 

I feel like there can't be a father figure that isn't tainted with inappropriate feelings. It took until I was in my late 20s to be okay to be in a room with a man alone.

I want to forgive. I think Dad 2 went through a breakdown. My mom is back with him. I believe in people forgiving and if you held us all up to the worst moments of our life no one would pass judgement.

I was named after him. I’m 25. My mother watched his movies, and my decided my name after watching Point Break. I always thought we had so much in common. He’s a great guy with a likable personality, but with a tragic backstory. Like me. Outside of that, we have similar interests. Motorcycles, sci-fi stuff, etc. I used to work at a motorcycle dealership. 

I am deaf, and I wear a cochlear implant. It’s super advanced technology, almost in a sci-fi way. I found it so awesome that he will star as Johnny Silverhand, a character that uses bionic technology in a futuristic environment (his arm). Not to mention his role from The Matrix, and other similar roles.

I always looked up to him and thought he is the pinnacle of man I should be.  Like him, my father was nonexistent. The older I get, the more we seem to have in common.

96,"I was going to post this onto r/coins and other numerology subs, but they seem to primarily be for posting coin photos rather than discussions. 


I've been collecting coins for many years, since I was maybe 16 I've had an avid interest. Over the years, my eyesight has gotten worse to a point where I'm at about 90% vision in one of my eyes, and 1% in the other (meaning I can detect light flashes, not much else). 


Pretty much, the only big coin shop in my area (that I'm aware of) seems unwelcoming to newcomers. This isn't to say they won't do business, but if you look like you're just standing around or don't know what you want your being welcome may be cut short. They have a great collection and I'm happy to do business with them, but I have a visual impairment that prevents me from seeing half of the merchandise unless its within two feet of me, let alone if its in a case and a few shelves down. I get it, there's literally kilograms of silver in the shop, you don't want thieves, but frankly not everyone will know exactly what they want when they enter the shop. People who are fully sighted and who like myself have a visual impairment.


I remember I asked about coins in Asia since at that point I didn't really know what I wanted, and the person in the shop brought out 4-5 huge binders. I barely got through the first one (combing through all of them alphabetically) before he asked if I found what I wanted. I had found maybe one or two, but was unsure about purchasing one of them when I saw another coin that caught my eye. When I had to put that unsure one back the look on the worker's face (not sure if owner or an assistant) was one of ""Why didn't you tell me before/just leave it"".

97,"So recently my life has gone to shit. My girlfriend (also F22) of almost a year left me. I’m having to move back in with my parents because of it (we were supposed to get an apartment and move out at the end of this month but obviously we can’t do that anymore, and I don’t have money nor time to find my own place). I was going through stress of trying to get back in school after two years of taking a break, which was an extremely difficult process. And now because of all of these things starting a couple of weeks ago, stress induced nausea has caused me to lose almost 12 lbs. I can’t eat, so I’m too weak to go to work (I have to carry big trays), and so my finances are crumbling. 

On the way home from my parents’ tonight, I started having a panic attack after letting my mind overthink. It got so bad to the point where I couldn’t breathe, my stomach and chest were tight as fuck, and my face, hands, and wrists were becoming so unbearably tingly and then numb. My vision was blurred. I could barely even grab my phone to call someone, my first instinct was to call my ex and she didn’t answer. It made me panic harder. So I called my close friend and she talked me through it. Now I’m home, feeling better after smoking a bowl. The only thing that really calms me down.

I have an easier time talking to girls now, and similarly that isn’t enough and I want more. Like I compare myself to everybody and everything  is a competition, and I just want to zone out for a couple seconds, but my brain never seems to let me. This is where weed has played a big part in my life, bc weed makes me less anxious, more motivated, I don’t overthink things, and I’m more confident.

I don’t know if it’s just a multitude of things that are bring me down, and right now I’m unsatisfied that I’m living with my parents while going to college, I don’t have a set major, I’ve never had a gf, and there’s just little things here and there that are starting to get to me. 

Something specifically that I was mad about is that I’m 19 and my mom will want me home by 10 when it’s summer, and she’ll act like it’s a really big deal, and she’s so paranoid, and my dads just not there, and he’s negative for everything, and I just want to be alone. I feel like this is some kind of teenage angst, but when you hear about all the cool shit your friends or cousins have done, and then you take a look at yourself, then I start to feel like I’m so constrained and trapped, and it makes me depressed and anxious. You hear about their midnight adventures and the concerts that they went to a couple hours away on a road trip, then I just feel so defeated and sad. It’s such a battle to do anything, and I’m just sick of it, and I’m sick of everything.

At the same time maybe I’m just blaming some of my problems on them when it could be something else, like my immaturity, selfishness, ungrateful ness, whatever, but I can’t help to feel like just a dumb, hopeless little kid.

I can’t even start to think about this stuff for too long before I need to smoke weed, so I can chill out and balance my mood. I just want my family to leave me alone, and I just want to be able to experience what everybody else experiences, or go out and do things I want to do.

I feel like I should be really happy right now, because I’m in a fairly good position and I’m taking classes that I like but everything just feels like it’s in black and white or something. I feel that there’s a piece is missing and I’m not sure where it went.

I don’t want to do any of my hobbies anymore. I barely do enough work to pass just out of pure stress and all I want to do is sleep, lay around and eat. That’s all I feel like I have the energy for anymore. 

The worst part is, one of the biggest sources of happiness for me just hasn’t been giving that same vibe for me anymore. It’s not that they changed or anything, in fact I love them more than ever and they’re extremely happy right now I just can’t seem to absorb those feelings right now? 

I can’t sleep either. I should honestly be exhausted because I’m doing more work and being more active throughout a day now because I’m finally in school again. Despite that, I’ve been getting maybe 5 hours tops in a night? (that’s pretty low for me I always try to get at least 8-9)

I just feel a bit hopeless right now. I want to go back to myself from a year ago where I was just so excited about everything and I wanted to paint, draw, journal, and do all sorts of things. I had so much passion then but it’s like someone sucked it out of me.

Honestly, I have no clue why this happened. I’m usually fairly self aware and can notice changes in my emotions and what’s causing them but this hit me so suddenly for no apparent reason. A few months ago I kept thinking to myself “I love this moment. I love my friends the world is beautiful. I’m happy.” and now it’s more like “Is it really another day? I’m surely disappointing my friend right now. I can’t be there for her emotionally and she’s in a bad spot I’m a terrible friend. Everything is disgusting. I’m completely miserable” Nothing has changed though. Everything is the same. It’s like a switch clicked off in my brain and made me sad.

118,"I went to a music festival for the first time last weekend. Had a few friends that were going to come with me but in the weeks leading up to it they all flaked out. I had already purchased my tickets months in advance and didn’t pay the insurance incase I wanted a refund so I figured hey why not? I like music and I’m a pretty independent person as it is so I knew I could have a good time on my own. So I took the 5 hour drive to the venue and set up camp (3 day, 3 night event). On the first day I didn’t really talk to many people just went about my business letting lots of pent up energy out on the dance floor. Had a great time. Definitely got lonely and was scanning the crowd looking for a group that I would enjoy kicking it with. Didn’t find any groups, but while scanning the crowds I always seemed to notice this shy looking girl walking around the venue seemingly not accompanied by anyone also. But the night set in and the whole park was dark so I decided to just finish the first day strong solo. In my tent I kept thinking how much more fun I’d be having if my dang friends would have been there and made the decision that I would without a doubt find a group to be a part of for the rest of the event. I ended up just going hard in the paint on the dance floor until I couldn’t go any more. Then I saw her again. She was always in the back of the crowd just listening it seemed like. My heart was still pounding and I was super pumped from the dance floor and I decided to go talk to her. So I introduce myself and asked if she felt like buddying up for the rest of the festival. She was super exited and we went on an amazing 2 day adventure enjoying music we both loved and at a venue with lots and lots of great, fun, funny things to do. The whole time I restricted myself from getting physical with her other than a hug at the end of each night in the hopes to not catch any feelings (she lives in the area so wasn’t camping at the venue). We both had an awesome time and not once did I feel awkward or like I wasn’t enough when I was with her (I gots low self esteem fam). I even met her Aunt, Uncle, Cousins combo at the event and they were really cool too. I had a few dudes that I had never met come up to me saying dumb “suuhhh duude” type stuff she had some girls come up saying how beautiful she looked. I even noticed a few older couple would look at us together and smile. We laughed making fun of how people can be so dumb. So skip to the end of the event. I walk her to her car. We shot the shit the whole way and anytime either of us brought up how we were gonna have to part ways we would just burst out in random songs. I was sitting on the sidewalk while she put her bags in her car and she finally asks me straight forward, “So am I ever gonna see you in my entire life again??” I told her that I hoped so and that she was a really cool person. So she asked if I would come to this event next year and I said of course. Then there was a long pause and we made some of the most intense eye contact I had ever had in my life. So I stood up and hugged her really tight and explained to her how a year was simply too long for my patience. We agreed that when either of us plan on going to events or trips or anything that we would try to go together. My plan of no physical contact had completed failed. She gets in her car and we say goodbye. I instantly turn around and remember that I didn’t even kiss her so ran back and we made out for a looong while. It felt like the first time I had ever kissed a girl again. She asked if what we were doing was a mistake and I said “I don’t think so”. I asked her the same and she just smiled and shook her head “no”. Then we said goodbye one last time and parted ways. The next day I drove the 5 hours back home and we went back to our lives. I’ve never been in a healthy relationship, only flings and shallow pursuits, but this seems like the start of something real. I can’t stop thinking about her and I keep trying not to fall into the trap of imagination. So with that being said here is the life that I have completely manufactured for the two of us hah! I have a really good friend that is somewhat of a mentor to me; I remember him telling me the story of how he had met his wife and that when they finally figured out how to be together and make it work they planned and accomplished going on a year long road trip across all the continental US. I had always wanted to follow in his footsteps and make this happen for myself (would love to go solo even to meet all the people across the country that I’ve gamed with constantly for years) but my experience with women up until this point has not been the best. But I think I found someone who I can be myself with and she can be herself with me. I really, truly believe we have the potential. She loves to travel and just see the world and meet new people just like me. So my hang up right now is I don’t know if this is based in reality and we should have a long distance relationship until I can’t take the distance anymore then I move to where she lives (she is in college currently) and just grind out as much money as I can while she finishes school to save up for this trip. Or is this all just a complete fantasy and that weekend is just a dream that is going to end in a nightmare no matter what and we will slowly drift into nothingness? Those are the only two angles I can see right now and I’m really leaning on the “try making it work” approach but I don’t know if that just sounds too crazy from an outside perspective. It is crazy. I am crazy about her. I’m in love, and I never thought I would say that again. 

P.S. We have stayed in contact over small amounts of texts, but they always leave my heart warm. (I’m 23 and she’s 20 if anyone is curious)



TL;DR - Friends flaked out of going to festival. Went solo, fell in love. Want to make dreams come true with her but don’t know how or if they’re even based in reality.",21Aug2019,1
119,"I own my own home and live close to family (brother is 10 minutes away, parents are 30 minutes away).
My mom has always had a copy of my house key for emergencies,  but she also drops things off at my house. To be fair, she tells me or asks me before hand before stopping by. But I would rather have a full day's notice.

My younger brother has moved out and into his own apartment. My mom made a copy of MY house key to give to him in case of emergencies. She made an off handed comment one day as I was busy and took my non answer for approval while I wasnt really listening.

I understand emergencies,  but honestly if there is one I'd rather not have my brother found me dead or dying. 

When I told my mom no, she got hurt and tried to explain her reasoning and then got irritated. Now she's upset and threatening to give both keys back and acting like I'm a villian. 

 I'll probably give in because my only reasons are feeling anxious. Comments are always made about the state of my house (I'm not messy or slovenly,  I'm just cluttered as I have a lot of hobbies/projects always going) and my parents have a history of cleaning up, but throwing everything away, without my knowledge or approval when I was a kid. (Maybe I need therapy). I just dont like not being in control of who enters my house and more importantly WHEN they enter my house.

I trust my family,  of course,  to never let strangers in. I just cant explain my hesitation.

So Redditors,  lay it on me. Should I just let it go and trust them to maintain my boundaries?",21Aug2019,1
120,"So I work in analytics and this one guy interviewed for a data scientist position. My boss was doing the interviewing, I was just there to meet the guy since he could potentially be my future coworker. Anyway, after the interview the guy tracked me down on LinkedIn and asked me out. I was flattered, and for a month I didn’t tell anyone.

Today, my boss had that employee’s name and two others’ names written on a board with a score next to each person for their people skills, tech skills, potential, etc. My boss then asked me between the guy who asked me out and another guy, which one did I think was better. I felt I was in a bad position because if I favored the guy who hit on me, it would give him an unfair advantage. So I fessed up that the guy tracked me down on LinkedIn and asked me out, and told my boss exactly what the guy had written. 

My boss thought it was funny, but commented that the interviewee was “too aggressive in doing whatever he wants” and that the guy was stupid for asking me out when there was a chance my boss would find out. So it sounds like it had been a toss-up between that interviewee and one other, and now that interviewee won’t get the job.

I feel guilty that a guy lost out on a great opportunity because I repeated a private conversation to my manager. Did I do the wrong thing? Should I have kept it a secret?",21Aug2019,1

122,"Just 2 years back, I was so idealistic and was always so hard-working and ambitious. I'm not sure if it's growing up or life taking a toll on me, but I'm now left jaded, lost, and confused as to what I want to do in life.

Growing up and just before college, I was convinced I wanted to be a writer. I loved literature, reading, and writing. When it came time to apply for university, I was encouraged to go for business instead of English because I was advised that English isn't a profitable major. I didn't prioritize reading at all during college, but I wrote personal pieces here and there. Not as much had I actually majored in English, however. So, I continued with business. It was a struggle getting through college, I mainly focused on my studies, but I finally made it and managed to graduate. Worthy to note that I succeeded in my accounting and finance classes.

After college, I almost completely stopped writing except occasionally. I took on a sales job- the first job I could get and my first real, professional job besides part-time work I did in college. It was a fun job, and it allowed me my first semblance of freedom after graduating- I went out partying for almost every weekend that entire week and a half. As time went on, though, I began to see what it's really like for a woman in sales- get subtly flirted with and border-line harassed by men at work, having to feel like you're stuck in a perpetual boys' club, etc. Also, to me, sales was pretty stressful with the quota pressure. So, I quit that job because I didn't see it going anywhere for me.

After that, I did a few odd jobs here and there (mostly in hospitality) to make some money to make ends meet. Until I got my next full-time job. I quit them all due to sexual harassment and uncomfortable working environments. I also just wanted to make use of my college degree, preferably in an office job (not that there's anything wrong with service-based jobs).

After that, I continued to look for business-type work related to my degree, to no avail, So I took on an admin position I got. I didn't have a good feeling about it, but took it mostly out of desperation, since I needed a full-time job at the time. While I learned a lot, I ended up getting fired 4 months later because I was just a bad fit for it. The job was more than hard, it was simply unreasonable. And I am an abstract thinker anyway, 

So, now I'm left feeling even more lost and confused than ever. I was advised to study computer science, and I do find it interesting, but that takes time. I do believe if I tired hard enough I could get back into writing, but that would take a substantial while and a lot of work on it- especially if I dedicated my time to a blog or novella/novel. 

I'm also struggling a bit to pay rent- jobs seem to be so precarious these days, especially if you don't have in-demand skills that are valuable to employers/allow you to earn high-amounts of money. I don't know what else I can do to be able to live freely on my own besides taking on service jobs again- my entire family is so against the idea of my ever living with roommates to save money. They deride every idea I have as immature.

125,"I went to an interview at a consignment store. Only it wasn’t much of an interview, the manager and assistant manager just asked if I could deal with high stress and fast paced situations and noted hat they get call outs all the time on the weekends so I would need to be sure to be at the store on the weekend. 
They told me they would start me at $13 which is one dollar more than the minimum wage where I live. I loved the sound of that and joked around say “wow, can I work full time here?”
They both looked at each other and then back at me saying “uh-yes.”
And I also like the sound of that but found it weird they would offer me full time when they hadn’t seen my work ethic yet. 
I told them I would need that to be promised or in writing because I wouldn’t want to risk leaving my current job if I wasn’t going to be full time.
And they told me “sure” but it didn’t fee sincere.

After the interview, everything was fine and told me to start work this coming Saturday.

When I got home I looked up the consignment I interviewed at, just to see what customers thought about the store I was going to be working at.
It’s Yelp page was blown up with complaints and some really bad stories about the “manager” that fit the same description as the manager who interviewed me that day.
Lots of, yelling at employees in front of customers, making them feel inferior, intimidated, even with customers that asked about what times and when to come back for their cash after dropping off their clothes sell.
Someone on the page claimed she was a former employee and explained how toxic the work environment was how her mental health was being affected but she needed the money and stayed for too long dealing with  the verbal abuse from the manager. 

I don’t know. It’s really all hearsay. But I cannot work in another toxic work environment, I have had one too many experiences that made me think very little of myself and I now have finally made it to a good place in my life. I cant go back to something that like.
Should I give it a try? Or should I trust my gut and let her know that I decided to withdraw from the offer.?",21Aug2019,2
126,"So earlier today, I was hanging out with my friends around town, and while leaving McDonalds, I tripped (on 3 stairs 😂) and slammed the back/side of my head on the concrete. I was out for like a minute apparently, and my friend’s older brother drove me home. I got home, and my dad says unless I think it’s absolutely an emergency, he’ll take me to the doctor tomorrow. (He couldn’t today because he had to go to work.) So me, trying to be tough, said I was fine, and payed on the couch with an ice pack. That was like 3 hours ago, I just woke up like 15 minutes ago, and I swear to you when I rose up from laying down, the back of my skull moved.

To my knowledge, I actually have no cuts or otherwise damage on the outside of my head, but I can reach behind my head and shift this part of my skull up and down. I’m still pretty tired, and could be a bit loopy, but I feel like I detached the full back of my skull. My dad’s not home, I can’t drive. Idk.

128,"Hey, ( M 25 ) here  
So After doing some recent research into my family history I found out about some dark stuff that no one in my family told me about aside from a less than 15 minute conversation that was \[not even joking\] a yes or no answer from the other party. It actually has been killing me since I found out, especially because I found out most of the details through google on a page that would only let me view it for 5 minutes.  I don't really know how to get the information I have been looking for without having to pay some ridiculous amount of money that I cannot afford or having to drive hours to the state that the incident occurred in.  Due to the fact that the people who have the information are no longer alive or people who would rather not talk about it or just being blocked by sites online that just don't tell me anything unless I pay. Maybe I'm just a nosy need to know it all or maybe I'm just curious because its something I have limited information on. Either way I think I deserve to know about it.  I'm worried and possibly even scared to post this because of what it could possibly do to my life as I live it right now. I just got myself a good job and paying off debts and as of right now I need them to continue living my life until I can afford to move out on my own. I still live at home with the same person who wont tell me and has told me to stop looking for information, I cant stop asking the questions and I need answers.

I am not looking for justice, recompense, or even revenge. All I want is the knowledge to know if what I have believed in my whole life was a lie that I myself have been so angry at the wrong groups.  I guess what I'm looking for is advice on what to do or how to do it, or maybe all I want is just to have the story heard and for others to know that the truth is worth the risk. Maybe one of you has gone through a similar thing and can kinda steer me the right way? Its sad to say but as someone who really hasn't had any real fears the fear of this person finding out is terrifying, I don't even know if this is right.   
Anyway: Here is some small background details but if you think more information is needed I can tell more about what I do know.   
When I was a baby my uncle passed away, leaving behind a trail of questions that I wouldn't know how to ask until 22 years later. Or even want to know about.   
For whatever reason my family that my uncle was on the side of is very secretive about everything, Nothing that is illegal or morally reprehensible to my knowledge but if you knew the people I was talking about you would know how I feel, and feel the same way too.   
The death was sudden and wasn't at all what you would call natural, and from the little information I know was in fact someone's if not some people's fault. There was a trial about the incident but those transcripts and documents aren't visible to myself, which is what I really want to know... What really happened. Why I had to lose out on the person and the memories I could have had with them, I know how that sounds and I kind of hate myself for posting it. I feel like anyone who has had someone taken from them before they had a chance to know them feels the same way. From the brief story I was told, the people who my family thought were guilty were able to get away with it due to them having a in a way to put it kind of immunity that others wouldn't dare question. Yes, what we are talking about is a murder.  I'm afraid that by giving more information now I may reveal myself to the person I was referring too and be stopped before I can even post a comment.    
 I just want to know if there is a way to figure out the information I need so I can actually know how to feel and like I said before figure out if the system I believe in had actually failed my own family.

When I came home, I saw a large dent and the car’s paint on my bumper. It was about 40 minutes after the incident, so the car had likely already left.

I met a dude on a dating app. We hit it off talking right away.  We talked for months all day everyday (and still do).  During those months we had plans to meet up but he cancelled 3 times.  I gave up and stopped talking to him.  

Well we reconnected about a month later and picked up right where we left off but with no expectation of meeting this time. I casually mentioned that I had been on a date that day (I texted him afterwards) and that it was lame.  He asked if i was trying to get him going.  I said ""no, i didn't think you cared"" to which he replied ""I'm taking you out tomorrow."" And we finally met up. 

My friends say this is a red flag because his motivation is either jealousy or he perceived a challenge. I, with my bad picker, thought it was adorable that he got a little jealous and it sparked him wanting to finally meet me.  

We spent the day together but the times we've hung out since then haven't been longer than an hour.

So, I'm graduating from a health professional residency/fellowship from a smallish town in Delaware and I'll be ready to work full time next April. However I want to get the fuck out of here and live in a bigger city. Here are a few of my dilemmas:

* I want to live in a bigger city but not TOO big like LA, NYC, etc due to saturation of my particular job and cost of living/taxes. I will be making a pretty good amount of money (let's just say around 200K an year) but with a shit ton student loans, so I'm still being cautious. 
   * I suppose my budget for apartment rent would be around $1300-$2000 a month.
* I want to live in a city with a relatively high percentage of Asians (I know it's weird, but I've never lived anywhere that had many aZn people - think it'd be an interesting experience). My parents would also be happy to hear that I'm at least making some sort of effort in finding an asian wifey (and no, they're not the typical tiger asian parents. I've mainly dated white girls so they're not totally opposed to it).
* I want to live in a city with good food, fun nightlife, and good music.
* I want to live in a city with a relatively high youngish professional population.
* I want to live in a city with low humidity.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Here are a list of cities I've thought about so far with the negatives/positives in my book:*  
\* **Seattle, WA** \- only problem is that it rains so much. good food. decent amt of asians. possible oversaturation of job  
\* **Orange County, CA** \- possibly too much traffic? I actually don't know anything about the OC...besides that shitty show. probably great weather and hot ass girls. great amount of asians. no clue about housing market  
\* **Dallas, TX**  \- great job market. cheap housing. okay asian population. don't want to get shot up  
\* **Austin, TX** \- great job market (prob not as good as dallas). cheap housing. cool music scene. okay asian population. don't want to get shot up  
\* **Chicago, IL** \- cold ass winters. that deep dish tho. okay asian population. pretty affordable housing  
\* **Jersey City, NJ** \- pretty expensive housing for fairly shitty places. NYC poser. okay asian population.   
\* **Northern VA area (Arlington, Fairfax, DC?)** \- high asian population. affordable housing...I guess?   
\* **Boston, MA** \- highly saturated job market. pretty expensive housing. okay asian population  
\* **Philadelphia, PA** \- relatively cheap rent for a big city. okay asian population.   


&amp;#x200B;

There's nothing really tying me down. No serious girlfriend. Parents don't care if I live close by. etc etc etc. So I suppose it's a good problem to have. HOWEVER, I've lost sleep over this whole thing... researching til 4 AM for the past 3-4 months and not having a clue as to where I should go; which is really weird because I've lived a pretty happy go lucky life. I guess it's because I'm finally going to be done with ""school"" and starting a new ""grown up"" chapter in my life. Also, in terms of my dating life, I feel like I've been sleeping around too much without having an actual goal of seriously dating someone - at my age, I think it's time to settle down.  


If you guys have any advice or any new city suggestions I'd really appreciate it.   


Thanks guys!

138,"Two year ago I used to live on my own, and study full-time. On the surface it seemed that I was doing well, but I wasn't. I was avoiding duties like shopping for food and choosing to only leave the house at night. I subsequently lost a lot of weight. This lead me to drop out after a semester at Uni. I feel like the proper diagnosis of my situation is Burn-out syndrome. If I am wrong please correct me.

I have now moved back home, and have been here for a year. When I came home I was quite erratic, or rattled, and to some extent took it out on my parents. I have also lost the ability to manage impulses, and as a result my behavior has become more sensation seeking.

My main problem that I cannot understand is. Since I have returned home my father i suppose has suffered a injury to his ego, as he quite often boasted of me. Holding a high sense of pride which has caused dysfunction in the family as it comes across as in your face sought of. It is almost as if we are caught in a dance, me and my father, and as it continues we are both getting more narcissistic. How do you think I can honestly approach my father about this, so that I can perhaps end it.

My father seems to lack introspection and doesn't want to admit his involvement. I tend to react with anger, which removes any sense of right I have. If I have it. I cannot calm down from being rattled, and practice mindfulness, so that I can possibly recover from this crisis, because my father is there ready to argue or use me as a way to handle frustrations. He hasn't left the Parent-child dynamic, and I end up being silenced with ""this is my home not yours"" ( I am still heavily attached to the only place i grew up in) or ""I am the father listen to me"". Sometimes i just want proper reasoning. Also I am quite often guilt tripped, because I am unemployed. I cannot de-stress in any way with out being made to feel guilty.

I think I am constantly being prevented from recovering from a crisis. which is leading me to develop more anger, more neurosis, or more narcissism. I know what I am saying is a bit over the place. I just want to know how I can escape this.",21Aug2019,1

I've had some girl friends but they were few and far between. On top of that I'm somewhat antisocial. The less I know someone, the quieter and distant I am when talking with them. So my experience with this kinda stuff is pretty much zero.

I met her in one of my college classes. It was a very small class with only 8 people(it was a brand new course the school just started) and I decided to sit a seat away from her. It was a hands on class and I didn't want to intrude on her work space. For the first half of the semester we talked quite a bit. Although, since the class was small and everyone was in earshot of each other, I didn't talk to her about things that I thought would be too personal. 

So I attempted to tell her I like her before class one day but completely froze up and changed the subject when I realized I was just standing there awkwardly. Although I think she may have caught on to me. A class or two later she let slip that she had a boyfriend while I was helping her on a project. I died inside a little bit. There went my chance of ever dating her. especially since she later revealed that she lives part time with him. After learning this I was crushed. I knew I wouldn't be able to date her so I settled with just trying be her friend. A real friend at least, not one that you completely forget about after the semesters over. I just wanted to be in her life at this point.

But as the semester drew to close she started talking to me less and less and on the last day of class she tried to leave without even saying goodbye. So I panicked and asked for her Instagram. she told me it was private and that she doesn't add just anyone. So I asked for her number and.... she just left. She turned around and walked out without even responding. I said was crushed before but this... really hurt. I was on the verge of tears. But I was able to hold myself together until I got home.

I'm sure I'm the reason why she treated that way. I didn't realize this until a little bit after the semester ended but I was way too clingy. I would wait for her after class since we both walked in the same direction afterwards. I did this almost every class. Its not I like followed her though. We would talk about stuff most of the time and she never told me that I was bothering her. However, after realizing this I wanted to apologize and hope that I would be able to become actual friends with her.

It's been 3 months since then. I tried finding her on social media but I had no luck. It wasn't until 2 days ago that I had made a linkedin account to do some job searching and there she was in my recommended connects list. At this point I don't know that to do. I've gone over so many different ways on how this conversation could go(both before and after I found her) that I've lost sleep over it(again, both before and after). It doesn't help either that linkedin is a professional site.

I really don't know what to do. Just thinking about her has hindered me so much in other aspects of my life. I just want to get know her but I feel like she hated me.

140,"Hey everyone! So long story short, I’ve had some issues with anxiety my entire life. However, a neck injury a few years ago forced me to drop out of school and put my life on hold. After a lengthy recovery l was able to take online classes and get my degree. I’m starting a new job in a few weeks (my first real job) but my extreme social anxiety has been causing me havoc, from not eating or sleeping well, to panic attacks. I can’t imagine getting up and out in the world every day after years of a quiet, mostly home bound life, going out to stores, dinner, etc. maybe 3-5 times a month. During these years I’ve lost touch with most friends and have relied on my family and one or two friends. Aside from speaking with a qualified professional, which I will do, can anyone offer some advice for my situation?",21Aug2019,1
141,"Hello,

I am an 18 year old male living in the United States. I am soon to start my studies at University which is the main cause for me to create this post.   


Some background information about me: I am the only child to parents who both come from Indian families. My parents grew up under very traditional standards, they were expected to study a very prestigious subject (such as medicine, law, engineering, etc.) and get married once their studies are complete. In some way they maintain these values with me, I'm expected to major in Computer Science and marry a nice Indian woman once I graduate. My entire family is quite large, consisting of many cousins who already have completed their studies in engineering. My family as a whole is expecting me to be like everyone of them, but I'm not.   


To start, I have absolutely no interest in studying Computer Science, I'm intimidated by the subject and quite honestly after studying CS for 2 years in High School, I still find no passion for it. With my classes starting next Monday, my parents are unaware that I've decided to major in business as I find genuine interest in it. I do feel sorry that they are paying for my tuition unaware of this, but that why I'm writing this, I need advice. 

In addition, I'm gay. I've never told anyone at all so technically this is my coming out. There is not one single gay member (other than myself) in my family consisting of over 30 people, nor have they ever supported the idea when I would bring it up. I used to brush my sexuality away and not think of it. Whenever my family told me that I'd marry a nice Woman I'd just smile and nod, but recent communication with them have made me aware of how soon they expect me married, and how I can't keep this lie in forever. In my family it is practically disgraceful to not get married by 25. 

The thought of my family finding out that I won't be an engineer like everyone else, and that I wont marry a nice Woman like everyone else has driven me into a serious depressive hole. I've already tried talking to my father and mother about a potential change of major and neither supported it, my mother specifically said to me that she wouldn't be able to proudly tell her family what I'm doing in life if I change majors. 

I love my parents a lot, and the thought of letting them down tears me apart. Almost so much that I feel willing to change my life to meet their expectations.   


As of now, I'm in a seriously sensitive mental state, reading some other people's threads on this subreddit made me cry, and I haven't left bed or eaten in about 16 hours. I'm not sure what to do anymore, I could tell my family everything, risking their disappointment, which I think would hurt me more than faking my life. What would you do?",21Aug2019,2

143,"Hi Reddit. I need some advice on relationship with my mother. Advice request and TLDR at bottom. Also happy to expand more on any part of the story. Lowkey considering ending it lol but I'm probably being dramatic. 

I'm 18 with a crisp $3000 USD in my bank account. Im enrolled to go to an expensive university in two weeks but haven't paid my tuition yet and just finished a huge fight with my mom. I haven't been the best daughter and all I seem to be is selfish. This is not the first major fight we had. 

FIGHT:
This started when I brought up that my grandmother loves all her grandchildren except me (heard her say it to her friend on the phone) and how I wanted to go somewhere with my friends. I started talking about how my grandmother hates me and my rough childhood. She then brought up her even rougher childhood and how she never blamed her parents. I said I just wanted some space from her since she's a bit strict (friends, curfew, grades, expenses, parties, etc.)

She talked about how all I do is spent time with my friends and I don't do anything for the family (give money, cook, clean, spend time, etc). She talked about how much she spent on me (she has spent a lot and worked incredibly hard to find good opportunities for me) and how she has saved up so much for this family and how I waste it all. She talked about how I only pretend to be a good daughter when I need her money and how she has to ask my permission to speak to me (she used to videochat me everyday which I did not like. I told her and she got mad. So I videochatted her every other day but since I was working long hours I was always grumpy or tired, which she did not like)

She talked about how I didn't want to live with her when she's older and how I'm only using her. She told me that she would give me a loan for school (that I would pay back each month) but would cut all contact and if I were to come to her house, I would have to pay rent. 

She does love me and she acts according to her culture, but I was brought up in a different culture so my expectations are different. 

Advice request: Should I try to repair this relationship and go back to being her daughter or give up and agree with her terms?

TLDR: Huge fight with mom. I'm a shitty daughter. Her proposal is to get a loan from her but stop being her daughter. Agree with her proposal or fight it?",21Aug2019,1

Girlfriend and i lived with one another in an apartment and we fought and argued and did everything a normal couple would. But we had broken up apparently but i was still sleeping in the same bed living in the same house and going to work in the same car.

So during that year or so of off and on. She was talking and come to find out sexting someone we worked with.:. Great.. so she decided to not tell me this until after we worked things out and got a house together.. btw.. she told me the day after i got arrested...for a petty weed charge 

So great we argue and fight and break up and make up again.. and now we have a kid... 


Now i have just learned that she actually went over to the guys house to smoke weed with him... and apparently he pressured her in to sex and raped her essentially.. 

 I’m kind of fuming with remorse and anger and all around feeling weakness that i couldn’t do anything and that she hid it from me. I’m grossed out that she even gave him the opportunity but wanting to murder the guy for defiling my mother of my child...

We’ve only known each for almost a year now, but we’ve gotten very close since then and now I consider him like a brother so it’s tough for me to live with the fact that a year from now I have to say goodbye to him. I know that I can always visit him, but odds are that he’ll be too busy.

160,"Hey folks, 

I'm pretty unsure on how to move forward in life and need some input. 

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, I don't like my job and realized it's never what I wanted to do in the first place. I'm still unsure of what I really want to do or what I'd be good at. But I'm thinking about a drastic career change and need some advice on how to go about it effectively. I have a MA is psychology, but I can't think of anything  that I want  to do that easily translates. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, I'm 29. I have a Masters in Psychology, but I've come to realize that it's not what I want to do. How I arrived at this point is a long story in-of itself, so I won't go into it. 

I have a job in my field and have been working in it for a few years now. I just.. I dont care if I grow in this field anymore. Once upon a time I had these grand plans of growing into this specialized expert. Instead, I'm not great at my job and I feel like I'm just faking it. I'm decent enough for now, but the whole thing has created a toxic mindset for me and it creating depression and anxiety issues (I'm looking into therapy and my Dr put me on some short-term anti-anxiety meds, for now). 

I took some time to reflect and evaluate everything (something I should have done ages ago). I asked myself ""why am I doing X?"" ""To get to Y."" ""Why do I want Y?"" and so on and so forth. I came to realize that I  didn't really like my field. I found it interesting. I had some unique perspectives to provide on occasion, but I'm not good at it and I'm not driven to perform on a personal level. 

&amp;#x200B;

During my reflection, I realized that I really just wanted to be in creative content without exposing myself to that level of criticism. So I chose a field where I could research how to make better creative content in hope of becoming a creator, without *being the* creator.  I now realize that that goal isn't feasible and I've put myself in a very awkward position both logistically and financially, as I'm still paying off my student loans and I'm considering going back to school (or at least community college to try out some different classes. I've never seen myself as a creator, but I've never really  considered it an option for me so I never entertained or put effort behind it. As such, I haven't taken any classes in art or writing. 

That said, I'm trying to open myself up to possibilities and be honest with myself of my wants and desires. I'm being drawn towards 3D animation. I spend a lot of time creating little cinematics in my head for fun and I think that fits. Based on some reading I've done, it's not a field that requires a degree, but based on portfolio and there are good open source tools like Blender so it wouldn't be the worst thing to get into.  

That's just one of many options, but that's where I'm getting stuck. I don't know where to start or how to move forward. 

Anyway, that's my situation in a nutshell. ""The best time to have started something would have been years ago, the second best time is now"", right?",21Aug2019,1

175,"Just looking for some third party insight here - much appreciated in advanced. 

I just recently met up with a friend I had met a couple years back; he was in town visiting the city I live in and we met for a drink. We had a good time catching up and he ended up staying the night. At the beginning of the week, he invited me to crash a trip he had planned for the weekend, if I wanted. Friday, the day he headed out, I last minute decided to join. Everything was great, really had a blast. 

The last day though, I kept getting this feeling that he was annoyed with me or something. I asked him and he said he wasn't and asked why I thought that; I told him it was just a vibe I was getting. He did mention later that day, something along the lines of him not just being there for sex. I told him I was simply just attracted to him and I didn't mean to come off like that. 

After I got on my flight, I sent a text just saying that thank you for the invite and that I had a good time. I apologized for making him feel like sex from him was all I was after again as well. When he did answer he just ignored what I had said. I couldn't stop thinking about it the next day, so just sent him a message asking if we were all good and I just couldn't get this feeling away. He said that everything was fine, but it all just still seems off; a gut feeling on my part. 

Am I overthinking all of this? I know I sound fucking crazy, but I just didn't want to end a fun weekend feeling that way and just can't figure out what to think. For sure just going to leave it as it is, but just wanted someone else's thoughts on it all, especially a guy's thoughts.",21Aug2019,1

He answered some questions I had about therapy and was just a nice person in general (he didn't have to be nice but he was). He's visiting next month so I told him that I can look into getting him discounted tickets if he wants. 




Now here comes my ""friend"". I've known her for like 5 years and she's not the best person, honestly I would call her a leech. I haven't spoken to her in almost 6 months and a couple minutes ago she just asked if I have any tickets she could buy. Obviously I explained that if I sell them I would get fired and that the free ticket is meant just to be given out. Now she wants to give me money to buy her discounted tickets (for her and her bfs 1 year anniversary). I'm obviously on the fence about this because we haven't even spoken in like 6 months and she just asks me for tickets out of nowhere.... Like wtf




What would you do? Should I give her the discount?",21Aug2019,1
177,"I started college really recently so maybe I just need some time. But here's the thing. I am quite an extroverted and outgoing person. I love talking to and meeting new people. Crowded places don't make me uncomfortable, etc. Going up and talking to someone? \*snap\* easy. My problem is, I can make a million surface level friends/acquaintances. But I have a hard time making real friends. I guess I don't wanna seem clingy. So, I'll meet someone, have a conversation with them, then go my own way.

After asking the staff not to clean my room (and I'm fairly sure putting up the card; I may have forgotten or it may have fallen down - it was back on the door), I came back to find one side of my fancy headphones on the nightstand and the remainder gone entirely.

181,"I’m not even sure where I begin on this. My mom has always been a very stubborn person, “my way or the highway” but would give way to reason some times. She is now 49 and my dad has retired.

Without going into my entire history of my life, she is very religious and a lot of her problems have gotten worse after she has started going to a new church that is evangelical christian. After my dad had a pinched vagus nerve and passed out while driving (me and my mother were in the car) she had developed a fear of driving. Not a fear of driving with my father but a fear of driving herself. It’s gotten so bad that she refuses to even talk herself up to going anywhere unless it’s to church or to get her nails done or go to her mom’s house. All are less than 5 mins away from our house. She won’t even go with us out to dinner. She refuses to travel. 

She is much more stubborn than she was before. She’s developed a self serving mentality and won’t do anything to make anyone but herself happy. She’s selfish and fails to have any gratitude for anything my dad or any one of us does for her. She’s not happy unless she gets her way about something. She is manipulative and twists everything you say around to be either an insult or a personal attack to her so she refuses to listen to any criticism at all. Sometimes I can’t even compliment her without getting yelled at. She is convinced that everything is my dad’s fault, as he constantly upsets her, when in reality it’s her inability to see things outside of her warped mentality. 

On top of that, she is almost basically delusional. She has told me she suspects my dad is cheating on her because he spends time as a contractor repairing houses for friends of his mother who are all elderly. This is just one example of the many things that she expresses jealousy about. She also has expressed paranoia and a serious fear that my father will kill her and cover it up. (They have been happily married for over 20 years and he would take a bullet for her). In any discussion she refuses to compromise her wishes and in any argument she gives up immediately when someone says something she doesn’t want to hear or accuses everyone of taking sides against her. 

Because of all of this, I’m wondering if anyone has literally any advice to help me because I don’t know at this point what else to do with her. I have lived 500 miles away from her for the past couple of years and I moved out when I was 17 because even though she was better a couple of years ago, she has still been unbearable for me to continue to live with. She has been toxic and manipulative to me my entire life to the point I had to start going to a psychiatrist for anxiety and rejection sensitive dysphoria when I was 8 years old because she made me so afraid of disappointing her or making her upset. Now that I’m older though I don’t let her manipulate me or have control over me and that causes more problems and for her to feel more upset and like she has no control. It’s getting to the point though that I can’t or don’t want to go home and see the rest of my family because I don’t want to see her. She is so delusional to the point when I come home she yells at me because I “never help her clean the house”... even though I haven’t lived there for three years. 

The people at her church fuel her paranoia and violent thoughts but I can’t get her to leave. They keep her around to use her because she’s very giving and willing to volunteer all the time but I don’t feel they genuinely care about her or want to see the best for her. I can’t tear her away from church because that’s all she feels she has left. My only thought process at this point is just to cut her off completely and let it get worse before it gets better. I can’t convince her to go to therapy alone because she fails to see that she is/has the problem. I can’t go to group therapy with her because I know she will be unable to handle what I have to say.

Anyways I figure I’d come here and hopefully get an outside perspective or some other advice from anyone in a similar situation. I’d just like to see my family together and not fighting all the time. Thank you to anyone for even reading my family nonsense.",21Aug2019,2

184,"So today me (14 yrs) and my mom were at a restaurant eating pizza for dinner and earlier I’d mentioned how it would be cool to wear long wigs since about 1 year ago I chopped my locks off. She sort of ignored it, and I didn’t think much of it. However at dinner, I brung it up again and showed her a wig that I’ve been looking at, and she straight up, looked me dead in the eye, and said “haha that’s such a stupid idea.” I was shocked at this and she quickly said “uh just kidding?” In a sort of “cant you take a joke” way. Whenever she tries to redeem herself after a nasty comment, she’s so incredibly fake about it. Here’s the thing though. I have bad anxiety and my mom knows this, as she was with me in my therapists office when we discussed it, so why would she say something like this? It’s actually not uncommon for her to act like this. Now I know that my mom loves me sooo much and that she might not even realize what she’s doing, but she’s very stubborn and sort of snobbish, so I don’t know how to bring it up with her.

I got home around 10, after they had already gone to bed, but they had only been asleep for about 30 minutes tops before I arrived home.

It just feels like the main phase of life is over, that at this point I'm supposed to have everything sorted out, maybe be happily settled into being a parent and maybe occasionally hosting a dinner party for old friends if I want to socialize. 

I feel panicked and almost like being suffocated whenever I acknowledge this, it physically hurts and makes me suicidal just thinking about getting older. I see TV shows where characters my age reminisce about the good old days in their twenties, or I see clothes in stores clearly meant for someone much younger than me, and it sets me off. Every time I think about trying to get my life together this thought 'Your life is already over' snacks me in the face and it paralyzes me.

Then it gets worse, I was hanging out with at her house and under her bed there was a used condom wrapper on the floor and some nike ankles socks for mens. It was not mine but i knew it was a dude's and so its making more and more sense she is sleeping with this dude. So where i finally get confirmation is yesterday when i hit up my girl to chill and she said she wasnt feeling like it. however i was alreayd driving to her house expecting her to say yes so instead of drive around every 20 minutes or so and i see some dude pull up to my girls house. she opens the door for him and they hug and kiss eachother then go inside. my heart dropped even tho i knew it already. and i asked my mutual friend and she told me that the dude that kept picking her up had a black bmw  and was tall, light skin, and comb over gel styles hair. and everything was a match to the guy that came to her house yesterday. I then messaged her again saying ""u sure u dont want me to come over? im already driving your way i miss you"" and she cursed me out saying how no is no and that if i come over she will not talk to me again. basically she was panicking and was nervous about me catching her in the act which i already been knowing. However, when we chill i never ask her about it because im scared she will blame on me some how and yell at me then break up with me. atleast im still going out with her and hooking up with her once in a while but she hasnt been feeling sex with me for the past month ironically enough. what should i do ?",21Aug2019,1

191,"I am Hispanic and was born in Colombia. I have lived in the US for most of my life but always visited Colombia every year and I speak fluent Spanish. 

I am also adopted by my parents. My mom is from South America and my dad is from the states. Here’s what I need advice on:

When I applied to my college application, I was asked if I was Hispanic, regardless of race, and in a separate section I was then asked to select the ethnicity that I consider myself to be (exact words on the application). I always struggle with these question as I do not consider myself to be just white, Colombia is a very diverse country, therefore it’s hard to belong to just a “white” culture. Another thing is that, I don’t exactly look white either. I have brown skin and black hair.

Well I checked both white and Native American, because unfortunately, Hispanic was not listed again in ethnicity. After submitting my application, I reread the definition of what each ethnicity is to the college and I felt like an idiot. 
Here’s the definition:

White: A person with origins to the original people of Europe, the Middle East or North Africa 

American Indian or Alaska Native: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North or South America...who maintains cultural identification through tribal affiliations or community attachments 

I’ve always put myself as white for ethnicity, even though I didn’t feel right putting it down due to not looking white. This time I wanted to convey both sides of myself. 

I don’t know if I should email admissions and tell them to change my ethnicity due to not technically having any tribal affiliations as stated in the definition for Native American from South America. I also don’t know if visiting my motherland counts as community attachment. 

When asking friends about what I should do, they told me not to worry about it. As colleges only use the information as a demographic survey. Genetically, I know I am mixed of Native American and European but culturally and ethnically I am Hispanic. Should I email admissions and ask them to change my application ethnicity? Or will I be okay? 

My friends say due to the wording, it’s probably okay as they asked what I consider myself to be ethnically. I still feel really uncertain and confused about it though. Any advice would be much appreciated. 

TLDR: I am a a Hispanic college applicant that put white and Native American as ethnicity but is unsure if that was correct and if I should contact admissions to change my application.",21Aug2019,3
192,"Hello reddit, this is my first post and it is sure to be a lengthy one, and I apologize if this is in the wrong place. So here it goes:

I have recently left the Military and have found a decent paying job for the amount of work I do in it. It is also located next to where I currently live. My goal right now is along the lines of earning my bachelor's, possibly up to my PhD using the benefits I earned while serving. 

My girlfriend, while I was in the military, got her bachelors and is currently living an hour away doing a job that fits exactly with her degree. We have both decided that we want to take the next step and live together. There is a college next to her apartment that I could attend. There is also a college that I have already been accepted to near where I live. 

The problem is that I can't find a job in her location that would allow me to work full time outside of school, and part time while in school. I feel I do not have the mental capability to attend school and work full time at the same time without having my grades suffer. Additionally, I dont believe a part time job would be enough to afford my share of rent, as well as basic commodities for living, with room for fun occasionally. (All jobs in the area that are part time are roughly 20 hours a week.)  

There are some very good full time positions available near her, but they aren't anything that I see myself doing for the rest of my life, and I would never ask her to leave her job to find a job near me, she also has a lease signed.

I don't know if I included enough information but this is the summarized version of what's going on. I feel the military set me back in the sense that I'm far away from where my peers are at, at my age, and she is someone I envision spending the rest of my life with.

He’ll often play this game where he pretends he doesn’t tap my shoulder but he does (we both know he does), he pretends to “scare me” but it never works. He’ll always help me with stuff I don’t need help with, and recently I feel like I confirmed that he likes me. I mean I’m pretty sure we flirted, he would constantly  find a way to be closer to me and would lean his arm on my shoulder. He also calls me by my nick name (even tho we ain’t that close) but shittttt I suck at showing my feelings back towards him. 

He’ll constantly be the one to start a conversation with me and I’ll always answer with sumn bland (even tho I don’t mean it), I overthink everything I do/say to him to the point I become distant and we hardly talk. I think he’s giving up on me and fuck I rlly don’t want that to happen. I really like him and idk how to stop acting like such a little bitch and to not overthink things. I want to ask him out to go with me to a festival that’s coming up but idk if it would be weird to ask (since we aren’t exactly that close). 

So what I’m trying to say is should I go for it? If he says no what should I do? How do I get better at showing my real feelings towards him so it doesn’t seem like this is a one sided love?

TL;DR: I like a dude from work (who I’m pretty sure likes me back) but idk how to show my feelings back towards him (as I often come across cold/distant) Want to invite him out to hang but idk if it’ll be weird (cuz we ain’t that close)",21Aug2019,1

197,"A bit of background about me. I’m 18 now, have graduated high school. I grew up in an upper-middle class family and my parents first sent me to a public school. Apparently (and I say apparently - according to my parents because I don’t remember this) a girl bullied me and tried pushing my head down to a trash can, so we moved schools to a private Catholic school. Everything was awesome there, and I had a great childhood. 

I was meant to go to the sister high school of my primary school, but got into a partially selective school and decided to attend there. Now, there was this one girl at in school who I've never talked to before, but she was in my classes and hung out with my friends. She would always stare at me both from afar and up close but she would never break the eye contact. She also looked at me up and down. I was coming top of my grade since Year 7 and she made it clear that she found this sickening and tried to knock me off the top by trying hard in exams when she previously did not try at all. Of course this didn't work because she definitely wasn't the brightest of the bunch and in the end I graduated with an ATAR of 97.85 and am now studying law with a FIRST job paying anywhere from $220-420 a day whilst she didn't even make it on the Honour Roll (Australian education system) She would make demeaning and mocking posts about me on her page so I removed her from all my social media but she would make fake accounts or get her friends to add me. I once went to a party and she bullied me about how my breasts were big. She lived and visited the government commission houses near where I lived and several times I saw her stare up from the driveway and stare into my window with a very angry look on her face. I had a feeling she wanted a reaction from me but I never gave her one - yes, I noticed what she was doing but that was it. The situation struck me as peculiar as I’ve never had someone hate and obsess over me so much before, nor have I ever been given so much negative attention from one person who I’ve never even talked to. I moved back to a Christian private school and have never had such a weird experience since (it happened again with another girl but on a much milder scale). Everyone who I've talked to this situation about has stated that she is jealous and envious. 

The situation returned to my mind today when I found out from a friend that this girl - FIVE years later, continues to yap on about me on her social media pages. Recently I’ve bumped into her on the street when walking with my boyfriend and she looked so unhappy.

We spent the entire night roaming the cruise ship and talking about personal experiences. Sadly, she didn't have a phone due to personal matters so I had and still have no way of contacting her. The next night I ended up finding her again at a dance. After the dance we hung out with some other friends whom we had met on the cruise. Like last night, we stayed up late talking. I was really nervous to tell her how I felt about her for a few reasons. First off, I thought she was TOO perfect, I was like a deer in headlights around her. The way she made me feel was indescribable, I felt like I was finally wanted by someone. We shared common interests such as reading and caring for animals.  Secondly, I had no idea how she felt about me. I had a sneaking suspension that she was into me; for a good few reasons. She gave off hints like always sitting next to me at a table even though there were other people guys and plenty of open seats. She didn't mind telling me about her troubled past and opening up about her ambitions in life. She also liked to talk to me about her current problems in life and how she felt about her future. It was late out when we spent time together, so naturally she was tired. She had no problems laying down next to me and closing her eyes. The first night she asked me to walk her to her room, the second night she did not. I figured she was just really tired on the second night since it was around 2A.M. and we had stayed up till 4A.M. the previous night. I forgot to write down my contact information for her and since she didn't have a phone, I doubt that she will remember how to get in touch with me. One of my friends had a really easy to remember SnapChat name, so I figure she will add him to find me. That could be a while since her phone was taken away from her and most likely isn't going to get it back anytime soon. I am really hoping she doesn't forget about me.

Anyway, I feel kind of stupid for not making a move on her. At the time I was just really anxious, because I had never connected with someone so well and I was nervous that I would mess things up. I also lack experience when it comes to making moves since I have never really felt a real connection between me and someone else. I felt and still feel really bad because I am almost 100% positive she was attracted to me and I didn't SHOW much attraction to her, even though I FELT like she was perfect and was extremely attractive to me. I am not really a people person, I find it hard making new friends  and talking to girls. This is mainly due to me being somewhat picky about who I am friends with. I really felt a strong connection between us. On the way home, I was really sad. I had missed out on a once in a life-time opportunity and I had nothing to show for our time together. It sounds silly, but I was really REALLY sad on the plane ride home. The plane ride home was definitely one of the saddest moments in my life! 

Ever since I got home from the cruise I've just been really depressed. All the reasons for me being sad are linked to her and my mistakes. I feel sad on one about the past; I feel like shit for not telling her how I felt. I feel like I betrayed her by not opening up to her. She seemed like she was in a really tough spot in her life right now and could have used someone like myself; someone who really cared for her. I know it sounds corny and fake. Generally I'm not a serious person, but I am so serious when I really cared about her; I feel like I could have really helped her overcome past trauma and our relationship could have been something truly special. On the other hand I feel sad but more so anxious about the future of ""us"". For example every time I go to bed questions constantly race around my mind about her. Most of the questions are just repeated for hours on end. ""How will I ever find her again?"" ""Did she really care about me the same way I cared about her?"" ""Will she ever contact me?"" ""Will I ever see her again"" ""What could have been if I just told her how I felt?"". 

It sounds exaggerated and insane, but those two nights were the best nights of my life. I really cared about her! I just don't know what to do. One part of me feels like I am over reacting about her and another part of me feels like I'm not reacting enough. The scientific and mathematical side of me sees her as one of billions of other girls out there. The other side of me sees her as HER. A truly unique person which can not be replicated. My friends tell me there are plenty of fish in the see. I agree with this statement, however there is only one of her. 

This is what my life has come to, posting a cry for help on Reddit at 12A.M. all because I found the perfect girl and blew it. I am honestly lost and having a rough time visualizing my future after the cruise. I just feel as if she was the lost part of me that I had been searching for my entire life... The second I saw her, I just knew! I never dated anyone in high school because I never really connected with anyone... I was knew someday that I would find my someone. I just didn't know it would be this specific girl and I didn't know I would blow it so badly. 

If you have actually read this far, thank you. It means an indescribable amount to me that you have been willing to read this far. I don't know how to thank you enough. I am really struggling more so than I ever have. I don't want to sound weird, fake or ungrateful. This is really the first time I've shared any of my feelings with anyone. I realize the internet is a cruel place where people care little of each other. If you feel like you have some advice for me, please leave a comment or private message me; it would really mean a lot just talking to someone else...

&amp;#x200B;

 \---  \*\*TL;DR;\*\* : 

I found a girl that I really liked on a cruise, I felt like we were two matching puzzle pieces. Unfortunately she doesn't have a phone. I do not know her last name, nor her address... What should I do?  I am really anxious that I won't ever see her again. Read whole post to get all details.",21Aug2019,0
208,"My dog died today unexpectantly.  We didn't know he was sick (cancer).  Anyway, we have kids, some took it harder than others.  I tried to be strong for them today and provide guidance and support, but I did show my feelings some as I think that's right and good to do, and I let them grieve in their own way.  I encouraged them to feel however they wanted to feel.  That all their feelings are ok, and I know that their grief is not a 1-day event.

My spouse was at work all day.   When he came home, and the kids were finally in bed, I just wanted a hug, I just wanted to be held while I cried it out.  This dog really was MY dog in many ways. This dog attached itself to me from the beginning and was my shadow.  He didn't leave my side.  This dog chose me, and we had a strong connection. Now he's gone.  

I just feel my husband is blocked off or something.  He liked the dog, not sure how he is feeling, he doesn't seem upset...but he feels like a wall, not supportive.  I want to be able to tell him how to support me...but gosh I don't even know the words to ask him.

He's just like - here's a quick hug, ""the dog's in a better place, you should go to bed.""

I don't want to layer in having an issue with my husband while I deal with the grieving issue, but come on!  I feel like he doesn't want to be bothered by me and my feelings.   Am I wrong to expect more from him? I just don't feel any compassion from him.  He has/ we have lost other dogs before, ones that mattered more to him, so he knows this pain. He's been here before with me.   Just this time I feel like he didn't care for this dog as much, so I feel alone in this.

How do I ask for support from him during this time, when I'm not even sure of what I want from him, just ""support.""  What could that look like and how do I ask for it?  ",21Aug2019,0

210,"Today I had an edible from a friend during the school breakfast time, we are in high school but still minors, I had a panic attack and it was affecting me in the wrong way, I went to the nurse and had to be sent out and advised to go to the hospital. Security told me they are gonna check the cameras after I had previously said I was dared to eat the gummy that was found on the table ( a quick cover up). I went to the ER and was their for about 8 hours. More kids had the same thing happen to them and were being sent home, it has made local news and on tv they said all the kids who ate them knew what they were, yet my mom and other family don’t know this. My other friend who also had one and admitted to it has to go to the office tomorrow and I feel I will have to do the same. The kid who gave them is expelled I’m pretty sure and all the articles online only mention that he will have consequences. Any help would be nice I would just like to know what the best move is, thanks in advance.",21Aug2019,1
211,"Okey so my dog is a 9 year old shi tzu and we trained him to not do that. The room in question is my office room and since I spent most my time in my moms room that room rarely got used.

It all started a year ago I'd say? When my office was filled with clutter and stuff from my bedroom which I was refurnishing atm. The door was open ,but I didn't go in that room until my other room was done and I transferred the clutter back. Then I saw something on the floor which was dried up and brown. I suspected my dog shit there but gave him the benefit of the doubt since it was dried up and I couldnt be certain. My room stayed abandoned for a while ,but when I cleaned it up and put a nice rug down for him he shit on it a few days later. I really liked that rug but since it was diarrhoea I held no harsh feelings against my dog. Until he did it again in front of my TV just a hard poop, ugh. For a while I always closed this rooms door when I went to sleep which I don't usually do because I like to open the window and the door so air goes through. Today I left it open and when I woke up I saw piss on my floor. Covering a big chunk of my big room and rinning under my shelfs.

My parents say he does this because he thinks no one uses the room and he just uses it when he really needs to go. Which like ok but Id still rather my dog take his poop and piss elsewhere? How do I stop this? I know he needs to go ,but at the time he needs to I'm asleep and he doesn't come to wake me up (only my parents) so I have no real way of preventing it",21Aug2019,0
212,"I met my best friend a few years ago in university. We lived together throughout it, and have remained close ever since- we have been the platonic loves of each other’s lives for a long time now.

When we became friends, we had both just ended severely damaging friendships with the people we had up until that point considered the ones we were closest in the world to. We healed alongside each other from the damage that was done (both were abusive friendships) and figured out what it actually meant to be both close and healthy, and it created a bond I don’t think I’ll ever replicate with anyone else. She is incredibly important to me. 

Every once in a while, she’ll have a bout of depression that causes her to stop communicating with anyone for a while. I have abandonment issues causes primarily by that ex friend of mine, but I’m pretty good at just... talking to her about it when she has one of those episodes if I need to. Usually she messages me before that and apologizes for being MIA, and since I know that this happens occasionally, I like to give her her space until she feels ready to talk things out.

This time, though... it feels different. She hasn’t spoken to me in nearly a month with no warning- things were fine. I continued messaging her, and she just... never responded. She has a lot of new people in her life, and I can see her on social media going out and having a good time with them, traveling with them, going to parties and exhibits... I’m worried she finally realized how weird and boring I am and has moved on and I don’t know what the next step is.

I know I should message her and ask if I did something or if I’m just being paranoid as usual, but the thought of getting no response is honestly scarier than the thought of getting a negative one. Just... being in the dark like that even after reaching out. 

Idk what kind of advice I’m looking for to be honest, or if I’m just looking for encouragement or something like that. I’m just so scared of losing the most important person in my life again.",21Aug2019,1
213,"Tonight was the last night me and my high school friends have before most of them move away to college. Some of us are all going to a local community college and will still talk regularly, but for the few that are leaving for college it really sucks. I never really realized how much they really meant to me until I realized that I'll probably never seen them at all really even when they come back for vacations. It was a good closure but I still feel that just knowing they will be far away and I cant just meet up with them whenever I want scares me.",21Aug2019,1
214,"I have been dating this girl for three months now, and over the past year or so I have fallen completely in love with her. Yet I find myself in a position in which I am completely lost. 

Some context: have grown up in a small town all my life, currently 20. I grew up in an extremely close friend group but spent the majority of my time with my best friend. His older brother and I were also relatively close through the years. Fast forward to about a year ago, he (the older brother) and his long time girlfriend break off their (less than ideal) relationship. Her and I had recently become friends and she tells me that they had supposedly broken up roughly a month prior as he was getting a little to friendly with another girl and that they were now seeing each other. She finds solace in me, and I (considering the fact that he had moved on already) go along with it. We began what I considered to be the start of a relationship and that goes on for a month or so ultimately for her to call it off to try things out with him again, cutting all communication. I soon after return to college in a city an hour or so away, and run into her every so often when out with my friends, as its a small town and hang out in similar crowds. Each time I see her though, I remove myself from the situation and go home, or do my best to avoid her, as I had developed feelings for her while we were together and it was tough to see. Her boyfriend and I slowly repair our friendship, and get back to close to where we were.

Well, fast forward a year. Her and I are at the same party and we chat casually and it eventually gets semi-flirty. Afterwards, she convinces me to throw an afterparty at my parents house as they're out of town and I agree, bringing a few friends over. We both go outside at one point to grab something out of her car, and she makes a bold attempt to kiss me that I slide my way out of. I explain to her that its not because of a lack of feelings by any means, but that she has a boyfriend; to which she responds with an explanation of how their relationship had already ended. She said that things never improved and that things between them were absolutely tearing her apart mentally. Everybody leaves that night and she stays and we stay up all night talking. Over the course of the next few weeks we ultimately build a relationship, after many laughs, tears, and nights spent without sleep. 

Now the part where I share the problem(s). Over time I have definitely noticed the strain that distance has had on our relationship. I still live an hour away (originally for school but now for work) and things just aren't the same when I'm gone, but whenever we're together its like nobody ever left. I am actively seeking employment back home but I have to stay at my current job until I find a new one. I also have extreme worries about loyalty, not necessarily because of her but because of a previous relationship. And on top of all that, the amount of guilt that I hold is unparalleled. The thought that I have brought any pain to her ex, somebody that I genuinely care about, hurts. From what I have heard, things haven't been easy for him as ties seem to be completely severed this time. Part of me tells myself that their relationship was awful and offering her an outlet to move on, in some way, does everybody a favor. Because it *was* horrible, for those involved and those on the sidelines. Anytime they went anywhere together they would just fight the entire night (both verbally and physically) to the point where they would have to be separated. And whoever removed him was then in the crosshairs, and he would try to fight them. One night he was so mad that somebody she had been involved with in the past was present that he turned and punched out the headlight in his truck, as he was drunk and then somehow managed to drive home. Which was not out of character anymore, as to cope with their relationship he turned to alcoholism. But hey, then again this could all just be a major case of self-justification. 

If you actually read this whole thing and feel like dropping some advice, I would greatly appreciate it. If not, I hope my predicament entertained you for a moment or two.",21Aug2019,1

217,"A friend of mine has been having a rough year, a rough couple of years actually, but I think the last couple of years in particular have been rougher.

 She's always been a little bit flaky and its always been 50/50 chance as to whether she was show up to group event or not.  By her own admission she's been a bit of a hermit lately. I've tried to be supportive even I can.   Making is it a text to even if I don't get responses, and call her when I can.  
Offered to keep her company if she wants it, just hanging out watching movies it eating cheese. Took a little care package for her when she had an operation.  Tried invite her to things the a lot in aki and do my best to make myself available if she want to do something. 

The last two times (i think more, but the last two stick out in my mind the most) she just straight up bailed on me.   I've been a bit of a hermit myself lately a calmer and my partner and I decided that we needed to have a lot in key games night and just invite people around to get back into the habit of it. 

 We were careful about who we invited trying to make sure that we have the right numbers,  and got people that the get along well. She had been saying for a while that that was exactly the type of night she'd like to have, and when I invited her, she said she would definitely come.  
Then the day of, I got a message from her saying she had to do a thing with her mum (the next day) and couldn't come. 

 I've been away on holiday, and just got back.  At the messaging her while i was away, to see how she was doing and let her know that I was thinking of her. 
 A couple of days after I got back I got a couple of messages asking if we could go out, because she really wanted to do out. Like *really* wanted to go out and needed me to confirm it.  I spoke to her the night before hand really briefly while at work, and had to go suddenly (a customer came in).  Called back as soon as I finish work and went straight to her voicemail.  (Side note, is that I'm a texter, and don't really like calling people at all unless I have too. She doesn't reply to texts 90% of the time, and only likes to call.  So I make a special effort to call her, purely because I know it's what she prefers).
Called her twice the next day and left a voicemail, to ask what time and if I should go straight there or meet her somewhere. Never heard back.  

 It's just frustrating, as I had said no to plans with somebody else, and my sister had wanted to do something.  It's getting to the point where  I almost feel like I should say yes when she wants to make plans, and then just make other plans because I know its unlikeky that my plans with her will actually happen. 

So the hard part is this:

1) I know that she's not in the best mental state at the moment.  I know she's feeling really isolated and lonely. I know that she's been getting a lot of anxiety and I suspect probably depression as well. I know that that's like, and I want to support her and let her take her time without pushing her. 

I'm also starting to get a bit frustrated and hurt myself that she keeps totally blowing me off or standing me up. 

2) She can be very volatile, and it's hard to know how she will take things.  
She basicly ended a 8 year friendship with her best friend, over a drunken comment that person made while they were both very drunk.  The other person has tried to appologies to her numerous times and she won't let it go (i was there that evening and know what they were both like, and think she's really overreacting tbh). It's been a year and she still not interested in them reconnecting even though the other person keeps trying. 

The point is, is that if I call her out for standing me up and being flaky, I'm worried that she'll take it as an attack and want to end our friendship.  But I'm also getting hurt/frustrated and annoyed myself at being ditched and don't want it to keep happening.  

I'm also worried about her metal health and what result that would have.  She's straight up told me she's not doing well, and that she feels like she doesn't have any friends and no one in her life.

220,"I love to help people, with whatever they need help with.

They like to call me a good person and a good friend, saying that I go out of my way to help them and make sure they're okay, they say I know the right things to say and I can stay positive.  

I don't know how to react, it feels like an instinct to tell them they're wrong for some reason, and I tell them that I'm not really a good person or friend just because I help. I just can't take any compliment about me and I know this seems like me just being humble, but I feel like it's to a point where I convince myself that I'm not a good person or friend, and I downplay myself and get even more critical on myself.

Honestly, that's not the biggest problem. 

The biggest problem is that she's having dental problems. Something's going onainly with her lower teeth line, causing them to push in. You can see one of her front teeth going up. It's gross and it hurts me to see her in pain. She eats so little, and can only drink warm beverages. I hate it. According to her dentist its 4000 for dental surgery. I'm pretty sure there could be payment plans, so I'm doing research on dentistries that do payment plans.

We tried getting a loan from a house we have out of state, but because I(my name is on the title) don't live there I can't qualify for an 11000 loan. I think the worst part is that while I was being qualified, my credit score dropped a lot, so now I'm scared I can't qualify for another loan. 

I'm here to ask for advice, I really don't know what to do. I'm a mess now knowing I couldn't get the loan. I just wanna know what are some options.

232,"In short, I'm doing some vigilante pedophile-exposing work, and I got my first suspect on Whisper. I need some second opinions on this..

So I made a fake profile on Whisper, and I never ask for sex, nudes, or to meet up. They have to solicit, and this guy whos 35 (He acknowledges that I'm indeed ""13"" and he doesn't care; but I'm really 20)

He sent me several dick pics, and asked to meet up tomorrow and he asked for head. I don't have a face pic yet but I screenshotted all conversations.

What do you guys think of this? Any advice regarding this?

 (I also know this is a very dangerous thing to do, physically and legally, but I cannot be talked out of this because I believe this makes the world a better place to live in, and I figured I do my part for society. I won't be hurting him, just exposing online and reporting to police)",21Aug2019,2
233,"I've known this guy (we'll call him Adam) for about 4 years now, and he's probably the only real friend I have in my life right now. We got through high-school, and everything was great. In fact, he saved my life once. We've gone to movies, have the exact same interests, and the same personality. We were close, nay, inseperable.

Adam moved to Indonesia for about 10 years, and I only met him once his family moved back. During that time, he had a friend that he only briefly mentioned sometimes to me. I thought, ""Whatever, he sounds nice, etc.""

Now, 8 months ago, Adam's friend moved here, and I met him. Really nice guy, valedictorian, etc kind of dude.

Ever since he got here, Adam is always doing stuff with him, and only occassionally with me. The times we do hang out, I ALWAYS have to make the first move, arrange dates, plan it out, pick him up, pay for what we do, etc. 

It's not like I'm doing this every day, maybe once or twice a month. I never force him to do anything.

I don't know what to do. I know Adam, and he isn't doing this to make me jealous, or mooch off of me. But I feel like a nuisance to him now, and he never asks me to do stuff anymore.

I don't want to lose my only friend, but I have nowhere else to turn about this.

Any advice would be very welcome.",21Aug2019,1

How do I get over feeling/having fear that I will be ostracized by all the super fit people at the gym? What if I see someone I graduated with and they see how fat I am now? I would be made fun of.

236,"So I (20F) made a friend form my home town, even the same high school, she's a year above me, while I was at college. we smoked weed a lot at her trailer and it was fine but Its not something i want my family knowing about. She knows I have very severe anxiety that usually focuses on social situations. She's never seemed to care though, she brigns up embarrassing things that happen to me, and talks about our private conversations to other people and it feels like i can't talk to her about anything serious. well, the day before I was going back up to school, I was haning out with my mother and my cousin, and I am very close to both. My mother knows I have smoked pot with my friend, and also knows I have already thougth about stopping talking to my friend because of how anxious I get when we're around other people, the constant fear of her embarrassing me or telling one of my secrets. Well when I was hanging out wiht them, she calls me that she is in my drive way, unannounced at like 9pm. I go out side to see her, she was dropping off stuff that she was giving me, clothes she didn't want. Well i tell her I have to take my cousin back home, she's 14 and can't drive, before it gets too late so when we leave she's going to have to go too since she was blocking me in. I didn't want to stay over because I wanted to spend time with my family before I went up, four hours away to college. Well she follows me in side and i'm like...okay? guess she's coming in. She comes in and sits down with my cousin and i at the table, we were in the middle of a Minecraft game, and starts talking. she immediately brings up drugs and I pale, and feel my heart drop into my stomach. I send her a quick snap telling her to not bring up me smoking. she looks at it, and then immediately looks up at me and ask, out loud ""if she can talk about her recreational uses"" i get shocked and panic, i felt my heart beating in my ears from how nervous I got. I tell her no, but she immedetly starts talking ot my little cousin about how hse had done ecstasy. I panic, because my cousin is very sheltered and hasn't even gone to school before, she's been home schooled her entire life. I don't want my cousin thinking bad of me because I know she looks up to me and it scared me. After telling her I needed to go to sleep early, she wouldn't leave, and even saying that i needed to bring cousin home soon, still wouldn't leave. It finally got to the point where I said, \*friend name\* can you please leave, i need to bring cousin home, you're blocking my car. It was midnight at this point, and i had been pancking to the point where I felt like i was going to cry. My friend gets mad very easily at the smallest thing. Such as, one of the things she talked about while she was there was how one of her friends came over unannounced and would not leave. i wish i was making up how ironic this was...She then preceded to try to get met to let her ride with us, or for her to take my cousin home. I told her that no, I have to drive cousin home, her parents do not know you and would kill me if I let that happen. she got pissed and siaid that it was crazy. I said no, i'm following my aunt and uncles rules for their child.and asked her again to leave. she still took 20 mins to pull out of my driveway.   


How do I stop talking to her? she's moving to a town 3 hours away from our home town, and i am currently in college four hours away in the opposite direction...so it'll be easier...do I just block her? But I am also worried about her being suicidal and hurting herself because of me, and I don't want her to do that and it scares me that she will.

TL/DR; friend makes my anxiety so high to the point where I wanted to cry because she wouldn't leave my house and threatened to tell my extremely sheltered cousin that I smoke weed. Now I need help on how to stop talking to her.",21Aug2019,1

238,"I’m 19 years old and i’ve been smoking weed since I was about 16. A few weeks ago I had a doctor’s appointment and I did all my research and found that telling my doctor/pediatrician that I smoke weed was the best thing I could do and all the posts reassured me that doctors won’t tell your parents anything unless you’re a minor or a safety risk. That’s the only reason why I opened up about smoking weed in the first place, because I thought I could tell my doctor and my mom wasn’t going to find out. A few days ago the results for my urine and blood samples came back and they told my mom it contained a lot of weed in it. A quit smoking a few days before I went to the appointment (been clean for about 20 days now) and I didn’t want to tell my mom so I wouldn’t have to worry her. I even asked the doctor not to let her know, but I guess fuck me right. To be fair idk if the doctor was the one that told her or someone else, but that doesn’t change anything. I don’t know why they had to test for weed in my samples when I already told the doctor that I do smoke. The last time I went to the doctor’s appointment, which was about a year ago, they took my urine and blood samples but obviously I didn’t tell them I smoked weed so when the results came back nothing about marijuana came up. So now i’m just in confusion, I thought I could confined in my doctor. I don’t get why they tested for marijuana when I freaking told the doctor that I had smoked weed.

240,"So I have been dating my current girlfriend for almost 7 months. I’m very much in love with her and she claims she loves me as well. Well one day about five and a half months into our relationship, she’s texting her friend about something and won’t tell me what it is. Later that night I got the urge to check her phone to see what it was about (something i’ve never felt the need to do before). Turns out it was just some drama that I didn’t really care about. But then I see the most recent person she texted has a bunch of random emojis as the name, something I’d seen before but didn’t think much about. I go into their text messages and find that she’s been having a whole relationship with her ex of two and a half years. It isn’t as easy as that though.

Her ex was abusive and would often force her to have sex pretty much every night. It was a relationship that scarred her and she would often tell me I saved her from him and that she would have likely gone back to him had I not come along. So after I find all of that I have a mental breakdown and it wakes her up and she does her best to explain that he forced her into it and that he threatened to tell people that she was crazy (she has depression and has mental breakdowns sometimes, nothing to call crazy). I’ve always been called “too nice “ but I did my best to forgive her and I’m still trying to get over it. She claims I don’t have to worry about it any more but I do. I have never been with someone for two and a half years but I would assume that that kind of time would create a bond whether it was a healthy relationship or not. I’m constantly paranoid now and check her phone often when she’s asleep which is something that makes me feel uncomfortable. Unfortunately I’ve found other stuff around when we first started dating of her talking to guys who hit her up and instagram and flirting with them for a couple of days before ending it. There was a couple of cases of that but they seemed to stop a few months into our relationship. I’m not really sure why she would tell people she’s single and talk to them for a couple days, maybe she liked the attention? I’m not sure, I’m just worried that actions like that might mean she would do it again in the future.  Sorry for the length but if you took the time to read it thank you!

She is supposed to leave Sept. 4th, which would be a month and 5 days after she arrived. The problem is, I start school on the 26th (I commute to a university in my town so I live at home still). This is the first time she would be here while I’m in college and I am terrified. My focus and higher level thinking abilities are severely affected when she is around, making it nearly impossible to do anything. Even if I did work at the library, just knowing I would have to come back home to her would be distracting and stressful. Maybe this sounds ridiculous but due to past trauma I am really affected by her presence. And the last thing I want to do is get behind the first week and a half of school.

250,"Exactly as the title says. I'm a 30 year old male. Shortly after graduating university where I did my share of dating and fair share of hooking up and one night stands I started working.

Fast forward 6 years later and I haven't been on a date since my last year of university. 

I honestly don't know if I miss it or I don't. I don't know if I want it or I don't. On the one hand a lot of my friends have long time SOs, some are getting married etc. Some of them are good couples, others, not so much. Maybe I would want a girlfriend. I honestly don't know. It's a weird concept for me now because I haven't thought about it in so long.

On the other hand I think I lost my ""Mojo"" as it were. I honestly don't know the first thing about approaching women in ""real life"" since I never tried out of school. I don't know how all of this stuff works. It's honestly just a thing that other people seem to know how to do and I don't know how to start.

I will say I think sex would be nice. In the past several years I have only had sex once. I got back from 6 months in Australia beginning of July. I had sex with a legal prostitute while I was there and it was great. But that was easy. I just gave her money and I got sex. I didn't have to actually put any work in.

I guess my question is how do I figure out if this is really something I want in life? And how do I learn to go get it again?",21Aug2019,3
251,"Welcome to the shit show. 

Hi guys, I don’t expect anyone to read this or even reply. This is mainly for venting purposes but I’d love opinions from all kinds of people - Just so I know I’m doing the right thing as I am still not very confident in myself. 

To set the scene: It’s the end of Summer 2016. I was low, insecure and ready to get dicked down. After coming out of a heavy relationship in January, I was ready to get on the dating scene. Where does a 19 year old girl start with that? Well apparently I thought it a good idea to download an anonymous message app called ‘Whisper’. 

I had a few messages from people that I’d ‘lured’ in from my posts. One lived in a neighbouring town and his name (obviously have changed for the purpose of the post) was Mike. Mike and I chatted for a while and decided to text each other. As you would, I was messaging other boys and met a boy named (also changed) Will. Will was very keen to flirt and get to know me. Will showered me with compliments and wanted to see me immediately. Mike was a ‘take it slow’ type but very keen to sext me and message me back and forth via texts. Fast forward a few weeks and I found myself engaging in a sexual relationship with Mike whist also speaking to and sleeping with Will. I have a crippling fear of letting people down and I did not want to let either boy down or let either go. Selfish, I know. 

As things progressed a month or so down the line, Will was very keen to start a relationship with me whereas Mike was still dragging his heels about it. I became impatient. I accepted Will’s proposal of a relationship whilst still speaking to Mike. I did not want to let Mike go as he seemed like such a goofy, funny guy. I wanted him in my life but I mainly wanted a boyfriend and Will was prepared to give that to me. 

Mike found out via Facebook that I was in a relationship with Will. His friend had searched my profile. I was so ashamed and embarrassed. I understood it was the wrong thing to do and I understand it even more now. Mike was broken hearted over what I had done. He did not tell Will. I am still unsure as to why. Will had no clue. 

After this drama, caused by yours truly, Mike and I cut off contact. I knew I had done wrong by him and I did not deserve him in my life. Will and I continued our relationship. We had numerous issues within the relationship regarding unfaithfulness (not by me this time!), money, sexual assault and attitude. 

I had and still have a fierce temper. So did Will. We fought until it was too much, and he had to leave our flat. I convinced myself that this is what I deserved after hurting Mike. I thought about him constantly. Mike Mike Mike. Mike. 

I took ownership of all of the rent and bills from the 50/50 split I had with Will. I went to the police regarding the serious issues and came to a resolution that wasn’t particularly to my taste but solved the issue of being constantly stalked by Will after the termination of the relationship. By the time it was fully over, it was July 2017. 

I thought about Mike and his kindness every day. His silly jokes. His support. I idolised him in my head. I thought he didn’t want me so I had a few flings here and there. I found myself living with another boy named Dunstan for a while. Dunstan ended up being immature and never pulled his weight - We were better off as friends and still continue to be friends to this day. He moved out of my place in January of this year after kindly agreeing to stay to help me find my feet after our split in October. 

I started speaking to Mike again after sending a drunk snapchat video apologising over and over again and crying. Oh the shame. Mike was so kind to me. He didn’t forget what I did but he started speaking to me daily, asking if I was okay, generally being interested in my life. This is when the real trouble started, in August 2018. I did not have any feelings for Mike, or so I thought. I had not left Dunstan yet. We eventually split up due to immaturity differences and it was as amicable as can be. Dunstan is a great guy. I can’t stress that enough, really great guy, just didn’t pan out the way we wanted. 

So I continued to speak to Mike via snapchat and really enjoyed our conversations. He made me feel beautiful. I noticed he was keeping his distance but I put that down to the fact that Dunstan was still living at my place. Fair enough. We saw each other more and more and I was getting so into him and all his promises he would make. He told me ‘don’t worry, as soon as Dunstan leaves I’ll be sliding straight in those DM’s’. I felt like I couldn’t wait for Dunstan to leave, I was so excited! I also felt very guilty as Dunstan would spend evenings and weekends hanging out with me. I was generally conflicted. Mike kept talking to me and promised to be with me after Dunstan had moved out. 

I had hesitations because Mike would never really meet up with me more than once every few weeks. I put it down to the fact I wasn’t alone at home and he felt weird. He made me feel like the only girl for him. 

Dunstan moved out on the 9th of January. Early on in January, I found a picture of Mike with a girl. She had posted about going on a walk in a forest with him. Mike had told me previously that he and this girl, Barb, had slept together but I shrugged it off. Upon seeing the picture I became enraged. How dare he promise me so much and then openly go and do ‘couple things’ with this girl. I confronted Mike but he did not have a lot to say. He was always so busy, or not feeling too good. 

I was so eager and keen to see Mike. I spent hours and days upon days sat at home alone waiting for a message or any sign of life. He rarely messaged me. He wasn’t keen to see me anymore. But he still kept talking. 

I started getting very depressed. I thought this was penance for my sins. (‘Mugging’ Mike off in 2016.) Months flew by, still I wasn’t Mike’s girlfriend. I didn’t understand why he didn’t want to progress things after all the promises and sweet nothings. I kept hassling Mike and he would say ‘well if you’d shut up, maybe we would get somewhere’. It upset me DEEPLY. I waited around. 

At another point, I messaged the girl in the nicest way I could to ask if anything was going on between them as he had threatened to do so himself so I thought this would be okay. She was incredibly rude to me and told me ‘well if you don’t trust him it won’t work☺️’ I didn’t like this at all. I’m not sure why but it didn’t sit right with me. 

Mike then left for a 2 week tour of Europe with strangers. He told me not to worry. Of course I did. The two weeks CRAWLED by at the pace of a dead fish (real slow.). 

When Mike came back, I expected to get together. Still nothing. He told me to stop hassling him. The compliments, sexts etc vanished. I felt empty. 

We kept seeing each other and it was going so so well. He asked me to be his girlfriend in May and I was over the moon. At this point I had been waiting 7 months to be with him. It was perfect! 

As time passed, I realised Mike didn’t really want to integrate me into his life, didn’t want me to meet his family and didn’t want to generally act like a boyfriend. I asked to resolve these issues to no avail. He would just say ‘I’m shit’ or ‘if you want to do ___ then just tell me!’  It felt as if the whole relationship was smattered with ‘if’s. I felt like he always said ‘if you do such and such, I will do this’. It seemed like a game of control that I always lost. 

I noticed Mike was still seeing the girl from January, commenting on her instagram pictures about her ‘baby curls’ and other private inside jokes. Tagging each other in things. Whenever I brought it up he would always say ‘you’re getting upset OVER A FACEBOOK POST, I can’t even LIKE A FACEBOOK POST’ He never did this with me. He always side stepped difficult questions such as (forgive me for being so basic and petty) ‘why can’t we announce our relationship on Facebook?’, ‘why can’t we post pictures together?’ And ‘why don’t you ever come and stay over at my place?’ 

Note: I kept my flat for as long as I could afford, only recently have I moved into a shared house, much to my disappointment. I wanted to make sure we always had a place to be alone together. 

Mike never wanted me to meet his friends and vice versa. He never wanted to go for drinks together or do anything more than walk around the town, shopping and cinema. We rarely went on dates. He never came round to surprise me.  I sound so whiney but I feel these are the components that make up a relationship. Whenever I got wound up at him he would always say ‘it’s not that deep’ and it made me flush with anger and shame. 

Then I saw something that made my heart stop and fall out of my arse. Since asking the girl if anything had been going on between them, she had blocked me on every form of social media. She posted on Mike’s Facebook wall for his birthday. 35 pictures and videos of them together, him being goofy like he was with me. So many snapchat screenshots of pictures I both had and hadn’t seen. It broke me. The post started off ‘to this absolute stunner’ and ended with ‘love youuu’. 

Another point to add, Mike was weird about his phone. I never saw his phone really, he always turned it sideways to check it. He never let me use it for silly things like a flashlight or anything. This is what made me feel like something shady was going on. I snapped when we broke up and said to him to hand over his phone but he just said ‘I can’t be bothered with this’. I don’t know if it’s me. But this just seemed weird. 

Immediately I cut things off with Mike. I made it clear that it was an issue alongside the other points such as only seeing me a maximum two times a week, never staying round etc. I said he didn’t feel like a proper boyfriend. I said I wanted and deserved (maybe not) something better and someone a bit more present for me. 

We slept together a few times after the split and I gave him many opportunities to get back together if he wished. He just told me he wants me to be happy and to focus on myself. I have left it recently and have not messaged him for a few days now but I notice he checks my instagram stories - he doesn’t follow me though. I cannot tell if what I did in the end was the right thing.

252,"I(24f) am planning on going to my college's homecoming in October. I am super excited as I was unable to go last year as I had other plans.

&amp;#x200B;

In college, I gained a lot of weight from soph-5th year. I had a lot of stress and this caused several health issues. I never went to a doctor, but most likely my thyroid was acting up, I had weight gain, and I was constantly sick. As soon as I graduated, ate normal food, cut back on drinking, and calmed down I lost 4 sizes already. I am not where I want to be but I feel a lot better. I also have not been sick in over a year.

&amp;#x200B;

I am nervous on comments about my weight or how I look so much differently. I lost weight in hs size 12-6 and was branded a eating disorder then. I do not want to handle these comments now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am also part time in college and am freelancing my work. I am not in the fill in the blank fortune 500 job or top MS program at the moment. I pay my loans and am living but its just against the college grain.

I recieved a voicemail tonight from my uncle who will be passing through town and asked if I want to get lunch on his way.


The thing is, I really super don't want to leave my home currently. I don't want to see anyone and mentally this phone call has pretty much sucked my day away.

256,"I work in an independent retail store and the place is a shit show. Theres zero organisation, management is a joke, and the bitchiness drives me wild. I'm good money, and I'm working 6 or 7 days a week (which is killing me), and I live with my parents with very little expenses (they refuse to let me pay board, but I chip in where they let me. I'm very lucky in this regard), so I'm doing pretty well financially. 


But the workplace is making me miserable. I have 
zero time to myself, I feel like I'm always there, and I'm hating every second of it. I've been here for nine months, and im moving away in Feb, so if I stick it out I'll only be there for another 4 months but theres no way I can stay here for that long doing the amount of hours/days a week I'm working currently. 


I want to quit now, because I cant take it anymore. My only trouble is, new job opportunities are hard to come by where I am unless in commute, which is not a good option, and I'm worried no one will want to take me for only 4 months. I'm actually in a position where it doesnt matter if I'm not working for a few months, but I dont want to be unemployed for that long. And I would hate to be living in my parents place without a job, and theres no way I'd do that and not pay board with my savings. 


My other option is I could change my availability at my current workplace and cut it down to a few times a week. That would definitely be more bearable, and the cut in wages wouldn't affect me too much but I would still hate every second I was there. I'm thinking this might be my most realistic option, even if its not my favourite.

258,"So I'm using my nsfw account cause I dont want anyone seeing this on my real account. 

Am I overreacting for telling my girlfriend who is also the mother of my child that we're done over her kissing someone else? Here's some back story. She started a new job probably around April or may. She had this co worker named Jerry. Now she would talk about Jerry a lot but eventually stopped after I teased her about it. She would tell me about all the issues Jerry has and about things that have happened in his life. (My girlfriends grandfather passed away yesterday ) Today she called me, and said she was taking Jerry home. 

Earlier tonight I was browsing facebook, i recently joined a group for a podcast I listen to, I read a post in the group about how this guy is worried his girlfriend is cheating on him and that he was going to talk to her but her grandfather died yesterday. And that he believes that she was on the phone with the guy who shes cheating on him with(it was me) I look at the name and it was Jerry. Now there's no coincidence that My girlfriend and some other girls grandfather died at the same time. So I confront my girlfriend about this, she says no. Then calls me back saying it was only once and all the did was kiss.

She said she knows she fucked up and that we've been doing.so good and she doesn't want to lose me and split up our family. I told her I dont know what im.going to do. I need space and time to think but we arent together anymore. I asked her why does he think you guys are together and she just says that he has issues. I say fuck it and I try to go and message him and ask him about it but he blocked me. She also admitted to blocking jerry on her Facebook so he cant see that she has one. 

A lot of things dont make sense, and is someone really delusional to where they think they're in a relationship with someone. When they really arent??

260,"Ok so I'm on a mobile formatting may not be perfect please don't hate. I'm 24 female. 

Ok so I got PTSD from my last two relationships they were utter shit.
*Both exs inappropriately touched me when I said no and made it clear I didn't want sex or anything sexual fast.
*They both played massive mind games.
* Got called childish for not putting out when they wanted it.
*Kept trying to get jacked off every time I saw them.

Now my last relationship wasn't so bad but thankfully it ended when it did. He just couldn't want, lack of hand-outs, didn't want to to do movie nights after 2 months in.

Now this new guy he's 27 I'm 24. He's apparently into me but the snag is with my distrust of dating and sexual and general trust I have real issues believing that what he says is true. He says he'll wait but at the same time he says he wants a girl just to fuck. But also says he actually wants to meet me, be with me etc. 

I know I should of left my other exs way before it got to the point of PTSD I was blinded by my stupidity that they'd stop after I said no and they promised. But I don't know about this new guy my gut is saying run and don't look back, but something in my head still has hope people are good and will listen. 

Should I talk to him more clearly make what I want clear and give it a shot or just forget about him?",21Aug2019,1
261,"So my current last name is a very common last name amongst a very specific group of people that isn’t well liked. My family (including extended family) has barely anything to do with this group of people outside of our last name so I really hate the fact that I’m constantly being roped in to people’s hatred for these people, when I have nothing to do with them, just because of my last name. For the longest time I didn’t care to much about it  because I thought that one day I’d just get married and change it (which is most people’s advice when I bring this up), but recently I’ve developed a serious disgust to the idea of getting married. The idea of spending my life with someone isn’t what I hate, it’s the whole being legally bound to someone thing that scares me. However, my biggest reason for wanting to change my last name is that the career I want to go into will require me to get a Masters at the least and I am also considering a Doctorate (I’m kind of playing it by ear and seeing if I want to do it/will need it when I get there) and I want my degree to be under a last name that is respectable and sounds good.

Then one day, about a year ago I stood up for myself, and he did not like it. He constantly hurls abuse, attacking my weak points. Examples;

Now a year later me and my fiance are going strong as hell and even going for marriage next year; he hits me with ""you two started bad, he's definitely abusive."" (He's not at all, and everyone remarks how wonderful we are for each other.)

I once had an eating disorder, was bulimic and lost 96 pounds because of it. He still calls me fat, even just last night he said ""youre a fat little fuck"" and told me how disgusting I am.

267,"Sorry if this seems trivial, but I thought I might as well post it and see what happens. I’m a 20yo female. I know a girl (the subject of this post) through one of my good friends. The girl repeatedly makes fun of me and my sister (who is also 20) for being “too innocent.” 

Honestly, this girl’s personality has rubbed me wrong for years. She’s highly opinionated and needs constant validation from her friends. However, instead of letting the friendship peter out like most people would, I decided I’d rather be as nice to her as I can since she’s in the same friend group as most of my other good friends. Basically, if I cut her out of my life, I’d be asking my friends to choose between myself and her; I don’t want to put anyone in that position. Also, her personality is pretty bad but not so awful that it warrants me dramatically cutting all contact with her. 

Anyway, this girl prides herself on being “mature.” She’s also 20, but has no moral issues with underage drinking with her fake ID. I honestly couldn’t care less about her doing that (I mean, a lot of underage kids do that sort of thing) but would rather not break the law myself. She really enjoys swearing—again, I have no problem with that, but happen to not swear a whole lot when I speak. My sister is the same way.

The girl has always scoffed at our innocent personalities, which I do my best to ignore. Playing Cards Against Humanity with her was rough...I really tried my best to get into the spirit of the game, which is literally meant to be vulgar and obscene. I read all the cards out loud when judging them and didn’t hold back on submitting crude cards when I thought they might win a round. Even still, the girl would make constant snide remarks about how my sister and I probably had no idea what jizz was, or stuff like that. I wasn’t really sure what to say and laughed it off, but all I knew was that I felt pretty terrible. Why is it so awful to be innocent? And couldn’t she see that I was trying my best to play a game that wasn’t really my style but that I knew she liked? My sister and I simply don’t like to swear a lot, but we’re not naive. However, I saw no reason why I needed to justify that to her. 

The girl pulled the same thing tonight, but on my sister. She, my sister, myself, and another person were in a group at a trivia night. One of the challenges required a member from each group to go to the front and answer trivia questions. My sister bravely went to the front and was doing really well when she was asked to complete a lyric from a super sexual song. The girl rolled her eyes and said something like, “Ugh, she’s waaay too innocent for that,” when my sister was far out of earshot. I wanted to disagree and say something about how she’s not really that innocent, etc. But I thought better of it because, once again, what’s wrong with being innocent? Why is that so awful? I was so mad at the girl then because, while it sucks when she is condescending and rude to me, it’s even worse when she makes the same comments about my sister. 

So my question is this: how do I politely get her to stop the condescending behavior without ending our friendship? She doesn’t respond well to emotion or confrontation of any kind, so I feel a bit out of my element with this one. Sorry if this problem seems small, but it has been weighing on me over the years (these incidents are drops in the bucket compared to how often she treats us this way) and I’m worried I might blow a gasket next time she makes a similar comment. Any ideas?",21Aug2019,1
268,"Basically what it says in the title. He was hospitalized for an eating disorder after he passed out from not eating for a week. He had to spend the better part of a month in inpatient treatment, and obviously couldn’t go to his regular therapist during this time. His therapist knows that he was missing therapy for important treatment that he needed to survive. But she still says that if he misses another appointment, she’ll file a 51A report (reporting abuse/neglect). So if he gets sick or has to be hospitalized again, him and his brother (who has absolutely nothing to do with the situation) could get put into foster care. Any logical person can see that this is absolute bullshit. How could he keep this from happening? Could this even happen? It seems like because he was getting important and potentially life saving treatment while he was absent, it would be the opposite of neglect. Would the report filed by his therapist have any grounds? Does it matter? I don’t really know how this stuff works. If anyone could shed some light on how he could deal with this or if this is something to be worried about at all, I’d really appreciate it.",21Aug2019,1
269,"Hello, I am an upcoming high-school freshmen. I have a choice of two high schools that I could attend, and I really need some advice for which to go for. I don't want to name these schools, so I'll just call them school 1 and 2.

School 1

School 1 is a blue ribbon school, so it's the best of the best. I actually had to apply for this school, and I was chosen. It seemed all sunshine and rainbows at first, but then I realized this school is not all it promises.

The pros

Of course, if I go here, I have a much higher chance at success in the future. I plan on going to college, and tuitions are being thrown at students in this school left and right. This school also has career pathways, so basically I can choose special classes that give me a headstart on what career I want to aim for in the future. This school will definitely look pretty on any college applications, which will always be very helpful.

The cons

Stress. The idea of the difficulty of these classes scares me. This school has very scrict criteria that you have to meet to not get kicked out. I mainly deal with stress through art and band, but those classes are very very limited at this school, as I can only take band for one semester, and I'll have to wait till next year to see if I can get into art class. There are no other extra-curricular classes except chorus, which I don't plan on taking. I'm not entire sure if I can cope with the stress of this school without those. The counselors seem more focused on making sure students' grades are good instead of the well-being of students. Overall, the school seems very cutthroat.


School 2

School 2 is a regular high school, the one I would be required to go to if I didn't apply to school 1. There's nothing too special about it. It's very packed with students, but it's kind of always been that way from what I heard.

The pros

School 2 will give me a full high school experience. Regular old classes, plenty of extra-curriculars, all different kinds of students, the like. I feel like I could handle school 2 without imploding, while still balancing a social life, and possibly a part-time job in the future.

The cons

Well, it's a regular school. I doubt I'm going to be very challenged in my classes, and I'd always feel like I could be doing more. Also, fights. This school practically has a reputations for having a lot of fights. I've never gotten into a fight myself, and I don't think I would, but with the amount this school has a year, I'm afraid I'm going to end up being dragged into one. My old school had its ""gangs,"" and I think they're just going to get worse if I go here, as a lot of the same kids that were going to my old school are going here.

I joined a band and sometime after everyone left I  took over. I killed the band name but a friend suggested I bring it back so I said fuck it why not. 

Flash forward a couple months and I have new members along with a previous member from the last lineup. Things are going fine but since the beginning I made it know i was going to release the songs that I had written when I brought back the band in the future. I recorded my body of music recently and took a break from music. Well my Instagram was flooded with posts about me in bad blood. I was confused. I didn’t really feed into the drama and kept away. I talked to one of the members who talked shit about me. 

He admitted he was wrong and that I didn’t even do anything wrong. I said cool but I don’t wanna be friends anymore. 

The posts disappeared and now one of the other members that I recorded this body of music is saying he is going to be putting his own vocals on tracks that I recorded. I recorded every single instrument btw. 
The lyrics/arrangements. All done by me. 

I’m actually getting ready to release this body of music soon and I’ve already started promoting it. 

The big question I have is what should I do? 
I mean I don’t want this dickhead to steal my music but I don’t wanna give the kid any attention because I know it feeds his/their ego.

277,"My ideals are not hard to understand! I am a man who has traveled and has experienced riches (non-material. those that have come to know me, truly know who I am and learned how I feel about the world around us, knew this post was inevitable. 

I have lived among many different people. I tried to help those that I chose to love. Most did not accept that help unless it solely benefited them. but those who gave back... or paid it forward and helped when they could have become to me family! Years ago I was leaving Germany (being Deported) and someone told me I would be a legend. Many others have told me I should start a revolution... I will not do more than keep trying to be there 100% for those I love! My revolution is a seed planted from the first handshake or hug. I have taken the life I had And chose to put every effort into becoming a better person every day! Make at least one person smile a day! And wether you know me as Josh, David, Yoshi, or Lunch box I hope to have affected you in a positive way. 

Danielle Elise and Hailey Erickson call thbhose people Yoshites... I call you FAMILY and if anyone who knows the real me They know that sometimes I have been abrasive and had an attitude but for the few times I have been this way I ave been there more as a friend, brother, or even a father figure. I do not claim to be better than anyone else, but I will say that those who put a continued effort to become better people and find their own balance between bad/good, hate/love, violence/peace once you consciously make these efforts the people around you will benefit and follow your example. Some will resist it and those may never understand that in this world what you put out comes back but only if you do not expect it, will experience a better quality of life!

My revolution is not for me or even those that live now its for our children children... If we affect this world by leaving a truly good impression on those around us it will eventually be contagious! What I'm saying is don't let people use you, learn to recognize those who want to take but not give back (even if its not to you) will not learn and eventually if this affects enough people they will have nothing but evidence in front of them that shows them a different view... (its not our place to impose this on anyone). The fact is that my movement is in all of your hearts and the way you treat those you love and those less fortunate than you! 

my family has helped me more than I could have ever expected, John Halley, Jim Halley, Joshua Trentham, Hailey Nichole Nichols, Donita Ra'nee Bierman, Claudette Mccarty, Amanda Belcher, Hailey Erickson, Danielle Elise and many others in my family thank you for being there and giving forgiveness where it wasn't deserved and helping when I was in need... I wish I had more to give back and will but at the moment I want all to see that I have been in thought and meditation through many of the situations I have experienced and though many (most) times I have failed to make the right decisions I have always put an extreme amount of effort for all I have for those I love and will continue until the day I die! 

I love you all and I am amazed by even the small group of people all over the world I have influenced. I am grateful to those that take me seriously. 

So, as of this moment I want those that read this and have any love for me to understand that my revolution is evolving as I do and please for me, make someone smile every day! 

we have an obligation as human beings to be good to our fellow man!

278,"Literally no one in my life is giving me any direction on my situation. I guess that’s officially adulthood where I’m just supposed to trust myself and make whatever choice I feel is best. But, I’d really appreciate advice in the mean time! Thank you! 

My boyfriend of two years broke up with me during our vacation, 30 hours away from home. He bottled up a lot and had a panic attack and had enough. We finished a great vacation together, and afterwards still had enough. During our week of vacation together I misunderstood his venting as us discussing things through, but he brought up me moving out or not and verified he indeed was done with us. Two days later he says he thinks he was being unfair by not giving us a chance since he agreed he bottled things up. Background purposes, he does indeed have legit reasons to break up with me. I haven’t told him I love him, and he’s definitely the giver in the relationship. That being said I thought the break up would be easier for me but the last week has been a lot more painful than i thought it’d be. I don’t want to sit here and waste time discussing our insecurities, so just go with the quick summary for me if you can. It’s hard for me to want to let him take back the break up because I feel like it was done for a reason and his overthinking and the normal feelings of the break up process is just getting to him...but I know I also have to be fair of the “grey area” of emotions and what not. 

On top of this, my living situation either requires me to stay and work on the relationship, move out nearby and stay with my job that pays very well and will give me flexible hours soon, or move out of state 8-9 hours away because I’m starting my online Master’s degree program in a week and try to land a job there and depend more on my financial aid. I planned on moving out of state in a year or two anyway because I want the research aspect of my degree as I feel like that’s important to me.",21Aug2019,1
279,"My friend and I recently moved in together. We’re both in college and attend the university 3 minutes away from our flat.

I had to leave my job for some unrelated stuff. I haven’t even told my own folks about it, much less his.

They keep asking him if I’ve been working. That and they’ve been asking if he’s doing all the work.

I get that have a right to be concerned, but I think they’re being overbearing. They know I’ve got my own savings account, money in the account, know that I cooked several dinners for us, and all this.

280,"My mom and her boyfriend (he’s been like a dad to me) work at the same place. Moms worked there for 11 years and her bf longer. They do different stuff. Anyway, some shady shit went down at the office this past year and my moms bosses have been trying to fire her for whatever reason. She had a surgery which caused her to be out for a few weeks and when she returned, things were scary different. Instead of respect and humility my mother used to get, she was greeted with judgement and lies. My mom wanted to give her work the benefit of the doubt so she asked a few questions only to learn her company was now filled with liars and manipulators. Her hands are tied in contract. She got a termination letter one day and it was so surprising she called her boss in the middle of the night to ring him a new one. She went to work the following day and they revoked this “mistake”. That was over a month ago. Last week she left a stressful meeting to go to a quiet room and calm her heart rate. She has been told by the doctor to remove herself from stressful situations and she felt the need to do so here. They sent her home and called her insubordinate and unprofessional even though it was medical and she did not cause a scene. They told her not to come back until they called. She was called in today and was fired. Her bf apparently has been lying to her and playing her. She believes he has been manipulating her and pretending to love her because he’s been in on it this whole time. They’ve been together for 4 years. She screamed at him to get out. I’m lost. I’m sad. I’m confused. I hurt for my mother. She is the strongest person I know. Yet I don’t understand why she believes her bf to be a scam. I have been shown no proof even when asked. But she’s adamant on it and us fighting is history repeating itself. 

If you made it this far, I appreciate your time. I’d love some advice on how to handle this delicate situation. Both on my mother’s front and her boyfriends. I care for them both deeply but will always stand with my mom. But that doesn’t mean my emotions aren’t a wreck. What am I supposed to do?",21Aug2019,1
282,"I just firmly believe I am a loser. It doesn't even upset me anymore, it just seems like a fact to me. 
I mean loser in the sense that I lose at most everything. 
I swam varsity in highschool and even became captain of my team and never won a single race. 
And as much as I love to play video games, I am realistic enough to admit that despite practice, I am not very good at them, and very rarely win a game. 
Any raffle, race or competition I participate in I seem to lose, despite the odds.
My boyfriend responds very defensively when I call myself a loser, to the point he almost gets angry with me. He lists off some trivial things that I am good at but none of it backs the notion that I am exceptional enough at any of it to win something for it.
All my life I've just been told that I'm a loser, and now I really do believe it. I know it's not a particularly great mindset but no amount of optimism has ever made a difference. 
I don't know how to be a winner, but I want to feel like a winner. It's getting really old just losing time and time again, but at the very least I don't want to unshakably believe I'm a loser. I need help convincing myself I'm worth something. I want to be exceptional at something.",21Aug2019,1

So basically My mother believes that my father is cheating on her after she found some 'evidence' which she believes to prove her theory. The evidence my mother has is a recipes for a hotel and one of her close friends saying that they saw my father a the hotel. ( There are other shady pieces of evidence such as perfume and a 'condom' however that was after she had drunk a bottle of vodka so no way to prove it.) She's been arguing at my father to let her see his phone however my father is not allowing her due to his work as he writes top secret exams. ' an oath of silence was made to the nation we live in. (Pretty cool ikr). Throughout all of this my dad has remained level headed and has even tried comforting her and caring for her during this argument and even going to the lengths of getting her to sleep which took 2 hours to do.

286,"my second and third time smoking were spent with a guy that i had been talking to. it was his weed, and i was still new to the experience whereas he was a heavy smoker who spent all his time and money on weed. i was alone at his house when this happened btw. when i took my first toke (which was fairly small, but keep in mind that it was only my second and third time) i had almost immediately encountered tunnel vision and blacking out every two minutes. it was awful. i couldn’t focus enough to walk, i felt like i was gonna puke (but didn’t) and i was getting really hot. he eventually walked me to the couch to lay down, and after ten minutes, shit hit the fan. whenever i closed my eyes pictures flashed nonstop of random things. i couldn’t focus at all, and i couldn’t fall asleep. about what felt like half an hour later, i started thinking about the meaning of life and other existential things. i had major anxiety and i felt trapped in my own mind. it lasted like this for what felt like hours, but i eventually fell asleep.

fast forward to the next day, i was still a little bit high, but i made it home. i was in the comfort of my own bed, yet i still didn’t feel right. the thoughts didn’t go away. i still had major anxiety for no reason. 

eventually i feel into a major depersonalization stage. i felt depressed, i had an ongoing existential crisis, i felt unsafe and was on the verge of thinking suicidal thoughts. this lasted for about 4-5 months. eventually i got out of it (thank god) but it was literally the worst phase of my life. 

i’ve smoked weed many times since then, but not with the same guy. i’ve smoked my close friends weed, my cousins weed, my moms weed, and even taken edibles without coming close to the effects i had with the one guys weed. 

since that experience i have been cautious about how much i smoked (even though it was a small amount to start out with) but deep down i don’t feel as though it was the amount i smoked those nights, especially since it was reoccurring. can anyone who knows a lot about drugs help me figure out if the weed was laced? i cut ties with the guy so i can’t ask him myself, but i can say it wouldn’t be too far fetched of him to give me (a young girl alone at his house for the night) laced weed.",21Aug2019,1
287,"My brother in-law (22M) just moved back to our hometown . My husband (25M) and I (24F) offered to let him stay with us for the time being until he finds a place to live. In exchange, he helps with bills, does a lot of the house work, and helps with our kids. 

I spent forever making dinner today, and nobody ate it but me. It honestly made me pretty sad, I was really proud of what I cooked, and pretty lonely eating it by myself. My husband came home from work at around 5, played some video games, then went to sleep. My kids (2 and 4 year old) didn't want what I made, so I made them their favorites, chicken nuggets and macaroni and cheese. His brother got home from work at around 11.

By this time, my husband and kids were asleep, and I in bed on my phone. He sends me a text saying ""Dinner was great, thank you."" 

I came out of bed and saw he was doing the dishes. He says hi, asked if he woke us up. I told no, that I was already awake. He said he figured he'd clean up a bit before he went to sleep, which I really appreciate because my husband never does anything around the house. 

Then he said ""You're a really amazing mom. (Husband) doesn't get how lucky he is. I hope I can find someone like you to settle down with."" 

I was pretty shocked that he said that. I didn't know what to say, so I just said thanks and went back to bed.

288,"For as much brevity as possible here's a little backstory, : My (17m) cousin (18f) and I are close,  she's like a sister to me and she lives close by.

My cousin's good friend, lets call her Erin, (18f) is there often and spends days at a time at my cousin's house and would often be there when we all hung out. We've known each other for about a year and a half and during that time i've had short little crushes on her but dissipated quickly because we only saw each other when we were both at my cousin's house as well as the fact that we went to different schools and she lives about a 35 min drive away. Now this girl is nice but has obsessed over one of the young teachers at her school to the point that i thought it was a little creepy and has shown other red flag-ish things.

Everything was fine up until the middle of July when I found out from a source that she liked me. That day I hung out with my cousin, a mutual friend of ours, and Erin. Me, being a dumb, horny, asshole, flirted with her and got her to admit that she liked me, and I  also told her that I had feelings for her. (Being honest i'm not experienced with girls and I was very guarded following this.) We would often talk on snap but things were slow and I didn't know where things were going, since she was (at the time) telling me she was going to a college in a bordering state and I was only going into my senior year of high school. It was also general knowledge that I was interested in a certain school close by to where I live, but wasn't fully committed to that exact school. My cousin was also going to be attending this school (but i wasn't going to go there just for that reason). For these reasons I didn't take things with Erin too seriously. Another important detail is that neither of us have our licence, which made it so the only time we saw each other was when we were both at my Cousin's house. During times like this i was pretty flirty but nothing ever happened. I realize now that i'm an asshole and that she really did like me and that i was just being a horny bastard without thinking of what would happen. Only after this did I think about what would happen to us since she was going to college in a different state and I didn't want to be in a long distance relationship, and when we did hang out alone it seemed awkward and I couldn't see us together for very long if we did decide to date. Trust me I know im an asshole for this, but that scared me to death. I had a long talk with my cousin about this since she was wondering why i was so distant from both of them. I explained everything that i felt and she understood what i was feeling. We both agreed that the right thing to do, was for me to tell her that I didn't think it was a good time for us to get into a relationship, considering the circumstances. So I did just that, i told her my concerns about school and about me not knowing what i wanted to do or where i was even gonna go to school. I thought it went surprisingly well, as we both walked back into the house and it wasn't awkward. But in this conversation she tells me she's not going to the school she was *gong* to attend anymore, and is going to transfer to the school that my cousin was going to. 

Fast forward to today. I was invited by my Cousin and Erin to go to a fair in a nearby town with them. I didn't want to go in the first place and my Cousin was bringing along a friend of hers that she was interested in. I thought it would be a little strange with them two together leaving me and Erin alone, so i decided to turn down the offer, and to instead hang with some buddies of mine. At the end of the night i went home but, Erin begged my cousin to call me until I gave in and finally came over to hang out, to which I eventually did. (They were pretty drunk) At one point I was left alone with Erin, where she told me I have been ""acting different and being weird"" ( this, i assumed was since our talk, i had stopped flirting with her, as to not make things difficult for us both.) . She then went on to tell me how she thinks im not telling the truth about the reasons that I don't want to date. I explained how i know now that i was an asshole but those are the reasons why ive been more ""distant"". She told me how she still wants to see me and that shes scared she wont see me again once she goes to college and the reason that she wanted me to go to the fair was so that she could still see me one last time before she heads out for college in a week. She ALSO told me the reason she transferred to the school i was thinking about going to was just because i thought i might go there. She did all of that before i talked to her the first time. I have no idea what to do.... i just don't understand why she would transfer to a school she thought I *MIGHT* go to even though we *weren'*t even dating. She broke down crying and i tried to comfort her but i was so overwhelmed with everything. I feel like a major POS but then again she seems almost obsessed with me. I feel like i broke her heart but at the same time i feel like i can't force myself to feel that way about her again. its been 2 hours and i still feel overwhelmed by this whole situation.

tldr: a thing with a girl wasn't too serious, but she ended up transferring to a school i *Might* go to in the future just to be with me.

She has always told me things that I shouldn't have learned till I was much older when I was in elementary school. She always told me not to trust people, or dont do this and this, and looking back I saw that I missed out of that impulsive rebel stage of my childhood. I have always had a fear of people and didn't trust people because of the things she instilled in me from a young age. I never thought to question her because she was my mom and never wanted to stand up to her because i was the only person in her corner.

A big thing that they always emphasized was that their children will always have a place to stay with them.

It was a great opportunity for me to catch up on student loans and try to set myself up for when I graduate college (class of 2020 hopefully).  And so we moved in, after the first month we had been doing alright but we're trying to get our stuff together since I took summer classes and we both worked part-full time jobs, and moving wasn't easy since the house has a lot of stuff in it before us moving back in, finding places for things was getting hard. 
The parents came for a visit and noticed that there were some marks on the wall from either the dogs noses touching the wall or some kind of spill, there was a small sticky spot on the counter, and the pool was a little cloudy.
They got very angry at us and said it better not happen again. 
""No worries"" I thought because it was a small slip up but things were getting easier to manage so it'd be easier to catch up on.
Fast forward to the next visit where they come in and start yelling at us about the patio not being swept and that the grass wasn't freshly cut (note: I'm deathly allergic to grass and weeds and had to undergo 5+years of allergy treatment shots to handle summertime). This escalated to them saying we weren't welcome in their home and that we need to find a new place to stay.
During the fight my dad got violent and started throwing stuff, he said he's disappointed in my sister and ashamed he ever helped her. He's since cut her phone off and removed her from his insurances.

My husband and I have been married a couple of years and travelled pretty extensively but there’s still a few items on the old bucket list. We’ve recently bought a house and we’re both relatively career driven - I’ve recently landed a great opportunity however it’s only a 12 month contract which started in June this year (potential for permanency).

We’ve been talking about having kids since we got married, and there’s always been something in the way, buying a house, a new job, a trip etc.

We’re at the age where a lot of our friends are pregnant or already have kids (late twenties, early thirties). It’s making us think more about it and we’d be excited if it happens but we were planning a trip for next April where I’d prefer not to be pregnant and I also don’t want to risk an opportunity at work.

I guess my question to you is, I know there is never a perfect time but do you wish you waited a bit longer and went on more adventures before having kids? 

I feel a lot of people say kids are magical and miracles but I’ve seen some the reality and hard work that comes with it and I often feel like people aren’t so honest about the hard part of the day to day of raising kids or the implications of less ideal timing. 

Lastly, just to get ahead of it, we know we’re able to have children so not as concerned about that possibility right now.

When following a story, I desperately want to figure out what the mysteries of the plot are, like everyone else. 

Doing so actually involves work, like playing the game, and reading the book. And eventually halfway through the ""work"", I give in to the easy cop out to satisfy my curiosity: reading the Wiki.

I always regret doing so as I imagine how much more satisfying it would be to discover these things instead of being given the answers.

Any good tips to stop this behavior?",21Aug2019,1

311,"Hello! So, I'm a conditioner at a well known grocery store. Basically, I work 5pm to 11:30 pm and I go threw 13 isles and end caps. I stock our store brand bread and manually count bread out of the system and throw it away. I also take care of products that are open, meat left out, damaged, and/or tampered with and put them away accordingly. While also attending to costumers and being called up at anytime to help bag or get carts. 

When I got my interview at said grocery store I was interviewed by two of the managers and they were sitting in front of me, while sitting at a table and I was looking at Manager 1 and he was talking I happened to look over and Manager 2 (my current boss) was looking at my breast. Keep in mind I tried to brush it off, I didn't have a job and I really needed one. So, they hire me. 

I remember him really being nice to me and then one fateful day he pulls me aside and said ""you are going too slow, I'd rather you go faster and it be decent than no perfect."" Which pissed me off to the core cause I have a total of 4 managers. Manager 1 works in the back with me and my boss and the guys who stock and run truck. I have asked multiple times to stock and he keeps repeating that he will keep it in mind. We only have one stockers. We need a totally of 4 or 5. I have never since February (7 months) have seen my boss hire a female stocker. The stockers that he hired were all gross. They would talk about trying to fuck all the girls in the store and see who can get more than who. They both had girlfriends and daughters. My boss would cut up with them and have a fun time with them, but the minute I'd spoke to him he would become cold. Even though we have a lot of women who applied for it. I'm one of them, he told me they don't need stockers but needed a conditioner. I took the job, because I needed money.

After, he pissed me off I finished early that night. Which I think pissed him off. Then he started complaining that I'm going too fast. Then started complaining about the bottom shelf and I'm not gonna lie, but I forget about the bottom shelf but have gotten better past few weeks. He then proceeds to try to tell me that I am skipping sections. Which of course. I am not, I am not skipping anything. 

He tells me this for a few times and tonight he wrote me up. He told me it was a job performance issue. Proceeds to tell me the bullshit, I feel my blood boil but I'm too scared to speak up. We were in a tiny inclosed room and it was for the most part sound proof. So I signed off and then I left. The room angry and confused. It was just a verbal warning, but for some reason it had to be written. It was really upsetting because I know I'm doing my job and I try my fucking hardest to help the cashier's, janitors, and costumers. 

The weird thing is that on the form there is a list to choose from on what time of write up it is. There's a option for job performance (which he told me that is what it was for), but he checked the option ""personal behavior"" and in his notes stated that I didn't care enough and need to put more effort into my job. 

He talked down to me but then he'd say shit like ""I'm not trying to be mean."" And then went on about how I can get training. Said that I could be a janitor if I'd like. Even though last week I asked to do stocking (I asked again because the opportunity to possibly stock). 

He told me the speed I'm going at, he's never seen someone go that fast and it look good. 

We are a busy grocery store. We have costumers come in while I work so who knows when and where someone will mess up the work I did. Which I'm fine with, but my bosses can't seem to understand that. 

They won't let two conditioners work together at the same time unless it is to train them. Which I trained someone Friday and then I was off till today and then decide to give me a write up at 10pm. 

I'm looking for another job currently one that is full time and way better pay. Currently I'm bring paid 9.00 an hour and just recently been getting 3 days a week (before it was only 2). 

I'd also like to mention he became a manager last August. My cashier friend was working during the time before and after he was a manager. Apparently, before he was a manager he would try to have sex with female associates. 

I just don't know if he's actually a dick or not cause he says that he defends all of his employees. I believe he talks down me and other female associates (conditioners and janitors). I feel he is a sexist pervert and many of my female associates agree. 

I feel stupid and crazy for it, but he treated me much better in the beginning and then a part of me believes when he saw me with my bf at the store he got mad. 

He mocks associates behind their back and talks badly about them in a non work related way. Things a manager shouldn't be discussing. 

I just can't stand him",21Aug2019,2
313,"This might not make sense, but it's been pretty much a lifelong problem for me and I have no clue what causes it. I get lonely, but have little to no interest in people. It isn't always this way because I have friends and I have been in relationships, but it's the way things are most of the time. I don't understand what causes it or what makes it go away. It seems to come and go. Sometimes alcohol and weed help, and sometimes they make it worse. There doesn't seem to be any pattern to it.

One example is I dated this one girl who I used to talk to a lot. We texted each other a lot and called each other almost every night. For a few months we were pretty in love, and then somehow the interest in talking to her went away. My feelings for her didn't, but I just felt no desire to ask her how her day was or call her. She hated it and tried to get us communicating more, but it didn't work. It sucked because I wanted to connect with her, but I just didn't feel the desire if that makes sense.

That's pretty much happened in all my relationships and friendships now that I think about it. At a certain point my desire to talk to them wanes and I have nothing to say, but I don't necessarily like them any less. As dramatic as this sounds, it's like some sort of invisible wall is put up in my mind that prevents me from fully feeling the desire to talk to them, and it seems to come out of nowhere. Sometimes it even happens while I dislike that it's happening. More of my friends now understand and don't expect more communication from me, but at the same time these friendships are not very deep because I have not put in the energy and time to develop them.

I think people end up assuming I'm uninterested because of it. But it's not that I'm uninterested; it's that my curiosity about a person or desire to connect with another person often stays abstract and doesn't turn into anything more concrete that leads to any actions. So then I end up with nothing to say to really contribute to a conversation. It's like my mind becomes empty and can't come up with content to contribute to a conversation.

TL;DR: I desire to form connections with people but for some reason have barely any desire or interest in interacting with them. I have no idea why.",21Aug2019,1

316,"Help, I need to figure out how to cancel on a group of my friends last minute and not come off as flaky or an A-hole. I'm cancelling literally hours before. 

So they've been planning a beach day for a couple weeks. I didn't confirm until a couple days ago because I honestly didnt know if I would be free. I work two part-time jobs, and have this weekend booked off (I'm traveling back to my hometown).

By some stroke of luck I got today off so I confirmed I could go and was really looking forward to it. Everyone is really excited. 

But then last night they told me which beach we'd be going to. Instead of choosing one of the many beaches less than 2 hours away, they decide on a beach that is 4  hours away. 

The rest of the group seems totally fine with the decision. So I'm the odd man out thinking this is an unusual choice. 

I have no clue when or how I'm going to finish my laundry and pack. The earliest I can expect to get home is 11pm since we're all carpooling. I then work early Thursday morning and have to rush from work to catch the last train to my home town.

317,"I'll start the story like this. Me and my new girlfriend got an apartment . About a month in it didn't work out, I ended up paying her to help with moving costs and found a new roomate online. He turned out to be a total fuckhead. He's ex military, 52 years old and a gym nut. Right after he signed the lease he started saying things like, the living room is going to be like this, I get these cupboards, ect. Basically he took full charge of the apartment. I told myself ""hey, after the lease is up I won't have to deal with it anymore"" during this time he got a dog. No big deal to me. But then he says that he gave my neighbor a key because she will be taking care of him every two hours while he is at work. So now I've got someone coming in and out of the house every 2 hours all day. This dog shits on the floor still, and he cleaned it up with the wrong cleaner and stained the carpet, then tells me he told the apartments it was the construction workers who did it. I can't have any friends over because every time I do he accuses them of stealing or feeding his dog, or says that someone went in his room (yeah, none of that ever happened) this becomes an ongoing problem and this fucking guy, every time I disagree about anything he will flex and sneer at me and say ""then we are going to have problems bro"" . He has done this repeatedly and usually with his shirt off. The guy is trying to fight me and I can't do anything because he would obviously kick my ass. Fast forward. The lease is up for him it's time to go.. this motherfucker comes to me and says he's signing again. Shirt off. Staring me down. Nothing I can do because it's a masked threat. He runs the apartment . By this time I had already moved a new girlfriend in (his replacement on the lease) and she is afraid of him too. We don't leave the room anymore. Nobody is allowed in the livingroom without getting threatened. I can't have anyone over because everyone is afraid of him. He screamed at my mom when she came to visit. In his fucking underwear and made her cry. I almost lost it but my girlfriend calmed me down. Shortly after he moves his son in. He told us his song was coming to visit. Can't say no because ""we will have problems bro"".  He son ends up being a tweaker and bailing on rent while not on the lease 1 day before it's due and this fucking guy says he's not responsible and that we are splitting the rent both ways. Like before. He has never asked anything once. EVER. It's always that this is what he is going to do and if I go against it then again ""we are gonna have problems bro, flexing and sneering at me. The neighbor that goes in and out of the house writes down if me and my girlfriend are home or not and reports our schedule to him and anybody that I have over. Then he chooses these times to accuse us of stealing. He has completely taken over my place and me and my girlfriend live in a room. We don't use the livingroom, and don't cook anymore. This guy's slams doors, stomps around the house. His son actually stole my bike and skateboard and random small things and was also doing meth. There's alot Moor my roommate has done but this could go on forever. Sorry if it is convoluted if you have any questions let me know. Basically I want this guy out . He is a fucking psycho and has obviously done this before because of the way he presents every move he makes. He knew he wasn't supposed to sign the lease again and he is using the lease agreement as way to stay here and control our home  without breaking the law. Please any advice before I kill him. I talked to property management, I guess nobody likes him there but they can't do anything until he either breaks the lease or things escalate to a physical altercation  HELP!

324,"FOR CONTEXT 
So I had this fella in twitter that post artworks of an artist that draw strips of scientific comic about antivaccine origin and why it's continue to get people attention.

So I saw him had tweet at the end of his thread and I quote:-

""Credit to its respective owner(s). Just want to spread awareness and correct all those misinformation""

So I notice he didn't tag the artist, hence I tweet to him and I quote:-

""Can you at least credit @sciencecomic for the artwork😊""

He stood his ground, mock me and says ""credits to respective owner"" is already enough and blatantly accused me for being antivaccine out of nowhere. Apparently I got the backlash of people that says and I quote :-

""dude he didnt know the real owner at first so he credited to the respective owner. chill la at least he didnt claim that as his artworks""

And many more.

So my question is, am I at fault for this thing or is ""credit to respective owners"" is enough to have credits to the original artist? Need a change of view as I don't want to see only from my perspective and apparently the op of the Twitter thread is quite fond with baseless and senseless argument.

After we broke up I immediately started dating J, who broke up with me last week after two amazing years. Admittedly, it's still a little soon for me to seriously be thinking about dating, but I can't get this out of my head.

H lives about a 3 hour drive away from me, but yesterday I decided to go visit him and some family who lives nearby. Long story short, after having a great time hanging all night, we ended up in bed. It was amazing; we always were very compatible in that regard but I loved how he treated me--kind and attentive and sweet and super, super into it. Afterwards we talked for a while; I told him about how I loved how natural it felt to have sex with him and he said that he normally doesn't like sex but I make him feel comfortable and that he's really attracted to me. It was really heartfelt and intimate. We fell asleep together.

I left this morning to go home and we didn't really talk about the night before, but now he's messaging me constantly (which isn't normally like him). I kinda feel like something sparked between us last night, and as much as I would like to have the conversation in person, I'm wondering if I should just message him at some point because I just want to know where we stand. 

I was thinking about just sending him something along the lines of ""*hey, I was just wondering what you were feeling about what happened between us the other night*,"" because I feel like that's straight to the point, but what I want to communicate is that I was really glad that happened, I want it to happen again, and I want to know where he's at--is this emotional, or is it just hooking up? I'm not currently in a great place to start a serious relationship, and I'm worried about the distance, but honestly, I'm really thinking about trying to pursue this, if it's something he's interested in.

337,"(Sorry, long post. I'm lost on what to do about a contract provided after we offered a job. Boyfriend and I can't agree and it's causing a lot of stress and I need reddit to help)

I'm returning to work on September 4th after 12 weeks maternity leave with my new daughter. I have been searching for a childcare provider to watch my baby in my home for the three hours between daddy going to work and mommy getting home. After weeks of no luck, miscommunication and interviewees that didn't show up, I found a very promising young lady that seemed like a good fit. We set up an interview and she showed up on time and interviewed very well.

Before she arrived, I discussed some things with my boyfriend. The main thing was pay. At most, I was able to pay $15. I would be giving up about 50% of my monthly pay at this rate, however, and would prefer to pay less so things weren't so tight. I told him that I wanted to ask what rate of pay she wanted and if it was less than $15, I'd be very happy as long as it wasn't too low. He immediately took the reins in the interview and was asking good questions so I let him continue and added things that I felt were needed as we proceeded. He ended up asking her what rate she wanted. She said she charges $13 an hour but will go lower if needed. I was very happy and was about to offer her the job at $13 an hour when my boyfriend said ""well we would like to offer you the job if you'd like it. Would you be okay with $15 an hour?"" She said she'd be very happy to take the job and $15 sounds great. I didn't say anything because he already offered it and although it wasn't my word, I feel like you shouldn't give your word on something and then take it back. She said that she likes to draw up a contract before taking any childcare position to make sure everybody is happy and we agreed that sounded good. She said she'd draft it up and send it over and we can negotiate on anything we don't agree with. 

She is a college student and stated she may sometimes have to leave early for obligations to an extracurricular program she is in and I said that is fine, I can leave work early or make other arrangements if that arises.

I received the contract a few hours ago. It says we need to pay her a week in advance. I've never had a job that paid in advance and I feel this could cause some issues. If she decides she no longer wants to work for us, I'm out $225 because a broke college student likely won't be able to refund me. How would we handle the days when she leaves early for college? Do I just pay her less for the next week? There is nothing in the contract for how that would be handled. 

The contract states that if I am even one minute late, I have to pay her an extra hour plus $1 per minute. I told her when we were first interviewing that I have a long commute and the road I take is constantly under construction so I may be a minute or two late. I can't afford to pay an extra hour every day. She made herself seem very flexible with time during the interview (I can be here at any time or leave whenever). I would prefer a prorated pay or $1 per minute, something to that effect. 

I told my boyfriend that I want to negotiate those parts of the contract. I understand the want for advanced pay because she might think that we will end care one day and just not pay her for work done. That would never happen and it is more likely that we would lose out on paid money if she wanted to end care for any reason. I either don't want to pay in advance and only pay for work done each week on Friday, or I can pay an additional amount each week until she has a full weeks pay in advance (ie: $225 plus $25 per week for 9 weeks). I've been out of work while still paying bills and they are due again the same week I'd have to pay her for the first week in advance and that isn't feasible for me at this moment. 

I want to negotiate her late fee request. She has the times open for me to fill out so I either want to add some extra time each day, maybe 10 minutes, to give me a little leeway to deal with the commute home. Any time after that will be $1 per minute. 

Here is the issue. My boyfriend is appalled by the contract. He thinks she's trying to take advantage of us. He said my only option is to rescind the $15 an hour and tell her we're only willing to pay $13 and the rest of the contract will be fine. I told him that although I wasn't happy with him offering more than I wanted to pay without speaking to me first, he offered it and she agreed and I am not willing to take that back. It's not something I'm willing to compromise on because it feels wrong. I stick to my word. He says he wasn't the one that posted the job or asked for the interview so he's not the employer and what he offered doesn't matter. I need to lower her rate. I insisted that I won't do that and he is a joint employer of the provider for our l daughter so what he said is what goes. He said he didn't know she would add these stipulations so we need to change the pay. I want to negotiate the contract. He's saying that my ethics don't make any sense and I need to lower her agreed upon pay and my options aren't feasible or valid. I just want to negotiate the contract points that we aren't comfortable with and am not willing to compromise on the pay he offered. 

He now wants me to find somebody else for the position because I won't lower the pay. He refuses to agree to renegotiate. I refuse to lower her pay. I think she would be great for our daughter and i am so stressed out now that I don't know what to do. I don't think I could find somebody else that meets my standards in this small amount of time. This makes me just want to quit my job and find some weekend position so we don't have to find care even though I love my job. 

Am I being unreasonable by not wanting to lower the pay he offered and she agreed to? Is he being unreasonable? Is there some middle ground or other option that makes more sense? I'm at my wits end. Please help!

Tl;Dr: we offered a job at $15 an hour. She gave us a contract and asked us to negotiate on points we don't like. Boyfriend insists I lower her pay to $13 because he doesn't like some things. I refuse to lower pay that we agreed to and instead want to negotiate the points we don't like as requested.",21Aug2019,1
338,"I am a student and in the near future I have to write a test. It's very fortunate, that I have the chance to participate in a course, which is meant to prepare you for this specific test and the person teaching is also a great one. There is also a script of the course and my problem is, that I arrive at the building, where the course is being held, but I always arrive at least 30 minutes after it starts. It's already the third day I missed it intentionally I think, because this course is an perfect offer for me and I just arrive and wait and convince my mind that it's too late and I can learn with the script at home. Also the teacher wouldn't mind me coming late at any time. It's not like I am afraid of that. Moreover I always think , that the other participants would be disurbed by me coming late and since I missed the first day, I don't even know, if there are places/chairs left. 
And if I arrive on time, I could accidentally take someone else's chair. Is there any advice or tips to overcome this? I'm also pretty lazy and what's the word called, where you do something instead of doing the things you should do? Even though I like sitting in a course and writing.

340,"I'll do my best to be brief. I live in California. I'm 29 years old and I live with my parents. I'm pretty poor, been a retail worker since I was a teenager. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I've got an opportunity to move to the east coast where I would be able to live with some friends for pretty cheap. The room for rent will be available in October, so I've been frantically trying to figure out if I could move in time for. The benefits of this move are the following

* Living around other creative-minded friends I love. In CA, I have no group of friends.
* Affordable living. I could actually afford rent 
* Living away from family. I don't have a great family life, which causes a lot of stagnation for me.
* Increase independence, can properly start my adult life.
* Would be pursuing a career in a healthier environment to hopefully get out of retail.

&amp;#x200B;

My number one fear is my financial position. I've been going through the motions for the past few years for personal reasons. Despite working a job consistently since I was a teenager, I've made no progress financially and was living paycheck to paycheck for years. I have a few thousand dollars in credit card debt, and no savings. I got a second job 4 months ago to prepare for this move, and was able to cut my debt in half, however, with no savings, I'm still worried it's stupid to do such a move.  


My fears about moving are as follows...

* Wouldn't have a car right away
* Worried it's dumb to move across the country just to work retail
* Worried career goals won't work out
* Worried about adjusting to the different climate and roads
* Running out of money
* Accumulating a ton of debt again
* Getting stranded
* Getting a car, and then crashing it
* Not being able to transfer work, and not finding new work
* Have no cushion of money to rely on for emergency  


The compromise I'm proposing for myself, is waiting until I have money saved up and no debt. I know I would be ready  in April of 2020, since I would have worked 2 jobs for a year by then. However if I wait that long, I'm scared I'd lose my opportunity to move, as this room gets rented out to someone else. I feel like the right thing to do, and what I want in my hear, is to move. Like right now. But I feel like I have so much damage I have to repair before it's logical to do. I worry about my financial situation, my mental health, how well I cope with stress, my physical health. I know either way a move like this is hard. It's not like I even have a lot to lose technically speaking, but I feel if this doesn't work out for me, I'd just be so catastrophically deeper in this hole I've dug myself into.  


So to summarize, do I take the risk and move, and hope being in a healthier environment and having to work harder would push me to succeed? Or do I wait a year until I'm more financially stable, and hope another room will be available at that time? Whether it's now or later, I will move. I just feel this sense of urgency. I don't want to lose the motivation and talk myself out of moving EVER. I'm almost 30 years old. Retail is killing me, and I'm having the hardest time trying to escape it. I feel like if I don't take the chance, I'll die working retail, having never lived as an independent adult. But I don't want to risk financial ruin either because I'm anxious and impatient.

341,"so, long story short, I wake up around 3:45 am to my mom yelling my name from my living room where she is sleeping. I'm 18, but I live with my mom, my little brother who sleep in the living room, my girlfriend and my son and I sleep in the front bedroom, and my two sisters who have their own bedrooms as well. I came out of the room and my mom told me there was a raccoon in the kitchen and that it was huge, so we barracaded the kitchen and it ran around, eating food and searching for other things to eat. I have been trying to leave food in my trash bags when I throw them out to feed them at least enough to survive, but this one was very fat and well fed. I have all of my windows and my back door sealed shut because admittedly, my house is a bit of a fixer upper, and I didn't know any way to get the raccoon from the kitchen to the front door to get out without putting everyone in the house at risk of it possibly running past the front door and hurting someone. I did what I thought I had to do and I killed the raccoon, I disposed of the body but my girlfriend broke up with me because we're both animal lovers, and now she sees me as a murderer. I don't feel that way, I wish that I could have had another way of going about it but I can't put my family at risk like that, I just don't know how to feel about this. am I a terrible person, did I do the right thing?

As a side note, I´m not planning to pursue this internship when I finish my studies as I don´t like the job and it´s really repetitive and boring and the boss is a complete asshole. I would just like to end on good terms with a good enough excuse so I can keep a good job reference and to complete my university assignment on the job.

The only reason I ask for advice is because, I live with semi narcissistic family members who would rather be at home being lazy, despite us living in a semi big home that needs rent paid, however I’m not letting them control my money because some are also too lazy to get a job themselves and they don’t suffer anxiety. + My boyfriend doesn’t want to live with a possible bum (neither would I, and I understand that.)

Anyway, I’m looking into being an early morning stocker at Petsmart, (I’m homeschooled, and will be 18 this December) and looking into other jobs. They pay 9 an hour which may not be the greatest but it’s enough to save up for a small apartment with my boyfriend. 

I’m curious as to what set of questions interviewers ask, how do I hit the question head on with a good enough answer, and  what do I do after the interview? Call them back the day after? Three days after? Email them? How annoying do I have to be to let them know I’m both eager and persistent to know if I’ll get the job.

I just really want to be able to live on my own already, and not depend on my family when they can barely provide for me. Thank you to anyone who can give me advice, and thank you so much for reading this.

I had an exam this morning, and after being cancelled on by 2 taxis I eventually get to the uni 20 minutes after my exam started. The regulations state that after 30 minutes students aren't allowed to enter the hall.

I pull up my timetable only to find it displayed a ""Timetable Unavailable"" error message, so I couldn't find the room I'm meant to be in.

I chase around and eventually I'm told where to go. I arrive 3 minutes past the 30 minute threshold and was told I cannot sit the exam. After staying awake till 5am stressing myself to death I feel so so crushed that I wasnt able to sit. I know its ultimately still my fault for arriving late, but surely the uni failing to display my timetable correctly means they should accept some responsibility? After all, I still would've made the 30 min threshold if I could see my timetable like I should've. I've spoke to staff at uni, they're being useless, and right now I feel my life has just crumbled before me.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

353,"Going into sophomore year once school comes back around, but a lot had happened to me in the span of the past 8 years that really seem too much even for me. For background, I consider myself to be kinda resilient mentally compared to my peers, and it's something I could take pride in. But in all honesty, I also feel shitty and really bad for my family. Right now it's me, my sister in middle school, my mom, and my autistic little brother who is diagnosed. When I was 11 my dad killed himself via hanging. He was serving in the marine corps for 8 years at that point and was a sergeant before he ended his contract. Him and my mom got divorced a year or 2 prior because of issues with his PTSD that my mom knew about. Me and my sister used to fight all the time but over time we both realized that we were the only ones in this shitty house who were somewhat ok. Our mom told us that he was crazy and everything and was cheating on her. After his death though, she did a 180 and admitted to lying to us during his funeral.

My dad went to places in the middle-east during his contract, he went to Bahrain, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Iran. However he went and set up bases for the military, and I'm guessing that he got PTSD after having to deal with seeing people die. He probably got triggers from seeing us after coming home when me and my sister would come to jump at him. He probably would remember the places he visited, and the people he saw. He was always an angry dude tbh. He wouldn't get mad at us or frighten us, but he was just always mad at himself or something. I used to see him look at himself in the mirror every time he had to get his hair cut. And looking back on it he must've been going through a lot. I used to think he was just being funny and weird. When we went to (Unnamed State) for a family reunion, my dad left early in the morning during one night when we were staying at a aunts house, and he left us with nothing except our luggage. My mom after that whole ordeal though after all that drama, was weird too.

I suspected my mom of seeing guys despite not ""dating"" anyone of them. The first one was this guy named, for privacy purposes, ""Conor"" who she had been friends with his brother since they were kids, and he was a weird dude, he was kinda femboyish in a way, but he was like a weird introvert guitar playing dude. ""Conors"" place was always a fucking mess despite him having a 3 year old son at the time. We stopped hanging out with him because of drama that I won't discuss here. Anyway, she hung out and had phases with these random dudes since our dad left and abandoned us where we currently live. One was a Nic addict paranoid, one was a super crazy devout christian guy, and the latest one was this wrestler dude who seemed alright he was just self centered. Anyway, the point is I don't like my mom because for a while she always tried making us see these guys as father figures like she was making us forget our dad, in-fact we ALREADY had uncles who where friends with my mom and dad since high school, and they are just now having kids. This brings me to my main point with this post.

I thought about all of this recently because, my dad was my age right now when I was born...

So obviously I'm an accident but tbh who isn't? And my main problem wasn't even being an accident. I just felt guilty. I have been feeling sad that I robbed my dad from the rest of his growing up experience I guess. He was in no way perfect. He was a super nerdy scrawny kid who played Quake and CS all day with his friends at LAN parties. When I was born, my mom ran away from home to live with him and his family and he realized he needed to support a new family and he thought the only thing he could do was join the military since he sucked in every field of School and was in no way getting a higher education. He had to become a dad at 16.

Now, I only feel this guilt because he didn't ever ""grow"" out of his old hobbies and stuff and was super reclusive when he got home. He paid more attention to my sister, and it was probably why I bullied my sister for the first half of my current life. All he would do was go on his PC setup that was next to my mom and play WOW or LOL or some MOBA game and he always seemed lonely or sad. He always stayed home when my mom went out with us to go eat, or anywhere. He would come out to major things like say our birthday family trips to Legoland, and he seemed really happy.

I have only felt this way very recently. Back then, I hated him for leaving us because of all the lies my mom spoon fed me and my siblings until his death. It was never a real father-son bond relationship because I didn't really ""know"" him on a personal level since he worked in the military and was reclusive since I was so young. I saw him as a superhero, like he was gonna save the day somehow. It was obviously wrong for him to leave us way back then, but I just wish I knew more about him. My mom tells the truth about him now that he's gone, and how he was like. He really seemed like a nice dude before everything happened. I feel EXTREMELY guilty about robbing him of the rest of his childhood. Since I forced him to grow up, he couldn't let go of and lingered on the things he liked most when he didn't have to be an adult.

I really miss him even still after the past 4 years without him, but it's been like missing someone you didn't know and admired for no reason. I just wish I wasn't born or were born in a time where he was in better conditions where he had a full childhood and had no regrets about his choices when he was younger and talked to me man.

My last conversation with him I told him that I missed him but that I hated him for what he did to us and all he could say at all was that he was sorry over and over. And I currently regret not trying to talk to him as much and also came out of a whole drama scene with some old friends sending my girlfriend who was the first connection in years that I could trust in to a psych ward after making her attempt suicide whom she had cheated on me with while they told and spread rumors about me raping her. Me and her ended up resolving that and getting through it together and making up and I am no longer in touch with any of my old guy friends or anyone except her and me and her are doing amazing now. Despite that, this whole thing about my dad is really making me tip back in forth on the balance of me knowing that my life is good or bad rn.

Tl:DR, I feel lots of pain from feeling that I stole the rest of my dads younger years from him when he was 16 when I was born and I wish I could've been born later in his life so I could've had a real relationship with him and so that he wouldn't cling on to his old self. Or perhaps if I wasn't born at all. My life isn't too great rn either, and I'm too young for this BS. I'd like to reroll my life please god if you exist.

I just started college this week because I'm in an early comer group for people with disabilities. This means any kind from physical, to mental, to learning, and so forth and on. I was pleasantly surprised my crush from my school's summer local was here. The thing is he is hanging out with this one guy who has this rumor going around that I kind of believe. 

There is a group chat for some the students and he is in it. At night time he'll post pictures of girls chests that look like they just started puberty. He'll delete it and say ""lol oops meant to post a meme"", after people see it. He will literally wait for people to come on to delete it. The thing is I am not in the group chat nor have I see these photos. The thing is everyone in the chat says that he's doing it. Some people even left it because they didn't want to deal with that. (I don't blame them.) Regardless of if they are as the rumored age is (12-14) it's still not cool to keep peoples nudes without their permission. And from the fact that everyone in this group chat says the same thing about what this creep is doing I find it hard not to believe he isn't a creep.

Now last night I made a mistake of reporting him to my RA and telling my friend who's on the same team as him. So I don't have any proof so I'm just not gonna go forward on telling anyone else till I do. The thing is my friend/crush is like bffs with this dude.

Reddit, help me find out if I acted wrong in this situation or if there is anything I can do rectify it.

My BF and I have been together for 10 years, we met at a student exchange towards the end of my BF's exchange. In that exchange, my BF also met a british guy called Mark. Mark and BF were together at a student exchange for the first 4 months, then Mark left, and 2 months later I came, and spent the last 2 months at the same student exchange with my now-BF. My BF has known both Mark and I for 10 years, but Mark and I never met there and had only met once, during his visit to us, until this year.

Mark and I have never spoken independently, until this year, we were not friends on Facebook, we knew nothing about each other's lives. My BF and Mark are typical guy friends - talk infrequently, but consider each other to be good friends and when meeting/talking, share life updates.

At the beginning of this year, Mark suddenly contacted us and decided to visit us if we were okay with his sudden arrival. My BF and Mark had a fun-filled week-long visit. Mark let us know that he had had a rough couple of years after his last visit to us and is finally getting back on his feet. Mark looked rough, however, tired, sad, with blue eyes and undereye bags. He also scolded himself frequently, saying things like ""he was an idiot"" and seemed to be very hard on himself. Long story short: based on his actions and words and his very sudden visit, I developed a question whether Mark was doing okay mentally (eg was he depressed or possibly suicidal), especially since he had told under confidence to my BF that he had lost his job, lost his long-term GF and had trouble with the police at one point. I have had mental health problems in the past and I am of the opinion that one helps another person if necessary, especially when it comes to mental health. I'm not forward about my own struggles, but I am willing to be open if I deem it to be necessary. I asked my BF, after Mark had left us, to contact Mark on his own and discreetly and semi-vaguely ask if Mark was doing okay mentally. My BF refused adamantly, saying that 1) men don't do that; 2) he had just spent a week with him and he doesn't think much is wrong with him, Mark had always been ""like that""; 3) due to my own mental health struggles, I am projecting things on Mark.

I spent a week thinking whether I should leave it or not, but in the end, since I had asked my BF to message Mark and he had adamantly refused, and I sincerely thought Mark might be going through stuff, I ended up befriending Mark on social media and very discreetly asking him if he was doing okay. In doing this, I let him know that this was my doing, my BF was not involved and that he did not know about me doing this (implying that Mark can let him know if he wants to, and if he finds I was inappropriate, to direct his anger towards me and not towards his friend with the crazy GF). I apologised to Mark profusely, said I was slightly worried, explained why I was worried, and literally asked if he was doing okay. I did not expect him to answer me and if he did, I expected him to be very cross and message my BF then.

Instead, Mark answered back, saying he had had a lot of trouble in the past couple of years with really dark times, but that he was finally, on his own accord, climbing out of it, and that it was ""kind of me to ask"". I let him know that I was glad he was doing okay and to never think he cannot approach his friend, my BF, if he ever went through something like this again. End of message and there was no reply.

Two weeks later, we were notified that Mark had been hit by a car and had almost died, and was currently in the hospital with severe and life-threatening injuries. My BF was very worried for him and spent weeks talking to his family, trying to reassure them that their son would make it out of it and promised to visit Mark in summer.

It has now been almost 8 months since Mark visited us, and almost 6,5 since he had his accident. We visited Mark two weeks ago and due to some innocent commentary, my BF found out that I had messaged Mark back in the beginning of the year, and he got very cross with me, citing that ""he would have never believed this of me"" and ""that I went behind his back"" and that ""it's as good as me exchanging secret messages with other men in secret"".

During our visit, Mark told us that after his accident, he feels very low, he doesn't feel attractive, he feels lonely and alone, he feels depressed and not motivated to do anything. He described, in detail, him being hit with a car, his injuries, his hospital stays, the medication he is on and the pain he is in. And he revealed, to both of us, that he had, in fact, been depressed a couple of years prior and had considered suicide as a way out.

It has now been a week since our return from the visit and my BF has been consistently getting more angry each day, with ending having almost a screaming match with me last night. He accused me of breaching his trust, even though I had asked him to message Mark back in the beginning of the year, and I had asked him to message him again now, post-visit, to assure HIS friend that he will be fine and he REFUSED both times. My BF accused me of lying and going behind his back, and refuses to understand that I do not see Mark as a crush or a male-interest, but rather his friend, who is hurt and in pain and needs his friend's support. My BF equaled it to him kissing another woman a couple of months prior, citing that the only reason Mark's long-term GF broke up with him was because Mark had thrown a fit over her messaging some guy and now I was doing the same. Except.... I did not know why Mark had broken up with his GF and I only messaged him with the intention to support a person I thought was depressed, since I have ample experience with that. Yesterday evening, my BF went was far as to claim he will end his relationship with Mark, since ""he is an asshole anyway and did not tell me my GF was messaging him in secret"".

I don't think what I did was wrong, however, maybe I should not have hidden it from my BF. Considering how he adamantly refused to even consider the idea of a message to his friend, I felt I had little other choice, since it was either to do it myself or to ignore the voice in my head, which claimed a person was in trouble.

Now... my BF is angry and does not really want to talk to me. He wants to cut off ties with Mark because ""he didn't tell me you messaged him"" (I never told Mark he cannot tell my BF about the message, all I said was that BF does not know, but if he wants to tell him, it's his prerogative to do so) and ""he is anyway a pompous prick who throws jabs at me"" (it's called bantering in British and it means throwing shade at your friends constantly..). He is just SO angry and I don't know how to solve this. I tried to, discreetly, help my BF's friend because I KNOW what it means to struggle with mental health and I just wish someone would have reached out to me when I was sinking. Nobody did, so I decided that if I can, ever, I will. And now I did and it just all ended up being s\*\*t.

I recently got a hospitality job which at first I was pleased about but now I hate. I don’t expect to love my job but there is nothing good about it. I don’t get paid as much as my other peers due to my age, I don’t get to keep my tips as they are “shared” out, my manager expects my to close up everyday. I live far and have to get the train. All the original team has left because of her and she talks about everyone behind their back to other employees. She occasionally guilt trips me if I want to have fewer hours, I hate it. 

I know that I’m moaning a lot but I hate the job. 

When I do get the odd day off I like creating stories, coming up with characters and creating complex plots (well in my mind they are). After downloading the app WEBTOON and seeing all the different comics on there I really want to publish my own stories on there. 

If I quit my job I could never let my family know about it, especially my nan. She has worked for the majority of her life and now expects me to put in the same hours she did when she was working.

I met Taylor (F28) at college years ago. We partied hard (drink and drugs) and lived off of ramen noodles and takeout but somehow we survived and graduated. We’ve been friends ever since, except I grew up and Taylor just sort of...didn’t. 

A couple of months back, Taylor was diagnosed with diabetes - which she was told would happen if she didn’t cut back on her binge drinking and takeout obsession. Since then, it’s like she’s been drinking harder and eating more, and worst of all, she isn’t taking her insulin.

I’ve tried talking to her, but she completely refuses to recognise there’s a problem. She’s got real bad anxiety and I think getting drunk and eating are her ways of dealing with it. She’s in  thousands of dollars of credit card debt. She still lives at home with her dad (mom and dad are divorced, mom lives out of town) and her dad has his own health problems but is kept busy with his new wife who he’s always taking away on expensive trips, leaving Taylor home alone.

Taylor’s been on a downward spiral for a long time, and at this point I’m actually scared. I worry about her everyday. I messaged her Dad about her not taking her insulin and he said he’d talk to her about it, but I haven’t heard anything about it since. 

Any suggestions for what I can do?

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

365,"Hey, r/Advice! Never posted here before, but I want to run something by you and see what you think about it.   


I'll be separating from the military soon, and while this post isn't strictly military-related, I do have a job that doesn't exactly have a 1:1 correlation on the outside. (Not that I'd want to do this if it did, anyway...). I know that I want to begin going to college, but in past experience - and it still holds true - I'm not 100% unshakable on what I want to study. I enjoy dabbling around. I sort of just like to learn, and am the type that is happy to work whatever job interim while I take classes that are cool, fun, exciting, etc.   


My question to you all is - does going to a trade school for 2 or so years to get a solid vocation that I am genuinely interested in, then working in that field as I figure my way out to complete a 4-year degree, sound logical? Since I don't exactly know what I want to do or be quite yet, I don't want to end up on the bandwagon of directionlessness after a 4-year degree. If an example sounds better, check this:  


I know that I want to pursue something in the medical science professions - likely physical therapy, chiropractic, something movement-related. But that goal isn't hard-set. However, never having had a medical-related career before, I've been thinking about pursuing a trade as a physical therapy assistant, or even a dental hygienist (to hone patient care, dexterity, providing services that people need). If I studied a dental hygiene program and came out on the other side, and took 1 or 2 classes towards a bachelor's degree per semester while working full-time, in my mind that makes better sense than bouncing from food to retail (or both, as it has been).   


I've struggled to find anyone with this sort of mindset on the internet - either you do a trade school and stick with that line of work, or you saddle up and finish the 4-year degree. Has anyone had experience in this sort of thing before? What is fiscally responsible, while working towards goals consistently? Thanks!",21Aug2019,1

I’m 20, and I study linguistics which I fucking hate with a passion although I’m good at it and I really wish I could change fields.

He only cleans his room and doesn't bother in helping out clean the other parts of our house. After eating, he just goes back upstairs and doesn't help out with cleaning the dishes.

I'm 24M, a virgin and I fear that I have fucked up my life beyond repair, and that I'm such a loser I will never deserve the kind of girl I am attracted to (basically just kind, normal, feminine, good sense of humor etc)

I barely graduated high school with poor grades, due to extreme depression. I had a bad home life, was bullied a lot and was a social outcast. I haven't moved past it and I have been in a negative, depressed state for most of my life since high school.

I'm not stupid, but because of my ADHD/personality, I find it extremely difficult to focus on tasks like reading books and studying, depression makes it even worse. So I believed I was stupid for most of my life and I never went to college, but I also was never really encouraged to.

I have done almost nothing besides work a shit job for the past 6 years, isolating myself, and doing little outside of browsing reddit, playing games and watching youtube videos in my free time. the years just fly by. I might spend time with friends once every two weeks or something. They probably don't invite me to do stuff much because I have a boring life and am an almost unbelievably boring person.

I'm extremely boring. I have basically no interests or hobbies that I genuinely enjoy. I've tried some projects but I never finish anything. because of my ADHD, I've always taken the path of least resistance. and I jump around a lot in my interests, so I know very little about a lot of things. interesting people know a lot about a few things.

I also believe I have some sort of undiagnosed Aspergers/identity disorder. For whatever reason, I've never felt a strong sense of identity. Because of my imposter syndrome/lack of identity, I feel 'guilty' or 'stupid' liking certain music/movies/subjects/things. Like I feel like I could get girls if I dressed more stylish/whatever. but I would get imposter syndrome and I would feel like I'm trying too hard to ""seem"" like I have a personality (weird I know)

I'm not ugly at least I think, because some girls have hit on me. I'm not short or fat. but my frame is so small (6.5"" wrists low T beta male), and I have wide hips. I fear no woman will ever see me as a physically masculine man which is one of the most important qualities girls seem to look for, especially as I get older. Even though I have lifted weights and bulked for years to compensate I still have a narrow frame so it doesn't matter. It's impossible to change

As I said I have been hit on a few times before, but I never pursued a girl in my life really. I know within 5 minutes of getting to know me they will be turned off because I'm boring, unambitious and unsuccessful. I'm also extremely shy and self-conscious especially around girls (yes I know hard to believe for someone 24 years old but I'm just a beta male). And even if somehow we hit it off, and they like me despite me being a loser, then there must be something wrong with them if they like guys who are losers, so I'm not attracted anymore.

Is it possible to get over this and find love? If I won't ever find love, what's the point of living?

Initially we were part of a 'trio' that was even more toxic. The third friend, who I don't speak to anymore, A and I would pretty much argue non-stop. At the time I thought arguing meant we were being 'real' with each other and these were the only people I could be 'honest' around, when in reality it meant nothing other than the fact that we just fucking argued a lot. 

I have attempted to move away from A several times but honestly, am very scared to. He has on more than one occasion threatened to kill himself if an argument wasn't going his way/if someone was attempting to break up with him. He also 'jokes' about having receipts on people like voice recordings etc and outing them if anyone leaves him. I asked him if he would ever do such a thing but he in turn made me feel like I was insane for even assuming that he would. So what scares me about leaving him is two-fold; he may harm himself and he may 'out' important information/ideas that I wouldn't want other people knowing. Oh plus I'm actually scared to even write this post because I'm afraid he might find it and get very upset so you can imagine how real the fear is.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm tightly (around my upper arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery on the chest high cabinet  she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the  cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",21Aug2019,0

He has been weird lately, especially since we moved in together, but before what happened yesterday i always thought i was just being paranoid and now i don’t know what to think.  

A couple of days ago he got a text and kind of chuckled, so i asked what was funny and he said ”my mom sent me a funny text” and i obviously didn’t think anything of it, however we were going to dinner at their house the next day and he was texting her about the time etc.. and i was sitting on the couch and his phone had his mom and his texts up, and i saw that before the most recent text they texted days ago! So that was obviously very weird that he lied, but i didn’t confront him because i feel like it was bad of me to look at his phone like that. 

Yesterday night i was at my parents house and he told me he was having friends over (his two best friends, both guys) and this morning when he had already left for work i found a glass with a dark pink lipstick stain on it. I was honestly kind of chocked and all day i’ve been going over every scenario to explain to myself why that lipstick stain is there, but i have nothing. Also that had to have happened yesterday because i washed all our glasses in the washing machine yesterday and no woman has been over to our house since then. He has no female friends and i even checked his friends (his other friend is single) girlfriends instagram to see if she maybe was over (but that would be weird since they are in a long distance relationship) but i saw on her instagram story that she was still at her house 6 hours away from here so it was not her.

400,"First time posting, this is a very long post, TLDR at the end. Please let me know your thoughts, this is my first time asking for advice about this part of my life.

During my freshman year of college (approx. 2 and a half years ago) I was accused of sexual assault by a ""friends with benefits"" partner of about two months. Following these accusations, most of my friends and all of my acquaintances seemed to vanish.. not sure whether they were avoiding me, or if I had started hiding - closing off. Our mutual friends developed a keep hatred for me, I specifically remember when one attempted, or at least pretended to attempt to hit me with her car at the crosswalk before yelling ""fuck you asshole"" from her window as she kept driving.

Our school held a formal review, investigating both of our recounts of the events surrounding my alleged assault. Any evidence was collected by the campus police, and referenced during this set of hearings. This process took 2 months, during which time I was assigned, essentially, a restraining order by the school. Certain times I could use certain academic buildings, eating areas, library, etc. She was assigned one as well, and it was a fair but slow, daunting process. Eventually I was found ""not responsible"" for the events of the night in question, based on our stories and the evidence. Essentially, the school agreed that I had not taken advantage of this woman.

When this came out, I thought it was over. That I could get back to life as I knew it. Less than two weeks later, a sheriff shows up to my dorm, asking for me by name. He came to serve me a restraining order. This is when I learned that anyone can get a restraining order against you, and you can't prevent it, you can only try to stop it after it's already in motion. I don't have any family in the state where I attend school - where I'd also have to go to court. I also couldn't afford a lawyer, so I had to represent myself given that this was a civil matter. This was another daunting process, which I eventually lost and the restraining order was upheld. I do not believe that this was indicative of my guilt, but of my lack in courtroom experience.

So, after only a week or so of freedom, I would have to abide by this restraining order for the next year, on a shared campus. Any time that I was within 500 feet of her (translated to any time I was knowingly near her, or she was in my line of sight) it was my responsibility to be somewhere else. I couldn't go within 500 feet of her dorm, which meant that I could not enter her quad (3 dorms out of 7 dorms on campus). I couldn't eat at the commons, one of two places to get food at my school. If I was at the library, or any other public place and she walked in, I had to stop what I was doing and leave immediately, or she could call the police and have me escorted out of the building.

Around this time, she went to our school paper and gave them a full recount of everything that had happened, from her perspective. My alleged assault, her experience with the school, and the school letting her down by finding me not responsible. She cited the court proceedings as evidence that the school was wrong. The paper published the story without seeking any confirmation, which they were allowed to do because the story did not include my name (but hundreds knew it was about me). I tried to have it removed, or to give them more information, but they said that they could not revise the story without referring to me by name. I figured that everyone who knew I was involved already knew her or my perspective, so I decided not to add fuel to the fire and kept quiet, letting her do, essentially, whatever she wanted. She dragged our schools name through the mud, sparked several protests on campus, and even made it onto the local news.

With so many supporting her story and her message, I began to see myself as a criminal. Maybe, even with the best of intentions and knowing that I would never  intentionally hurt someone, maybe I did. Maybe I am a rapist, and I'm just so corrupt that I can't even tell the difference... these thoughts began to consume me. I felt imprisoned by my own school, cast out by all of my peers, and immersed in total darkness. This full recount of events lasted the duration of my freshman year. During the following summer, her father (who worked for the school, and helped her ruin the school's reputation) 'resigned', and she could no longer afford to attend. She did not renew the restraining order, and I was finally free.

Or at least, so I thought.

The last two years have been a constant internal battle. After a year of looking over my shoulder, worried I'd see her, or her friends.. worried I wouldn't see her but she'd see me, so the police would arrive. Worried that half of the people in all of my classes saw me as a criminal, a rapist who ""got away with it"" following the story that she sold. I still feel so broken. I regret not standing up for myself, being too afraid to share my own story. To clear my name. And when I meet someone new at school, my first thought is still ""do you think I'm a rapist? Do you hate me for something that I didn't do?"" when the reality is, everyone has moved on. Most don't even remember their own freshman year. My question is, how do I move on? More specifically, how do I start being myself again, saying hi to strangers and feeling confident, opposed to cowering at any sign of social interaction?

TLDR: I was accused of sexual assault nearly three years ago. The consequences of these accusations were severe, lasting approximately 8 months. Nothing has happened since, but for the past two years I remain guarded, afraid, and introverted due to these events. Is there anything I can do to feel like myself again?",21Aug2019,1

I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it.

As we chat he asked me for pictures and etc but I denied.  Today I made a big mistake and gave him my Instagram. Because he wanted to see my face and I thought nothing can happen (at least for now nothing has happened). Yea I know I am dumb. So he started trying to make me go out with him. Btw he is 23 and he is a total stranger to me I only have seen a couple of pictures of him ( he is cute but they may not be his, I googled them but nothing showed up). Another mistake I made is to tell him that I may be available tomorrow, and just now I have realized how dumb it is. At least he doesn't know where I live and maybe doesn't know my name ( I removed my name from my Instagram ). So I am still not sure about going out with him tomorrow.

405," 

My father is an easy going person but he is really stubborn. 2 months ago, when I was with him, he told me he suddenly couldn't see. His eyelid is fully opened but he said it's dark. I asked him to close each eye and apparently only one of them is dark. He told me it happened few times before but every time he wiped his eyes, he can see again. This scares me. I told him to go for checkup and he said he will next month. He told me not to tell my mom or she may worry so I didn't. He kept reassuring me he would go check it up.

Last month, my grandmother (his mom) passed away. I think this caused him to be more on the edge. He now quarrel more with my mom whenever she try to tell him to do something. Few weeks ago, she suddenly had nose bleed while she was sleeping and it just flows nonstop. He brought her to hospital and after some checkup, they said all seems fine with her. While they were there, my mom asked him to do check up too and he suddenly lashed out, asking if my mom is cursing him to die. He told her he is healthy so there is no need for check up. I think he deep down know there is something wrong and he is scared of it.

He is in his 50s. I have told him to do health check up multiple times the past few years but he kept saying he will but he never did. Recently he told me he would go after he can sell his land. He has been trying to sell that land for God knows how many years and it still hasn't been sold. I don't think it would sell anytime soon too. I think he is worried that whatever sickness he thought he has would cost a lot so he would rather find out after he has a big sum of money.

How can I convinced him to go? I've told him that I love him and if he really care for me, he should go. I also transferred him some money to go for checkup and he scolded me saying I have too many expenses already (I am paying for my parents mortgage). I am really worried.",21Aug2019,1

410,"My friend (M) and I attend a school where most of the work is done in groups. The two of us were group mates with a third girl (E) last year and it was hell. We misunderstood each other constantly which caused a lot of friction and E bad mouthed M (My best friend) to me and it made me feel like crap. M eventually found out about this. E is dyslexic. A free program is offered to her by the school to help her spell etc, but she knows that M will correct her spelling and grammar for her so she doesn’t use it. Our projects are often 40 pages long, so she spends hours doing this.

Often we would be left alone with the work because E goes to bed at 7-8pm. Then M and I have to stay up to 2 AM to complete her work. E also often misunderstands the assignments, so we end up rewriting her stuff. 

It obviously didn’t work out. M was constantly sad/frustrated and left for an hour at a time because she was about to cry, I guess.

We’re all fine friends out of school, I do think E is a bit manipulative but that’s besides the point. 

How do we tell E that we don’t want to be in group with her again this year?  M feels like she’ll be upset because she doesn’t talk to anyone else in class. I feel like school work and friendship should be separate and not affect each other. E thinks we are in group although we never discussed it. 

We don’t want to be assholes, but we also don’t want our grades to be affected negatively in order to not upset this girl. No we’re not 13 😅 but it does kind of feel like it",21Aug2019,1
411,"Sorry about the long post, but please read the whole thing.  

Me and this friend have known each other for our entire lives, we lost contact at 14 and i messaged her to reconnect last year (we were 18 then) and when we met, it was awkward at first but after awhile it really felt great to see her again and i enjoyed talking to her, she told me the same thing.   

After than she started getting really distant from me, responding very slowly etc... and after a couple of months of me asking how she is and trying to connect and with her ignoring me (when we first met she told me that she has been going trough a lot, so i just thought she was going trough something at the time), we eventually talked on the phone where she told me that she had indeed been going trough some stuff. I told her she could talk to me if she wants, i’m there for her etc. 

After that, i tried to connect again but she kept being distant and eventually completely stopped answering my texts. We didn’t talk for months but early this year she posted on instagram saying “i have had a really bad year, it would mean a lot if you want to send me a message but don’t get mad if i don’t respond” so i ended up writing a message to her, basically saying that i’m here if she wants to talk, and also bringing up that i have also been trough a lot, which is something i don’t really talk about because i’m completely the opposite to her (she likes to talk about her problems and vent, i keep it inside).  

I got no response to that message, but i didn’t expect to either.  I can’t help but think that if my friends wrote stuff like that to me, no matter how shitty i felt i would still take the time to at least say thank you.   

These upcoming months i have seen her hang out with her other friends a couple of times.  

A month ago while i was on vacation she sent me a message on Instagram “hi how are you” and i responded and asked how she was, and she said something like “i’m alive, do you want to meet someday?”  And i told her that i was on vacation but i would be home next week.  

Next week comes, and the week after that and i hear absolutely nothing from her. To be honest i did expect her to take the initiative since she was the one that texted me first. I also expected her to acknowledge the fact that she has been ignoring me so much before.  

I feel like she just wants to meet me to vent about her problems and has no interested in me as a person or even cares about me. So a couple of days after that i sent her a text saying “did you regret it?” And she answered “no i was waiting for you to text me”, and i answered “mee too” and she just sent me a laughing emoji and now nothing else for weeks again.  

For the past few weeks i have been feeling really down. My anxiety and depression has been really bad and to be honest i have even been suicidal (but that’s something i would never go trough with) And yesterday i received a message from her saying “when did you want to meet?” and nothing else, not even a Hi. I responded and told her that i have been having a hard time lately and that i honestly didn’t feel like meeting anyone right now. I also told her that i hope everything is going well for her and that she is ok. That was over a day ago, she hasn’t responded.  

The whole thing is just bizarre to me. It’s like she only texts me when she wants to vent about her own problems and doesn’t care about my feelings or feel bad about ignoring me for literally a year before this, which she hasn’t even brought up or apologized for. When i tell her that i am going trough something, she doesn’t even think to ask me how i am or what is going on, she literally ignores me again. If it was the other way around, i would be there for her 100% because that’s how i am as a friend.  

I honestly feel angry about the situation and i hate being treated like this. I feel used and i want to confront her about it.  

Am i right to feel angry? Should i cut ties with her? Should i confront her? Please help, i want to say something to her but i don’t know if i should.",21Aug2019,1

The trouble comes when I dont know if it will destroy me, sort of speak. I work 5 days a week in the morning, teach English and course twice a week and my band reharses on Saturdays too. So I dont know if I would have time to do it and if it´s worth it. What do you think?",21Aug2019,1

416,"I’ve been in and out of a relationship for 5 years. I love my SO very much but lately I’ve been feeling insecure. Since we’re in a long distance relationship , we usually talk on the phone everyday. Last night we were getting sexual over the phone and my SO told me about a fantasy she has at work. She says she wants me to come to her job and have sex with her in the bathroom. I was turned on by the idea but I got a little paranoid and starting asking questions. I asked her how we would get away with that and she replied with pretty easily. She started going into detail about how we would meet and have sex. The way she described it it seemed like she’s thought about it more than once but this was the first time she ever told me about it. The reason I started getting paranoid about it was because about a month or 2 ago I drove up to see her and while I was there she got a phone call from a co-worker but didn’t answer it. Then the next day she got another call from the same person. I thought it was odd since it was the weekend and she doesn’t work on the weekends but she says they probably wanted to discuss something about work. Now I’m being paranoid about this and I keep thinking it’s more than just a fantasy.

421,"I am a 26F with a law degree and a masters. For the last 2 years I’ve been studying to become a civil servant in my country, Spain. Here, if you pass a civil servant exam you will have decent pay and a job FOREVER (that’s right, you can’t be fired). The thing is I live in a very dysfunctional home, my sister is an alcoholic and my father a narcissist. 
As is the tradition here in Spain my parents are supporting me while I study and I live with them, but lately my father has been threatening me to kick me out if I don’t do things he wants me to do. 

I didn’t even want to study this anyway, but my father is also a civil servant so they pushed me to it and my mum was fired some years ago and it was the worst, so I would love to get a lifetime position. 
I’ve also always wanted to move out since my sister has been an alcoholic for years (lives at home) and she abused me physically when I was younger. 

I’m thinking about trying to a lesser civil servant position, easier to pass (so I’ll be out of the house sooner) but it has less pay, and I’m afraid this won’t change things, like I will still be kinda miserable or regretting not staying in the future. Also I spend a lot of time at home studying, Right now I study around 9 hours a day, 6 days a week which doesn’t leave a lot of time for the adventures/travels/things I want to do.

422,"So, for context:

I go to karate classes twice a week. I met this guy the first day I joined, we exchanged numbers, yet barely text. I see him once a week and we get at most five minutes to talk one on one.

So;

One day he says at the beginning of class that he likes me. I didn’t know why, but I got really happy about this. I didn’t even think that I liked him back. Maybe it was just a loneliness thing, idk.

Last week he pulled me aside at the end of class and shook my hand, apologizing for that comment and saying that he thinks it’s best that we just remained friends. Now don’t get me wrong, I DID consider him a good friend, albeit there were some awkward moments.

For the remainder of class I was just in some kind of confusion filled daze. I couldn’t really figure out why, until I got home and came to the conclusion that I did like him. Though that’s still really debated, since I never felt any sparks fly when we worked together.

I still can’t get over it one week later, and I actually dread seeing him the next time I go into class. Is there any way I can just... avoid or deal with these feelings without talking to him directly? I feel like I’m on a thin line and really don’t want to rock the boat on this one.

423,"I live in Germany, since this is of importance, and am female and in my late 20's. 

At university, I studied languages and cultural sciences. After graduating, I was desperate for any job and took the first one offered to me. On the one hand, this job has amazing job security that people are envious of. On the other hand, it's low paying because I'm an administrative assistant and it won't get much better in the future.

Here are the pros:
Amazing job security since I work in the public sector. My company is required to offer me a permanent work contract when my current contract runs out. This means I would have a secure position for life unless I quit and would be nearly impossible to fire or let go of. I'd have to stay in the area, since I'd be working here the rest of my life, but that also means I'd have the perfect security I need for starting a family in the future. The pay goes up a bit every few years, but will max out at a certain amount in about 10 years. It will then not go up again, probably ever. There is no chance for a promotion. But I am considered solid middle class with my pay. I have flexible working hours and my boss often isn't here, so I can frequently go home an hour or two early. I am not asked to work overtime except for maybe once a year. My company also contributes some money to my retirement pension, which usually only companies in the public sector do, and gives me a large Christmas bonus every year, which most companies in the private sector don't do.

And now the cons:
It's administrative work. I spend about 80% of my time reading Reddit and am bored out of my mind. The other 20% is actual work. I feel like I'm wasting away time in which I could be learning valuable skills or how to make myself more marketable. Although the company is required by law to offer me a permanent contract soon, my coworker informed me they've found a way around handing out permanent contracts via a legal loophole. My coworker says they've been working here for 13 years and still don't have one. So it's not a guarantee, which bothers me. I'm not sure if I want to keep hanging around until my current contract runs out to find out since by then I'd probably be considered too old for a career change. My boss has also increasingly made little comments and remarks over the years that I'm pregnant or will become pregnant, which tells me I don't think they'd take it kindly were I to ever actually get pregnant. Also, I already mentioned my pay will max out in about 10 years. I'm not sure if I should be happy with ""solid middle class"" or not. I just feel like I could do better with my life than making appointments and faking smiles for visitors from companies.

I occasionally apply to other jobs but have always been rejected. I worry it's because I'm not gaining experience here in anything other than administrative work and have started applying for traineeships. Traineeships last about 2-3 years and are low paying until you finish them, after which you start getting paid a normal salary. I'd have to apply for government assistance to just pay my rent and afford food while working one. Buying new clothes or anything else in those years wouldn't be possible. It would be a really rough 2-3 years, but at the end I'd be working a job that would allow me to move up in a hierarchy and wouldn't leave me wasting my brain cells every day. 

Am I just being selfish by not being grateful for what I already have? My partner says I have a job lots of people would be lucky to have and should stay, but the thought of working here until retirement makes me feel terribly sad.",21Aug2019,1
425,"Reddit, I need some perspective/advice...

[27 F] [32 M]

I am a 27-year-old female. My fiancé is 32 years old and we have been engaged for 14 months. My fiancé was previously married for roughly 6 months. We met and became a couple roughly 2 years after his previous marriage ended. We are planning on having a wedding next year.

Two months after getting engaged, I found out that my fiancé was having sexually explicit messages with an ex 6 months into our relationship. This occurred one time. However, they occurred just a couple of hours after he and I were speaking. We were on good terms/ 6months in at the time.

As you would imagine, this made it very difficult for me to trust him. It is something that I’ve struggled with since I found out. He also has a history of ogling other women in front of me.

He is friends with all of his exes on social media, and he often makes jokes about cheating, hooking up with other women, texting other women and comments about other friends being “lucky”, etc. (e.g. while in the company of his mom, he was droning on and on about his friend being lucky for having his girlfriend, and his mom had to stop him and tell him that he was lucky to be with me). After he does these things and I mention them to him, he apologizes and says that he didn’t mean to/ he was being thoughtless and he was joking.

I have checked his social media and messages, and I have not seen any sexually explicit messages with other women. He also often tells me that I am beautiful/ made for him and I am his dream girl. His friends and family also often insinuate/comment that I am out of his league/he batting above average/he is lucky to be engaged to me.

He has expressed a desire to change/ is willing to attend counseling, however he keeps making these little comments. I’m trying to determine if he’s trying to tell me something or if he really just keeps joking about these things over and over without the intention of cheating on me/the desire to be with other women.

My question is, what is going on here? Is this something that can be fixed? I truly love this man and believe we have something special. I really need some advice here.

430,"Hey everyone. I think it’s been like 8-10 months since i was last active on this sub and reddit in general. It’s taking a lot for me to finally admit this to myself and ask for some help. This is going to be long so I apologize in advance 

Last year I lost about 40 pounds (from 215 to 175) in about 6 months. I was eating really healthy, exercising daily became normal for me, and I was more confident in myself. This sub helped me a lot; from you guys giving me tips and the fatlogic giving me reality checks. I was an emotional eater, but I had started meditating and journaling regularly to help me cope with stress and difficult emotions. I was done with emotional eating, or so I thought. Then my senior year of college started.

For some reason, my final year turned out to be the most stressful. Family problems, relationship problems, money problems, roommate problems, depression problems, school work piling on and grades slipping, etc. Pretty much any curveball you could think of was thrown at me. I maintained my weight loss for most of the school year, but by late Feb/early March, I was at my limit and started coping with my problems with emotional eating again. I also went through a bad breakup in April and it got even worse. Thankfully I still managed to keep my grades up and graduated in May. 

I moved back in with my parents and took the summer off from working or looking for grad programs so i could live stress free for a little while, but I’m still stuck with that bad habit of overeating emotionally and impulsively. From late Feb until now, I’ve gained back 30 of the 40 pounds I lost last year. Right now I’m stuck in a cycle, and I don’t know how I can get out of it again and lose weight like last time. I’m too ashamed to even leave my house. I’ve been avoiding meeting my friends because I first met a lot of them during and after my weight loss. I don’t even care to dress nicely or wear makeup anymore because I’m ashamed of my body.

I’ve been trying to get back in the swing of things. Logging on my fitness pal and going for walks. But I still overeat way too often, and most of the time, I’m consciously aware that I’m not even hungry when I’m doing it. I don’t know how to stop. And I’m still having a hard time exercising as often as I should. Last night I dreamt that I reached 300 pounds and I’m honestly terrified that will actually happen to me if I can’t get a hold on myself now and turn things into the right direction as soon as possible. 

Does anyone have any tips or advice or even just words of encouragement to help me get back on track? I’d really appreciate it. And thank you to every and anyone who was willing to read this post. I know it was long.",21Aug2019,3

Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

438,"I moved into my new dorm a few days ago, and I have barely slept since.

The overarching problem is that the room is too damn hot. There's no A/C in this dormitory, but I think there's gotta be something generating heat in here, because my room is just ridiculous. My glasses literally fog up just walking into my room from the hallway. I can't just lay in my bed with no covers without sweating through my sheets.

I have three separate fans running in here, and I talked to the front desk and they gave me a box fan for my window. The box fan is actually pulling its wait, I must admit. It's loud, but it single-handedly makes the temperature livable. It's actually somewhat cool and decent in here as long as I have it in the window. Which creates another problem.

My window is directly adjacent to the building's main entrance. If there wasn't a metal mesh there, I could reach out and punch people walking into the building. If I have my window open to have the box fan running, then I get the sounds of the front door slamming and people talking all day and night. It doesn't bother me during the day, but it certainly keeps me up at night.

Either way, window closed or open, I can't get any sleep. The one thing I've thought of is earplugs, which I've never tried before, but I'm worried that they would prevent me from hearing my alarm, which I need to wake up in order to get to classes. Presuming that I was asleep when it went off, that is.

We are halfway through our vacation to China and Japan. I can say that it’s been ruined by him. It was in China were we started arguing in public (More to it) Mostly because we wanted to see different things so we agreed to go separate ways. I failed because I have no knowledge about the metro system in both countries. 

That was then but now I know how to use it so I can freely travel alone. I only meetup with my brother when we are going to eat or when we wants to see the same attraction. 

Most of the arguments was started by me but he was the one who provokes it. I won’t write down all of it but the last arguments we had was about sim cards. 

I asked him about he’s opinion regarding the price and what GB I should get. He’s been to Japan before and can speak Japanese very well so he knows stuff that I don’t. He answered but negatively saying that I have low IQ for asking that. Then I proceeded to say something about him and it ended with him saying this: «Honestly no one understands your thought»

443,"Some backstory : 
I, (22M) work away from my family. Here in India, its very common for us to live with our
parents. I come from a family of 5, as we live with my grandparents too. Up until 5 years ago,
I’ve lived in the same house with my family, as I did my schooling in the same city.
I wouldn’t label my parents as highly restrictive or anything, but they were definitely
super-overprotective, as I’m their only child but I do recall certain things they’ve prevented me
from experiencing, certain basic things like riding a bicycle or any two-wheeler for that matter, or
going down to play with other kids (“they are bad company, you can sit at home and play video
games instead”). I also recall the way my mother freaked out when she discovered I had female
friends, and her reaction was the closest I’ve ever felt to being looked upon as a criminal. By
now it is pretty clear, that they have always been the well-meaning hyper-conservative parents,
who have also been very supportive of my dreams and career choices. Eventually the
over-protectiveness did mellow down, but the possessiveness still remains till date.
Evidently I felt a certain degree of openness and freedom I had never experienced before, the
minute I left home to live by myself in college. It was honestly a breath of fresh air, and I felt
more than happy to take charge of my own life, and do all my chores myself instead of my mom
trying to pamper the heck out of me.Living by myself honestly became addictive, and in a way,
crucial for my regular functioning, as I did not have an overbearing shadow on me all the time.
College definitely turned me into a man, and I managed to indulge in a lot of activities that I
couldn’t partake in back home.They called me once every day, just to check in on me, and were
quite understanding whenever I told them I was busy. Of course, I did start smoking weed,
drinking, and even had a girlfriend, but eventually told my parents about my girlfriend, which
they surprisingly took well, and didn’t burst into flames as they did earlier. But eventually, they
asked me extremely uncomfortable questions about her past, which lead to some horrible fights
between me and my mom. I had assumed they had made some progress, but maybe I was
mistaken.
Now I have a job outside my city, and come to visit home every 4-6 months. To be completely
honest, I visit them because they ask me to, and not always by my own will. When I come back
home, I have my own agenda, which majorly revolves around spending some peaceful time at
home, as I need a break from my job. My family does NOT understand the concept of “me time”
or an individual “needing space”. Understandably they want to spend time with me, but over the
course of time, I’ve become highly disconnected from them. There is barely anything to talk
about with them, as they keep giving me updates on relatives I don’t give two shits about, or
keep cracking stupid jokes as if I were still a 7 year old. My grandparents constantly keep
critiquing my appearance, and keep asking me to either cut my hair or gain some weight. Some
may say they “love” me, but I most certainly don’t consider love as constantly looking at
someone’s personality as malleable, and trying to get them to alter it to fit their tastes and
antiquated perceptions.
My parents still had this hope until very recently, that I would still look for a job in the same city
so that I could live with them, but slowly they have been getting used to the idea that I don’t wish to do that at all. They still bring up this issue in a very passive way, saying that there would be
no one to take care of them as they get old, and I wouldn’t be able to help them in medical
emergencies if I’m not in the same city. They also plan to eventually move to whichever city I
settle down in.
Here lies my problem. I do feel love,respect and gratitude towards my parents for everything
they have done for me, but every single time I come home, I’m faced with this hollow feeling
which is a mixture of guilt for not being there for them, conflict about my future, and a complete
lack of connection with them. Honestly, it is a bit suffocating to live with them, as I eventually
start feeling repulsion towards them even if they haven’t done anything wrong. I’m highly
unproductive at home because of this same reason, and I tend to function very well in my own
space. Has anyone felt this way? If so, please share your experiences with me. How would you
advise me to improve my relationship with them, while also maintaining my personal sovereignty
and making them understand that I need my own space?

445,"**TLDR**; I feel that after every argument with my BF, we might breakup. This is the case with even the smallest argument. I need advice.

I'm 18 and he's 19. We have been together for almost 3 years. We both love each other a lot and we plan on moving in together soon. Here's the thing: I've always had issues with our arguments though because we tend to back away from each other and not actually resolve anything in the moment. We wait until later at night or the next day to talk things through. Now my problem is that I believe that after every argument, we might breakup and I feel this way with even the smallest argument. This might just be my insecurity and anxiety speaking, but it's really hard to leave that mentality behind. He's my first boyfriend, so I don't have any prior relationship experience besides friendships that turned for the worst after one argument. I think my mentality is like this because I go off of that experience.

How can I deal with this feeling? Thanks.",21Aug2019,4

When I try making small talk I can see they're visibly scared just to be around me.

When I go the movies a thing I loved doing back home, 8/10 times a group of people will notice me and make the same comments and even take pictures me, and report me to staff, then halfway through the movie some tough-looking guy will come in and stand at the entrance occasionally glancing up at me or just come sit a seat or two away from me and other stuff like that. Now the types of movies I usually go to have the same set of seats I like to sit in reserved 3-4 days in a row, I imagine as a subtly hint they don't want me to come. It's like this everywhere I go the park, no one wants to sit next, I heard a mother tell her daughter who asks to sit and pointed at the bench I was on and the mom said she doesn't trust him and went and sit somewhere else, I drank myself to sleep that night, I feel like giving up",21Aug2019,19

451,"Exactly as the title says. I'm a 30 year old male. Shortly after graduating university where I did my share of dating and fair share of hooking up and one night stands I started working. I had and still have lots of friends that I spend my time with and I was always just so tired after work that I lost the will to want to date or even go and find sex. Fast forward 6 years later and I haven't been on a date since my last year of university. 

I honestly don't know if I miss it or I don't. I don't know if I want it or I don't. On the one hand a lot of my friends have long time SOs, some are getting married etc. Some of them are good couples, others, not so much. Maybe I would want a girlfriend. I honestly don't know. It's a weird concept for me now because I haven't thought about it in so long. Looking at couples around me i see both the bad and good and often think that it looks like more trouble than it's worth.

On the other hand I think I lost my ""Mojo"" as it were. I honestly don't know the first thing about approaching women in ""real life"" anymore since I never tried out of school. I don't know how all of this stuff works when you have a job and all that adult stuff. It's honestly just a thing that other people seem to know how to do and I don't know how to start.

On top  of everything moving around my weekly routine that I have established over the past 6 years just seems like such a hassle to do for something as unreliably enjoyable as dating. You never know how a date is going to turn out. In my and many other people's experience dates and relationships in general tend not to go so great so it's hard for me to justify giving up time doing stuff I know I'll like to go on a date that could very well turn out to be a dud.

I will say I think sex would be nice. In the past several years I have only had sex once. I got back from 6 months in Australia beginning of July. I had sex with a legal prostitute while I was there and it was great. But that was easy. I just gave her money and I got sex. I didn't have to actually put any ""work"" in.

I guess my question is how do I figure out if this is really something I want in life? And how do I learn to go get it again?",21Aug2019,1

456,"So basically we were inseparable for 2 years, spent everyday together, have so many great memories. Problems came with my anxiety and me being an asshole to her and just criticizing her for small shit.

It led to her “falling out of love” with me and breaking up a few weeks ago. 

We hung out a few times since and the first time was rough. She asked if I got with anyone else since and I said yeah. Following this she now says she wants to have fun and get with other people, see if she has a stronger connection with someone else.

I tell her I have to block her and she texts me a few days later saying “I guess it’s my turn to be depressed now, hanging out was always fun no matter what and we can’t even have that.” She tells me she knows there’s a chance to make it work in the future after saying previously she didn’t see it but she couldn’t know for sure. 

So now we’re taking a month of no talking or seeing each other. I want to take the risk because I just feel like we could be so good together if I just get my shit together and we stop being or at least I stop being so dependent.

I’m trying to not get my hopes and I feel like I’ve been doing better lately but I’m scared that’s because I think there’s a chance.

461,"I (27F) live in Chicago, and am apartment hunting to live on my own for the first time. 

I've wanted a dog for a long time, and as someone with bipolar disorder and anxiety, my therapist of 10 years and my psychiatrist of 5 years recommended me to get an emotional support dog (It cannot be a cat). My therapist has also said that if I'm living alone I need a dog for my own safety. 

I have been finding some amazing apartments in the neighborhoods I want. Some of them (the best ones honestly) are ""cats allowed, no dogs"".   Because it's an emotional support dog, they can't not let me get one, but I really don't want to be an asshole about it. 

My thinking was if they allow cats not dogs, then it's probably a damage/cost thing. I'd be willing to pay a second, non refundable, ""dog security"", so I'd be paying a full months rent instead of a normal $350 pet fee(there is no fee for the cats). I'd also be willing  to pay an additional $100 per month. My goal was always to get a small &lt;25lbs dog above the age of 2, so no puppies and hopefully pre housetrained. 

I'm pretty sure legally they have to let me have an emotional support animal, but before I sign anything, I wanted to ask, should I try to find something else and pay an extra 200+ for apartments that allow dogs? How do I bring up the topic of an emotional support dog, and/or convince my landlord to allow a dog (I'd get a dog 1-2 months after moving in)?

469,"I'll keep this relatively short, so, I'm currently 17.

Now, my parents relationship is definitely an abusive one, and while I don't want to call my dad a devil, he's definitely been an abuser to both me and my mom, but we always end up feeling sad for him because he also has good things about him. He's both a cool guy, and a devil at the same time, and I never knew how to feel. I wanted to hate, but love him at the same time, and it's never clear which part will prevail. But I know one thing: I've been severely traumatized by him multiple times in the past, but I won't even try to tell him because he never understands, and always plays the victim.

Now my mom said to my dad that there's the possibility of her contract being prolonged to a full year, and my dad went absolutely nuts, threatening to leave us \[like he always did\], and saying that we won't find anything when we get back home \[which isn't even out home at this point since he's been looking for houses for half a year now, we're still in the house we rented\] and he even said he doesn't care if he leaves our dog to die.

Now he made all this mess over a suggestion \[my mom also wanted him to come with us since we live in a shithole\] but he just doesn't reason with us, claiming he's ''the dictator'' and that there's ''no democracy'', bullshit quotes he repeats ever since I was a child. He thinks mom always wanted to leave him \[false\] and now he is getting all of his friends and family involved, they all think my mom is somehow the villain, when all she wants is to guarantee me a future, because as things are, I can't go to college since my dad doesn't provide nearly enough money, especially in the winter when it's my mom that works her ass off while he just sits around doing nothing, saying how nice it is.

Now I have quite a bit of resentment towards my dad, and I mean a lot. I still love him of course, but he's behaving like a child, and honestly, like a straight up cunt. Everyone thinks he's the victim cause he' good at playing it, and since everyone who doesn't know him thinks he's the straightest most honest guy that ever lived. I'm honestly kinda glad shit is going down cause my mom couldn't survive if she lived with him any longer. The amount of emotional and smetimes physical abuse was too much, not to mention his violent outbursts that sometimes cause tables to be flipped.

There's a lot of things left out, but this is the majority of it, I just need some advice and prospective on the situation cause it's fucked and I don't know what to think.

470,"Hello Reddit,

I'm having some challenges with my father's behavior / health and the impact it's having on my family. I'm not sure how to best address this. This is my first time posting, please excuse the post length. TLDR at bottom.

Background: I've been away from my home region for work for many years. I've recently moved back with my partner and we are staying with my parents as we get established in the area. We pay rent, help out around the house, and the house has lots of space. I don't think we are putting any burden on my parents and we wouldn't stay here if we thought we were.

The situation: My father will almost never leave the house (when he does it's not beyond a handful of nearby familiar places), seems unable to handle tasks that have any level of complexity or stress, and seems to have trouble communicating.

Frequently, his response to discussing or addressing any of the above issues is anger. For example if he's invited on a family vacation he gets quite worked up then angry (and will never come). The same is true for almost anything to the point where I haven't been able to have a normal conversation with him for much of my life.

He is also very particular about mundane tasks: dishwashing, food prep, etc. If he sees you loading the dish washer he gets bent out of shape about what can and can't go in it, how it must be placed, and upset if someone starts the dishwasher other than him. If we are preparing a meal he will come to us and tell us about all the items stored in the fridge, freezer, etc. Though it's the same items over and over every single time he sees us.

He spends most of his time sitting at his computer in his bedroom / office playing casino type games (offline, no money involved). He procrastinated extensively.

Essentially, he is unable to lead a normal / healthy life. Additionally, he often interferes in what others around him are doing which prevents them from leading a normal life. This ranges from mundane tasks to major decisions. He often seems needy emotionally, but unable to interact with people reasonably.

Due to a health condition my mother has been unable to do much paid work during her adult life. However she is heavily involved in volunteer organizations in the community. As such, my father has control over their finances. This limits the things she is able to do independently and she must coordinate with him on so many things, which is very challenging given his behavior. As an example she loves gardening, but my father seems to make it hell for her to build gardens in the yard.

Another example is that my parents driveway has been a mud/sand pit for the last 20 years. It was never completed. After some coaxing my dad was willing to look into having it completed, though he became very stressed about it. My partner and I have work background such that we could come up with a plan for the driveway, organize anyone who needed to be hired, and do much of the labour ourselves. We offered to do this to help out and take the burden off my dad. We provided a design that we felt would be functional, beautiful, less expensive, and help increase the home's value. Importantly, it would also prevent all the mud and stones from being pulled into the house on people's shoes that happens now.

My father was angry about any suggestion we provided or help we offered. My mother had reached out to a local landscaping company she had a connection with for information. My father ignored all of this and would not talk about his plan in any detail to me. He hired an individual with a back hoe to dig out the driveway. Then two truckloads of gritty sandy gravel arrived and was dumped in the driveway. 

My mother was in tears. After 20 years of waiting and trying to convince my dad to move forward on this, after the recent stress and expense to make that happen, we ended up with the same product in the driveway that had been there previously. Small irregular stones that get in people's shoes mixed with essentially sand and mud. When the trucks arrived my mom pleaded to have it sent back but my dad wouldn't listen. Also, the driveway was made bigger (it's already disproportionally large) destroying landscaping and parts of my mom's gardens. After all of this we weren't any further ahead.

I suspect my dad may suffer from something similar to undiagnosed depression or anxiety. But beyond that he won't listen or talk to others, and won't accept help. It's been this way since I was a young child and I've never had a good relationship with him, but after returning home I can see it's only gotten worse with time.

He also will almost never go to the doctor, dentist, etc. He has a physical medical condition since shortly before retiring and we could never get him to go to the doctor to deal with it. He would just get angry.  He finally did after years of fighting but isn't really keeping up with having it taken care of.

Given this, I can't imagine how to get him support for his behavioral challenges.

First, my main concern is my mom. I'd like her to have a better life without dealing with this all the time, but she doesn't have the financial independence to go out on her own. 

Secondly, I also worry that my dad's decision making is putting them in a worse financial situation than necessary: doing things around the house that lessen its value and wasting money on projects that don't lead anywhere. I'd like to be able to be sure my parent's finances are sound and being managed well.

Third, I'd like to help my dad get support if he will accept it. However I'd don't have high hopes for this. It's not like we haven't tried in the past.

I'm not sure how I can help with these things without my dad's cooperation.

I know this was a long post, thank you for reading it.

TLDR: My father has had behavioral problems since I was young, I see they are getting worse with age. I'd like to help my mom live her life without being held back by this, but she isn't financially independent. Also, I'd like to be sure my parent's finances are being managed safely. I don't think my father will cooperate.",21Aug2019,1

473,"Tdlr new transfer has a history of accusing us of racism, and will now be working with us daily. Anyway to protect myself and co-workers from further slander?

Some background: I work in the health care field. Our profession (like many others) relies on exact precision as to not cause permanent harm to other. Part of our job is to train students to do the job. 99% of therapists I know take this very seriously, one mistake and you could potentially harm someone badly. 

So now onto my problem that I need advice over. We had a student a few years ago that couldn't do the basics of the job in his senior year. We had been working on teaching him since his junior year. We realized he wasn't getting it, so we all took turns trying to teach him hoping someone else's teaching style would work. He just couldn't do it. We rotate the students to our different centers every month or so. I spoke to his program director and asked if he has had this issue else where. She said no. Turns out he did, but people tried to do him a favor and passed him anyways. 

He took this experience and went around saying we are racist. He is a black man, being trained primarily by a black man, Indian man and a white woman. Are problem wasn't his race. It was him not being able to do the job safely. 

Now he is an employee at our main hospital and applied for a transfer to our site. He was rejected due to his (undocumented) history of racism accusations. He in turn told the director that we wouldn't take him bc his race and that we have a history of ""hassling him"" and down grading him due to it. They didn't want to deal with any backlash and approved the transfer over more qualified employees.

My sister has offered for me to move in with her and her husband into the the townhouse they’re renting. They live about an hour away from the city centre (where all the jobs are). She is married and has a baby daughter with another on the way (to be born soon). I get along with well her husband, and with my sister for the most part, except our huge differences (she’s a bit religious, I’m not).

I’m still waiting on on word from my city’s unemployment office if I’ll be given unemployment benefits that would pay this month’s rent as well as the next 5 months. The pay is quite a lot since I live in an expensive city. 

I initially wanted to move in with roommates to save money (as I should done when I first moved to this city), but my sister and family keep going on and on about how doing this would be a big mistake. And how I need to stop making mistakes in life. Which is true, I have...but I can’t help but think they’re right and I do want to listen to them, but I’m worried moving in with my sister and her family might be a bad idea. 

Although, living with my sister rent-free would mean I would save a LOT of money- whether this is the unemployment money, or earnings from whatever part-or full-time job I would get. Just until I can gain more experience and skills and find suitable work. I would also be helping my sister out with her new baby, household tasks and cooking (which I don’t mind doing).

483,"Hi all. 


Using a throwaway for this one. I’ve been working really hard on a presidential campaign. I helped coordinate the events, spent a lot of money, time and effort on these events. I was working with another person coordinating everything and honestly, she would not have gotten a lot done if it wasn’t for my help. I recruited all the volunteers, hand made all the campaign signs, came up with ideas for future events that turned out to be successful. Spent a TON of money getting all of this done. All she did was make up a couple of sign up sheets for the events planned.


Now here’s the issue, she took all the credit for EVERYTHING. Now she is getting special treatment by the campaign for the “work that she did.” She did not mention my role in this AT ALL to the campaign staff. We were at an official event the other day and they treated her like royalty while I was on the sidelines watching. It was very apparent that she did not mention my role in any of the work we accomplished.


The last grassroots event, I recruited all the volunteers and then when I tried to get more involved with the event, she shut me out and only said I could work a few hours. When I showed up, there were actual campaign staff present and she mentioned nothing about me or my work. Just that I “helped a little” with the first event we had planned. This event WAS MY IDEA and most of the things planned were my ideas as well! I wanted to be involved with more planning but she said “she got it” and wouldn’t allow me to talk to the campaign at all during their conference calls.
Seeing her getting special treatment at the fundraiser we were at absolutely killed me. She wouldn’t be there if it wasn’t for my help, and those volunteers, would not be there either. She even got to meet the candidate and hang out with him before he spoke that night!


Now, I hate drama with a passion. HATE IT. And I don’t want to seem like a trouble maker or come of as a narcissistic bitch. However, I really want to let the campaign know my role in all of this! I’m not sure how to do this or if I should at all. She is going to be at all future events, which I would really like to be involved with. However, I’m torn because I’m so angry that she took all the credit for the hard work I did. It’s so bad that I’m starting to get turned off to the candidate I was so passionate about.
So reddit.. What should I do here? Should I contact the campaign and let them know - tell them I have always been involved and want to be involved more? Or should I not bother?


I have not brought this up to her. I know, I probably should but at the same time, I don’t really want the conflict. She can tell I’m upset, and she absolutely knows what she is doing to me.
I appreciate any and all advice you guys can give to me regarding this! I really really want to be more involved, but some bitch is stealing all that away from me :(

486,"I don’t really know what to do anymore, my plans have been thrown into the blender and I feel like a failure. Currently I’m entering my second year of my Master’s program for a Master’s in History. Originally, the plan was then to go on for a PhD in History. This summer I was going to start applications (Summer 2019 for entrance in Fall 2020), but then my advisor said I should wait to apply until the summer after I graduate (Summer 2020) since then I will have a full transcript and grades, which means I would not enter a PhD program until Fall 2021. I was bummed about having to wait a year but I went with his advice. Then he told me a month later that at the end of the summer we’ll have to discuss my future academic career and what comes next.

So I met with him a few days ago and this is where the plans get fucked. He basically tells me that I’m not smart enough to get into any PhD program. He was far more polite than just saying “you’re not smart enough” but that’s what it boils down to. I’ve been getting As and high Bs in all my classes, but for my area I had to take the notoriously difficult Medieval Latin class which I got a C in. Mind you I’ve gotten straight As in Latin and have been taking it for 5 years, but this class just fucked me; and tbh I don’t believe it’s fully my fault. There’s only one professor that teaches it and everyone knows that he grades based on how much he likes you, he also limits grades (as in only 2 people can get As he decides arbitrarily) and grades sporadically. Everyone knows he does this and no one cares. Even full on Latinists struggle in this class. 

My advisor basically said that because of that C no program will take me in either of the fields I’m interested in (Medeival and Ancient). My only option would be to take that class again which I’m not doing cuz fuck that guy, also I can’t afford it. He also said that there’s an equivalent course (taught by his rival of all people) two states away, which I can’t do because no money and I don’t have a car.

So basically he said that because of that C and the fact that I have a couple of Bs, and that now my GPA is 3.5, I can’t get a PhD. I’m pretty devastated and ask if there’s anything we can do. He says I have two options: get a second Master’s degree and/or get an “alternate academic” job for a couple years and then re-apply. Yet in the same breath he cautions me against “alternate academic” jobs cuz the old fucks who run admissions tend to snub and look down upon people who do that cuz to them that means “oh you weren’t smart enough to have an academic career so you got a fake one”. So basically that leaves getting a second Master’s degree and then re-applying to PhD programs after that.

At first I thought I’d get a second Master’s in the other field I’m interested in (I primarily study Medieval History now but maybe the second Master’s could focus on Ancient History), but he suggested it be in either Museum Studies or Library Sciences. I’ve been looking at both and there don’t seem to be many that will suit my needs, mainly that I need the school to waive tuition at the very least cuz I can’t afford dick, and I really need a stipend. The MLIS (Masters in Library Information Science) programs seem much better than the Museum Studies one (and Librarians get paid more than Museum people, there’s no way in hell I’ll ever become a curator)

So now I’m not sure what to do, I’ve been pretty depressed about it and I don’t know what my next step should be. So I wanted to ask y’all.

I don’t know what job or career I want, I’ve never known. I’ve been teaching and have been told I’m good at that so I was kinda aiming for professorship (which I know is very difficult) or some other academic-centered career.

So should I:

1) Stop after I get this one Master’s degree and try to find a job (which I’ve had notriously rotten luck at)

2) Try to apply to PhD programs next summer against his advice (which will cost me several hundred dollars on a vague hope)

3) Get a Master’s in Ancient History (there aren’t many programs for that in the US and I can’t afford to study in the UK) and then re-apply to PhD porgrams

4) Get an MLIS and then re-apply

5) Get an MLIS and then find a job and give up on getting a PhD

I know it all sounds weird but I just feel like an idiot and a failure. A lot of people in my family have PhDs, MDs, JDs, etc. and not being able to get one makes me feel like shit, especially since this has been my plan for five years now.

492," I'm 22, currently overweight, have a £7000 overdraft, failing at university, always in a dispute with my family and I got fired today for being late to work one too many times.

I wanted to use this opportunity to reflect on my life and ask for advice. Over the past 5 years, I've been studying at university and working part-time jobs because I come from a low-income family. In this time I've had roughly 6 jobs each lasting an average of 5 months and I used to think that the jobs just weren't right for me but today I realise that I'm the only common denominator.

I've worked for multiple massive retail chains including Apple (for a few months until I failed my probation due to lateness), as a cashier in a bank (which I left because they were going to fire me if I kept coming late) and the job I was just fired from was as a cleaning job (the first job I could find after being out of work for 3 months).

Last year I was on course to graduating with a 2.1 but my grades dropped drastically because I got a zero for not submitting an essay on time and this year I have to get 70% in almost everything to pull my grades back up to a 2.1. I'm overweight, and have no restraints on what I eat, but every time I try to go to the gym, I last for a few weeks before getting to a certain point where I take a break for a day or 2 and then I lack motivation to continue.

Every time I've been unemployed, I've also made plans to pitch up a really cool business that I thought of but the idea has been sitting on the back burner for so long that my friends have been turning it into a meme. Basically everything about me is a mess at the moment, I hate the person I see when I look into the mirror because it's so different from the person that I want to be.

I thought the core of my issue was lateness, but all I have to do is look at my university grades and bank account to realise that I have a much deeper underlying issue which I can't recognise. I used to think I was more special than other students because I was always getting above average jobs in big stores, whilst they worked at a grocery store but right now I just want to have a job that I'm good at, or just do something right at work.

The worst thing is that although I feel a little bit guilty, I don't feel overly stressed out and I'm way too chill about my current situation. I don't know if I'm in too deep or if my problem is that I'm too carefree. I am in a situation where I have 1 year to fix all of my issues otherwise I'm potentially going to be ruined for the rest of my life. If I don't get rid of my £7000 debt in the next year and a half whilst its 0% interest, I will start having to pay interest of approximately 10-20% on it and things can spiral down from there. If I keep on getting dismissed from work, I won't have any good references.

I've spent time thinking about myself, but I just can't see what my problem is. Do I have a time management problem? Do I have a discipline problem? Do I have a type b personality? I usually play games when not at work, but do I spend too much time playing games? Am I just lazy? Do I lack motivation?

Fortunately, I've been offered an amazing job at an even bigger bank - better than anything I've ever had and I really don't want to mess this up. I know this is an opportunity at redemption for me if I can do things right but I'd like to start by identifying what I'm doing wrong and any sort of advice that you can give to me would go a long way.

493,"Sorry about formatting, on mobile. There's also a lot to this.

In May I got a job at a group home. I'm looking to be in the medical field so I thought this would be a great opportunity. I'm applying to medical schools currently. I started working there for a month, everything was fine. About a month in, I get a call saying my background check didn't go through. I live in the state that I currently work in, and they did a background check on me for this state, but not the stare that I grew up in. Mind you, this group home has me working with children. Thank god I'm not a creep.

I go back to the office and re-do my fingerprinting. two months later: you read that right! Two months later (August 7) I get a call saying I'm good to come back. I go back the next day. I learn that while I was gone/out of work an incident happened: a child was in a hold by three staff members and the other child started climbing on the roof. The company is being investigated by child protective services for neglect. ha. I was interviewed by CPS on my first day back, even though I wasn't actually there when the incident occurred. I also come to find that my background check actually went through on July 7 but they are incompetent enough to let me know for a whole month.

Well I went back to work there on August 8th and everything was fine (I guess) until last night, the 20th. I get a call saying that the guy that did my fingerprinting didn't technically have the authority to do so, so now I have to do another round of fingerprinting. 

Some of you might be thinking: just quit, this is ridiculous. But I'm worrying because of my medical school application. I have written so many amazing essays about how I'm so brave and strong and have compassion and understanding for working with these individuals. I don't want medical schools to think I just gave up, and I don't want to sound like I'm blaming the company if I tell them the truth. I'm just kind of torn because I don't deserve to be treated this way. I have two bachelors degrees and I get paid $12/hr to work with extremely behavioral children everyday. Just doesn't seem right.

495,"Some background. No one would expect me to do a lot of the things I've done. I'm a straight A AP student, a successful artist, activist, and volunteer in the community, and I was 1 or 4 top students for leadership and citizenship in my graduating class. What no one knows besides some people close to me is my struggle with my family and eating disorder (ED). That I've had since 13. It had gone untreated since my family doesn't believe in mental illness, not blaming them for my actions. Everything I'm about to share is completely my fault.

Anyways I moved out in late March because my family environment was incredibly toxic and abusive. In May I was able to get a job at Walmart as a cashier. The income wasn't great and I struggled a lot. I always payed rent and uni deposits and by June only had $0.16 to my name. This is when I started shoplifting food from Walmart along with taking bread from salvation army. But I didn't only shoplift food I'd eat. I'd get food I would chew and spit and purge and all that fun stuff. Eventually even when I had enough money I would pay for what I'd actually eat (which isn't much), but I wouldn't pay for the food I'd use for my ED habits. Usually I would pay for stuff once or twice a week at most but steal a few items almost everyday I worked. My usual approach would be heading, and grabbing some stuff, going to the back room and putting it in my bag.
Today was when I was finally caught. I even lied about it in the beggining too, acting like I couldn't find the receipt. Then I eventually confessed. Saying I was going to pay later on my break since it was close to my shift. They got me to write a statement and told me I couldn't work my shift today for gross misconduct and they will speak to me tomorrow (the day that I planned to be my last since I'm going to be moving soon). So I'm afraid of what's going to happen and if I'll get criminal charges and a criminal record and lose any chance of ever getting a job again.
Please don't berate me. I know I'm a dumb ass and there is no excuse, and maybe I'm just getting what I deserve. I know i need to get therapy and I already have doctors appointments set up for when I move (tomorrow). 

TLDR: I Shoplifted junk food from Walmart as an employee to satisfy my Eating disorder habits, was caught today and might be fired and charged on my last day",21Aug2019,1
496," Sorry if this belongs in [r/Roomates](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roomates/) or [r/badroommates](https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/) instead!

**Background Info**

My old roommate, whom I got along with really well, moved out and I really needed to fill the room so I offered it to my couple friend who I know hated their building at the time. I offered it at the same rent as mine, even though it's larger and they are two people (one income) if they handled wifi. I was also desperate because I can't afford the whole apartment myself.

I thought they were clean, easy going people but it's been...difficult for the past 10 or so months. I am very, very clean, and I had to adjust to living with some not-as-clean people *and* two cats. It took me a bit but I did.

I've had around 30 or so roommate due to living in suite-style residence at University (3 to 4 roommates per academic year and summer) and had issues with maybe *two* of them--but those issues were suite-wide.

So, apparently I'm a bad roommate that tells them what to do like children because I've asked them once if they didn't mind vacuuming, and once if they could do their dishes because my boyfriend was coming over and we were going to cook so it'd be nice to have a clean work space (and also clean pans and knives, which are mine but they use and don't clean). The first time they responded that they don't feel the need to ""deep clean"" every week (in my mind, vacuuming is not deep cleaning and should be done weekly when there are three people and two cats living in a small apartment). The second time they didn't respond. I message them because I can't get them together, we have very different schedules, and the one time I said something to one, it got *very* twisted when related to the other.

Last night I talked to one of them because there is too much tension and I'm very unhappy in the living situation. They have been together for 9 years and never had a roommate; whereas I have lived by myself (aka not with my parents) for 8 years, with and without roommates. She told me that they are offended and feel like I'm a strict mom telling them to clean up when I ask if they could do their dishes or the like because they're adults and they know when they have to clean. Whereas, I feel like I'm a roommate asking another roommate for a favour, because we're sharing the space and we need to be conscientious of that. I really struggle with this because she basically told me I can't ever ask them to do anything because they're adults and they'll do it on their own time. This is not how roommate relationships work, in my mind. I also don't consider myself their mom. I am 26 and they are 30/31.

They also apparently feel like I don't want the apartment to looked ""lived in"" so they feel like they have to clean up after themselves immediately. I thought this meant wiping up something if you spill or sweeping up crumbs if you got the kitchen floor really dirty while cooking. To them that means not leaving a single book out--which I have never said anything about (and I leave things out too). I'm more concerned about dirt and food mess; I also have Celiac so I need to be careful not to accidentally gluten myself in the kitchen.

**TL;DR** This roommate relationship is not working--we have very different ideas of the responsibilities of co-habitation (I think I'm right but so does everyone else). I lived there first and I don't think they have the ability to live with a roommate. I want them to move out. Is this fair?

(Note: Two of us are on the lease because I didn't want to be on the hook for their rent if they defaulted. He's a little spacey sometimes.)

Any advice would be appreciated.

As the title says. I think this is not normal

For example, I have a dayoff today. This morning I was productive for updating my website, but from the afternoon to the night I did nothing other than eating sleeping resting and watching movies with my wife and now I am ready to sleep but with guilty feeling for doing nothing productive.

I was trained this way by my parents since my childhood. Even when I was sick, if I was just laying in bed they would yell at me for doing nothing, even though they clearly knew I was sick.

Now I am an adult and this has been bugging me. This makes me unable to enjoy leisure time such as dayoff or vacation.

For some context. I am 24 and I graduated with a computer science degree in spring of 2017 and I have been working as a programmer for 2 years now. However, I am learning that coding is not for me, and that most of the time it has proven stressful than rewarding. I realized coding was not for me in college but I didn’t wanna switch majors and lose time and money.

Now I’m looking to go back to school for a masters in a different field, and I was thinking about mechanical engineering. I am not sure if I will quit my job and go full time, or go to night school part-time. My question is: If I don’t have an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering, is it expensive or complicated to get a masters degree in Mechanical engineering? Would it be better to go back to school for a bachelors in mechanical engineering instead?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",21Aug2019,1

Well I never thought he liked me, I just thought of him as a friend because he’s always had a girlfriend. Or well a new girl every week I guess would be better to say.

He always jokes around with me and messes with me but I know that’s a not a tell tale sign he likes me but last night I asked him if he could take me to get a soda since I don’t have my car. I told him I’d get him one too if he took me since they are only $1 at the convenience store.  After we got our sodas I assumed he’d take me home but he saw the sunset and was all about how pretty it was (I know, he’s just goofy) and he said “let’s drive into it” lol he was just messing around but we literally drove around for about 2 hours listening to music and just enjoying ourselves.and the fact that he didn’t take me home just made me wonder. Especially since he got a call from someone asking to hangout and he said he might later and we just hung out all night.

In return they would get food, a place to live, and a computer to look for a job in the evenings or just for general entertainment. Once they find a job then they move out and I look for another homeless person to help out. So does this sound like a good plan or would I just get beatten up and robbed by the end?

522,"So I and my friends avidly play GTA, we have a great time. We're relatively high levels, and one of my friends James is very competitive. He's the highest level amongst us all, I was ahead of him one time when he was playing the new Destiny game but he's back ahead, doesn't bother me but I won't lie, I get a little bit of satisfaction out of knowing I was ahead of him at one point. Anyway on with what I came here for.

Just after new year, I wasn't that far from hitting level 800 as ever since I got the game, I averaged about 200 levels a year. We were discussing levels, and James (level 824 at the time in early January) made the bold claim that he will be level 1,000 by April.

Immediately, I began trying to tell him to spare himself the effort, that it wouldn't be worth it. He begins getting all defensive and you can tell, I've bruised his ego. I'm not kidding, you doubt his ability on anything, he will do it. ""Hey James, I bet you can't land a Titan upside down on the top of Maze Bank tower"", and he will do it and not give in.

So I see some easy profit here and tell him that we'll have a bet. If by April 1st, he had not reached level 1,000 then he has to pay up, initially we agreed on a PayPal transaction but then I thought I'd make it easier for him, the code of a PlayStation wallet top-up worth £10.

Well nearly five months later, he lost the bet and still downplays it and tries to dodge the issue. I don't want to press it too much, but he lost the bet and I feel like he's going to take the handing over of the code or any lump of money is a sign of him being defeated and that his ego has taken a hit.

525,"TLDR: New friend and I go from hanging out, texting often to straight up being ignored for no reason. Attempts to reach out have been ignored, and I'm trying to figure out why. 

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend of many years, A, has talked to me many times about a childhood friend, P, she has, and still talks to and how I would probably like her once we got to know each other! A also mentioned that P is notorious for being flaky and usually cancels plans last minute, but A can never hold it against her because she always has a great reason for cancelling, that's subjective, but I understand what A is saying. A and P uaually only communicate a few times a month and when they do eventually meet up, it is like no time has passed, so really a good friendship, but P's flakiness still annoys A sometimes. A and I even joke sometimes about it, as A has planned several meet ups and P has always flaked and given an excuse, so when plans are made and I'm not even involved, I always joke ""Has P flaked yet?""

&amp;#x200B;

P has somewhat recently moved back from where she was attending school several hours away and A says that all 3 of us should hang out when P is free. Finally the night comes, and P and I get along so, so well. Like instant click, similar to when A and I first met.  We spent the whole night talking and we exchanged numbers so we could talk and maybe hang out one on one. A wared me though that P is not a great communicator and doesn't like to text often which is the total opposite of me. 2 days after we hung out P reached out to me! She was super sweet, convo flowed well, and I really enjoyed talking to her.  The next 2 weeks or so continued that way where one of use would reach out to the other almost daily.  P even started to say how much she ""loved"" me and how she was so glad she met me, how she couldn't wait to hang just the two of us. I felt weird with the ""love"" thing as I take that seriously and I would never say that to someone unless I truly meant it, but I chalked it up to P being very sweet and genuinely just liking me. We did get a chance to meet, go out for drinks, and have some girl time just the two of us and it went really well! We talked so much about how glad we were to be friends, and how much we had in common. And the best part for me was that she didn't flake!

&amp;#x200B;

I worked super early on that Saturday but texted P around 7 am to confirm the plans. I check my phone again at 1 pm and not a word from her. I text  her again, just a friendly ""hey what's up"" and still nothing when 5:00 rolls by. I don't even know the address so that's why I am reaching out. I let it go, but inside I am stewing but try to chalk it up to P's flakiness. 8:30 pm I get a text saying she was sorry and she was busy with going to Ikea and spending time wither her boyfriend all day. She ended the text in a business like fashion that made me feel like she couldn't have cared less if she felt bad for blowing me off. I responded cordially, saying that we should reschedule.

&amp;#x200B;

The next few weeks, texting goes  down to nothing, and if I reach out, I get a half-hearted response the next day. I bring it up with A and she is sorry for me, but she told me what to expect. I can't figure out what the issue is as every time we saw each other it was great, and a lot of conversations ended with her saying she couldn't wait to see me again! I ask her a few times if she wants to stop by the café just for a bit, but she always says she is exhausted from work or that she is too busy. Fair, I get it, but I am still not happy with the lack of communication in general. A says that P has asked to hang out a few times with her and she mentioned that she felt ""pressured"" to hang out with me when she didn't feel like she had that kind of time. I even see P is going out all the time (not a creeper, she just updates her social media often). A has given pretty bland responses similar to what P would say in respect for me. A is pissed off at P for how she has just simply ignored me for seemingly no reason. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple weeks go by and I message P just saying I know she is busy but if we could talk for a bit about how we've been I would appreciate it. She responded with her typical ""Heyyyy gurl. I've been sooooo busy, how are you?"" Not even answering or addressing my question. I even responded saying I was ok and asking what she has been up to. No response and another couple weeks go by. A few days before my birthday I send her this message,

&amp;#x200B;

""I know you're super busy and you're not really big on communicating often, but I gotta be honest...it really hurt my feelings when you never responded back. We went from planning to hang out and texting frequently to just never speaking? Did I do something wrong? It never felt forced and I never got the impression I was being too pushy or anything....your feedback or even a message from you would be nice.""

&amp;#x200B;

That was 3 weeks ago. Not a response. A and I have gone over everything together and we both can't figure out what I did wrong. I'm pretty much over my ""hurt"" feelings, but can I get some advice as to why this person I really thought was my friend would do this? Why is she obviously ignoring me?",21Aug2019,1

528,"Quick Background: I work as a remote English translator for a local company (I live outside the US). Recently, they’re trying to change my contract of payment to much less than before, something like half of my original salary. Their reason being the shortage of projects lately.

Obviously, I am not happy about this, I think I’ve been nothing but pleasant for them, always on time, etc. After some digging, I found that the one actually paying for my salary is their Partner Company from The States! But, of course they neglected to tell me this. I tried contacting someone from the financial department who’d just recently quit, and I was told that our dear ol’ company’s been charging The US company… a 100 bucks… per chapter…. for my service.

It absolutely devastated me that they would dock my pay that much, if what was said is true, then my local company’s currently only giving me 10% of what I’m supposed to make.

Now, I plan to email the truth to (the US) partner company, I’ve never had any contact with them before, and my company never told me the truth behind my employment. For all I’m supposed to know, I’m only under contract with my current local company.

Do you guys think what I’m about to do is stupid? I’d like to email the US partner company and tell them the truth, then offer my service directly under them (meaning I’d like to ditch my current local company and work for them immediately) I plan to tell them that I’m actually employed under my local company (who’s their only partner in this country) but that I find their payment very disadvantageous and shady to me.

Is that unprofessional? Am I just going to get in trouble? :(

(Please note that the company I work under does not operate as a translation service provider, they create media of a sort, and they built a partnership with a company in the US to have their work translated over to American platform. My job is to translate between them. I mean, I don't think they are a contractor? )

TLDR; My local company has a partnership with a company in the US. The US company is responsible for my salary as a remote translator, but when my local company hired me, they didn’t tell me this. They gave me a rate of 10$ per document, while they charged the US company 100$ per document for my service. I only found out after connecting the dots from a colleague, a retired employee from the finance, and after digging through their old social media posts. Should I contact the US company directly and tell them that I strongly suspect my company is lying to me about my pay (Therefore, my company is charging them more too) and that they should just hire me directly? Or is it just an extremely idiotic plan that would get me in trouble?",21Aug2019,1
530,"Hi everyone, 
Just had a mental breakdown about this over the phone and I'm close to having another one.

Since graduating uni, I did some TA training and odd jobs here and there until I got some experience in schools and decided if being a teacher was truly my calling. 
I was doing a freelance writing gig (which I liked but didn't pay so well) when I applied for a teaching gig in Asia. It was spontaneous and the kind of adventure I desperately needed so I went for it. 
I moved, didn't have time to settle in my new kindergarten job (I was replacing a teacher who had left on short notice) so things were hectic. This was around 6 months ago. I was constantly hearing bad things about this job but decided my story was gonna be different and tried to ignore it. Things at work only gradually got worse but my new friends, adorable students and the general vibe of being in a new country kept me sane. 

I went home for two weeks last month (England) and realised just how much I missed everyone/everything. I came back for the new academic school year to find that one of my previous obstacles (that made me want to quit on several occasions) was now gone. Thought things would get better. They didn't. 

Micromanagement is at an all time high, work has piled crazy amount of extra pressure/expectations/responsibilities that I'm not qualified to handle. They also have no intention of handling any of our concerns or finding a solution to our many many problems and it's frustrating. 90% of the TEFL teachers at my school left in July because they were fed up. As did the Asian staff and almost all of admin. The turnover is huge at this company. I stayed on for the new year from the start of this month (as per my contract) and I'm seeing the new teachers struggle too. 

Anyway, I've sincerely lost interest in this job now. I don't get any satisfaction. I try my best for the kids but you'd be blind not to see my enthusiasm has disappeared. It's difficult to save with the price of rent and my salary in general so I'm not getting much out of this except being able to say ""wow, look at me, I moved abroad on a whim, #lovinglife"" which isn't unique/special anyway... I've suffered from major bouts of depression in the past and I don't want to go back to that place again. 

I got in touch about the old freelance job and it's still available for me so it's not like I'd be going home to nothing...
I'm contracted for almost another year at this TEFL job but I can hand in a month's notice.

From reading all this, the obvious answer is probably ""go home, you're miserable!"" but going home could potentially put me back in a low place and remind me just how difficult it was to find a job, ANY JOB, after uni.  Having a degree in English Lit doesn't help. I'm aware that one parent will be greatly disappointed, especially as it's taken us years to mend our relationship. Family is a big thing for me. 

Should I go home after handing in my notice or keep at it for the sake of my CV/resume looking good?



tl;dr work abroad sucks, MH is bad, should I pack up and go home?

Note: apologies if I seem whiny or ungrateful. I'm happy to provide more context as best I can if you have questions.",21Aug2019,1

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

534,"So I'd been working for four years in my industry, and my job was a nightmare. I started noticing some heath issues popping up here and there, but my boss wouldn't give me any time off of work to go to a doctor. She kept making comments about how if she'd known I was going to have health problems, she would've thought twice about hiring me (note: I never missed a shift the entire time I was there related to these issues coming up and I was often referred to BY HER as the best worker in the place, so obviously it wasn't affecting the quality of my work).

I somehow managed to get time off for appointments through favours from coworkers to find out that all of my health problems were caused by one underlying health issue, and the only way to fix it was surgery. There were multiple small preparatory procedures that required days to recover from, as well as twenty or thirty different doctors appointments in the months leading up (1-2 per week for a while, and all during work hours), and the surgery itself required a month off of work for recovery. I knew my boss wouldn't give me time off for all of this stuff, so I quit (I live in Canada, I didn't need the insurance from work to pay for surgery). 

I spent about 11 months off work getting surgeries and medical procedures done, and the underlying medical issue is fixed. There should never be any kind of follow up work, it was a one-and-done kind of surgery. For all intents and purposes, I'm as healthy as the next average Joe on the street. So I tried to get back into the workforce, I've had a few interviews, and they've all asked me about my resume gap, and I've politely explained that I had to take some time off for medical reasons, but it's been taken care of and shouldn't affect my ability to work for their company. I thought this was the right answer, but they've all had this weird look on their face, like ""why would I hire this person, what if there's still an issue or she gets sick again?""

Is there a better way for me to explain this off? Am I phrasing my answer wrong?",21Aug2019,1
535,"I'm seeing my grandmother for the first time in 4 years, and she has no idea that my parents died during that period of time. The whole family agrees not to tell her, since she's very old and is not in an emotionally stable place to handle something like that. She loves my mother and always asks why we dont contact anymore. 

My family knows that if they take me to see my grandmother, she will definitely ask about my mom. They agreed to take me if I can come up with a good lie about why my mom no longer contacts her and hasn't visited. I'm the worst liar and can't think of anything. Would love any advice or help!

538,"I need advice. Idk how to address these feelings I have.

 I frequently compare myself to others and I get easily bummed. I'm very harsh on myself. You could say I'm a pessimistic person. I always find the fault in me but never the good in me. I can't appreciate myself and my efforts. Every time I have done something that's somehow great, the next thing I know i'm harshly criticizing my work and tell myself that there are other people better than me and I shouldn't be proud. I hate it tbh. But it seems like it's already a habit and I can't find a way to stop myself from having these thoughts and feelings. It made me extremely sad. I want to change for the better but somehow i have the thought that if I stop I wont be better enough for myself and for others. 

These has taken a toll on me. I became slow and stupid. I now have a hard time studying. I can't even enjoy the things that made me happy before. Sometimes, I'll just cry because i realize how shitty a person I am and how worthless I am especially when I compare myself to others. It made feel like i should just disappear because there are other people out there who is better than me. TBH if I could kill myself I would've done that a long time ago but ofc I can't cause some people depend on me sooo ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  

Hope someone can give me advice so that i can be better for myself ;((",21Aug2019,1

541,"A friend of mine is going through a tough time and I want to help but am unsure how. First off, she's an absolutely huge nerd, loves Pokemon, anime, cosplay and works for a comic book shop. Her parents (whom she lives with) HATE this and seek to make her life difficult in ways that I would describe as criminal. Some time ago, her parents thought this geekyness went too far and basically trashed a bunch of her possessions. You know, the geek stuff. She also has mental afflictions (ASD, schizophrenia, PTSD from domestic violence) so sometimes things are hard for no reason.

Some of her words excerpted from our conversation, with minor grammar corrections: ""\[...\]Not sure when I can go home today. I don't know if it was the cosplay (author: She shared some cosplay photos with her parents who seemed genuinely interested in the stuff yesterday) or what but my parents decided to cancel my plans today (that I got a shift covered so now I'm down money) and as I left for class they took trash bags into my room\[...\]""

""\[...\]I left for school and my comic book store agreed to let me come straight there to 'work' in the back and hide out today if I need to.""

""I just worry about my dog.""

""My sister left for college yesterday and she often had the pivitol role of distracting my parents from...me. They love me. Like generally my parents are good to me. (author: Not so much?). Its just been...bad again lately. I don't know.\[...\]""

To condense a little, she is worried her possessions will be thrown away (again) because of her parents. She is currently in class so my contact with her is a bit limited, but I'm extremely worried over here.

I'm working on acquiring her address if I need it. For a little more background, she's in college, has a boyfriend, but I tend to be the trusted adult in the room. I'm 32M, CO, (with a NY phone number) and have known her about three years, so there's only so much I can do from here.

Advice?

TL;DR: Friend is worried her parents are going to trash her possessions, I don't know how to help from time zones away.",21Aug2019,1
542,"I will start off saying that i don't know them for longer than 2 months and what i'm writing is just what i saw and heard.

So i met a girl at a party (let's call her C) and a few days later i met a good friend of hers of 10 years. Both liked me but i only liked her friend. When i told C that i liked her friend (and later found out that her friend told her the same about me) she fell into that 15 yr old phase of ""oh no no one likes me i'll never get a bf"". That was my first warning sign. The second warning sign was when the first thing her friend told me after i confessed and we started dating was that C should not find out. C found out. For a month or so i never heard from C and neither did my gf. If my gf tried to message C and apologize because she thought she was the one who did bad by liking me she would only get cold responses and ghosted. Of course my gf was really sad and missed her (probably only) friend for some time. Ffw to today when C and gf and some other friends went out together (i stayed home with a broken leg) after C invited her saying she wasn't mad anymore. On her way home my gf told me C was still mad at her and that some of the friends thought the same. Reason? Because my gf befriended some of C's friends (because they were also my friends and classmates).
My gf also said she misses C so much she is willing to accept things like this just so she could be friends with C.
I don't want to see her suffer.

I would like some advice as to how to take in this kind of situation and how should i held my gf understand that C is a toxic friend.

Am i in the wrong?",21Aug2019,1
543,"Sorry in advance for the long post. Mostly just looking to see if anyone’s ever been in a similar situation...

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend’s friend is dating this girl that I haven’t exactly gotten along with. My boyfriend met her on an app a few years before I met him and the two of them met up. He and this girl went out to a party where she proceeded to make out with two guys in front of him. So, my boyfriend, unimpressed by this, obviously left. She texted him a week later asking where he went and if he wanted to hang out again. He basically told her to never reach out to him again.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a few years and my boyfriend and I go out to a bar to meet up with a couple of his friends. While there, one of them (let’s call him Kyle) introduces us to this girl he’s been meeting up with (let’s call her Karen). When we left the bar to go home, my boyfriend asked me what that girl’s name was and I told him. He responded saying, “I knew I knew that girl.” And he explained the whole situation to me about having had met up with her. He didn’t tell Kyle about it until he announced that he and Karen were now an actual item so my bf thought Kyle should be given the head’s up. Kyle, however, seemed unbothered.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months later we’re out with my boyfriend’s friends (minus the guy and his gf Karen) and one of the guys (let’s call him Steve) starts ripping Karen apart in front of everyone, showing us her instagram, and pointing out every red flag she has. This went on for literally over an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out Karen and I are taking the same classes and have the same professor so Kyle asks my boyfriend if he can give her my number. I told my boyfriend to say no and that I don’t want any help with school because I don’t really feel comfortable having to talk to this girl after my boyfriend explained their whole past meetup to me. My boyfriend gave it to Kyle anyway, saying he was sorry but he couldn’t tell him no and make things weird.

&amp;#x200B;

This girl texted me nonstop for nearly a year asking for help on exams. She only texted when she needed something and would call me “babe” and say “Omg I love you!!”. I just felt like it was extremely fake and so obvious that she was just using me. I would be trying to study and my phone would be going off nonstop with questions about what was on an exam (I took all of my exams except one before her). She even sent me a PDF with about 300 questions and asked me if I could tell her if any of them were on the exam and to point out which ones if so. Meanwhile, she’s given me about three vague ideas of what questions are on that one exam she took before me and I just say thank you and move on and stop bothering her. When she doesn’t feel I give her enough though, she sends me a lengthy text saying how she’s helped me soooooo much and my friends and I really need to return the favor.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, I have interactions with this girl in person that really give me a bad taste in my mouth and make me think she’s even faker. First time I see her all night at a friend’s house is when I overhear her saying to Kyle that she shouldn’t have to be there hanging out with his friends. She then turns around and sees me standing there with another girl and puts on a huge smile and acts so excited to see us. I say hi and then return to hanging out with the one girl for the rest of the night. The next month we all go out and she comes into the room and says hello to EVERYONE except me. I even stood up to say hi and she blatantly ignores me. I then hear Kyle tell her how I stood up to say hello and I hear her go, “Oh, really?” And then she still doesn’t turn around for five minutes and again puts on a huge fake smile and pretends she’s happy to see me.

&amp;#x200B;

So obviously I’m pretty fed up with the fact that this girl whose background is already not the greatest has been using me so blatantly for months and being so two-faced so yeah my friend and I (who knows the situation very well and does not care for Karen either) called her a name to that friend that had badmouthed her that one day for over an hour. And that friend, Steve, had even made a comment to me that night suggesting she had been talking about me to him because he accused me of not helping her on exams (aka I won’t help her cheat). I’ve never had an issue with Steve and my boyfriend, friend, and I even drove him home that night even though it was out of our way and already really late.

&amp;#x200B;

But Steve turned on me and decided to tell Kyle and Karen about me calling her a name. So Karen blocked me on social media and Kyle called my boyfriend to tell him about all of the complaints Karen has about me. My boyfriend asked me if he could see my texts with her and even said that from what he can see it’s obvious she’s making up lies about me and exaggerating the truth. But anyway basically I’m in a bad spot with Kyle now (which is upsetting because he is a really nice guy and has always been so accepting of me ever since I first started seeing my boyfriend).

&amp;#x200B;

This coming weekend I have to go to my boyfriend’s other friend’s birthday and will have to see Kyle and Karen and am feeling so uneasy about it. I’ve never been in this situation before and have never had an issue with any of the other guy’s girlfriends but I’m worried about how the night is going to go. Has anyone ever been in a situation like this and what do you suggest I do? I’m worried she’ll want to talk to me but I really just don’t have any interest because I fear she’s going to keep twisting things around and make me out to be the bad guy. Part of me just doesn’t want to go but I also don’t want to feel like I’m being bullied out of events or even like I look guilty for not showing up.",21Aug2019,1

I thought this was amazing an d did as they suggested. But the 1 of the other friends still keep in touch with me but the other 1 just stopped talking to me, he did nothing wrong and I did not do anything to him.

547,"The dynamics of my work have changed drastically since I’ve started. I’m now under a new manager who micromanages us and finds problems with everything we do. If it’s not done her way, it’s “wrong.” 

Manager has gotten rid of 3 temp employees so far. These employees did nothing wrong, she just didn’t like them. After one of them left I heard the managers talking about how “ghetto” she was because she was black. 

As of now there are 2 more temps and I am the only real employee. I like them a lot as coworkers, but now my manager is going to start getting rid of them one by one, me included. My coworkers temp assignment is ending, the position has the possibility to be permanent. She is good at the job and knows what she’s doing. But when she asked our manager about her assignment ending, my manager said “well it’s being posted internally because people want to apply”, but then my coworker went and say that an indeed ad was placed online. So that’s not internal, and the ad was for a direct hire. My coworker filed a complaint with EEOC since she is black and feels that our manager is waiting for a white person she can hire on. 

Besides these issues, our manager goes around the office taking shit about her employees to everyone. She told my only manager that she hates me and “can’t stand me” and that she was planning on getting rid of me. She talked shit about the other new temp telling people she was “sick of her calling in” when she literally has only called in one time. She’s training someone in another department secretly so that she can take over for my coworker once she gets let go. We know this from watching, the employee has been going into our managers office with her computer and closing the door. The employee who’s doing this is known as the office snitch. She has no plans obviously on telling my coworker that she won’t have a job soon. But since we figured it out on our own, she’s looking at other places. 

Is there ANYTHING we can do about it? Will reporting her behavior to HR do anything? I don’t see how this can’t be seen as bullying. 

This isn’t even beginning to go over her extreme micromanaging, anger issues, general asshattery and foolishness that goes on in this office under her management.",21Aug2019,3
548," 

I and my life and family that is what I'm going to talk about let's break this down with just fast thoughts one at a time over and over 

I'm 29 

my birthday where no one showed up 2019. 

the fact I feel left out of my family but I know I did it to my self.  

the fact was really bad with money growing up.  

I find it really hard to leave my house now.

I draw almost every day for 6 to 10 hours.

I don’t sleep well at all. 

I live with my mom now since my dad passed away and we have become good friends because of this despite not really seeing anything but my scary mom growing up. 

but the gap between me and my brothers and sisters are far as it can be now and I know I am to blame I think.   

I love my mom been a rock for me tough my dad's cancer and my breakdown she is a strong woman.  

I have a fear of never doing anything and being forgotten yet I spent years trying not to make an impact that I didn't.   

now I spend a lot of time alone and think all the time which has trapped me in a weird state of mind where I panic at the smallest thing going wrong because I just can't deal with it anymore. 

I burst into tears out of nowhere and I can't control it reminds me of everything I have lost how much I have fucked up   I can't sleep at night    I am trying so hard to be a better person I really am.   

I started therapy then they let me go because I was in a hole and couldn't get there. I get why they had to let me go because the waiting list for help is a year-long and really hard to persuade someone you need it. 

I'm so guarded  I can't  even let people in my house unless I really know them  I'm so scared of people leavening that  I don’t even let people close but I really want them close but how can I trust anyone   anymore after everything that’s happened   I know there's so much I haven't put down here  because most of it I don’t even know I don’t know how my life got this bad and this fucked my life  was stolen and I stole it   no one ruined my life my stupid actions  and mistakes did and have left me so scared I can't even move  and I don’t know how to fight back anymore  or what to do.   

Do I keep trying to make friends with the people who for most of life never paid attention to me or I can try make new friends but I'm 29 and I have no idea how to do that because of all that I'm a mess of a person who cants leave his house most days.

Life's boring when you have no point im 29 and I don’t know how I am or where I'm going or even if I have any friends my life doesn’t suck it's just really lonely.",21Aug2019,1
549,"Now, I just want to apologise in advance if my problem sounds a little pretty or stupid. There are probably others on this sub who need more help than I do, but I thought that I should at least try to get some advice.

Basically, I'm in a bit of a rut. I'm not exactly a social person, I dont have many friends and I used to love watching films whenever I got the chance. But now, for some reason, I just dont want to do that, and that worries me a little because they really did make me happy. Whatever I was watching, it would help me take my mind off whatever else was going on but now I just dont have the same enthusiasm and I dont know why.

Has anyone had any similar experiences to this? Does anyone know what I should do?",21Aug2019,1

551,"Hey

I don't mean alone in the physical sense, i.e absence of the presence of other people. I mean, very little friends, very few meaningful interactions, going to sleep every night crying because I literally have no one anymore.

I've got Bipolar Disorder type 1,  and Borderline Personality Disorder. Recently, my best friends, and the respective circle of friends gave up on me. I don't blame them. I'm not really worth anyone's time, I just wish I was.

Anyhow, they've all gone to Reading Festival today, and will be there till Monday. I was meant to be going with them, but since they gave up on me, I had to refund the ticket. When they did give up on me, I tried to overdose. Parents noticed, rushed me to A&amp;E. Was brought back. It hurts so much to see the people I held close to my heart, like family, enjoy their summer so much whilst knowing the position I am.  Recently I've just been taking Seroquel and Xanax to make myself sleep all day before I'm too fucking conscious to realise how awful I feel.

If it wasn't for the utter turmoil it would bring upon my family, I would kill myself however I could, whenever I could. I don't like existing for no reason. I don't like being this shell I am. I can't even define myself. The things that have always, and will always define me are my mental disorders.

I hope, by virtue of some miracle, that my (ex) friends come around and decide to give me a second chance. I get that I haven't been the easiest person to deal with in the past, but a lot of that is down to my BPD (something for which I have to take accountability).

I'm heading into my second year at college/sixth form. I was pleasantly surprised by my AS level results. But.. I couldn't celebrate them :/ My (ex) friends did though, they had a party. How do I know this? Snapchat stories from  acquaintances. I won't have anyone to hang around with in College anymore, I won't have anyone to share jokes with, I won't have anyone to get drunk with, I won't have anyone to confide in, to trust, and to lean on. It fucking sucks.

Please, could someone offer some advice on what I need to do, or what I should do? I'd rather follow some advice rather than take more drugs.

Cheers, and sorry for the long message.",21Aug2019,1

554,"So I'm in first year university I'm 18, doing a degree called games technology, which is focused on the design and development of video games, with a focus on vr dev, and hands on experience. I love game design and development, I find the creative aspects combined with the problem solving and software engineering really engaging and interesting. I also got an awesome scholarship, it pays around half of my degree, and I can pay for the other half, so I'd actually graduate debt free. Here's where I've gone wrong, in the first semester I didn't take my workload seriously, I the last few weeks of semester I put in an enormous amount of effort to pass my units, and I managed to scrape a pass, becauze if I failed a unit and lost the scholarship I'd be crushed, and my parents would kill me.

But after our recent trip last month I seriously want to ask her out or tell her how I feel. Now we don't talk much because I can't start conversations and am very bad at keeping one. We do send each other snapchats back and fourth quite frequently for a long time. Because we don't talk much I dont want to just go bam and tell/ask her but I know that I have no chance of building up the conversation to lead to it.

559,"  

My fiancé and I just got engaged on July 1st. We have recently been discussing wedding planning with my family, because I asked my sister to be my matron of honor. About five years ago I was my sister's maid of honor and was heavily involved in the wedding planning. I organized her bachelorette weekend with my mom, helped her try on/pick out her wedding dress, helped my mom throw a party at her house instead of a shower, put together a slideshow of photos, gave a speech, and did a lot of work on the day of the wedding, as is expected in that role. I enjoyed being included and helping things run smoothly

So here’s where our wedding drama comes in. My fiancé and I are not religious. I come from a very Catholic family, and he was raised Southern Baptist. My fiancé had a bad experience growing up with being told he was going to hell if he wasn’t saved and does not have a relationship with his mother, in large part because of her extreme religious and conservative beliefs. I consider myself agnostic and my family has a major issue with this, but we really avoid talking about it because they think I’m like my uncle who turned away from Catholicism and has lived a pretty rough life. They assign at least part of the blame for that on him not being religious anymore. They’ve tried to badger me about what I will do if I have kids, if I’ll raise them in the church because they believe that kids need a “moral foundation” that comes from some type of religion. I haven’t really given them a direct answer because I feel like it’s none of their business, and I’m leaning towards not having kids anyway, something else they’d probably have a major issue with if they knew. 

My parents are very keyed into appearances, it is very, very important to them to have a very nice house, well decorated, a nice car, a good career, and for other people to appreciate that. I don’t really have a problem with that, but I think it can be superficial and it affects our relationships negatively because they can be very critical of me if I don’t do things in the way they think I should. I rarely invite them to my house because it isn’t as nicely decorated or organized as theirs, and they definitely make it known to me that they think I should do better. I used to let them come over to help with projects but now I don’t because it almost always turns into an argument about why I haven’t finished a project yet or how I should organize something differently or how my lawn needs extra work. If they could just come over and have dinner with us, or have a relaxing time, I’d love it, but it doesn’t work out that way. There’s almost always something they think I’m not doing right, or enough of, and I am already stressed and strapped for time, so I just don’t respond well to that. I have blown up on them a few times when I felt like I was being berated. 

When my sister got married, they threw her a $50,000 wedding that was essentially a big family party showing off, and it happened to align perfectly with what my sister wanted because she thinks much along the same lines. When they asked me on her wedding day what kind of wedding I might want, I said while it was perfect for her and a wonderful celebration, I wanted something more casual and relaxed, like a wedding on the beach where all of my friends and family could enjoy spending time together. I didn’t want a big cathedral wedding with a bunch of people and I wanted it to be the kind of wedding where it wouldn’t be weird to wear flip flops under my wedding dress. 

They’ve already made it known to me that they intend to spend half the amount on my wedding compared to what they did on hers, which I told them might be ok, but I just don’t want it to be a very public display that is not as nice as her wedding. What I wanted would probably cost less anyway, and they have contributed to me financially in ways that they didn’t for my sister, however I wish they had discussed this with me. I’m inclined for us to just have a house party or elope if I think it will be too awkward. I know they would be very upset about that, because again, they care about appearances and if I didn’t have a wedding where other people were invited, they don’t seem like they’re willing to accept that when I suggested not having a wedding at all. We are paying down the rest of my student loans and I suggested that we could just count what a wedding would have cost towards the balance of what I owe, but they said no to that. 

So yesterday I go over to their house for my parents’ 40th anniversary, and we brought them gifts, etc. My fiancé was there so they started to talk wedding plans, and they asked me if we’d be willing to consider having a religious blessing like their friend’s son did, for the sake of his family, even though he was not religious. I told them that we would consider it, but I really needed the chance to talk to my fiancé outside of their presence because I did not want him to feel pressured. They told me to remember that our wedding isn't just about me, or my fiance and I, it's also about the family.

My sister started teasing me, in kind of a nasty way, which is not out of character for her, about why I am not religious and why wouldn’t I just consider it. I told her that I wasn’t saying no but wanted a chance to talk over it, and then it turned into a fight. They were trying to say I was the one who anti the blessing, not my fiancé, because he seemed “open” to it and he really didn’t react to it other than saying he grew up in the fire and brimstone kind of environment, without saying yes or no, which they told me sounded to them like a yes. My mom started crying, and I think it was partially because she isn’t feeling well due to a health problem that requires some surgery to resolve that will happen soon. I just repeated myself that I wanted a chance to talk to my fiancé about it, just us, and then my sister was saying I shouldn’t be anti-religion like my aunt/uncle that she always compares me to. 

I was upset and I told her I didn’t want to talk about it anymore. Then she tried to drag my fiancé into it by talking to him about how he feels and I told him he didn’t have to respond to that if he didn’t feel comfortable, he barely knows them, and I know he watches what he says so as not to offend them. My sister reacted like I was telling him to shut up, which I was not doing. My sister brought up that my fiancé had been interested in attending mass, and he had been after seeing the Vatican on Easter on TV. He wanted to go to see the flowers and the music, not because he is necessarily open to religion itself. She tried to make it sound like I was the one shutting everything down, which is not true because my fiancé and I were going to attend mass so he could see what it was like with my family until the circumstances evolved to where we couldn’t go. They made it sound like I had told him we couldn’t go. They weren’t even present during the conversation where we decided not to go and discussed trying again maybe next year when we had planned better for parking, etc. 

I felt ganged up on and once we got home, I talked to my fiancé. I asked him if I was being as unreasonable as they said I was, and he said that while he thought I was being touchy, they wouldn’t let it go once I said I wanted to talk to him about it alone, and he understood why I was mad. He said that it seemed like the only answer they were willing to accept was yes, which was how I felt too. He told me we should have just left if they wouldn’t drop it, and I admit, I shouldn’t have become so heated and argued with them because it doesn’t accomplish anything.

I’ve had conflicts with my sister over the past year, where she tries to say that I’m nasty because I don’t feel well because I’m overweight, rather than listening to me when I try to tell her how I feel. Before when they asked me why I had gained weight, I tried to tell them I was having issues with depression, and my sister responded to that by telling me that maybe I was just a weaker person than she is. I can’t really forget comments like that and if I bring it up later, my family will gaslight me and act like they never said that.

To me, this is manipulative and could be considered borderline abusive behavior. As a kid, I didn’t know how to stand up for myself, and it took a long time and a lot of hard work to gain confidence in myself, learn what boundaries were and how to set them (which is probably going to be something I have to work on for the rest of my life), and to even develop my own opinions. I feel like now when I voice an opinion that conflicts with what my family thinks, they call me inflexible or disagreeable. There were days when they wanted to come over on almost no notice, or showed up hours before, and didn’t understand what I didn’t want to let them come in or do what they wanted to do, even when I had other plans. They alluded to not telling me how they feel about certain things because of me being disagreeable or reacting negatively. They kept saying they weren’t ganging up on me, but it certainly felt like they were to me. I told my mom that saying you’re not ganging up on someone, doesn’t mean the person you are talking to feels like you’re not. You can’t tell people how to feel. 

I got a text from my sister today, telling me that she is going to bow out of the wedding planning based on our conversation yesterday, because she feels this is stressing me out and if I want help, I can ask her to do specific tasks. This is upsetting, because I was pretty involved in her wedding, and in my mind, I thought this was going to be fun and we could enjoy picking things out or planning together because my sister does have very good ideas about decorations and planning. My sister even asked my mom in front of me yesterday if she was difficult during the wedding planning, which my mom said no to, but then turned to me to tell me she felt like I would be the one who would be difficult. 

I am not trying to be confrontational or argumentative at all, but I think I should be able to have opinions about how I want my wedding to be, including opinions that they don’t agree with. My mom told me today she had talked to my sister before she sent the text to me about needing specific direction, and agrees that it would probably be best for us to move forward this way, because I don’t seem to be able to tolerate my sister. I agree with that because I don’t tolerate nasty teasing well because it isn’t funny when it is something she actually means. It feels like they’re spoiling for a fight and no matter how I try to avoid it, it turns into another fight. I’m sick of it. She called me the next night, crying, asking me why I was so anti-religion, asking if I would raise my kids with religion, and telling me that was sad when I said probably not and I told her that it was none of her business either way. She said goodbye after that and it felt like this tearful phone call was meant to manipulate me further.

My mom said today did not think my sister was being nasty yesterday or putting pressure on me to say yes to the religious blessing right then. It is as if we had two entirely different conversations from what she described happened yesterday. She also said, when I suggested maybe my best friend might officiate our wedding, that she, my dad, and my sister would have nothing to do with our wedding if we did that. A very long time ago, when I was 19/20, they were very angry at my best friend because she and I had planned a camping trip that my parents forbade me from going on. I had some pretty eclectic friends, including my best friend, who were basically hippies or dressed like goths, which my parents really didn’t like because of the suggestion that some of them were into witchcraft or violent people. 

They were also not a fan of my best friend because they saw some of the art she made depicting fantasy type scenes, some fantasy weapons she collected, and that apparently scared them because they assumed she was a violent person. They also found out she was bisexual and my sister tried to tell me that only people who were abused or “messed up” are bisexual.  I decided that I was an adult, and I was going to go on the trip anyway because I’d have to stand up for myself eventually. I did, they found out because I stupidly told them, and they showed up at my best friend’s mom house who refused to tell them where I was because of how controlling they were acting. I’m sure they were pretty dramatic too, given how they usually react to situations like that.

After that, my mom would be hysterical about me spending time with my best friend and tried to forbid me from seeing her. I had lost other friends in a less severe but similar way, because they liked to wear too much black or other similar reasons, so I stood my ground on this one. She and I are still very close. We talk basically every day. My friend is very familiar with the situation, so I do tend to vent to her about them at times because she knows what I’m dealing with.

I only just began to acknowledge to my parents that we were still very close maybe five years ago, even though she and I have been friends for 16 years. I thought it was time to give up the pretense because I was going to visit her, she visited me, and I figured maybe they were past that. Especially because I knew if I ever married, I wanted her to be part of it and any other major life events. Today my mom said that they don’t want her officiating my wedding because of that memory, many of the details of which she got completely wrong, and because they don’t know her all that well. I was also on a medicine that can have some mental side effects, which to this day they blame my behavior on, rather than acknowledging that I feel the exact same way and would have done the same, 12 years later. Regardless, I don’t think I would have asked my best friend to officiate anyway because she is very busy, but the fact that they would say that is hard to swallow or forgive.

I am at my wit’s end with them. I feel like all they do is manipulate me and stress me out. My mom today said that my sister was more apt to go along with things my parents thought she should do or agree with them, which is true, I tend to have different opinions than they do, and I think they consider that as being disagreeable. Today she told me I was controlling but I think this is them projecting. I do try to reflect on my actions to see if I’m the one who is out of line. It’s hard dealing with the chaos and constantly evaluating the situation to see what went wrong.

I am so tired of being criticized that I am thinking about just eloping with my fiancé. Maybe we could throw a small house party and have whoever wants stay with us, so we can avoid all of this conflict. I don’t think I want to interact with them very much anymore. What should I do? If I don’t go along with having a wedding, then we probably won’t have a relationship anymore, and I worry for my parents when they are old if my brother in law keeps my sister from helping them out or caring for them, but I shouldn’t have to put up with this kind of controlling, manipulative behavior. My brother in law has some major issues with them, probably partially because of this behavior and also because of his own mental health issues. My fiancé and I are going to talk about it tonight, and know that at minimum, we are going to have to set some parameters on any planning we do, if we have a wedding at all. Currently, I’m not talking to either of them because I think the events of this weekend are still too recent and I don’t want to fight with them. Thank you for your time.",21Aug2019,2
560,"I (22F) currently in my second year of a four-year grad program where the debt is racking up at approximately 40k (USD) per year. One of my classmates (25F) is getting married this month and invited me and my significant other to attend. 

I want to spend a socially acceptable amount on her gift, but I’m also in a position where I’m very financially stressed at the thought of spending $100+ to meet traditional gift standards. I know she likely understands my financial limitations as she’s in a very similar position, though her future wife has a job so that’s been helping her offset a small amount of tuition costs. I could ask her what she’s expecting, but I feel like that might be tacky and put her in a position where she feels like she has to say a low amount to avoid putting me in a bad spot.

561,"I have developed a massive crush on a guy in college over the course of a week. He is shy, cute and plays the guitar. He's very well behaved. I first met him at an informal meeting in college. The next day, we introduced ourselves to each other when we were making our way to a classroom. Later, while coming back from the cafeteria after having dinner, I waved at him (kinda kicking myself for being so stupid and weird) and he waved back.

The reason why I want to get over him is because he's way out of my league. I'm not good looking enough  and have no chance. There have been times when he kinda gave a quick glance in my direction during classroom sessions, but I think I'm overthinking and trying to make a scenario in my head which I deem unrealistic.

562,"So I met this girl who would become my best friend when I was in elementary school, and back then, her and I had a lot of the same interests. Pretty cringey shit, like anime. Not to say that people who enjoy that type of thing are cringey, the way we were into it was. I hate to say it but we were definitely weapons. Being kids, the way we expressed our interests with weird enthusiasm and little care for judgement is a given, I suppose, so I try not to worry about it too much. 
We became pretty close and we hung out a lot, just the usual things close friends do. Over the past few years, however, my tastes and interests have changed drastically. I've outgrown certain singers/bands, tv shows, video games, and ive outgrown anime. (Its important to know our interests centered around anime and RPGs in elementary school). I went through phases like most people do. I've been exposed to new things and people so of course I've changed.
This is where the problem is. Her interests havent changes at all. They're literally EXACTLY the same as they were when we were kids. Now, were graduating high school this year, so it's been almost 10 years since we first met, and shes exactly the same, and kind of still childish. The main issue here is the difference between us. It's so difficult to hold a conversation with her because of them. I try to keep discussions going as best I can but it almost always becomes bland small talk and ends quickly. 
I feel awful because this is kind of my fault. I think I should be putting more effort into being her friend, and i DO miss being able to speak freely with her, but it's hard to when in the back of my mind I dread talking with her. I shouldnt feel this way but i do and i dont know how to help it. If it were easy I would be selfish and just stop trying to talking with her/keep things going, but she has a lot going on in her life and losing a friend would just make everything worse. Plus, everyone I know knows her as my best friend, so I'm also expected to be friends with her, and I have no one to talk to about this. Actually, I don't think anyone knows how our relationship is going. 
(I'm sorry I tried to make this make as much sense as possible)

564,"So, let me preface this with the fact that I have worked in food service and retail that was demanding and fast-paced before. 

I am a college student who needs an on campus job for the upcoming semester and naturally I applied to all the ones I could find. Finally, after about a month of applying, I hear back from someone. Fast forward a few weeks and I have been hired and about to start my job training. Its a fast food place notorious for having picky customers so I needed about 20 hours of training. No big deal! or so I thought. 

The girl training me was absolutely the most horrendous person ever. She made snide comments, she was dimissive and furthermore she was bad at training me. She made me drink a concentrated syrup that was bitter because it would ""add to the experience"" She made me make steamed milk 15 times and was forcibly moving my hand. She was basically bullying me from 7am-1pm. I was on the verge of tears yet figured that I could handle it. I am a confident adult who can handle stress and a demanding workplace! I collected myself and convinced myself I was just tired and being sensitive. However, this girl had the audaucity to make a racist comment about me as my last hour of training had come to an end. 

I am middle eastern and two brown women had approached me inquiring about hiring while I was looking over a recipe booklet. I had a uniform on and there was a sign saying that we were hiring. These two women told me they were immigrants and masters students looking for jobs. As my dad was an immigrant to this country, I go out of my way to be nice to anyone new to America. I tell them I will ask and walk over to the girl training me. After I relay the message, she says ""Who is asking? your little buddies over there?"" 

I say ""What?"" 

She says ""Oh, your little pals over there"" 

At this point, I am fed up. I retort ""Uh no, I don't know them. They just came up to me. They are graduate students."" 

So, reddit I have decided not to work at this place for minimum wage. The job environment is hostile and I don't feel comfortable being around any of those people.  How should I go about quitting?",21Aug2019,1
565,"So, 

Back story so there is some insight..

My father died 7 months ago on New Year’s Eve. My father was the single most important person in my life, (he is even showed on google for his wright brothers replica he built in narromine) My siblings are abusive, physically, and they both refused to come to my fathers side as he passed, even my mother wouldn’t, this broke my heart. I just want to state they didn’t turn up because they are heartless, and if you want further details I can give them but take my word, my father and I were the only loving, kind people in our family when he died I felt destroyed, my university studies have suffered badly, my siblings are trying to steal my fathers money the little 10k he had in super, but they want it all because if we divided it, it’s only 2.5k which I am happy with but they aren’t. My Aunty (my fathers sister) has stolen all his belonging including the very expensive Gibson vintage guitar he owned and toured Australia with in his band which was promised to me. I wanted it for sentimental value but they took it for the money and sold it for 30k. To top it off, I.. as a uni student do not have the money to pay for a funeral so my grandfather (who is very cold) paid for it, he refused to include any of my fathers kids in the funeral, and they even dropped his coffin in the process of carrying him to the hearse which brought me to tears instantly. I was the only one to give a speech at his funeral. Luckily the priest allowed me to even thought my grandfather refused it.
My dads money and belonging were all stolen, including his ashes and his funeral. It has left me crushed, other than my memories, I have no way to show my future kids or to look back myself of any memorabilia or such. I can’t seem to recover.

I’m a shift supervisor at a pharmacy. My manager in training has made racist comments, as well as ableist comments. I didn’t report her to HR for these at first because I thought maybe it was a generational thing. However, she’s been talking about everyone behind everyone’s back. She told my coworkers I was “too emotional” because I had a panic attack one (1) time at work off the clock, as well as talking about my breast reduction and what my “real motive” was, when in fact, I’m transgender and that’s the reason. She talks shit of my coworkers too, but when I found out she was talking about me as well is when I got really upset about it. I spoke to my store manager and I’m reporting her to HR next week.

579,"My boyfriend (31m) and I (25f) bought our home about 3 years ago. We bought it to use it as an investment property and lived in a high rise nearby. Our neighbors on one side have lived there their whole lives, a son in his 60’s and his mom 98. I feel like they initially didn’t like us being the new owners because of us putting it on Airbnb and attracting some partiers which I’ll admit would be annoying. We did away with the Airbnb and now live in the home and I’ve made it my mission to kill the guy with kindness, which has actually helped some. He at least says hi back when I say hello and will sometimes chitchat about the neighborhood or about grooming up the tree that sits on both our land, just little shit. Now recently within the past month or so I’ve seen his mom getting put into an ambulance a few times, last night being one of them. Every time I want to reach out or offer some help, but I’m not sure what I could even offer or if he wants any help. Does anyone have some advice on something I could do for him or offer to someone who I don’t really have any relationship with? I just feel sad for the guy.",21Aug2019,14

591,my boyfriend and i have been dating for about 5 months now and he has this close female friend. i don’t care who he’s friends with as long as they treat him right and i’m not the possessive type either. a few things are making me uncomfortable though. they will go out to a dinner and a movie or go over to her house to make food together and watch a movie at her house. he’ll also go to disneyland with her (we all have disney annual passes). just a few days ago i went with him and the very next day he went with her. i’ve met her a few times and a few months ago i asked my bf if i could get to know her a little more bc she’s a close friend and he said “i don’t think that’s a good idea because she’s really shy”. just recently we all went to a movie and she brought a friend and right after the movie she literally bolted and left and my bf told me that she was super uncomfortable. i’ve talked to a few people about this and they said that he’s essentially going on dates with another girl and idk how to confront him about it. i trust him but it’s just a bit odd and awkward to me and it makes me uncomfortable. i’m not saying he can’t be friends with her because i would never want to prevent a friendship over jealousy but like i said it’s weird and it gives me an uneasy feeling. help ?,21Aug2019,1

594,"I've lived with my roomie for over two years and we have never had any issues. This week, her best friend of a long time has been staying with us and for the most part, there's not been any issues. However, two nights ago I was getting the vibe that he (30m) was interested in myself (22m). I'm super socially awkward, but have been friendly and nice to him and I tried to make it clear I wasn't interested and that I've been looking for a lady for the last couple years. 

While he was drunk, he walked into my room at 11pm unannounced, saw I was awake, and closed the door and walked away without saying anything. No biggie, he was drunk, I assumed looking for the bathroom. Now last night, I was sound asleep, woke up around 3am, and saw that my bedroom door was wide open and I was by myself. Considering I sleep naked, and that my room door opens to the hallway, I was concerned that anyone could have seen me butt naked and asleep. 

As the day has progressed and I have woken up more, I'm increasingly unnerved at what happened while I was asleep. I texted my roommate and haven't heard back from her yet. I don't know how to approach this situation as I have no issues with the guy in general, and because he's pretty much been shitfaced all week.

Now you may be asking yourself, that’s all fine and dandy but that paragraph has nothing to do with the title, well here’s where it begins. 

So we both knew soon she has to go to college, a dorm college, where she will be staying for a few years and would only be able to visit maybe every month er so.

But I’m not capable-of letting her go, mentally, i want her to go and succeed in life having a bright future but after everything we shared it’s going to be hard to not see her as much. I’m scared of losing her because of the distance and the fact we won’t be seeing each other much. I told myself i would be strong, that i would be her rock so she doesn’t cry, but knowing there’s only one day left till she leaves I’m slowing breaking down and becoming a mess.

600,"Need some advice here! I have been dating my boyfriend for 5 years now. He lives with two male roommates who have become my best friends over the years. I know them very well, go on vacations with them, hang out with them every weekend. These are people who will be in my wedding - we’re that close.

I met this girl, let’s call her Dani, through a mutual friend.  We hung out a few times in a big group of girls and I always found her kind of annoying, but fine. I live in a big city and making new friends at my age can be difficult. I didn’t particularly like Dani all that much and saw some red flags, but she was a casual friend. 

My boyfriend and his roommates had a house party that I invited Dani and a bunch of other people to. Dani comes to party and hooks up with one of my boyfriend’s roommates, let’s call him Eric. I still thought Dani was weird, but I laughed and didn’t take it seriously because I thought it’d just be a drunken hook up.

Well, from that time on they have been dating. It’s been about 6 months. Dani has become increasingly annoying, controlling, needy and all around really unpleasant to hang out with. She thinks we’re “best friends” - we have never been close. She wanted to grasp onto me because she knows I’m close friends with Eric and in “the group.” She desperately wants to be friends with us, but no one likes her except Eric. We all see major red flags - she can never be alone, she hides in Eric’s room all of the time and is always there, she cries if she’s not included in plans with us, she constantly texted me trying to hang out and wouldn’t leave me alone.

About a month ago, the roommates and myself were planning a birthday party for Eric and Dani started texting me crazy stuff about how she’s never included (she was fully invited to the party and was in on the plans) and I finally had enough of it and basically told Dani to stop and that I wanted to distance myself from our friendship. Since then, she hasn’t texted me and I haven’t seen her because it’s summer and we’ve been away and on different schedules. Now we’re all back in the city and here are the current issues: 

1. I can’t go to my boyfriend’s house without seeing Dani because she is always there. This is making me super anxious because we haven’t seen each other since I told her I needed a break from her. 

2. It makes me enraged that Eric and Dani are dating because their relationship is toxic and he deserves better. They broke up for a week because Eric realized how crazy she was, but they quickly got back together because Dani manipulates him and takes advantage of him. 

3. The whole group dynamic has changed because Dani insists on always being with us and won’t leave us alone.

4. I’m starting to lose respect for Eric because he’s acknowledged to all of us that their relationship sucks yet he stays in it. I also feel weird not being able to ask my close friend about a relationship he’s in. I never ask him because I don’t want to talk about Dani.

What do I do, Reddit? I know their relationship isn’t my responsibility, but it’s so annoying because she’s invaded my whole life. I can’t even go to my boyfriend’s house without seeing her. It brings me major stress and I’m sick of dealing with it and having it impact a very close group of friends. THANK YOU!",21Aug2019,2

603,"this month is awful.

Weeks ago i went into my friend's account and checked what my gf and my friend was talking about(i know it's wrong to invade other people's privacy, but i just need to see it and i had my friend's account for 3 months), and they've been talking shit about me. I texted her that day and she hated me texting her. 

i didn't reply to her message yet, because if i reply she wont like it, and if i ignore she won't like it either, i don't know what to do.

I was also planning to give her a silver bracelet. But now i don't know. I don't know if i should give it to her still. I can't even see her anymore because maybe she'll hate seeing me.

and whenever they talk shit, i always try to improve, but whenever i improve myself, there's always something wrong with me.

i feel like i got betrayed by my friend, in my convo she's all like supportive and stuff, but in my gf's convo she's talking shit. After seeing that, i don't even know if i can trust all of my friends anymore.

And me, i'm lost. I really am.

i'm a really sensitive person, whenever someone jokingly said ""kys"" or something like that, i'll think that that person actually wanted me to kill myself.

And when i see/talk to someone, my mind will say like ""i hope X dies"", ""kill yourself X"" something like that.

I wanted it to stop but i can't 

and my mind often tells me that i'm smart and i'm smarter than X, but i'm not. I know i'm not, but my mind keeps telling me that.

and my parents often argue when they're together, and i hate it when i can't help. My sister got abused by her ex, and i did nothing to stop them, i didn't even know that happened.

and i always think,

what if my parents, my sisters,  and my friends died?

i always think about that, and i'm so scared that will happen

i want to stop thinking about that but i just can't
 

and also, i'm an attention-grabber, i really want to stop, but i just can't stop myself.

i just want to be a nice and kind person because i fucked everything up, But i know i probably won't change, i'll just be a sad sad useless guy

it's like everything i do is wrong

i just need help

i feel so lost, afraid and crazy

i feel like i've gone mad

If i tell my problem to my friends, they'll think i'm crazy.

615,"You know how ""nice guys"" exist? Guys who feel a false sense of entitlement to receive admiration or consideration from women? I'm scared I might be the same way. I'm a bit biased about men because of how I've been treated by some of them, but I realize that not all men are bad. I noticed that while browsing the nice guys subreddit, I see how their behavior is wrong. Yet when I visit the nice girls sub, I feel like some of them are right. Not all of them. A lot of screenshots have me saying ""wtf!"" Out loud.

Example: A girl rants about how guys treat nice girls horribly, make her crazy, and how they don't really want nice girls. I agree with her in some ways because I had the same experience with a narcissistic ex who did the exact same thing. However, if I read the same post, posted by a guy, I'd disagree and suspect that he is ""entitled"" or did something to be a jerk to push someone away. I recognize what a biased, double standard that is and I hate being a hypocrite!

How can I change ""nice girl"" mindset, entitlement, and actually be the decent girl that my wonderful boyfriend deserves to date. I feel like I may be exhibiting narcissistic behavior that turns people off without being aware, then complaining about how people don't want to be my friend because I'm ""Too nice"". I used to talk a lot of shit on Facebook while contradicting myself so that's one pattern of behavior I've noticed while trying to change. Please don't be rude. 

I know I have toxic tendencies that I need to change and I desperately want to be a better person. Please don't recommend therapy right now. My therapist is genuinely in the wrong about how they invalidated abuse I receive as a child and recently. They discouraged me from no contact with a narcissistic, abusive parent. My former psychiatrist was convicted of raping nine patients, so I'm not going to feel safe enough to try therapy for a while. I'm not trying to make excuses. You can read my post and comment history if you doubt I'm in the right about cutting contact with the abuser. Please. I just need some basic guidelines or extensive advice about how to be better.",21Aug2019,2
616,"I have a friend, I'll just call him ""Jacob"" who I'm not sure is toxic for me or not. We have been friends for about three years, and during the beginning he was incredibly nice and I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary about his behavior. However, in the last year, I've noticed he's very nitpicky towards me and tries to control me.



Also, we're both photographers, and I notice when I try to experiment with my studio gear he tries to tell me how to do things I already know how to do. He is an intelligent individual, and insists that he's ""only trying to help"" but oftentimes gives unwarranted advice and opinions that are sometimes hurtful to me. His way of doing things is always the right way, and if I make a mistake it seems like he has this 'know-it-all', 'I told you so', and 'I should have done it' type attitude. He's just always quick to correct me.
 For example, I normally let him drive even though it's my car because it always seems to stress him out when I drive.

 Also, anything I am doing he seems to always want to be a part of. For example, I started a job and he wanted to work there as well. I want to become a web developer, and he talked about how he wanted to join a coding bootcamp with me. He can't seem to commit to one thing unless I decide to do it, and then he wants to be a part of it somehow. 


Even if I make the slightest mistake he seems to make a big deal about it. For example, we were looking at apartments together, and if I made a mistake with the scheduling or didn't do something exactly how he thinks it should be done, he would criticize me. 


I notice he also displays pretty possessive qualities towards his significant others. He moves very quickly in relationships with them
and usually tends to adopt some point of their identity. (For example, his last boyfriend was Korean and he decided to learn all about Korean cooking, one was Brazilian so he was going to decide to move to Brazil and become a journalist there, the one he has now is vegan and he has decided to be vegan). If the person he's seeing wants some space, he doesn't seem to understand. He will text that person incessantly and even show up to locations he knows they will be at in order to confront them about their lack of responsiveness. One person he sent a terribly long and mean Facebook message because he wouldn't text him back and 'have a discussion about Jacob's feelings of insecurity' towards the relationship. I know this has nothing to do with me, but it really bothers me how he handles his relationships with these guys, who are often times at least five-seven years younger than him. 

He can't seem to empathize when people act outside of his expectations of how he feels people should act. If someone acts in a way that he feels isn't how he would handle it, he is highly critical of them. He also hates that he can not finalize someone's opinion of him (for example, he and his boyfriend broke up, and he was super upset that his ex boyfriend decided to stop talking to him instead of ending it on a good note). He also seems to only be concerned with his own anxiety and depression and how he copes with it and doesn't seem to want to understand how someone else handles these things in a different way. 

He does have a lot of nice qualities. He's clean, neat, helpful, and I think does have good intentions in mind, but I just can't stand how I constantly have to watch myself around him. There will be times where he tries to build me up and complement me on how I'm doing, so that's why I'm not sure if he's toxic or if I'm just being oversensitive.",21Aug2019,1

Sorry if this belongs in [r/Roomates](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roomates/) or [r/badroommates](https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/) instead!

**Background Info**

My old roommate, whom I got along with really well, moved out and I really needed to fill the room so I offered it to my couple friend who I know hated their building at the time. I offered it at the same rent as mine, even though it's larger and they are two people (one income) if they handled wifi. I was also desperate because I can't afford the whole apartment myself.

I thought they were clean, easy going people but it's been...difficult for the past 10 or so months. I am very, very clean, and I had to adjust to living with some not-as-clean people *and* two cats. It took me a bit but I did.

I've had around 30 or so roommates due to living in suite-style residence at University (3 to 4 roommates per academic year and summer) and had issues with maybe *two* of them--but those issues were suite-wide.

So, apparently I'm a bad roommate that tells them what to do like children because I've asked them once if they didn't mind vacuuming, and once if they could do their dishes because my boyfriend was coming over and we were going to cook so it'd be nice to have a clean work space (and also clean pans and knives, which are mine but they use and don't clean). The first time they responded that they don't feel the need to ""deep clean"" every week (in my mind, vacuuming is not deep cleaning and should be done weekly when there are three people and two cats living in a small apartment). The second time they didn't respond. I message them because I can't get them together, we have very different schedules, and the one time I said something to one, it got *very* twisted when related to the other.

Last night I talked to one of them because there is too much tension and I'm very unhappy in the living situation. They have been together for 9 years and never had a roommate; whereas I have lived by myself (aka not with my parents) for 8 years, with and without roommates. She told me that they are offended and feel like I'm a strict mom telling them to clean up when I ask if they could do their dishes or the like because they're adults and they know when they have to clean. Whereas, I feel like I'm a roommate asking another roommate for a favour, because we're sharing the space and we need to be conscientious of that. I really struggle with this because she basically told me I can't ever ask them to do anything because they're adults and they'll do it on their own time. This is not how roommate relationships work, in my mind. I also don't consider myself their mom. I am 26 and they are 30/31.

They also apparently feel like I don't want the apartment to looked ""lived in"" so they feel like they have to clean up after themselves immediately. I thought this meant wiping up something if you spill or sweeping up crumbs if you got the kitchen floor really dirty while cooking. To them that means not leaving a single book out--which I have never said anything about (and I leave things out too). I'm more concerned about dirt and food mess; I also have Celiac so I need to be careful not to accidentally gluten myself in the kitchen.

**TL;DR** This roommate relationship is not working--we have very different ideas of the responsibilities of co-habitation (I think I'm right but so does everyone else). I lived there first and I don't think they have the ability to live with a roommate. I want them to move out. Is this fair?

(Note: Two of us are on the lease because I didn't want to be on the hook for their rent if they defaulted. He's a little spacey sometimes.)

Any advice would be appreciated.

620,"Hey, this is my first time posting here,or posting at all so it's kinda weird for me so if something is confusing or anything,tell me and i'll try to explain (also i'm mid-european so my english isn't the best) Also,sorry for the length.  


So,onto the story. I'm 13 years old and about to go to 8th grade. Before I get into the main situation,I want to tell that in 8th grade in my country,we need to sign up for high schools that has to do with our future careers- therefore it's like a mini university. So, I wanted to study in arts/animation. We just started searching for high schools this August.  


A bit of backstory. My parents had a big kinda fight like,2 years ago (i think) and since then my dad doesn't as... passionate? About the family as he was. You see, my dad only comes home on the weekends. He's always wanted me to have a good life,a good career/future. So all we really talked about is what I wanted to do.   
He always took me out to the movies,to my grandma's,to work and everything. Then this girl came around. (She's my Dad's **coworker)** She was always there,every time we hung out,came to my grandma's, even brang HER NIECES there. Even just hung out like,by herself without us.  
I kinda got angry about that whole thing. It upset me that she's always there,every single time. And eventually I had enough of it.   
It really got to the point that I didn't even really want to hang out with my dad. That's really why the reason I'm here.  
But she isn't important now really. It's a whole other situation.For now.  
So I really didn't know my dad for,really most of my life,and he doesn't know me either. So that didn't help that he always was  saying that ""why don't you talk to people"" ""come on just go partying,have fuuuun"" ""you're always sitting in your room go outside for once"". And that was also kind of upsetting. He felt like a stranger to me. I mostly stayed with my mom,she always took care of me and all,and i couldn't wish for a better mother.

So,the current situation we're in right now. (this happened in 2 days.)  
So my dad really wanted to bring me out to the lake.He told me that it's gonna be sooo goooood and we're gonna have fuuuun.  
Now, his coworker is not the biggest reason I didn't want to go,but she's really the one that made me build up this frustration.  
Two days ago, we were supposed to go to the lake. I didn't really sleep well, and we needed to wake up early. I didn't even want to go in the first place. So I mostly stayed in bed until he came in and told me I have five minutes and we're going. So I panicked,because I knew she's gonna be there. It doesn't sound like a big deal,but it was to me,and still kinda is. I just started crying. I told my mom I didn't want to go. So we started talking,I did end up telling my dad that I didn't want to go because I was tired,so he just stormed out and went away.   
I told my mom that I didn't really like that we were always hanging out with his coworker,everytime we were supossed to have 'us time'.  
So,she told my dad. He came back and talked about how ""certain people like hanging out with certain people"" and I kind of found it reasonable. So he kept asking me ""so are you coming"" ""why aren't you coming I don't understand"". We hugged and there he went.  
Today he called me to ask what I was doing,and of course,why I didn't want to come. I told him I can't really explain. So he told me to write it down and he'll be waiting. So,I told him that :  
""Why I did not want to go is because I wanted to get ready for next year. I want to use this time,to stay at home,chilling,and having fun because I will not have that during school""  
Now. What he wrote back was:  
""Did your mother tell you to tell me that? (Sad-f\*\*cking face emoji) Now tell me the truth."" And I was like  
What the actual living sh\*t  
So I wrote back ""No. I'm being honest to you,these are my words.""  


This just happened an hour ago. My mom was showing me some cool schools,programs and stuff just asking if it is what I wanted to do. I was like ""I'm not sure,but that's kinda it"" And then went outside to pet my pup.  
And apparently while I was outside my mom send the program to my Dad.   
So. My Dad was also searching for schools for me. And guess what  
He got f\*\*king mad.   
He asked my mom if ""If you already found f\*\*king schools for (me) then why am I even doing this sh\*t"" And trash talked about my Mom.  
My Mom broke down over this. I just came in from the garden and went to comfort her. She told me that ""I'm not doing this anymore"" and told me the whole situation. That's why we're here.  


I was already expecting this.For months. But ignored it.  
I don't know why really. It was in my mind,but I instead watched my favourite shows and drew stuff to distact me.  
That's all.   


I would like to ask people with similar family situations,or split parents, what do I do? I kinda feel helpless in this.  
What happened after Your parents divorced,and what problems came after?  
Honestly,my only fear that my dad will get custody.While I doubt that that will happen,but he technically lives here, the other plcae he sleeps is at his coworker's or the office.

621,"I work for a small boutique that’s been owned by the same woman for almost 25 years, I’ve worked for her for about 2 and a half years now and she’s like family to me. But, I’m the only full time employee, the only other help we have is one full shift on Sunday and one half shift on Thursday. And she “promoted” me to manager, on top of being her assistant, which I honestly didnt want the responsibility because I’m already doing the job of 2 people on a day to day basis and now I’m expected to be on top of everything, including her schedule and even where she leaves things around the store, the other staff, paper work, and cleaning. (Including and not limited to washing the windows) And on top of that I’m expected to be on top of the social media but also not use my phone to much and also be making sales. We expanded the store in July and I had agreed to work 6 days a week temporarily to help get everything settled and organized and so that she can also get a day off. But she hasn’t even been taking a day off, she could just not come in, but she still shows up.. 

On top of that I rarely take any real breaks, I take my lunches in the front so that she gets a chance to go and eat, which she is usually gone for 20-40 minutes. And if I just try to sit for awhile I just get a list of things that I need to be doing instead of taking a break and she goes and smokes outside, honestly I’ve thought about picking up smoking just to take a real break, even if I’m allowed to take the break usually it’s so that we can discuss what else I’m going to be doing after it. She’ll even decide to rearrange the entire store on a whim (which includes a lot of physical labour from me) just so that we’re kept busy.

And she expects me to be on top of everything but doesn’t trust my judgement, to the point that everything is micromanaged by her, but if I make any sort of decision no matter if I’m right or wrong she wants me to ask first. And to top it off, I’m expected to put in a lot of emotional labour, since we are close I end up hearing a lot of her personal problems, and I’m used to this with a lot of people on my life, I like to listen and help but it’s exhausting, I’ve found myself getting more and more emotionally burnt out. I know she plans to retire and has expressed that she wants me to run the store for her after she does, but I don’t think I want that, anymore, once I thought I did but I don’t think I do..

Anyway, TLDR: I have a boss who is like family to me, but she works me to hard, I’m expected to do the job of 3 people and I’m working 6 days a week and never get a real break. What do I do?",21Aug2019,1

A bunch of middle schoolers were asked to write the top reasons they feel insecure and the following were amongst the top answers  
1- Worrying about what others say  
2- Dressing up to others standards  
3- Obsessing over performance  
4- Wanting to fit in and be popular  
5- Drama created by other girls  
Do you think these insecurities only apply to middle schoolers or do they sound familiar?  
I personally related to some of these insecurities and it's so sad that some insecurities stick.   
That's why we have to be aware of what is making us insecure and work on it because if you don't go face to face with your insecurities they won't go away.

Hi, I'm Alec I'm 17 and a senior in high school (I also take a handful of college classes). I've been diagnosed with ADHD since the last year of junior high - which has roughly been 5 years now and I have continually taken my ADHD medication as prescribed since then. I've had issues with my appetite which is normal with the medication (Adderall) but it has gotten a lot more intense this new year since I started it back up on Monday. I can recognize I'm feeling hungry and my stomach will growl and I'll even feel sick from hunger but I cannot eat or I will physically get sick. I'm used to bingeing my own way - I would go a school week without eating, eat on Saturday, and continue from Sunday to Friday. But I am transgender and I just started testosterone two months ago and I don't know how it will effect that. Any advice helps. Thank you.

628,"My boyfriend of 5 years and I recently ended our relationship due to both of us changing and heading on different paths in life. It was mutual and we agreed on staying friends. The first few days I felt relief like ai have never felt before as I realised I can now focus on my career and enjoying a more adventurous sex life but as time passes I am starting to miss him.

I then swear that I will exercise self restraint next time but normally never do. As such, I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and has found a way to combat this issue?

Overall, I feel like the binging comes from my personality of getting into something and then giving it my 110%. Issue is sometimes I wish I would have this much effort on more productive things more often than I do on fun things.

Just to note: typically the binges don’t really affect my professional life outside of lost sleep and I’m still doing well overall with college and my job. The binges do seem to kinda hurt my chances for making new friends tho but that doesn’t bother me normally during the binge but I do feel kinda lonely after the binge is over. I guess maybe the things I binge also serve as a proxy for a core group of friends I haven’t had since high school (we all went to different schools in different states/changed quite a bit and the group kinda fizzled out).

Guess this kinda turned into a two parter with binging and friends, whoops. Anyways, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",21Aug2019,2

636,"Essentially, there’s this guy or man-child that has been flirting with my girlfriend at work. She didn’t really know how to handle it and was too nice to him. When she realized he was crossing the line, she told him that they could no longer have a relationship at work and that she’d now be working with other people from the same department rather than him. 

Here’s how she described his responsive behavior in text to me (extremely strange and clearly some serious mental issues!!): 

https://imgur.com/r5Jsql5

She also said, “he started scrunching his face, messing with his hat, and pulling it over his eyes”
To be this emotionally affected is such irrational behavior that I’m legit worried for her. She doesn’t want to tell management because she knows her boss is going to report it and most likely fire him. They have a 0 tolerance policy at work with this kind of behavior. The problem with that is this guy has literally nothing else going for him in life. He has those “dead eyes” that are empty and a sign of someone that has nothing to lose. So, clearly it’s not a good idea to get this guy fired because there’s a good chance he will go batshit crazy on my girlfriend and possibly me. 

Luckily, he shows up to work way earlier than her and also leaves way earlier. My problem is that he’s the type of guy to stick around after work, and he doesn’t seem mentally stable (clearly). Unfortunately, my girlfriend doesn’t have anyone to walk her to her car and it’s unreasonable for me to drop her off and pick her up every single day, but it seems like that’s really the only option going forward until she finds a new job. She really likes this job and was going to be promoted to manager soon. So, I’m not sure if it’s worth for her to stick around just to get the title and move on. Clearly, nobody is going to give her a managerial position for less than  1 month of experience at her new position. I just feel like as the weather gets colder here, this guy’s mood will continue to drop drastically based on seasonal depression and coupled with all his other mental issues. 


So, what do you guys think? It’s time to look for a new job and suck it up? Take the big risk of telling management and him getting fired while losing the only thing he cares about in life apart from his dog (according to himself)? I don’t really see any alternative scenarios here. I think it’s foolish to just wait and see how it plays out. This guy has most likely been harboring a lot of negative energy for many years. As we know, people can snap even over the silliest of things.

If you guys think I’m being irrational, please do let me know. I do tend to over-worry though I really feel justified with that at this moment.",21Aug2019,2

Why is life so unfair? There are people who don't put much effort into something but fate is still in favor of them. They make things seem easy when there are other people who need to work their ass off.

Why is effort not always enough when those kind of ""gifted"" people enter the picture? It's like all the effort of my kind are being washed off in a snap.

Why am I like this? I feel so pathetic and useless.",21Aug2019,1
643,"Hello all!

I am having a really tough time deciding if I should accept a job offer or not. I am 25 years old and currently work as a police dispatcher. It pays roughly 60k/year and I've been in this line of work for 5 years now. I own my own small house and easily pay the mortgage and all of my bills each month. I have no credit card debt or student loans. I will list the pros and cons of my current job vs the other. 

Pros for current job:

\-I have a lot of vacation time. 16 days currently and it will become 21 in another 2 years. I have the ability to trade shifts with co-workers so usually I only spend 4 vacation days and a trade to get a whole 10 days off of work. Effectively giving me 4 times a year I can have 10 days off and 5 times a year in 2 years. This by far is the biggest pro. I really enjoy traveling, I've been to many countries and plan to go to more.

\-My work schedule is 5 days on 2 days off then 5 days on 3 days off. An extra day off every other weekend makes week long vacations automatically 1 day longer, 10 days instead of the usual 9. And that is an extra 22 days per year of free off time on its own. Trading a shift (or calling in sick) after a 3 day weekend makes for a nice 4 day weekend if you wanted to take a small trip! Technically I work 8.5 hour days but it's still a pretty good deal.

\-For about half of my shift I sit around doing nothing but watching TV. Some days can be busier or slower depending on the day. But a large amount of the time I get paid to do nothing.

\-I have a nice house here where I live now and I live close to my parents with whom I have a good relationship with and visit often, and my best friend of over 10 years.

\-My best friend works for the police department I dispatch for, so we have indirect contact at work and I can message him about things.

\-I'm would consider myself very good at my job.

Cons for current job:

\-For about half of my shift I sit around doing nothing but watching TV. I am incredibly bored at work for the majority of the time. Yes, it is nice to get paid to do nothing. But it's mind numbing. I could pick a busier shift, but to be honest I don't really want to do more volume of this work.

\-I dont particularly enjoy the work. I do not hate my job! But it doesn't really do much for me. This job is incredibly easy and not challenging for me.

\-I dont like talking to the public (who does really).

\-Idk if I can see myself doing this forever. And then what other job will I get? I've always struggled with knowing what I want to do with my life. The odds of finding something I genuinely enjoy seems slim, and finding something else with this much vacation also seems slim...

\-The pay is alright but not great.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros for other job:

\-Seems like an interesting job that I could enjoy doing. Of course I haven't done it so I can't say for certain. I think I would be good at it as the skill set seems right up my alley.

\-Average salary of about 120k but can reach upper 100s. Starting at about 70k depending on where you go. And after you are trained it jumps quickly.

\-No talking to the public or dealing with them at all!

Cons for other job:

\-13 vacation days to start and 18 after 3 years. The bad part is that you have to bid for them a year in advance. Getting a week off spontaneously is impossible so you have to plan all vacations by October of the year prior to taking them. And being low on seniority can limit taking off time during some months. Overall much less schedule flexibility.

\-The schedule is really strange. The usual week consists of 2 afternoon shifts, 2 day shifts, and 1 midnight shift each week. Seems really bad for a sleep schedule and just why.

\-I will almost definitely have to move from where I live now and it could be somewhere not great. You get to pick out of a list of available places anywhere in the US. I could be there several years before I could transfer.

645,"I’m in a group of 3 (I’m a guy, the other 2 are girls) and we’re very tight. We all lived in the same area but the other 2 recently moved to different states (Tennessee and Texas). We have kept contact. The one in Tennessee, we’ll call her T, just started dating this guy and I’m happy for her. Still herself, texts and calls almost everyday and wants me to meet her new boyfriend. She’s very happy and I’m happy for her. The one in Texas, we’ll call her D, is seeing a boy. Not dating but talking. D is in university and she has been smoking almost everyday and not really texting us or calling or really giving much attention besides small talk (my leg hurts, I’m bored, etc.) D hasn’t dating anyone in years and I showed her tinder for fun talking to people. This is how D met her boy, X. Ever since she met X, she doesn’t talk much to me and T and she is always out late. She doesn’t bring a roommate with her anywhere she goes. I’ve talked to X. Seems kind of off (monotone, go with the flow kind of guy) he seems trustworthy but I see him as a friend for D rather than a boyfriend. He looks out for her and they roast each other. He doesn’t call her names like “pretty” or “cute”, he doesn’t really do much with D, just watches tv together. Just seems more of a friend than anything. D really likes X tho. I think it’s cuz of the attention and the fact they met on tinder kinda pushes her to think she should date. Me and T haven’t been talking to her as much since she is always with X, which I understand. But it got to the point she would cancel on us for a group call we agreed a time on to hang with X or even play games together. T even went as far as cancelling her trip to visit her due to her behavior. T and I are debating on just cutting her off till she wonders why we aren’t talking to her. Help?

647,"I (22, F) have been using a dating app called Bumble. I matched with a guy (M, 28) and we began to hit it off. We exchanged cell numbers so we could text off the app and make plans to meet. I enjoyed hearing about his teaching/coaching work, he is a high school teacher and he coaches girls JV soccer. All was going great but then he started to weird me out, I wouldn't respond for a few minutes and he would bombard me with texts demanding me to answer. I'm not used to that kind of thing. This was only the beginning. 

He asked to come over to my apartment - mind you that I have never met this guy, only texted. I told him that I have a personal rule that I don't meet people I don't know unless it is first in a public place, I think that was super reasonable considering I'm an unarmed 22 year old female who doesn't even have a roommate. I told him I was willing to meet for dinner at a restaurant instead. He didn't like this very much. 

He told me that my rule made sense but that there was no need for it. He said he would much prefer to come over to my place and bring takeout. He then sent me pictures of some of his young female students, showing me conversations with them and photos they had taken with him, claiming this is proof that he is a good and safe guy. I do not see how it is appropriate for him to even be in touch with his students in this kind of way let alone exploit them by sharing their pictures with another adult. 

I started to ignore him. I began to get a strong sense that this guy is a total creep. I disliked him for trying to go against my personal rule of nobody is allowed over before I meet them - I felt disrespected. I figured if I just stopped answering, he would go away. 

He kept going. 30+ text messages to me throughout a series of a week or so and I have yet to answer. He has apologized, then taken back the apologies, then apologized again, all just talking to himself basically considering I haven't and will not be responding. 

I decided enough was enough and blocked him. Then I got a text message from his iCloud account, he was furious that I blocked him and didn't understand why I wasn't giving him a chance. I decided to be blunt. I told him that I thought he was disrespectful and that his persistence had crossed a line of sanity. He told me that I was lying, that I was making up that he's disrespectful and then sent me more photos of him and his young female students, again using this as a claim that he is a good person and respects women. These girls looked like they were 14. I felt criminal just having pictures of minors like this on my phone. I blocked his iCloud. He reached out again through a iMessage email. I don't have the emotional energy to continue this blocking game. 

Why does he have so many photos with his students in his phone? I don't know why he sent me photos of his high school female students to begin with, it made me so uncomfortable. I am worried for his students. I feel like this man is a serious creep. 

What should I do? He reached out again a few minutes ago and I cant take this anymore. Please, any advice would be so appreciated.",21Aug2019,3
648," Hey guys,

I've  been in contact with a senior retired psychotherapist for the past  couple of months. He is a nice guy and we felt like we could be great  friends. Because he lived somewhere far we didn't get a chance to meet  each other yet but now he's here and we're finally going to meet next  week. Now his birthday is tomorrow but he doesn't know that I'm aware of  that (I found it by going through his friend's profile on Facebook and  that was out of curiosity).

Now my  question is: Should I send a birthday note to him tomorrow or will it  come off as creepy? We are just normal friends and he has a partner.

I  want to send him a birthday note to make him happy. However, I'm afraid  he would think that I'm obsessed with him or something like that.

649,"Okay so I live in a hostel in a single room with two beds. We have both AC and non AC units. Since the beginning I've been living in an AC unit ( which is significantly more expensive) since I'm used to that kind of environment. I had a roommate till last month who recently shifted out.

Now I've gotten a new roommate who's like 3 years my junior ( in the course)
The issue is, before this he was in a non AC unit, and now he's taken an AC unit. It would be fine, I assumed, except he hardly uses the AC. He says he's used to the heat and not used to the cold and doesn't use it much. 

Whenever I get back to my room it's hot. 
If I turn it on, he needs to either turn the fan off or set the temperature at 28( the AC doesn't even cool at that temp.) I like setting it to 25-26. However even that's too cold for him.

On top of that this place is highly humid. Hence I like to keep the AC running at night. This dude turns it off everyday sometime in the middle of the night.


How do I approach this issue?

Hi guys, so I just went to the dentist for the very first time, I am 28 years old (I know) and I got them cleaned up and did an x-ray (was that it? I guess it´s an x-ray), and they advised me that I should pull out one of my wisdom teeth.

Here is my question, should I do it? I mean the tooth doesn´t hurt at the moment, the dentist said it was going to acumulate food there, given the position it´s in, and sure enough, it´s hapening and I keep picking my teeth to get it out.

It is a bit too close to the next one, but I don´t know if that is going to be a problem or if it will finish coming up without hurting me. they scheduled me for september...

The cirgury is 80 euros, and I earn an average of 850 month, so it´s quite a bit of money... should I do it?",21Aug2019,1
656,"
At this fruit stand/truck I work at, every fruit salad comes with a banana on the side. Although the banana comes with it, alot of customers will tell us they don't want their free banana. 

I had an idea to make a donation box where people can put their unwanted banana and tips, then, at the end of the day I could bring the box and use the tip money on fruit for the homeless. 

Background: Im an 18yo student and I work for my grandpa at a fruit salad stand/truck as a cashier in Philadelphia. I usually collect and give over-ripe/slightly bruised bananas to a homeless people on the street. Depending on the day of week I collect about 10 overripe/bruised bananas. I also get alot of custemers who give me tips which I also collect and donate at the end of the day. We dont have a tip jar but I feel like if we did have a tip jar and labeled it ""Tips for homeless"" I would get alot more donations.

Let me know your advice on my plan.

Will this violating any law or rule? 

Is this fair to my grandpa to do? 

Is it unethical to walk up to homeless people and ask if they want donated bananas, and bananas we cant sell?

Should I drop off the fruit at a local homeless shelter or something similar instead?

Any other advice on doing something like this is also appreciated.

Thanks in advance, Sorry fir the many questions but I dont have anyone consult about this idea with and Im still afraid to ask my grandpa. Id just hate to waste all this food especially because of the large homeless population in Philadelphia.",21Aug2019,1

What I’m running into is I get loads of interviews where I get to the last rounds and someone always beats me. They always tell me they really like me but it never turns into anything. Someone always has more experience than me. The thing is these positions are always in the 40 range mark for entry level which is even more discouraging.

One of my closest friends (friend 1) met this girl on a night out, they started talking etc long story short they got together. They we're together for 2 years slowly coming up to they 3rd and recently got a house, about a year ago now me and the girl started talking everyday, every second it was like I new her before no awkwardness nothing and after a  little while we started getting closer and closer. We got so close she start telling things friend 1 would do. I didn't think much of it because i didn't see it for myself, she told me that she felt stuck and could get out of this relationship.

Friend 1 had me and another guy (friend 2) we met online and known for 5+ years now stay around there house for a gaming week (okay we're nerds) That week we didn't really speak unless her friend 1 wasn't around (sounds bad but we didn't mean it like that its just he would kick off on her if we did speak). That week I saw everything and she was right...he forced her to get him things, food, drink, go to the shops etc. We all went for a day out it was a long car journey (about an 1hour 30 mins) me and the girl are sit in the back (friend 1 is one of them people who ""shotguns"" the front seat) when we arrived me and this girl got out to stretch our legs, friend 2 was jump turn his car off and grabbing his things from I boot when friend 1 kicked a football at this girl as hard as he could. She played it off because she's used to doing it, me and a random woman kicked off on friend 1. Everything that day was okay after that. We got home they had an argument over it and why we sat next to each other in the car. We had a group bight out where friend 1 broke up with her for about 5 mins then came running back and threaten to punch her, we kept drinking then he kicked off again saying me and her have be flirting all night (we spoke once) she ran off this time while he threw her phone in a bush. Later that night I'm sleeping in there spare bedroom and she walks in and cuddles me and 30 mins later friend 1 catches us.

ANYWAY!! yes I helped her out of this girl shouldn't be treated that way and it pisses me off when I see it happening, I helped her out of her relationship and helped that back into her feet, stopped her from self harming and suicidally thoughts. Friend 1 stopped talking to me and blocked me on everything.
Me and the girl stay together (sleeping together to, i started getting feelings for her from this) for about 6 months every night her flat or my house, everything was going well she wasn't looking for a relationship and that was fine for me I was going ask her near her birthday but it just felt right. 

Friend 1 started talking to her again and she started talking again I told her I don't like him for what happened and never will it was disguising anyway after a while they met up and agreed to try it again, she promised me everything would be fine and we would still talk and that happened we almost slept together again a week into her relationship. We went to the movies one night all joking around until the finish ended, i saw her check her phone and she didn't talk to me on the way back, started listening to her sad music and wouldn't tell me whats wrong (she used to tell me everything). after 5/6 weeks of them being together she slowly went quite, she would never/still  doesn't message me first and if we did talk it would be me messaging her first and it would/still be 1 word answers or her just ignoring me. We have signs to tell each other that there something wrong without talking and she giving me every one of them signs. I called her out on it she gets annoyed.

So what do I do.
If nothing happens relationship wise I still want to be her close friend (we're promised to always talk and never ever forget about each other ( we have our own saying for it)

I know she has depression and my grandfather just died last week. Even before his death, the slightest things could set her off.

When she gets emotional, I get emotional and really just want to yell at her sometimes to calm down. My question is: How do I deal with her without losing my own temper?

My mom, since a young age, has always had this view of me. She’s always compared me to everyone, even my drugged up convict brother. She would constantly compare me to him. 

She would always bring up how he can drive and I can’t. Mind you, I can’t yet because of the insurance I’m on, but I’ve practiced more than enough with my learners permit. She would mention how he has a job, and how I don’t, which is not the truth because I work for the DOE, I just go to school while I work so I make less than him. His job by the way, is something he’s forced to do because of an arrangement from the jail he’s in. She even compares me to him because I’m not married and has kids. He made it pretty clear how much he doesn’t want to see his kids, but I’m the bad guy. 

On top of comparing me to a man who has shot, jumped, robbed, and drugged people before. She thinks I’m this pathetic man who everyone hates. 

She has this opinion of me that all my friends actually don’t like me and are only with me because they pity me. I force them to be into gaming or anime or things of the like. In her eyes, I’m unworthy of having any friends because I’m such a disgusting human being. 

Just yesterday I was talking to my dad about my trip to Japan and my mom jumps into the conversation upset that I made my friends spend thousands of dollars for a trip they didn’t want to go on. She exploded when I told her that I didn’t put a gun to their head to make them go. 

“They are just as interested as I am, if not more.”

She exploded when I said that and screamed in my face talking about how I’m a terrible friend and person for shoving me interests in their face. 

“Why can you be more like your youngest brother!”

On the subject of my interests, she has quite an opinion on that as well. She thinks all anime is just open and has no issue telling everyone at her job about it. I’ve gone to her job before and quickly was escorted out by security because of it. The people in our congregation understand what I have to deal with for the most part, some though believe her and have ended their friendships with me, my mother believing it was the best for them.

Some would say I was genetically blessed. All the men in my family can grow solid beards. My father, his brothers, my grandfather and so on. This would be fine if I was just a normal dude.

The problem is, is that I'm not. 

I am a crossdresser. I very much enjoy dressing like a woman and prettying myself up with makeup. Its obvious that these two things are very much incompatible.

My family and friends constantly bitch and moan when I shave. If I had a nickle for every time I hear ""you're so much better looking with a beard"", I could buy a private island that I could fuck off to. 

**I have no desire to come out of the closet to them.** This is a part of me that I will keep hidden from my ""vanilla side"" until the day I die. So I can't tell them ""I shave because I want to pass as a woman when I wear lingerie and high heels"".

It seems the only way I could get them to shut up about it is if I find a girlfriend who ""validates my reason for shaving"" to them. But that's a lot easier said than done. Trust me, I'm trying.

I've tried telling them, calmly and rationally, that it is my facial hair and I can do with it as I wish. So if I want to shave, I'll shave. But they still moan/complain/tease me about it. Sometimes I wish I was born without these genes, so I wouldn't ever have to worry about it.

Ever since I was young, I have enjoyed performing, especially dancing. Though there were no proper dance academies near me, I have never stopped learning.

Literally a day after asking about it, my grandfather sends me an image of some specs of a laptop he found, and upon first glance it looked really good. I texted him that, and immediatly he went ahead and bought it. It was clear he wanted to keep what kind of laptop it was a suprise by not showing me anything but the specs, but he left the product code in the link visible, so out of curiosity the next day, I went ahead and looked up what kind of computer it was. Much to my dismay, the computer has mediocre reviews, about 3.2 stars, and dozens of reviews complaining that despite it's good specs, the laptop runs horribly slow, restarts constantly for no reason, has terrible screen resolution and lighting, among other, generally bad things. And this is where my problem lies: do I take the completly free laptop and simply deal with its plethora of issues, or do I tell my grandfather that the computer may not be the best buy and have him return it and look for another one?

The only issue with the whole fiance thing is that we had a big engagment party and the fiance's family already gave the money for the wedding to my parents and so id be messing up so much in terms of money wasted and stuff like that. 

The issue is that me and the other guy are in love and we just don't know what to do. If we get married to each other we would both be disowned by our family and idk if our parents will support us (we both just graduated college and he is going to graduate school). We don't speak each others native language, we don't know about each other's cultures, we don't know about each others food, etc. Id have to move in with him and his family and idk how id be treated by his family since I'm not from their country. Is it worth it? All the trouble, all the hate, all the struggle, will it pay off? Or am I just a young person in love that just doesn't understand what's best for me.",21Aug2019,1

She’s going through some stuff and she tells me she’s talking to a professional about it but this is every time she’s gotten a prescription for it. I’ve been buying her weed religiously (which is putting a huge strain on finances) and try to get her what she wants. I love her but I hate this about her.

723,"My neighbors recently got married and went on a 1 1/2 month honeymoon. They asked me to plant-sit, and even though I warned them I've killed my own cactus they seemed to believe in me. They even gave me some fancy chocolates for my efforts...which I ate the day after they left.

The plant seemed OK until last week, and they're coming back this week. My friend suggested it may be root rot, which is difficult to care for and I have no experience with plants. Additionally, I noticed that if you look at the middle of the plant from above there are small white things crawling around.

I'm not sure what to do at this point. I'm going to buy them some fancy chocolates and offer to reimburse the plant, but should I give them the plant as is with the white things or throw the plant away (and wash the planter)? I feel really bad, but I'm honestly so bad with plants. :(",21Aug2019,1

Well she broke up with her bf then went back to the fwb. Then went to me.

728,"So I was dating my brother’s best friend for a few months. At first, it was amazing. He would schedule dates and always pick me up, and he would make sure I got home safely. He texted me all the time. As time went on, he slowly started distancing himself. He would make last minute plans with me, and want me to drive to his house instead. It would be later in the evening, and we’d make out at the end. He blamed his distancing on anxiety and being super busy, which could be partly true, but he used it as an excuse way too much. Exactly a week ago, he asked me if I was free and if I’d want to hang out. (After not having seen me in two weeks or barely texted me.) I told him yes, and he said we could at 3:00. So 3:30 rolls around and i get a text saying “hey, sorry, stranded on a bike with my cousin. might have to reschedule.” I was furious, obviously. The fact that I was just this option for him. I told him “yeah. Maybe some other time.” As in “no. If I’m not good enough to stick to a plan for, then never again.” He said “I’m sorry” and I didn’t reply nor have I heard from him since. What happened? Why was he so sweet at the beginning? Was I not good enough? He was so gentle with me but I’m sure he really wanted to have sex with me, which I was not willing to. Did he ever like me, or did he just play a game to get what he wanted? Will he ever text me to give a real apology, or explain himself? I know that he likes thrills, and danger. He last relationship ended dramatically, and it seems like that has closed him off emotionally. I overheard my brother on the phone with him, comparing how many matches they got on Tinder. He got 26. Will he ever realize that he missed out on me? Is he even the type to want a normal, caring girl who’s in it for more than just the physical stuff?

730,"sorry Reddit, this may be above your pay-grade but I am lost and need advice

My (f) life-long friend (m) is ill, he is losing his memory and his symptoms are behaving like fast-moving Alzheimers. He's been losing his memory and cognition really fast over the past few months.

There is a long story about our circumstances that I'd like to leave out but the short version is that he's deteriorating fast, his wife is at a breaking point and is unhappy that his friends weren't visiting and calling enough, which I fixed as soon as she told me how grave the situation was (none of us knew how fast this was happening).

She has now in front of him on 3 separate occasions compared him to a vegetable and given horrible descriptions of his situation while he sits and listens, aware of what's being said but unable to remember from one day to the next.  
While I do perfectly understand that it was the situation and frustration talking I don't think this is something he or anyone should hear about themselves, not as a patient, not as a husband and not as a human being. 

I know this hurts him, I could see it during our last visit and while I was trying to encourage him and ask him to do the mental work she saw nothing but darkness and was describing the symptoms and having a conversation about him in front of him, again comparing him to 'a vegetable' and specific vegetables which made me really afraid of how she speaks to him in private and how many other conversations she's had like this in front of him. She speaks of him with so much disrespect and talks in front of him like Cinderella's mom would speak about her unwanted infant stepchild. It's horrible to listen to for me and I can only imagine how he feels.

Even though my friend has slipped into a haze in his mind I could see how her rant about his vegetable state hurt him and he was agreeing with me to the best of his ability that we need to keep a positive outlook and put in all the work we can to slow this down. Heck, even if he is losing his mind he has to believe in his own power of mind, in the doctors and in the treatment, even if it isn't working he needs to feel good instead of listening to fire and brimstone rain about the situation and his spouse rants about how he's now like a vegetable.  Even if we don't have any chance of him getting better and even if he has lost all memory it doesn't help to berate him and list up how he's failing in front of him. 

I tried to be delicate about pushing back, saying we ""shouldn't talk his condition down"" which started a debate of sorts where she was painting his condition extremely black in front of him while I was trying to be polite for his sake with him trying to explain that he understood that we have to be positive... but that triggered her immediately and she totally flipped out and yelled I was being delusional about his situation (which I am not, I just didn't want to have that conversation in front of him) and she said I was disrespectful to her in her own house.  I was trying to be respectful and did not yell at her ""Stop being abusive to my friend you crazy bitch"" like I wanted to, tried to settle the matter and tell her she was misunderstanding my point and that we have to be careful not to talk his condition down (especially to him).

To put it briefly she took my attempts the absolutely worst way, yelled I was disrespecting her in her own house and that I should get the hell out. I tried to talk her down but she was furious and loud so I left. My sick friend then sent me a message an apologized for her actions, the longest and most comprehensive message I've gotten from him in weeks. 

I apologized to her via messages but she maintains that I disrespected her in her own house and that she won't respond to me again. That led me to sending her a message saying that I understood that she was under a lot of pressure and I appreciated everything she's doing for him but I did not think it was acceptable, nor something she would like to look back on, that she's comparing him to vegetables like that. 

She did not respond to that but called his sibling and covered her bases, saying this only happened that time and she shouldn't have said it but I disrespected her which is clearly a big issue in her culture (she comes from a culture where verbal and physical abuse are unfortunately more common). But that wasn't the first or the second time, that was the third and ugliest time. I know she has serious problems admitting that she's wrong and was regularly verbally abusive towards him before he got sick but now he can't defend himself so I'm really worried.

While he and I are cool and exchanged friendly 'I love yous' he doesn't remember anything from one day to the next. I asked him if I could come later and visit and go for a walk with him and he said yes, I messaged him again today and said if it was OK for me to come tomorrow and he said good. Then I sent her a message telling her that I had spoken to him and wanted to go for a walk and she replied curtly and said they were busy.

I heard from a mutual friend that visited today that she was calm and treated our friend nicely but I fear that she is blocking me from seeing my friend. She is the only caretaker at the moment and she can control all access to him. And now she's freezing me out.

I don't think I was out of bounds and frankly I think I stood up for my friend at a critical point and probably managed to stop her from abusing him further (at least in front of other people) but I don't know what I can do more than gravel against my better judgment in order to stay in my friends life for what is very much his last year.

Hey, so, this is a Story that stretches over nearly a year now. Please hang in there while Reading this   It's set in October 2018 and is still going on. I've fallen in love with my best friend, who lives, well ... 580 KM away from me (\~360,395 Miles) I've been there for her when she moved out cause Living with her Abusive father was too much for her. I sacrificed my time, my sleep and a Higher education for her.  
     
Don't get me wrong, I didn't expect her to become my GF and I was in no way entitled to her Love and affection.     


I told her that I was in love, even tho I knew she was (and still is) in a relationship (What a fucking dick move by me) I was with her through day and night regardless tho, cause that's what friends are for. she told me everything, including things like how her Boyfriend occasionally rips his Condom off and Has sex with her, without it. I helped her and tried to tell her that the relationship is toxic, she didn't listen so I helped her fix it. she is still in the same Relationship and happy now.    


Well, let's get to the actual story : it's October 2018 Depression has been hitting me like a truck, and I had no one to turn to other than her, I told my parents, they didn't give a single Fuck, I told my sister, she told me that she was concerned but that it probably wasn't Depression. she was the only one who'd listen so I told her everything, about how I didn't want to be alive anymore, how Life is painful and not Rewarding, how Everyone hates me. the usual Depressed shit you know. and she just told me that 'It's probably better to cut all Ties then'  The day after I was second away from jumping in front of a train but didn't and I still don't know why I hesitated.    
she ignored me for months, didn't talk to me, didn't Answer me just radio silence, I was out of Friends and Options I attempted suicide another 4 times, failing every single time    
a few days ago I messaged her, about how things have been going, about Therapy that I started and about being sorry for putting all this on her. We've been talking again now and again, but I still can't get over it, I just wanted things to be back to normal. I can't let go of the person she used to be, now she's just toxic, swearing all the time and I don't know what to do. I Miss the late nights talking to her, I miss the time where I was someone to someone now I'm just there to talk to if she needs me and to be pushed aside when she doesn't    
I just miss the person I fell in love with and I can't get over her not being here anymore, I've been getting Depressed again, my mood has gotten worse and I've been thinking about ending my life over and over again.",21Aug2019,1

I am doing this master cause it practical and I am interested in programming. I want to get a Ph.D. cause I have always been told I am smart enough to get one and as I struggle with classes I want to prove that to myself. My parents set aside money for college and I dual-enrolled to save so I have no debt and still have extra cash, but eventually, that money is going to run out.

I am autistic with a side order of ADHD and depression and still live with my mother no matter how much I want to have time away from her. I can not drive due to my increased anxiety and live somewhere where there is no public transport, trapping me in my home unless I bike in 80 to 80 degrees weather or convince someone to drop me off somewhere. I enjoy and like to think I am good with writing and cosplay when I try, while doodling not so well for myself and take care of pets better than I take care of myself. Not that that is saying much. 

I am mostly lost though, I got an accounting degree knowing it was practical and not if I could handle the stress and workload. I feel like I learned nothing and that I am unprepared to get an accounting job.

I am learning coding with no idea what I want to do with it, but when people ask I can come up with an answer cause I don't want to admit I am unsure. It's easier and more impressive to say ""video games"", ""Ai"" or ""Diagnostic programs disguised as video games for kid""  than ""I have no idea.""

I love psychology, but would never want to help someone through their own issues and could never empathize. However, could I really handle the stress of a researcher?

I found out it would take me a year to be a mortician and I would not have to deal with living people. I use to want to be like Bones from TV, until I learned how much me and biology can mix without me getting paranoid.  Can't learn biology if learning about how fragile you increase your already terrible anxiety.  But if I am so smart why would I do a job that only uses a year of education?

&amp;#x200B;

 So when I was very young my aunt, that has downs syndrome, molested me. I hated her for it and would cry and call her a monster and my other aunts hated me for doing that. They didn't see it as a big deal and tried to force me to get over it. I couldn't because I was a traumatized child. I clung to my mom because I loved her but I don't think she has even helped me. I found out that the one friend I made in elementary school was my friend because my aunt literally told the people in my town that I raped my baby sister and ""couldn't remember doing it"" She did this because I ""wouldn't get over"" the fact that my aunt with downs syndrome molested me and i'm pretty sure it gave me ptsd. So basically alot of my social interactions through childhood my aunt has tried to control and if she couldn't control she made sure they thought I was a rapist, and I'm a guy. I wasn't even aware that everyone thought this of me, I've been very alone and very isolated my entire life and it has always been impossible to make friends. I just thought people were mean and got used to being very alone and you just don't realize that people don't like you when no one ever has. I found out all of this because I recently tried to kill myself and had to get hundreds of sutures in my arms. It finally came out because yeah I'm not fine obviously and people finally cared enough to get the truth out of my family. I think my aunt lied to my mom and said that she saw me do it and even if people did know I was molested they didn't care because my aunt said I raped my sister. My entire life and everything I have ever worked for has been ruined by my terrible family and girls I went to school with who thought I raped my sister. I went to community college and girls from high school followed me there and talked a bunch of trash and I couldn't make any friends. I tried to volunteer and just nothing ever works out and I've been pretty much oblivious because I have never really had any friends and can't even really recognize when people don't like me and can barely carry on a conversation. I'm in my 20s and I just have nothing because literally everything that could be meaningful people made sure I didn't have. I'm a victim of childhood sex abuse and people have stalked me everywhere I go and call me a child molester and rapist. I don't have a single misdemeanor or felony on my record and they have just made shit up. People cried when they found out and I saw them and it doesn't matter because they still fucked up my whole life and I have no relationships with anyone. My little sister and I were close and she was my friend and I don't even want to be around her anymore and I am so mad that people would accuse me of that when she is my sister and I would protect her and they could feel so entitled to me and my life, and it was all just a fucking game to them. People don't even want to tell me about it because they think I might kill people. My whole life feels like the end of 1984 where the two people that were in love don't look at each other and thats how I feel around everyone. My grandfather had a bunch of money like a couple hundred thousand and I think thats part of the reason why my family did this, also the aunt that did it everyone loves and feels sorry for so they don't want people to know shes a child molestor. I want to take my grandfathers money and burn it, he died last year and they split it up between my mom and her sisters, how can I get any recourse for what happened to me?

Basically yesterday I noticed that when I flushed the toilet there was clear water coming out the bottom onto the floor. I say clear because, like, it wasn’t the contents of what I was flushing that was coming out hahah

And then just now when I switched on the tap, no water came out even though it worked a couple hours ago. And then I checked the shower, also suddenly not working. 

I’m terrified it’s because I flushed tampons down the toilet and they blocked something or other. I don’t usually flush them only there was no bin in the bathroom so I didn’t know what else to do with them. 

I just don’t know what to do. If I could I would wait until I leave but that’s in two days and obviously I can’t just not shower or go to the toilet or use the tap for two days.

However, I find myself in a very agonising and frustrating situation at the moment; because I got the job during the summer, I had lots of free time to work 6 days a week, 7-8 hours per day. Where I work at there's only two employees; my boss and I. There used to be another girl but she got fired early in the first month I was there, so half the responsability of the business fell in my hands. My boss is an old lady and can't work alone so I have to help her with everything, that includes taking over the front desk, carrying the business phone with me at all times (even after I close and go home) so I can make appointments, bathing/grooming the animals, cleaning the place, inventory, opening and closing, etc. 

I can do all these things because I have time, but now that I'm going back to uni things are getting frustrating. A couple of weeks ago I told my boss that I can't work the 6 days, 7-8 hours per day schedule that I have because I'm going to school and my school schedule greatly crashes with my work schedule. She got mad at me and gave me a list of reasons why I can't leave her by herself. I promised I would try to change my classes but it's been days and I can't seem to make things work. I can't find classes that allow me to keep my work schedule and my boss won't let me work less hours. Everytime I propose something she refuses and bombards me with excuses/reasons why it won't work. Recently she's taken to guilt me into dropping out of two of my classes that collide with my work schedule (they start and end around the same time I go to work). She says to try it one semester, that it won't affect me. She says that she's praying every day that I can keep going to work, that she just had an accident and can't move much, that she's really happy with me and will miss me terribly if I go, etc. I told her that she needs to hire another person so they can help out but she refuses. She's not happy with any option or solution that I give her. It's making me horribly sad because my boss is essentially forcing me to choose between my job and my education. And I could leave but I feel so bad for my boss. She fractured one of her legs a couple of months ago and so she can't stand for too long or do much physical work and I understand that working with animals isn't exactly easy to do by yourself, but at the same time I can't and won't drop out of my classes just because she refuses to hire another person. 

I'm running out of time to register for my classes (school starts next week) and I really have no idea what to do. I'm desperate. Any advice would be much appreciated.",21Aug2019,5
753,"So I'm a High School student going into senior year, and throughout this summer I've been job hunting. I applied to a lot of the big stores near me, but one place I really want to work at is a local bookstore. I handed my resume in person a few weeks ago, and I was told to contact the store owner ""within a few days"", so I did just that. However, each time I called they weren't there. I made sure to space out my calls (3 in total) so I wouldn't seem annoying. One call, I was told that the owner would be in the next day. Nope. The person I spoke to then gave me the owners email, but that was a dead end as well. So yesterday, I decided to go to the store in person to speak with the owner, and I finally met them. But then the owner told me that they never even *looked* at my resume. They then told me that they would consider hiring me, but I would have to work 2 weeks unpaid like an ""internship"" to see if I would be ""a match with them"". I consulted my dad and he said that its fine, but my uncle is telling me that it isn't. So I was just wondering, is this normal? If I do get a call back should I take it? 

(Sorry if this question seems kind of dumb, but I really don't know what to do right now lol)

TLDR; The owner of a bookstore wants me to work 2 weeks unpaid to see how I perform, is this normal?",21Aug2019,1
754,"Hi, so this year I'm starting college at a technical school that's quite a ways away from my house, and yesterday was my first day. I previously figured out my commute route and for most of it I just take the bus or train to get there, but there are a couple portions where I have to ride my bike. I live in Utah so it's broiling hot most of the time and between riding my bike and waiting outside I get pretty sweaty. Also they don't have showers there.

Beforehand I always put on deodorant and shower, etc, but is there anything y'all can think of that would help? I get there 30 minutes prior to class so I can eat my dinner so I have time afterwards to go to the bathroom and clean up. Any advice is much appreciated! :)",21Aug2019,2

In this class we get a break and we talked together as we went to the bathroom. We were bumping into each other and I made her laugh😊 she also tends to address me by my full name, rather than my shorthand version. Are these signs? Or are they nothing?

756,"Sorry in advance, this is a bit of a long one.

I am the older brother in a family of four. My parents have had an extremely rough marriage. My father used to be physically abusive until he beat my mom up about 10 years ago and we called the cops on him. He went to jail, but I guess my mom didn't press charges, since he got out in only a couple days (I still don't know too many of the details regarding the aftermath as my mother hasn't been very open regarding this). In that time, we stayed at my moms friends place, and then moved to a different country for 3 years, away from my father. However, we eventually moved back in with him. He hasn't escalated his violent behavior since, but remains verbally abusive. My little brother, who is 13 now, was slow to start talking and has been doing very poorly in school, but my father has been unwilling to sign him up for a special curriculum in which he would receive special attention and possibly get the help he needs to be  successful, despite the insistence of his teachers and my mother. I often find myself getting extremely frustrated at my brother when he can't do something, that is otherwise inconsequential, right. He still has trouble wiping himself off in the toilet, for example, and is very absentminded regarding most things.

My maternal grandfather, who we lived with when we were away from my father, just had a stroke a month ago, and my mother left to visit him. She also received news before she got on her flight that one of her uncles had died in an accident. She got back a few days ago, but I can imagine that she isn't in the best state of mind right now. She definitely seems depressed and is really beating herself up over small mistakes she makes in day to day life. My father has also been constantly berating her for these mistakes, disregarding her state of mind. She says that she wants to go back to her parents and live with them on some days, and other days she says she wishes she could just die. 

I can empathize with her, but I believe the problem lies with her relationship with my father. I think a divorce is the best option for all parties here and have thought so for a long time, but my mother is not interested in entertaining the idea. My maternal grandfather had selected my father as a candidate (my parents have an arranged marriage) and my mother wants to honor his decision. I am extremely frustrated by this, because I think it's naive and that my brother is suffering as well because of this, since both of my parents are attempting to instill opposing ideologies in him. He's already having enough trouble as it is, and the hostile environment at home is not helpful. 

It should come as no surprise that I genuinely despise my father as well, since he is the root of most of this, and whatever he has done to my mother, he has done to me, albeit to a lesser extent. 

I hate staying with my family so much, but it's killing me to see my mother and brother floundering like this. I help figuring out what to do. I don't have any money, a car, or a job. I'm still in college, and I'm still financially dependent on my father.

Please feel free to ask any clarifying questions you may have.",21Aug2019,1
757,"I work and go to school and the cheapest rent where I live would take my entire monthly income and no housing agency will take me because of the bed bug infestation.


It’s in the garage and my mother has been keeping this infestation a secret for a month until it got serious. It’s completely taken over the garage and they’re crawling everywhere.


Mom says it’s “quarantined” because she put down some essential oils on the floor but then later she said that she saw some past the barrier she put. 


She keeps going in and out of there to do laundry and keeps leaving the door wide open insisting they “won’t spread throughout the rest of the house because she’s super careful”


I try to explain to her that when she leaves the door open and goes in and out of there it gives me anxiety but she still says it’s fine and not to worry.


I keep begging and begging her to get pest control over here and even offered to pay for it but she keeps saying she “needs time” and “to wait”



I can’t even sleep properly at night anymore because I’m constantly afraid of a bed bug biting me in my sleep. I just want to get out of here or get rid of these disgusting creatures!



Mother said she would pay me back once she’s sold she house but she’s already borrowed thousands of dollars to re do her bathroom and get rid of mold.


I hardly ever spent any money on the money I have saved up and here she is spending thousands of it on this stupid bed bug house...


After the bed bugs are clear she will owe me $10,000 and I have no idea when she will be paying me back because I have no idea when she’ll sell the place... I really wish I would have just used that money towards moving out but I can’t anymore 



I feel so stuck here. I can’t afford to live on my own, I have no friends so I can’t find a roommate I can trust nor can I have access to any housing services due to the bed bug infestation.



I don’t want her borrow any more money from me but if I don’t pay then she won’t hire an exterminator. She doesn’t have a job so she can’t afford to pay and I can’t get the exterminator to come and take care of things because she owns the house and is head of the house hold...



I don’t want everything I own to get ruined... I don’t want to be covered in bites, I don’t want to have little insects crawling all over me at night.



I just want out but I can’t get out. I CANT. I don’t know what to do.
If I want to live on my own I’d have to quit school and get rid of my dog because I would be working so much I wouldn’t be able to take care of him.


He’s an elderly dog that I’ve had since I was 10 and I just cannot get rid of him. I love him. I can’t lose my dog over some stupid bugs!

762,"I need some insight…I’ve already talked to my advisor at the beginning of this summer and I will touch base with her in the middle of this coming fall semester. She’s been helping me plan my college career by semester, because it’s not really easy planning it 2-3 years ahead. Sorry it’s going to be long. I’ve had all of these thoughts in my head since this year started.

Some background…I’ve been in college for roughly 3.5, almost 4 years. I should have graduated already (I’m super pissed at myself for this) but I changed my major like, 3 times and withdrew and failed a bunch. I messed up SO MUCH in the past 3-4 years. I grew up in poverty and really had no role models and battled depression and addiction. I was just so desperate to get out of poverty and my parents’ overbearing hold and having to deal with my mental illnesses. LUCKILY, I didn’t incurred any debt, except since last year when I finally settled on the major that I should have went with since the beginning. So now I have about $7k in debt which I’m trying to get rid of asap because those loans are no joke. Everyone told me my major wouldn’t make money so I didn’t pursue it. They’d tell me how their brother couldn’t find a job in that field, etc etc. Back then, it scared me and I didn’t know what I could do with my major but now I do. People still to this day tell me those scary stories of someone they know in that field who couldn’t find a job. There’s been many times I’ve cried and broke down and begged my parents to let me drop out because I just didn’t want to go to college anymore and just wanted to make money. It didn’t matter what, as long as I had income. I previously had an easy full-time warehouse job making $2,000 a month while going to school full-time too and it was manageable because my coursework wasn’t that hard (I was only doing generals at the time). Recently I’ve been thinking about going back to that job, but my major now requires a lot of time outside of class and I really enjoy it, even though it can be frustrating. This past spring semester was the first time ever I’ve made straight A’s since I was in middle school and I’ve been really proud of myself and I just really like going to college. I estimate that I’ll be graduating by Fall 2022. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, the question is, should I be a part-time or full-time student next year? I’ve already completed my generals. My future semester courses won’t reach the full-time credit load. Almost all of my tuition is covered if I’m a full-time student. So, I can take classes for fun or I can take on a minor (literally only 3-4 classes if my core classes count towards the minor. I plan on talking to my advisor about this). I think the minor and some of the classes that I find fun will be helpful but it’s not necessary. Right now, I am a full-time student with two part-time jobs making \~$800/month. I was thinking of just continuing to be a full-time student and try to start a few side businesses with the little money I have. If I’m a part-time student next year, I’ll probably barely have much time like I do now and I’ll most likely make \~$1500, $2k if I'm lucky. I’m just torn because I really want to move out with my younger brothers (19 &amp; 17) because we live in such nasty living conditions…My parents are getting older and going batshit crazy. Our house is breaking down and filthy. My parents are hoarders, they don’t bother to spend any money on fixing the house, and we’ve been having a rodent and pest infestation for years. I feel like my only safe space is my room.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan after college is to be a front end developer and do UI work. I know of ways to make money on the side (gigs, freelance, starting small niche businesses), but I’m just scared of it not working and also because I don’t really have the funds for it so starting the businesses that I want will be slow. I’m also just scared of not securing a a good enough paying job after I graduate. These what-if’s haunt me a lot. I don’t even really have much experience under my belt, but I’m planning on working on those skills. It’s just hard pushing myself to get started.",21Aug2019,1

771,"So pretty much only my friends know this but, I’m pretty convinced I have another sister who is almost exactly a year younger than me. 

   Before I start my suspicious I should probably mention that my parents are divorced and my dad says secrets when he’s drunk. He also has three kids from his first marriage (2 girls, 1 boy) and they are much older. 

  So anyways. I was at my dads Easter of 2019 when it first caught my attention. He was pretty fucking drunk and He was sitting on his recliner. I heard his phone ding and he opened it right away and said “awe look at your sister”. Now when he said that, I looked up expecting one of my older sisters, but it was in fact a girl I’ve never seen before. I was pretty annoyed from a previous conversation earlier and cringed and said “that’s not my sister”. He started to become hostile and was like “oh, well, of course it’s not” and then put his phone in his pocket and watched tv. Weirded out but still annoyed from earlier, I let it go. 

 About a week later I started thinking about that incident and remembered what I saw on his laptop when I was about 15 (I’m 17 now)

  So what happened was, i was playing around on his laptop trying to find pictures of me when I was little and I found random elementary school photos of this girl who was definitely not me. I was trying to figure out for hours what it could be but in denial of it being anything weird or bad, I decided it was for a nursing paper when he went to nursing school a couple years ago. So I let it go. 

  All of this didn’t officially come together in my head until one of my best friends said that she just found out she has another brother who’s a year younger than her and was a product of her dads affair. That’s when it hit me. I told her about the whole Easter and  computer thing and she said that it was really weird and that I should ask him about it. 

  Long story short, I never did, buuut

  Two weeks ago, my dad was talking about this woman he was texting who he considers one of his best friends from where him, my mom, and I use to live and that she has a daughter who is practically my sister and that we grew up together without ever knowing. And then he said “but don’t worry, she’s not acccctuallly your sister”. Everytime he says it, it sounds more suspicious. 

 Now I could’ve let that all go, but 

1.) She sends him photos of her daughter, even though to my knowledge he’s never met the girl

2.) No one calls someone your sister unless the girl and you are best friends and have actually met, or you’re actually sisters 

 Anyways that night I tried to find the woman and couldn’t and got extremely frustrated. Then around three days ago, I found the woman and found out she has one daughter (who coincidentally doesn’t have a father) and I found the daughters Facebook. Oh my god do we look similar. Same cheekbones, hair color, eyebrow shape, and jawline. It’s almost to freaky if this isn’t true.  We also have the same music taste and when I looked through her music playlist she posted, it was almost identical to mine. 

 I need answers now. If this girl is my sister, than that means my father cheated on my mom two years into their marriage and I know for a fact my mom doesn’t know and idk how I would tell her if it is true. Also I have no clue how to approach him about.",21Aug2019,1

773,"So... I had a very dramatic teenagehood. Think law being involved several times and choatic lifestyle and responsibilities then having to deal mostly alone. I wasn't physically harmed though, and nothing traumatic. I still ended up with appetite problems and that lead to me having anaemia for most of my teenagehood years, and it being at extreme levels at the end before being back to mild.

Anyway, with that out, ever since the stress of studies years ago (right around the time I began treatment for extreme anemia), there has been white noise inside my head, as in me having not much thought going through my head (which never happened before unless at a writer's block) and trying to think and create is becoming increasingly exhausting. The front part of my head feels... spongy? I have been writing the last part off to me worrying too much.

Other than that, my linguistic abilities are suffering. I have forgotten the spelling of the words that I use most as a writer, some of which I re-learned. I keep forgetting my vocabulary in all of the languages that I speak, and sometimes I am thinking of a word but something totally different comes out of my mouth. I find chatting with people increasingly more difficult as, since my head has nothing in it anymore, I have nothing to talk about. 

I have become much more forgetful. My short memory has gone bad (I still can function simi-normally, but I tend to freeze mid-action every once in a while forgetting where I am, but I tend to figure it out) and my long term memory kinda followed. I have been telling myself that I am just clumsy but this is kinda a big deal so I just can't get it out of my mind. I am worried also because I am on auto-pilot 70% of the day, as in I am not 100% aware of what I am doing and even trying is tough. I tend to often get lost because of this. I don't drive anything either anymore (not even a bike).

Then there's the fact that my emotions are turned off for the most part. Like, I act like I am feeling something, but I don't feel it. I smile when I see someone I know, but I'm indifferent. I have been blaming this on getting older but I have no idea.


The crazy part is that I am a young adult, not even in my 30's yet. I was told by a councillor that I need therapy and I am suffering from anxiety. I feel that is hard to believe because I am not in connection to my emotions. But at the same time they are someone with a degree, I can't know better than them. Also, my family doesn't believe in therapy and I am yet to find a job, so if I were to go I'd need their support but I am not sure if I were to mention it it would go well at all. Do I really need help? If so, what kind of help do I most likely need? Is there a way around letting my family know? Did you have something similar?

So I live on the bottom floor of an apartment building. When I emptied the trash the other day, I was hit with a powerful mustard odor coming from the trash can. I don't eat mustard and never have any around. It took me back a bit. I took it out and thought nothing of it, because, well, it's trash and it's not supposed to smell good. 

The next day, I came home from work and I was hit with a similar odor, but this time slightly more sulphuric (more like rotten eggs mixed in). I looked around the apartment, including opening the dishwasher, which I never use. Sure enough, there was a pool of disgusting looking standing water on the bottom which smelled very much like rotten eggs. All this despite that taking out the trash fixed the smell problem the day before. Weird, right? Well, I cleaned the dishwasher and ran it a few times. I think the problem came from my garbage disposal being broken and getting backed up... I know the two are connected somehow. It got so bad that it started to leech out of the cracks onto the floor. So I got it fixed, but I never use the dishwasher so I never noticed the water in there.

Anyway, the problem was solved for a few days. No smell at all. But then today, upon coming home from work, the smell hit me worse than anything. I immediately checked the dishwasher, which seemed perfectly clean. 

Does anyone know where this smell might be coming from? Did some of that backed up moldy water stay in the pipes and come back with a vengance? Please help if you can, I can't imaging what impact breathing these odors in must be having on my health, but I've been getting sick a lot lately",21Aug2019,1

778,"So I know the title sounds bad let me explain some back story. I met this dude I high school, we were probably around 14-15 at the time. We hung out a bunch through out high school and when he graduated he left for college. Now this guy never matured, like he still acted like he did when he was 15 last time I hung out with him (maybe 2 years ago). After that I decided I didn't want anything to really do with him anymore. Here's some examples of what I'm talking about:

This guy has sent my 3 different full length essays as to why the empire in star wars are the good guys (I don't give a shit about this in any way shape or form and have told him this)

He's sent me an essay he wrote about how eating humans is actually good for you and better than any other kind of meat, all the science around it being bad is bullshit and he's going to try it some day.

He got a lung infection and was coughing up blood so he sent everyone pictures of his bloody napkins and said it doesn't hurt. Pretty much something straight out of r/imverybadass

He's super creepy towards women, he's asked one of my best friends to marry him multiple times. Constantly tried to convince her to leave he boyfriend of 6 years for him, tells her all the time how much happier she'd be with him. Apparently right now he's working on a crown of bear claws for her. He regularly ignores boundaries that get set, not even unspoken boundries but clearly communicated and outlined ones.

He always has a new mental illness, one day he's bi polar the next he's schizophrenic then it's just depression then it's multiple personalities. I don't believe any of this becuase for example his proof for his schizophrenia is that he will sometime randomly laugh out loud at a funny joke the voice made. It's disrespectful and demeaning to people with actually mental health issues. 

There's a ton more but it's just too much to list. He just hasn't changed and has actually expressed the he doesn't want to change, he's perfect the way he is. It's too much for me. So now to present day and the ghosting. Let me just say I hate ghosting and really wrestled with the idea of doing it for months. I tired to just flat out tell him all this but he thought it was a joke. Then I tired to just barely engage all my texts to him become a basic ""okay"" or ""cool"". Eventually I just stopped responding. Last time I sent a text back was March 2018. I still get messages from this guy every now and then, he just can't take the hint. But it was fine because as far as he knows maybe I had to change my number and lost all my contacts. But this morning I wake up to a friend request of Facebook from him. I asked my friend about it, the one he wants to marry, and he's claiming he accidentally made one so how he's just adding everybody. I don't know if I should accept it. If I do it'll open the flood gates and if I don't he'll know for sure I'm just ghosting him becuase my account is active I do use it to message people and post stuff for some of my family. So what do I do here?

I kept giving hints about what I did but they STILL didn't notice, as this went on for about an hour they were starting to kick off at me so I told them what I did and all it did was make everything worse so I said ""Are you guys actually so dumb that you never noticed"" And ik I shouldn't have said that but then they said ""God why am I even friends with you"" And I just said ""I don't need friends anyway"" And left the server but they kept purposely getting everyone against me irl and online and I was hoping someone could tell me how I can stop this because I didn't mean to cause so much drama, I would really appreciate your advice, thank you",21Aug2019,1

I did one layer of a plaster like acrylic paint, while it was wet I used graphite pencils to add words and give my piece some texture.

782,"Hi. It's a long story. 

We were together for almost 3 years. We met here in my country, and we decided to do LDR after he left 6 months later. I travelled abroad to study in his current home country, which strengthened our relationship, for about a year (2016-2017). I've always wanted to go study abroad in that country, but him being there pushed me to really save up funding for the trip. After I came back, he visited his family and me 4 months later. He said he would come back again in the summer (summer 2018), but that didn't happen as a result of health issues and well it led to a break up talk... 

My LDR ex and I broke up on mutual terms almost 1.5 years ago (early 2018, I brought it up after hearing about his health issues, he said the decision was mine to make, I took about a week to contemplate, we both agreed it was a right choice even though it was tough, and being together may have been tough as well). Reason being is that I was in school and wasn't sure if I wanted to keep being in a LDR with no end date, and he wasn't sure how long he was planning on staying in his current home country (he originally stated anywhere from 3-5 years, for career purposes). He said the next time he would visit me would be in about a year (winter 2019) so, which I felt was too long to wait. I didn't want to break up but I felt like we need to if we didn't know when or where we would end up together, and I was getting tired of not knowing where this relationship was going. I also didn't want to hold myself back from applying to different career-related/major-related opportunities which wouldn't have happened if I just focused on saving up money to see him again. Additionally, I felt like I wouldn't be happy being the one to make a permanent move since I wouldn't get a job over there related to my career interests (the most common job for expats/foreigners is English teacher) and I would have a hard time making friends outside of my ex and his social circle, perhaps. Also it's pretty damn tough seeing someone so infrequently... even when I was in his home country it was a LDR, but it was just a 2-3 hour bus or train ride. I usually would visit him.

He understood my thinking and encouraged me to focus on myself. It was a very heavy Skype session, it included a lot of crying on my part and reflection. I told him we should do NC for a while but that we would contact each other in case there was an emergency. I was also going through other shit with school and family which contributed to me feeling down. Through therapy, however, I learned that I may have been the one who made the RLS a higher priority. This also included a lot of psychoanalysis of deeply rooted issues and insecurities related to other things, such as my dysfunctional family. I've went over the pros and cons of the relationship, and I am still feeling stuck. Maybe I cling more to the projected partner image than who he was and what the RLS entailed. 

Anyways, this has been a rather rough break up on us both. I did grow a lot and found that when I was feeling my best and investing in my life, I felt great and secure and I knew that I'll be fine without him, even though I do love him a lot still. I even met some other people that I ended up taking a liking to, but I haven't seriously dated around. I did realize I have different standards now, and that I do feel less constrained as a result of the breakup. I have the choice to date others and to explore my sexuality as well... but unfortunately I had one or two incidents that turned me off to dating overall. As a result I realized I don't like to date around to just distract myself from the break up pain. In addition, I ended up traveling to try out an opportunity related to my career interests and to visit a friend in another country, and I just finished school.

Since the break up, however, he would be making drunk phone calls and reaching out to me or I would miss his call and he wouldn't respond back when I asked what was up. I reached out maybe twice directly in the early stage of the breakup because I was so miserable. I did answer one of the phone calls in the fall, and we ended up having a messy disagreement (he said something that hurt me, but apologized later). After some time of not talking again (we wished each other holiday greetings and I got another missed call from him while I was traveling in the beginning of this year), I called him and asked for friendship, thinking that I would rather have him as a friend in my life than nothing at all. But I realized later I couldn't just be friends since I still am in love with him, so I broke it off with him and gave a speech explaining my choice and explaining how angry or confused I would feel whenever he would reach out to me non-sober, because I kept it inside. I told him to not contact me unless his family or himself were greatly sick. When I asked if he had anything to say, he said he had a lot to say but he will say it perhaps at another time if there is another time... we haven't talked since (so 3.5 months). 

I have stalked his social media before as well and he seems to be seeing other people. I know it's unhealthy of me, but I guess I am obsessed with knowing what he's up to. I've been trying to cut down, and been focusing more on other things in my life, but fuck.

I know what you're thinking: this hasn't been consistent NC at all. 

I reached out to his mom (we're still friends and she has helped me and we also talk about other things) recently and she informed me he was in town for this month. Right now is the last week he'll be here. I have been contemplating whether or not I should just listen to my gut and reach out to him to meet up. I haven't seen him in since the very beginning of 2018. I know that I don't expect a RLS (relationship), and little by little I've been realizing that his dating life shouldn't affect me as much, and that in the end I'm the one who needs to invest in myself more no matter what. I still love him, but I don't know if he would wanna meet up because I get that things might be awkward. I just miss him, his friendship... and the way things ended just sucks. I also feel like meeting him would bring me to face with reality. There's been some cons in the RLS, and I know I don't want to put up with it in my next RLS... but I wonder, damn that's a shit ton of emotions to deal with if I may see him IRL. But I also feel detached at the same time. And yea I do have friends but I get lonely. And I don't want to be selfish. So, what do I do? Because we only have one life, one chance. What if he dies on the plane ride back to his current home country?",21Aug2019,0
783,"
IIn high school I didn't have much friends. Basically i was a fucking shutin, I would rarely see anyone outside of school (maybe like once every 2 months). This was because i was socially anxious, had low self-esteem, and didn't want to approach anybody to hangout. I also screwed myself up because i didnt join any clubs or sports cuz i never thought i was good enough. While everyone else my age was going out to parties, doing fun teenage shit, and experiencing things i was sitting at home wasting my time playing video games and watching youtube videos. Back then I would walk past a group of kids my age and feel anxious/nervous and be afraid that they were judging me. I would get sweaty af and look nervous too. I would only be comfortable around a select few group of ppl and outside of it the anxiety would show especially around girls. Since then (about 1 year, im in college now) i have decided to improve myself. I started hitting the gym, quit playing video games, and tried to go out more. Ive also tried figuring out how to stop my anxiety by both taking medication and pushing myself more when i feel anxious. Even nowadays though i still get nervous around girls and certain situations. I see so many guys my age hanging out with girls easy and doing crazy shit while i lag behind. I cant even imagine myself doing what they do. I still get the sweats, nervous ook, and awkwardness when I talk to girls and people that im uncomfortable with albeit less than the years before. My question is: how the hell can i solve this issue? Do i just go out more and embarass myself with ppl and it eventually goes away? Or should i take meds to reduce the anxiety? Did any of you have the same issue as me? My anxieties and fears hinder my life so much. I cant enjoy it the way other people can even with all the self improvement.",21Aug2019,1

793,"yyyyyyyyep, I'm gonna have to go ahead and ask the internet's help on this one.

still living with family because of reasons, moved into a slightly smaller apartment recently, and I've been asked not to flush the toilet in the middle of the night anymore because it wakes people up.

unfortunately that's how I deal with cum after masturbating. toilet paper, flush, go to bed. plus the middle of the night is the most convenient time for me to do it.

I switched to paper towels instead and figured I'd just throw them in the garbage bin in the bathroom before passing out for the night.

I happened to wake up to pee at like 4 in the morning and noticed the bathroom smelled like jizz. I dunno if that's just what happens when you utilize a cum dumpster, or if maybe it's just hot here in the summer and it caused the stuff to start smelling more than usual, but it's embarrassing and gross.

I replaced the bag in the garbage bin, Lysol'ed the place, went back to bed.

for those of you who toss cum in the dumpster, what masks the smell? is there anything cheap I can wrap the paper towels in that'll keep it from smelling? I was thinking of ziploc bags, one bag per jack session, but I'll have to figure out how that works out money-wise if that's the direction I go. I dunno if ziploc bags will mask the smell and that might be a bit pricey in the long run actually

799,"Throwaway for obv reasons. So a lot has happened these last few months and I need some advice: I’m no longer friends with a former best friend, and I was wondering if anyone had advice on how to deal with it going forward. I’m going to be as unbiased as I can.

She and I got close very quick but after her ex dumped her (they’re very toxic) she kind of got a bit crazy.. she found out he hooked up with some girl and went batshit crazy. Like constantly stalking her and making fun of her photos. She and her ex eventually made up and they started seeing each other again, she told him they were monogamous and wouldn’t let him speak to other people.. meanwhile she was seeing and sleeping with someone on the side. She lied and manipulate

My relationship got very strained with her after she wouldn’t stop bringing this up even though I asked her to stop repeatedly talking about this guy, and I told her a few times that I disagreed with what she was doing and that she shouldn’t lead him on/be cheating on him. The final straw was when I got into a relationship and she kept trying to sabotage it.. and by that I mean telling my business to all her friends. It was really upsetting because I never insulted her boyfriend and tried to tell her nicely to do the right thing but she always talked about my business, and made several lies to her friends, including making fun of him cause he “looks like a school shooter” and saying he’s abusive to me. 

I cut off our friendship last month and blocked her on everything, but she non-stop keeps trashing me and this is where I think I made it worse: We have many mutual friends and I heard that she and her ex finally broke up, and I was talking to her friend and he was asking why we were no longer friends and about their breakup. I told him some details mostly about me and then mentioned how I didn’t agree with her treating/lying to him and then his friends and him figured it out immediately, since her ex knew about the guy she was seeing on the side but asked her and always lied. Now my ex friend is even angrier and keeps sending her friends to lurk on my social media, even to LinkedIn and I think she’s up to something.

My question: is this my fault? Also, was I in the wrong here? I feel that it’s mostly not me but I did accidentally let something slip but she’s super crazy and I think she’s trying to dig up dirt on me to get me fired or something especially with getting her friends to look on my LinkedIn.

TLDR: crazy ex-friend was cheating on her boyfriend and insulting my relationship and now she’s mad at me because I let it slip she was manipulating him but I thought they already knew. Advice needed.",21Aug2019,1

801,"Hey guys so I'm gonna list some of the reasons I think my parents are to strict and let me know if you agree. I'm 20/f.

- the have a tracker on my phone
- they pay for all my shit so that i don't own anything and they have control over my car my school etc
- i have attempted to have a relationship twice and every time I went out with a guy to the movies or the park or some really pg bullshit i would have my phone blown up, be threatened with the police, and then both my parents would start driving to my location
- i don't have a curfew because I'm not allowed to leave. Having a curfew means i could go out wherever.
- They claim I'm allowed to go out just not with any of the people i know irl right now because they ""smoke weed""
- I can't leave the house for more than 2 hours without getting my phone blown up if I'm at a location they don't approve of
- Every time I ask to hangout with someone it's always they can come to our house but you can't go see them even if its a public place
- They expect me to be a virgin till marriage I think that's why they do all this
- They pretty much tricked me into living at home for all of college claiming they can't afford to pay for the dorms when they totally can. When I asked about this they said they didn't know the dorms where that cheap.
- Every time I go out somewhere they don't approve I get screamed at and threatened over the phone and then guilt tripped when I come home specifically they start talking about both of them dying or if both of them go to a nursing home what would I do to support them. They also bring in their personal work troubles saying that I'm making it worse for them and they said them neglecting my brother is my fault because I'm being so ""wild"".
- I work and I'm in college with a 3.4 and they say I'm ruining my life by talking to a boy.
- They both forbid me from seeing this guy I liked. He ended up dating another girl and then after that my mom started texting him for like 3-4 months trying to make him religious and basically save him.

I don't go out and party, i don't drink, i some a cigarette occasionally but not weed, I'm a total introvert and I'm not out doing wild shit. Basically all I want is to be able to have a relationship without being threatened with the police and guilt tripped every time I see this person. I feel like they're over reacting but they make me feel as if I'm hurting them. I also really want to move out and whenever I talk about it my mom says I want to abandon the family and I act as if I'm doing them a favor by living at home. This is actually insane I'm not just crazy right?

Anyway what could I do about this? Most of their ""rules"" are non negotiable even tho they say they are and every time I follow all of them they still pick out things I'm supposedly ""doing wrong"". I don't have enough money to move out and I have no friends or other family I could stay with.

In May, I accepted a job that I knew would have an expiration date at 3 months or 6 months (based on external factors) in a city far from home. I got an apartment and signed a lease for 3 months with the option for a month-to-month extension. At 3 months, the job ended. I'm still in my apartment and have it until the end of the month. I've been applying to/identifying a lot of positions I'd like that wouldn't have a definitive end date.

\- I don't want to leave them without someone for this position

\- I've made some good friends and it would be nice to stick around them

\- the new assignment would be a slight upgrade from the previous one

Why I'd want to go home:

\- I want something more permanent

\- I miss my family and my parents are very supportive of me staying with them for a month or two until I land something else

\- The nature of the job isn't fully aligned with my end career goals (it's in my general field, but not specific field)

\- I think my leasing company may have already filled my apartment for next month

Even if I did stay with her, and I know this is a stupid thing to be concerned about - but she has a tiny house, and I don’t own much, but I have hundreds of books, and two boxes of memory stuff I couldn’t bare if they destroyed, and I’m scared to leave behind.

I’ve mild Aspergers so I honestly don’t have the slightest idea where to look for help. I’m scared to report them to police or something because even though I have evidence (like pictures of injuries, old diary entries of some incidents etc), they’ll all call me a liar. My Asperger’s isn’t even bad but I know they’ll use it against me. If I say anything I know they’ll slander me. They’ve convinced my grandparents they’re right, but some other relatives are worried about me. There’s no organisations here that cater to anyone except women abused by their partners, and the government agencies don’t care so I don’t know what to do.",21Aug2019,5
808,So I have been out on vacation in another part of the state and service is really bad except for when I go into town. Anyways at like 6am this morning I was sent a message that he needed to talk then at like 1pm I went into town and saw the message that he wanted to talk he when I called him he told me his mom has cancer and that she and his dad left at 6 leaving him to parent his 9f sister. He isn't in very good mental health in the first place and so this messed with him a lot. I cant drive back but I can try to convince my dad to let me get a ride back. Or I could just have him stay with my mom back in town. The main issue I am having is I dont know how to help him and I am generally feeling helpless and normally I'm the one who helps him. How can I help him?,21Aug2019,1

I had a huge crush on one of them so I decided to tell her ,she said that she doesn't feel the same and I just said ok. The same night she tagged her best friend on facebook . The thing she tagged her on stated:"" how to talk to girls :just don't, it's a trap"" and her friend said ""You tagged the wrong person"" which let me to believe that it was about me. The next day I asked her about it and she seem very convincing and she was really nice to me so I thought I was just paranoid. A month later I see another tagged meme which referred to me and her friend answered with the same thing:""you are tagging the wrong person"". I don't know what to do. As I see it there are 3 options:
1. It's not about me ,it's about someone else 
2.They are making fun of me and even if I ask her again she would still deny it and continue making fun of me.
3.I ask her ,she gets angry at me and never talks to me again

810,"I need some advice. I will be deleting this account as i cannot have anyone trace this back.

When i was 10 or 11 my step dad (who had raised me since i was 2) was watching over me and my sisters that day. My mom was working at night at the time. I dont remember how this even happened. My mind completely blanked out that day except what had happened. 
For some reason i went to lay down in bed with him and he was spooning me but he pulled me unusually close to me that it made me uncomfortable.  Im not sure if it was that same day later that night but i was laying in my room and he was wearing these green shorts. He made me touch his dick from the outside. I didnt want to but he insisted on me doing so. I dont know why i didn't tell my mom. He didn't threaten me or anything. I just never told her.  
As time passed by i guess my mind repressed that memory or i just didnt give it much thought. My mom still doesnt know.  I am now 28.  The rest of my childhood was ok apart from what happened that night.  He never did it again.

However now that i have been dating my now fiance for over 11 yrs and even had a child together... he doesn't know about the abuse and he looks up to my dad.  After having my child i went into this deep depression because those fears came back and i was afraid my dad will hurt my daughter too. 
To make it more fucked up his father molested me too and my sister. But my mom knew about that. But never about what my dad did to me.

I have this fear that my fiance will do the same to my daughter. Like touch her innapropietly. I think i feel this way because of what happened to me and what i went through with my dad.

I dont know if i should tell my fiance. I dont know if he will leave me after knowing this. Will he take my daughter away? This will completely ruin my mothers life and sisters. Im afraid of what will happen. Will i end up alone? I just dont want the same to happen to my child especially if later on i regret not saying anything and my child end up messed up.  Should i seek professional help before i decide to do anything?? 

Please help... if i do not respond back its because i deleted this account. I will however be reading the comments from my real account. I promise 

Thank you

814,"A few months ago, my friend (we'll call her Jessica) stopped talking to her other friend (Emily). At the time, Jessica told me the story of what had happened between them, and the story- as you might expect- portrayed Emily in not a very nice light. Jessica told me not to tell anyone that she'd told me and I agreed.

A few months later, long after the fact, Emily and I are having a regular conversation. Prior to this conversation we never really spoke, hence why we never discussed it sooner, but Emily starts talking about Jessica and why they stopped talking. The story that she tells me is very different to the one that I heard from Jessica. Emily says that she suspects Jessica of spreading rumours about her and asks me if I've heard any. I, caught up in the moment, tell her that I have and tell her the version of the story that Jessica told me. 

And now I feel immensely guilty. I wasn't thinking at the time- to be honest, in the moment I thought that Emily deserves to know whats being said about her, especially if it might be a lie. And maybe she does. But whether I did the right or the wrong thing, Jessica made me promise not to tell anyone and I broke that promise. I asked Emily not to tell anyone that we'd spoken about it, but I broke my promise about keeping my mouth shut so how can I blame her if she chooses to talk about it? My worry is that Emily will tell people what I told her, which- in the way that gossip does- will get back to Jessica and she will find out that I betrayed her trust. And even if it doesn't get back to her, I can't speak to her without feeling guilty.

Not that it makes much difference, but we're not super close friends. We just work together at the weekends. To be honest, even calling us 'friends' might be a stretch. I say this not to try to justify myself or anything, but because I want to convey that we really don't talk about.. *deep* stuff. We only really have occassional smalltalk, which is why I feel uncomfortable about suddenly getting serious and confessing that I talked about her, if that makes any sense.",21Aug2019,1

I know that seems bad on my part, but I just really don’t want to. Her not liking me is fine, and I accept that, but I also have the right not want to continue the friendship. I just want to know if there is a way to do this without me looking like I’m purposely being petty or a jerk.

821,"I love writing, and it's something I've always been passionate about. I used to write stories all the time from fanfiction to stories based on my dreams. Those who knew me when I was growing up thought I would become a writer. 

Unfortunately, my chances of becoming a writer fell down the drain during my sophomore year in high school when I failed English. There is no chance in the world I will ever succeed at writing when I couldn't even pass English! Every writer every should easily pass English, but I failed it! I'll never be a good writer, and I need to learn to give up. 

I was always told to never give up on my dreams, but that advice doesn't work in the real world. Sometimes, the best thing to do is to give up and find another dream. Imagine if a colorblind person wanted to be a pilot and got that advice. They'll just waste their life away because they'll never be a pilot. No matter what I do, I'll never be a writer. 

I ended up getting expelled for unrelated reasons and had to take the GED test, but even though I passed every subject that was tested, my lowest grade was English. English is my weakest subject. 

There is not a single successful writer that failed English. You cannot be a writer if you can't even pass English. It's just not possible. 

Some of you may mention that Albert Einstein failed math, but that couldn't be any further from the truth. In fact, his math skills were excellent. While English was my weakest subject, history and science were my two strongest. Giving me false historical information isn't going to help me. 

I have a bunch of ideas for stories I want to write, but I can never succeed as a writer, so I wish I could give up writing and stop having so many ideas so I could focus on something I could actually succeed in. 

How can I stop writing and do something that isn't a waste if time? 

In fact, everyone here is probably cringing at all the grammatical errors and incorrect word usages, and since English is my weakest subject, I don't even notice them.",21Aug2019,1

826," So I'm due to start studying Mathematics and Economics at university. I have been looking at my maths grade for high school to see where I went wrong.

So basically I went through the papers where I would've expected to do well but did worse. And I found that a lot of the reasons I have not done well is because of:

\- Silly mistakes where I either forget to include a number whilst working out so it nullifies my marks on the follow up questions

\- Sometimes numbers flips around when I work them out so similar situation as the above

\- I either read the question too fast or not properly as my anxiety is basically eating me up due to the time constraints so I am not able to think properly.

I have been trying to focus on my anxiety this year but have felt that it gets worse whenever I do my exams to the point I can hear my heart beat more than my thinking. The only arrangement I have had is just being in a smaller room. I did improve on the fact that I'm not depressed because I didn't get what I worked for, but now focusing on what to improve on to prevent this from happening in the future.

I am planning to consult with the support services at my university to see what they could do to help me with these issues.

830,"Hi guys, longtime lurker, first post so be kind popping my reddit cherry. 

Here’s the deal, my fiancé (34 M) has a female friend (37 F) (they were friends in college first) he dated for 1.5 years after college, but broke up with because he didn’t feel romantic love for her. 

Fun fact, she was the sister by marriage to my fiancé’s brothers wife, they use to share a step dad prior to them getting divorced (again). This wouldn’t be a big deal except.....his sister in law likes a big family and encourages her to stay around and so does my fiancé, as they are friends. 

When I first met her, he instructed his friends and family to lie to me about their past and not mention they had once dated. This all came out months later when I noticed his behavior seemed strange around us and I asked him directly. 

I learned he slept with her 1 week prior to us becoming official (exclusive)  at a wedding he attended with his “friend”, aka the Ex. I forgave him for this after he explained himself and regretted how he handled the situation. Their friendship continued and I stayed out of it for the most part as she lives a few hours away and I am not a jealous person. 

He breaks up with me 2 years later (said he didn’t see us going long term) during our 3 month hiatus hooks up with her. Fast forward to me taking him back, I allow the friendship to continue bc the way I see it, we were broken up and why should I force someone I am dating to drop life long friends in the pursuit of something that may not last, right?

Fast forward December 2018, we are now engaged and now my concerns are potential deal breakers if I cannot resolve my emotional distress. He assumed she could come to the wedding, he then assumed she could be in the wedding party. He then assumed she could attend an intimate destination wedding with less than 35 people. When I was upset about this, he got angry and defensive.

We are in couples therapy and we are doing well, our communication has improved. We respect each other and I have zero trust issues with him cheating. But I can not shake this feeling that I am entering a marriage where a precedent has been set that this woman can be in our life, and perhaps that she may be more involved, or he would at least like her to be. I have gone to have dinner with her, just the two of us in hopes of getting to know her better and get rid of some of my anxiety. She is wonderful and I trust her to be honest and respectful of our relationship completely. But I am worried this behavior is so selfish and has such disregard for my emotions wellbeing that I shouldn’t ignore it. 

So I am asking Reddit; have any of you been in a similar relationship issue and been able to
overcome it? I love my fiancé but I don’t want to be a fool, or be so insecure I leave what could be a beautiful marriage.",21Aug2019,2

838,"I apologize in advance if I use any wrong terms. I do not have any experience with people with developmental delays. 

I started a new job about two weeks ago. Some coworkers told me in a not very nice way that they employed several special needs people that would start back soon. I didn’t see why they spoke poorly about it and I still don’t. They are all nice and most work without a lot of direction better than “regular” employees. 

However, last week I met a young man that washes dishes here. Well, really he walks around a lot but no one cares. He is not socially adept and seems young developmentally. He’s very nice, but he has quickly decided he likes me (not sexually). He is hugging me several times a day, constantly touching me, interrupting me working, gets in my way to try to help, corners me and asks me to sing to him because he’s bored, etc. I am overwhelmed. I do not like to be touched in general and I am incredibly uncomfortable. Everyone keeps laughing when I bring it up. I was told to remind him we’re at work and I need my personal space but tonight he came in my office when everyone was gone, hugged me at my desk and asked me to sing and I told him I was busy working, that I do not like to sing, and that I’d like my space and suggested he go back to work and sing a song for himself. He flat out told me I wasn’t busy and I didn’t look like I was working, I was just scrolling on the internet. I had to get up and leave my desk. 

So I’m at a loss for what to do here. My manager just smiles or laughs when I talk about it. What else can I say or do to help this situation? I know that this may be seen as overreacting, and believe me I feel like an asshole for not knowing how to humor him, but I am incredibly uncomfortable.

She receives some income from disability and some from SNAP food benefits. Right now she lives with my brother (30) who is basically paying all of the rent because her money goes towards car payment + insurance, gas money to get to her appointments almost daily, etc. 

Long story short is I want to help her either A.) get into an affordable/state-sponsored housing program where she can live (currently lives in MA), or B.) help her find some work where she's able to work at flexible hours doing something relatively simple, where she doesn't have to lift or move anything and can sit down. 

It's incredibly difficult to see her depressed and stressed out over money and it's causing stress on the rest of my family trying to support her. 

I don't know if this is even the right subreddit to post to but I'm trying to get advice wherever I can if it'll lead to a better life for her. Thanks for reading.",21Aug2019,1
849,"I attempted to look into this a few times with vague results.

I have Dysautonomia/POTS and any thing i found linked my leg pain to that.

Basically I'll go to bed and during the night I'll wake up and ny legs hurt. They feel extremely sore.. Sorta burning? Or stinging. I'll roll around to try and get comfortable. I'll stretch them out or curl them in. Anything to make them hurt less.

They usually hurt a ton on the side of my thigh cause I lay on my side. I'm not sure if its just my nerves hurting from the pressure or what.

The past few times ive brought it up with doctors they didnt listen. Said I just need to stretch more. Well i do. That hasnt helped.

I've tried walking some more but it seems to make it worse. I still get exercise in cause i need it but I 100% end up being bed bound when I do. Which makes my leg pain 10x worse.

I'm not sure what to do or how to get it looked into. It hurts really bad.",21Aug2019,1
850,"She wants it to order takeout, (likely a box of mozza sticks) because she doesn’t like anything other than fast food. Literally. She’s extremely picky.
She would order it herself but she left her card at her friends’ (she usually would have lost it by the way). 

My sister keeps screaming at me for it and my Mom keeps telling me I have to, but I really don’t want to. 

I’m not supposed to give her my code, I’m really shy and awkward so I’m terrified of going down and even being near the delivery guy and I also barely know how to use my bank card. I know it’s simple (I’ve done it before) but I’m just really slow and I hate using it anyway. I also don’t trust my sister with my code, she’s not very trustworthy and I feel like she would likely memorize it and end up using my card without my permission when I’m not home or something. 

Also, I know the food that she’ll order she’ll just throw up anyway. (She’s not bulimic or anything, we don’t know what it is yet. Everyone thinks she might be lactose intolerant but I also think it could be because of her bad eating habits along with smoking). It’s really not good for her, she eats so unhealthy constantly.

Everyone says I’m just being selfish and ignorant. They are right, it isn’t really nice of me to say no every time I’m asked  (as she theoretically *would* transfer the money back right away anyway). But I don’t want to, and I don’t understand how being yelled at and guilt tripped all the time is going to make me happy to help. They keep using the excuse that she’s had a long day or she’s in pain because she’s been working (she has a job, I don’t understand why she doesn’t have any cash). 

I’d really like to not be a selfish asshole, but I just don’t feel comfortable with her using my card.

851,"So I've been struggling a lot recently and my parents don't really believe in like..therapy. They're pretty insensitive to mental health but that's just an old parent thing I guess. 

Anyway my community college offers free mental health counseling which I've just found out about even though I've been going for 3 years!! I'm emailing one of the advisors there so I can schedule an appointment but I'm beginning to have second thoughts. I'm becoming extremely nervous..meeting one on one is a really big fear of mine just general social interaction but that's part of what I'm trying to get help with. I've never been to any sort of counseling or therapy before so I have no idea what to expect and I'm beyond nervous just thinking about it.

Since the services are free I feel like I have to go in knowing exactly what I want to say. I'm really worried..for anyone who's been to counseling or therapy before please let me know how the process is..like do they do most of the talking? What if you don't know exactly what to say? Where do you even start? I am currently a ball of nerves right now and the appointment hasn't even been scheduled yet.

852,"Hey guys, I have a question. I’m sorta new to skateboarding, so I mostly just ride around this parking lot near my apartment. 

Anyways, on Sunday I was riding around and my left foot started to ache right at the base of my Achilles’ tendon, and I think I was kicking/pushing with my left foot weird and ended up spraining it or something. 

It aches a bit when I walk, and it hurts some when I touch the spot, and I limp sometimes. 

I walk about 1.5km to and from work every day, and this is getting annoying. I’m aware that it probably isn’t healing as fast because I’m walking a lot, but I don’t have money for the bus.

854,"I work for a company that does paint supplies and works with painters on a daily basis.  


Today, I had been gone for a week and a few days on vacation so it was my first day back-- while running the tinters I made a small mistake and forgot to double check a co-worker had made sure they had hammered shut a gallon of paint.   


Needless to say, all over the inside of a brand new shaker a mess was made and a gallon of paint had to be wasted. Now, after seeing this my manager was ticked. I had decided to take the blame for the new girl and worked to clean it up until it was nearly spotless. Later in the day, I made a similar mistake with less diasterous results-- a little crack had opened on the top of a gallon and spurted some paint across another tinter...  


This is where my boss Loses it. He berates me on the sales floor, asks ""What the Fuck is wrong with you!?"" In front of several customers and fellow employees (Not to mention a Child and his Mother at the counter), YANKS the can out and as I'm dealing with the customer from earlier I heard a crashing crunch.  


Apparently in his rage fit state over a small error he had thrown the can of paint off the back wall and gotten blue tint EVERYWHERE. Flustered, he came out, helped a few more customers, went to his his JUUL and then came back inside to clean up the exploded can all over the floor. Meanwhile, here I am shaking because I feel like he's going to throw me off the wall next.

859,"Hello all. So I’m a 29 year old male and looking for some helpful advice to get rid of all this negative thinking I carry. Ive never had a girlfriend, hardly ever dated, and have struggled with self-esteem issues most of my life. 

For most of my twenties, I’ve sat back and watched life pass me by, while my friends and other people I know were dating/having sex/ and living their life. I used to tell myself that I dont deserve a “normal” life bc I saw myself as unattractive because Ive always felt I looked different from most guys. 

Everyday I’m hit with these negative thoughts that its too late to change things around and live a normal life with normal experiences like so many people have. Im back in school finishing my degree, but its hard for me to see the value in it if im gonna continuing living this lonely life. 

For years I accepted being alone bc of my low self -esteem, but now Im tired of it and really want to change things. The problem is I feel its too late to build any kind of personal/social life. I dont want to be alone anymore, and I keep asking myself whats the point of even going to school if im still gonna be alone. 
 
I get depressed just seeing random strangers in public places knowing how they’ve all had all these experiences that ive never had, and quite frankly dont know if i ever will.  

I know Ive wasted my twenties and will live with that regret for the rest of my life, but how do I accept that and move on? Ill never get to be young and dating and having fun like so many do/did, and bc of that I keep telling myself ‘your lifes over why bother’

Im seeing a therapist for the first time next week, but hes an older guy and probably wont understand much of what i am telling you all in here. Id really like to hear people in their twenties/my age suggestions on what I should do.  I dont think I can go two more years of school completely on my own with no gf or anyone special to spend time with. I cannot live alone anymore!",21Aug2019,1

867,"Hey, okay I don’t know if anyone will even read this but here we go. After graduating high school in 2018, I planned to attend the University of Colorado, Boulder. My mom and step-dad planned to help me with my tuition, although I did have some roll in paying a certain amount. They did not want me to have debt, and my only responsibility was to earn good grades. I headed to the dorm life, and it was completely different from how I grew up. I let myself go and like a knucklehead I didn’t balance partying and school. Instead my focuses were just on partying. I would sleep through classes, miss assignments, and do poorly on tests. It was a mess, I couldn’t own up to my parents because I knew how much of a failure I felt like and I knew how hard they both have worked. In the middle of the summer I got a call from my mom, she was pissed off. I already had a bad feeling and sure enough, it was about my grades. That’s the long story summed up into a short one. I completely understand that I made the decision and should have consequences. I think a lot of things happen for a reason whether we like it or not and I would rather not learn the hard way but here I am. I guess what I came to this platform for is advice on my options. Currently I have no loans, no grants, no scholarship. My parents did say they would think about offering to help again if I can prove myself in a semester. So the options, I could possible figure out a emergency loan with the school when my dad and I do our FAFSA options tomorrow. I just really don’t want to get a loan off a impulse decision. Next option, i currently work for my dad full time in the summer doing garage doors and would continue to work for my dad during the fall until spring semester and possibly have enough money to pay my way through school with payment plans in the spring. Next option, is figure out online schooling and still work full time. Next option, and I know this sounds like a joke or a stretch but figure out how to become a pilot. I know there are certain requirements and I’m not at all clear about that but at least it would be cheaper then put myself in a whole with a loan.  Btw I start school on the 26th and payment is due by sep. 5 lol. I have no idea what I should do. I know I want to prove to myself and my parents what I can do and who I am as a person.

868,"I just got my GED finished up yesterday after having dropped out back in September (family issues, transportation ect. prevented me from attending high school)

 In my first year or two of high school, my grades were actually really good. I took all honors classes and an AP elective. Along with all those, I got involved in the school band and, even though I had never learned an instrument before due to money issues, fell in love with it. The band director told me that it was too late for me to learn an instrument, but that he'd allow me to join the drumline and play cymbals since they were the easiest thing to do and had the easiest music to read.

    While I had absorbed some knowledge through my peers throughout my time there and my person studies, I'm still nowhere near the level I would need to be to go to college as a music major. The only thing is, that's all I've ever wanted to do. I would pour my blood, sweat and tears into learning given the opportunity. But I'm also aware that it can be a very difficult major with very little reward financially.
 
   I don't know what to do. Realistically, I feel like I need to just throw all of that away and try to get the best STEM major I can, something like nursing, even though that will most likely be difficult as a GED student.

872,"Hey all, hoping for some insight by people in HR or supervisory positions, but any and all are welcome to throw in their two cents.

I recently (about 7 weeks now) started a new job, and it’s absolutely the job of my dreams. It’s a technical trade job with some manual labor thrown in here and there.

The overall work environment is very relaxed and no one expects you to break your back every single day, but they do expect hard, diligent work, which I’m all about.

Since I’m new but tend to be a fast learner, I’m kind of stuck in the middle of being on my own, and following a superior employee.

Well, the superior employee who has been training me is one of those “give an inch, take a mile” types. As a result, there are days where a 15 minute task turns into an hour long fiasco because he’s just wasting time, and other days he just blatantly doesn’t work. And being his trainee, I get dragged along for the ride. As far as I can tell, the supervisors are none the wiser, because he’s, admittedly, pretty good about making people THINK he works hard and diligently.

I don’t want any of the other employees to view me as lazy (being a labor intensive environment, lazy is NOT a good thing to be) and I don’t want my supervisor to get the impression that I’m not giving this job my all.

Our evaluations aren’t until October, and I feel like I desperately need to say something to my supervisor that dissociates me from this person’s work ethic. He (my supervisor) is generally very understanding and also has a strong work ethic himself, so I think it could go over well if I were to talk to him about it, but I’m now sure how to approach him (if I even should.)

So fire away. I look forward to any and all responses.",21Aug2019,1
873,"Please, please don't be mean but also be honest. If I look as absolutely disgusting as i feel like i do, and should hide away, tell me but in a nicer way. I just don't wanna cry again right now lol


So about three years ago, my now ex (obvious why he's an ex) had knocked out one of my crowns. He had told me he'd pay for me to get a tooth implant, which I was told was the only option. It would cost around 8k which is absolutely insane. I ended up leaving him because he was abusive, and he basically laughed and said he was glad he didn't help me fix it, and now nobody would be with me 🤷‍♀️


Eventually over the years, my teeth are just looking worse. They've gotten so spaced out because of the missing tooth, and I feel like the ugliest girl on the absolute planet, period.


I take care of my teeth, don't have bad breath, etc. So it's nothing hygienic. It's just appearance.


I planned on getting the implant eventually, then maybe invisalign r braces even... But that could possibly be years and years.


After leaving my ex, I was forced to move home and now I take care of my dad and 5 siblings. I absolutely can't put my teeth first, and can't put money towards it.


I can't do a payment plan, because my family relies on me for money for food, electric, etc. So it has to come last. Dental schools can't do anything for me, at least not the ones in my city.


I'm absolutely torn up about this, everyday. I look at myself in the mirror and feel disgusting and disgusted. I Googled it and then cried for hours. The amount of people who say bad teeth are a dealbreaker outweigh the ones that don't care.


My family says I overthink it, but if it was them, they'd get it. Other than my teeth, I'm not a bad looking girl. If I don't open my mouth, don't talk or smile, I look fine. Nothing is off, nothing else is horribly disgusting.


This is extremely terrifying for me to do right now, because I'm so insecure. I cover my mouth talking to anyone, so posting pictures is making me panic. But I need advice.

Only 'when I was in the military, we had to do \_\_\_\_', which very rarely applies to whatever situation is at hand.

* He talks down on me and seems to assume that I have no idea what I'm talking about half the time (despite the fact that there are some areas where I *actually* have more experience than him now \[what a shock\])
* Slinks away from disagreements by physically flinching (which seriously worried me, so I *did* talk to him about it and promised not to yell anymore, but he does it now even when I'm *not* yelling, but when we're just disagreeing or when we're talking about something he is mildly uncomfortable with)
   * Note:  this is also something I used to do, too.  Disagreements led to disappointment and we were more often than not expected to obey blindly regardless of what we thought or believed at the time.  No physical punishments, just a deep-set feeling of disappointment and emotional pain.
* Hides away in his room and doesn't interact with us unless there's food involved (he's better at interacting with our younger sisters, but even then we barely see him)

I've *tried* to talk to him about some of the things that are annoying me and I've tried to bring my concerns to him and talk to him like an adult.  I tried little stuff first in order to test the waters and see how he would react, but he just shuts me down and I can tell he's just expecting me to cave and go along with whatever he says.  If not when he gets pissy, then when he gets all flinchy and tense.  It's an actual *pattern*.  The first few times, I was worried that I was pushing him too hard and that I was being insensitive and that I was going to hurt him if I kept it up.  But the more often he does it, the more I realize that it's a way for him to shut down *everything* he dislikes.  And what he seems to dislike is change, like the change I'm trying to encourage so he can actually stay up-to-date with the family's growth.  But even I can be made aware when me and my 'help' aren't wanted.   It got to the point where he *admitted* that he wasn't really listening to what I was trying to tell him, but that he was just trying to wait out whatever I had to say so he could go back to whatever he wanted to do.  He straight up admitted to ignoring me.

So I removed myself from the equation.  For the past few months, I haven't been interacting with him more than necessary, just quietly keeping my spaces clean and keeping my head down and staying out of his way.  It's not that hard, given that he doesn't really want to interact or anything.  And it worked and even though it sucks, it was generally fine.

Now, however, there's been a shift in house policy.  Everyone is going to have to pitch in with dinners.  Not a bad plan.  It didn't work the first time, while he was in the military, but we're giving it another go and hoping for the best.  My brother, however, is pissed because he can't cook.  Our sister is offering to help him and teach him so he can get a few dishes under his belt, but he's pissed off that he has to participate and even though we're trying to be helpful in this, he's just getting fucking pissy.  

We were discussing the new dinner plan this morning and I was trying to figure out what the plan was for his night (what his night was, what he was gonna cook, and if he was getting help), when he tensed like he was gonna get hit and stormed out of the kitchen and up to his room.  I wanted to talk to him about it, but I figured it would be stupid to do it right then.  So I waited ten minutes for the both of us to calm down (I wasn't even talking *to* him at this point, so I was really miffed when he just barreled out of there like a bat out of hell) and went to his room to talk about it.  I actually thought I'd said something unintentionally triggering and opened up by asking if I'd said or done anything to cause the reaction (because it's a huge fucking reaction).

The little fucker told me ""I can't cook.  And I don't like doing things I can't do.  It's stupid and I should get over it.""

In this house, 'I should get over it' means 'I should, but I'm just angry about it and I wanna mope and maybe I'll get out of it if I garner enough pity'.  It has for years.  Even worse, it *worked* for *both* of us as kids.  And I know he's not actually working on it because the instant I left after everything was said and done, he just raged around his room, cursing up a storm, and then got on his video game.  And he's been uptight about this for at least a week without *any* shift in attitude.

So I tried to be helpful.  I told him about how awful I was at the beginning, and about how he was *there* for my most catastrophic failures.  I told him that no one gets better without practicing and that he wasn't even going to be alone for his first time cooking.  I told him how I remembered him actually being *able* to brown meat and that I used to go to him for help because I couldn't do it as a kid.  I had *hoped* that this reminder that he could do that much and that he wouldn't be alone would help.

But he tensed up *again* and he kept jerking all over the place.  Sparotic hand movements, twitchy eyebrows, deep scowl.  *Nothing* was helping and his entire attitude *wasn't* changing at *all*.

So I was an idiot and asked if he was actually hearing me out or if he was waiting for me to leave.  Of *course* the fuckwad said he was just waiting for me to leave.  So I left and I cried and I pulled my shit together and I got shit done today and now I'm trying to think about how to move forward with all of this.

This *isn't* the first time he's basically told me that he disregards everything I say.  I started just ignoring him because I know I'm not really worth anything to him at this point.  Maybe as a childhood memory, but not right now.  But *now* he's being expected  to pull his weight and if he *doesn't*, then the rest of us catch the flak for it (there are six people in this house and one of them is in high school and she has awful eating habits as it is).  However, he'll never listen to me if I try to bring it up.

So what do I do?  Go back to ignoring him and his melodrama and try to pick up the slack again?  Or do I try to talk to him?  Or do I try to get someone *else* to talk to him?  I'm so fucking tired of his bullshit and he won't let anyone help him.

***tl;dr:  Brother expresses very clear and very physical signs of distress (remnant of childhood coping mechanisms, I believe) whenever confronted with change or responsibility and refuses to listen to any advice I try to give; soon to become everyone's problem.  What to do?***",21Aug2019,1

890,"I live in Halifax, Nova Scotia, a relatively small city that is plagued by the Air BNB disease where landlords/tenants will rent out a space not to live in but to rent it out on Air BNB. They're making so much more money that it's a no brainer for these greedy people. It makes finding an apartment extremely competitive and difficult. 

My situation is also a little different. I have autism spectrum disorder (you may know it as Asperger syndrome) and I have trouble with jobs because of it. I am on disability and I get paid about $900 a month. I'm looking for an apartment around $700, and I have found plenty, viewed about 9 or 10 and applied for 5. None of the applications have been approved. 

I am wondering now if maybe the fact that I am on disability or autistic has something to do with it. On the applications they ask about my employment, where I then say that I do not work due to a medical issue but I receive money from the government. It is illegal in Canada to discriminate against me for this reason, but I have no way of proving why they actually aren't accepting me.

I'm wondering if there is perhaps a better way of to get this across. I'm not very good with knowing what is and what isn't acceptable if I haven't learned it already, my guesswork and estimation in this area is terrible.",21Aug2019,1
891," I'm a 22 year old male in the United States (California to be exact). Throwaway for obvious reasons. About a month back I engaged in online sexual activity with who I thought to be a woman. After exchanging photos and even a video of myself pleasuring myself, they threatened to send it to everyone I knew unless I paid them $200. I panicked, and I paid them, then blocked their phone number thinking it was the end of it.

A couple of days later (this is something I just found out over 2 months later), they had send me pictures of everyone on my facebook friends list over google hangouts. I didn't see this until 2 months later, but I immediately deactivated my facebook, and attempted to delete my PayPal which I had paid them with to try and protect my information (obviously it's too late for that).

There hasn't been any contact from this person in 2 months, but I just saw the new messages today. Should I be worried? Is there any action I should/could take? I'm honestly just not sure what to do and explicit things getting sent to people I know obviously wouldn't be the end of my life but it isn't something I want to happen. I'm worried they are going to contact me again.

I still have all the records of our google hangout exchanges, none of the ones over text. So I can't prove they were asking me for money since those were over text. I just don't know what to do. I'm panicking.

Any advice/help would be appreciated.",21Aug2019,1

893,"I apologise in advance for this lengthy post. 

Let's start off by saying that my finances aren't great. I mean i'm not homeless but they could be better. I've been stressing out at work and at home quite a bit so i was planning to go on a holiday to istanbul with my friend and his wife. Let's call this guy friend 'A.' 

'A' and i are very close and we have been friends since primary school. I visit his house almost weekly and both he and his wife are awesome. They are extremely hospitable and i am always made to feel welcome in their house.

Back to the holiday...

We had always talked about it for years and we were finally getting some dates ready. 'A' and his wife could only come for 5 nights due to work and he then also told me that his wife would be unable to book days off work before the end of this year. 

This kinda stressed me out a little because i had found a really good deal at a really awesome 4.5 star hotel for 5 nights. The cost per person would be around £450-£480 for 5 nights in May. The dates were perfect (just before the peak season) and the price was good as we were travelling and booking as a group. The issue was that in order to get this deal we would have to book a.s.a.p as prices would increase the closer we got to the date.

As mentioned my finances aren't abysmal but they're not the best  either so i was anxious to make sure that i didn't end up spending more than i could afford. I wanted to lock in the price before it increased during peak travel times.  I didn't mention my finances to 'A' but i did say clearly that prices would be higher and that it would be harder to get rooms in that hotel or any hotel at that price if we booked closer to the date of the holiday. I would not be able to afford it.

I was also under the impression that there were limited flights and seats going during the dates we wanted and i was worried that we wouldn't get seats on a flight for that date .

(I only checked 1 flight which said there were only 6 more tickets on that particular flight on that day. In reality there were plenty of flights as the same flight left the airport every day at the same time, i just didn't check properly. Nonetheless i mentioned this to 'A' who understood where i was coming from - I will come back to this later)

'A' (who seemed to be thinking more about the erroneous information regarding the flight issue than the cost) then told me that if it was going to be a problem then i should maybe think about contacting some other mates and see if i could go with them as It would just not be possible for 'A' and his wife to get days off before december This saddened me as i did really want to go with him but i didn't want to force him or cause inconvenience.

I then spoke to 4 other friends of mine the next day (let's call them all 'Group B' who came over that evening, we went out had a meal, discussed the holiday and then came back to mine to check out the dates and prices. We found a really good deal which would let us stay for 3 whole nights more. A full 8 nights in istanbul in the same awesome 4.5 star hotel for around £400 per person (INC RETURN FLIGHTS :D). This was around £80 less and we got an extra 3 whole days to explore Istanbul!  I assume that since more of us were going it seemed we got a bigger discount.

This was perfect for me as it costed less than it would have done had i gone with 'A' and his wife AND to top it off, i could stay for another 3 whole days. I love exploring so a longer holiday really appealed to me  (and i would be able to save some money). 

'Group B' and i didnt waste this opportunity and started making preparations for this date immediately. I sent off a renewal application for my passport and the rest of 'Group B' started getting things ready. For all intents and purposes we were now committed however we had not yet booked the tickets themselves as we are currently waiting on my passport renewal. 

Meanwhile 'A' told his wife about all this who was understandably very upset, We all spoke over the phone and she was angry (again quite understandable) that we had talked about this for years and now that we finally got the ball rolling, she felt that i had ditched them and left them hanging. I explained that it was not my fault and that her husband, 'A', had expressly instructed me to go with 'Group B'.

'A' at this point admitted to his wife that he had told me to go with 'Group B' but in an effort to defend himself, he kept referring to my earlier gaffe where i was like ""oh they only have 6 seats available right now and we won't get seats on the plane if we book in december"" and continuously said that though he had said himself that i should go with 'Group B', it was actually my fault as i had misinformed him which led to him saying that i should just go with 'Group B'.

We all sorta got into a mild argument and ended the call there. He then messaged me again, continuously saying that i had misinformed him and created an issue (regarding the flight seats) when it didn't actually exist. He really wants me to cancel the deal i have with 'Group B' and come with him and his wife to stay in istanbul for 5 days instead of 8 and spend around £60 more for the privilege -_-.  

I don't want to lose 'A' or his wife's friendship but i also don't want to pay more for less and bail out on 'Group B' 

Again, I'm sorry for the lengthy post, any advice is appreciated.",21Aug2019,1

Living with Family: 
Mother
Brother, Jay17
Brother, Jesse26 no job, never left home
As said in the title, Ive sustained a serious brain injury. Last year i was in a horrible car accident, and I had 3 brain bleeds, two craniel fractures, broke all 4 limbs(several places each), 4 ribs, and I had my 6th surgery ~3 months b4 this post.
 Its been a year and ive finally kept a job for 2 months, but I just told my mother to ""go **** yourself sideways"" after she tells me ""you might(vicious sarcasm) need to leave this house"" at the end of the 4th screaming match between her, myself, and my brothers as I walk to my room desperate for a break.
Jay immedietely runs forward and tries to fight me. I was able to push him away over and over till my mother holds him back and then she and Jess walk forward and Jess tells me to put on shoes and leave and never come back. 
""Understood"", I say as I hobble down the stairs. After watching me come up the stairs and sit to put shoes on, my mother screams at me again as to why I said that. I tried and failed yet again to explain that I cant stand them judging me for things I cant remember after my TBI. They will regularly roll eyes at me. They judge me out loud for repeating conversations over the days at times. And they chew me out for misinterpreting their words because I cant remember everything thats been said like they can. 

We used to be a heck of a lot better than this b4 this accident, trust me.
ve given them so much slack thinking of my mothers experience waiting 4 me to wake from a 50day coma to be in the same condition mentally as a newborn. I couldnt form words for 2 weeks after I woke.

I'm afraid ive run out of slack to give

897,"I’m not really expecting much of a response to be honest because I feel like I never get taken seriously about this topic. I’m about 5’8 and a half and around 109lbs at this moment but it differs between 110 and 115, it’s never gone beyond 120lbs. My BMI is roughly 16.5 which is very underweight and from what I’ve heard is borderline mild anorexia for some people... I know I’m not anorexic because I actively try and fix my weight, but every time I try I always end up not gaining any and getting depressed and then losing much more. I’ve been to the doctors about it and they don’t take me seriously at all. The only person who does is my Mum who often gets angry at me saying I look like I’m about to fade away and my girlfriend. I really want to gain weight because the other boys in my class take the piss out of me for being so skinny and it’s not easy going through school getting abuse hurled at you.

898,"So this is gonna be long, but I’m currently a senior in college, and i currently have no friends there. For some context, i was forced to switch universities after my sophomore year. When i was a new student at this new school (junior), i had a very hard time finding friends. I lived in a dorm and was hoping i would maybe become friends with some people in the dorm or whatnot, but it just didn’t happen. 

Everyone there was welcoming but after that, i basically did nothing. Everything i was invited to (mostly floor events), i would go to, even tho i dreaded going cause everyone already had friends and didn’t really care at that point. I find myself a pretty social person, and i believe i’m easy to talk to, but i couldn’t get anything to click. people would talk to me and then it would stop shortly a couple minutes later and i just felt excluded. 

I would go to dinners with the entire floor cause i needed social interaction and i wanted to keep trying to find friends but it never worked. people just didn’t have any interest in talking to me or getting to know me past a few minutes of talking. I don’t think i’m boring or the person that doesn’t stop talking, but idk people would just not care. It honestly seemed like they had their shit figured out and didn’t wanna change anything. 

Towards the end of the year, i just played a lot of video games online with old friends at my old school and basically stayed in my room all day. My 21st birthday was spent alone cause i had jack shit to do anything with. 

It really sucks cause i used to have amazing friends at my old school and i had a ton of friends to hang out with. i knew tons of people and never had a problem with people. Now i just struggle to get someone to talk to me.  

This year is my senior year and i still know no one. Because i transferred, i didn’t get much of a choice of where to live due to only going to THAT school for 1 year so i got stuck in a dorm with someone i have never met. i hope the guy is cool, but it’s just worrisome cause i have no idea. 

I just want to have my old life back or to find a new life here. i feel like i have little control over my life now and i’m just trying my best to make the best of it. 

i’ll probably just play tons of video games again if i make no friends.

Besides this, there are several issues with the place that just plain old make me want to leave.
