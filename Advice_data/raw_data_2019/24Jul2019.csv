0,"Help is deeply appreciated ❤️ mods removed me in r/parenting because I'm not a parent. Very stupid, I was posting this on behalf of my mom,  why do my relationships decide wether I can post or not. This only restricts people from getting advice or communicating about alike problems.

Anyway.  

Making this out of desperation as today was real bad and I want to help my parents.

My little sister is 5 and often does these things where she has to perform a certain task or make us do things specifically. Im wondering what to do to break this cycle and stop the stress it's been causing us.

Some background: 

She goes to a small daycare/school everyday but the weekend. She lives with my mom, dad, and I and we give her much love, attention and care. She is not related to my father, only my mother. She calls my dad ""Papa"". She loves him as much as if they were blood related and they've been together since she was 1

My parents divorced and got back together right around when she was born. in-between the divorce my mom got an emotionally abusive boyfriend who impregnated her. Things slowly went sour with them and my mom and dad realized they were still in love and got back together.

Well, she has her real father she has to Skype with twice a week, which she hates doing as her father is not very good at interacting with her and is just strange to her. (I believe Skype is court ordered, we live in ct) She calls him dad on Skype but she is awkward about it. She only has 1 month of time in total with her Dad, so they aren't very close.

The OCD problems:

Example: she will sometimes make us wait at the bottom of the stairs and hold her hand on the way up. If we proceed up the stairs without her she will full out tantrum. Some days are better than others with her not caring as much.

Today was the worst it's ever been. My mom came home and brought belongings inside. Little sister was freaking out because she wanted to carry her stuff in that my mom was carrying. My mom said no when she asked because she just had a long day and didn't want to give in to her silly behaviors. Plus she had her hands full and this is just a plain inconvenience to her she wants to avoid. She keeps waking to the door and she has an awful fit.

We didn't end up giving in and she screamed, jumped and stomped over it and almost pulled the curtains down. She kept insisting we bring the stuff back to the car so she can than bring it back inside. She was very stressed out over it and was acting uncontrollably. It was a nightmare and my mom can't handle these situations much longer. I can't comprehend how not being able to carry stuff inside caused this.

Papa held her hand and put on a show. He kept talking to her about what was currently happening on the show. This slowly calmed her and she is now over it 18-20 minutes later.

She has a bed time ritual where she has to say ""goodnight, good luck sleeping make sure you dream about things"". She says it every night and says goodnight repeatedly while going upstairs. She makes us say goodnight multiple times as well while she goes or she just gets pissed.

She also visits her Dad alone occasionally. I'm wondering if the Skyping and visiting is messing with her head because it's like she has 2 dad's... And she doesn't like her real one that much. She is visibly unconverted when around him.

Thanks for reading this, hope to get some good feedback.",24Jul2019,2
1,"So, for some backstory here, my father and I don't necessarily have the best relationship. He and I are just very different, he's an ex-army man who can't be told no, especially from his children and I'm someone who values fleshing out opinions and arguments to ensure both sides have their say. I'm also a girl in a family of predominantly boys, so there's that. We used to fight almost weekly over trivial shit, such as me getting my license or me going nowhere in life since I didn't have a job. I couldn't understand why he wasn't happy with me, since despite not having a job I was pretty much a straight-A student in High School, didn't drink or go out and enjoyed playing sports.

Now, onto the present. Things have gotten better in recent years since I've learned to hold my tongue and just try and cope with his mood swings. I've graduated high school, am in my second semester of university and did very well in my first semester. I have a job now and I am going for my license next week! The problem is the only time my father shows interest in something, is when it's about me working or me getting my license. As I don't yet have it, I need someone to take me to my hockey game on the weekend (In Australia, you're not allowed to drive by yourself until you have your provisional license. You must have someone with a full drivers license instructing you) and generally I drive with my mother. She's going away for a weekend and I thought if my father took me, it'd be a nice outing for us and a way for us to practice my driving before my test next week. 

The disappointment part? I asked him politely if he'd be able to take me knowing he doesn't have work, but apparently supporting and helping out his daughter isn't as important as watching a random football match at home. Is it wrong that I feel so angry and upset over this? Maybe I'm being childish. I don't know, any sort of advice is welcome.",24Jul2019,1
2,"Context: I have known this girl for 6 years and seem to have issues with opening up to people and consequently suck at dating.She's one of the few people who I can honestly say i feel totally comfortable opening up to. My recent dating struggles combined with hanging out with her more have caused me to realise, personality wise, she has everything I want. I worry however that this isn't reciprocal and worry about ruining our friendship if I act on this. Any advice is welcome.",24Jul2019,1
3,"Okay, okay. I know I have to grow ""thick skin,"" but it's been a month with no progress.

I give no reactions to their jokes which lead them to believe that I was ""cranky"" and I was. But only because they were repeating the same stuff over and over again. They're obnoxious, and there's no other way but to deal with them every single day.

One of them started to remark how I was being quiet and introverted again. The other started calling me a little b**ch, which he name calls everyone... so I know he isn't specifically targeting me. But it's still so disrespectful, agitating, etc.

I know I'm being a bit of a baby over this, but this has literally turned me into the crankiest person ever. I used to be more optimistic and happy before this.

I'm really starting to hate them. I really am. What do I do?

4,"I (21/M) came to City X for an internship for the summer. I met a really great guy (31/M) during this time and we've been seeing each other (not exclusively), but we've been spending a lot of time together on dates and just hanging out. We've clicked pretty hard and I find myself thinking about him all of the time, something that's pretty rare to my dating experience.

We talked about our situation recently and I'm still processing what I even think about it. I'm moving back home for my last year of undergraduate and then I'm planning on moving to City X. We came to the agreement that we're going to keep things with no label for the next year while I'm back at school. We're also planning on visiting each other a few times during the next year. 

If I do end up moving to City X, we will resume things. However, he doesn't think that he's up for doing a long distance relationship because of the difficulty (and I agree), at least not this early on. I personally don't think jumping into a long distance relationship after 1.5 months of seeing each other would be giving it the best shot of success. 

Also, another factor that complicates this is our 10 year age gap. It's not a problem for us person-to-person, but we are at different parts in our life. He has an established job in City X and wants to stay there. I'm hoping to move to City X after graduation, but I feel like I'm at a point in my life where I'm still trying to figure myself out. I love City X and really do see myself being there, but I haven't committed to the area yet with a lease. And I think that's another reason why he and I don't want to get into a long distance relationship right now. What if I don't end up in City X?

I guess my current issue is that we're putting each other on ""pause"" for the next year with no guarantee that either of us will even be single. Does this appear to be a healthy/manageable situation? Or should more boundaries be defined in regard to exclusivity? Has anyone done something similar?

Something that would possibly make me more comfortable would be having a no-label, non-monagamous type thing where neither of us will be dating other people, but would be allowed to hook up with other people. However, if it ended up that I didn't move to City X for some reason, I wouldn't want him to have wasted his time not dating other people.

This was kind of all over the place, but I greatly appreciated any help with this or thoughts you may have! Even if it just touches on certain concerns.



tl;dr we're super compatible, but us being together relies on me moving to City X after I graduate college, and I don't want to waste his time or my time or hurt one of us. What do?",24Jul2019,1
5,I've been home-schooled most of my life but I'm going into high school and my mom wants me to go to public school but I think I might be to dumb at this point I don't know what to do I want to go but it just seems like a easy way to make life a little bit worse,24Jul2019,1
6,How this mess started; I met my online friends on a game and we hit it off instantly and as our whole friend group gained more friends to the group it got out of hand. I was a pretty alright friend ig I’d like to think so when my friends needed items to get items they liked I gave them stuff  (pretty decent items ) to help and when they were upset I’d do a alittle “Don’t you know your actually amazing paragraphs” surprise and I was always there for when they got into arguments but of course they were there for me too until I introduced a rude friend they hated him for his rude jokes and ofc I wanted to make things work but they weren’t helping  so I listened to them both and got my head all mixed one telling me “ you me suffer just drop him “ and I’m the type who just doesn’t drop memories and the other saying “you’ll never meet then and they are pathetic “ so I got alittle confused trying not to disappoint anyone so in private I agreed to both! Thought things ended here? Nope. I was very stupid one day and let’s say sent things I’ll regret for the rest of my life and those things spreaded around our huge friendship group and me and a few of the originals were talking and they kept lecturing me and I told them I didn’t like it and they continued Ik they were trying to help but reliving the moment isnt a nice feeling so I went to my rude friend and said “ i hate my friends .... bc they lecture me so much “ but he screenshotted it only saying I hate my friends and sent it to them my friends dropped me and I didn’t have to explain so i told my rude friend bye and moved account so everyone found me and called me Named etc and my rude friend hacked my account containing very expensive stuff but when things got alittle nasty irl I would of played my favourite game but as you can see I’m in a pickle how do I reunite with stubborn friends,24Jul2019,1
7,"It's embarrassing that I have to make this post, but I don't know how to feel. I've been straight all my life. I've always found women to be extremely attractive, and I still do, however lately I've been feeling weird. 

I've been avoiding porn and masturbating for the last few days, and I plan on doing so for the as long as I can. I was watching porn very frequently and I would spend hours at a time. I was completely addicted and I would always brush it off as just ""something guys do"" but now I realise the damage it's done.

I feel like I became so desensitized to straight porn, that I needed something new and different. I watched some gay porn even though I don't find men attractive. I masturbated to it, and a few more times again. I've never had any romantic attraction for men at all and I still don't, but I think the idea of having sex with a man was something I thought was taboo and therefore, attractive. 

Because of this, I feel really confused. I know that I don't like men, but I felt turned on while watching gay porn, so this mean that I'm gay? I can't imagine being in a relationship with a man. 

I'm hoping that by quitting porn and masturbating, that I can feel the way I used to feel. I'd really appreciate some advice, especially if you've been in a similar situation.",24Jul2019,1

10,"I had a bad childhood but it wasn't really bad until depression hitted me on a early age. When I was 10 years old, I cried daily on school because of no reason and people hated me because of it. I was always a quiet guy because of my bad language development and started talking real words when I was 6 years old. I had a agressive stepfather and my real father didn't have any money because of his drug addiction and clinical depression. He lied about everything, just to dissappoint me afterwards. My stepfather abused me mentally when I was 4-8 years old. I don't know much about it anymore but I remember being scared all the time and developing a negative self image. He  called me a piece of shit every day and threaten me once a week with really agressive attitude.

Because of this I was always scared of what he was going to do next. He always was really agressive and I was always the fault of everything. After a long time, my mother left him because he was cheating. We had no house anymore so we lived in a house of someone and paid rent but we didn't had heating or much room because we lived in the ceiling of the house. When I was 10, we moved in our new house and something changed in my brains. I woke up really tired and painful and didn't enjoy things anymore.

I remember the exact day and it was fucking shit. I started to develop anxiety and was scared of dying and got panic attacks every day at the age of 11. I haven't felt a single day since that day without my depression and anxiety coming up. I have mental help for 3 years but it's absolutely shit and tried medication 2 times. Nothing is gonna help me anymore and I tried to kill myself 2 times earlier. It's getting worse and I can't even get out of bed anymore really. I can't sleep good anymore. I can only sleep when it passed 3 AM. My whole body is in constant pain. I get spasms every 5 minuts in my legs and I can't do this anymore. I still cry every day and have constant anxiety and nobody can help me anymore. My psychologist is shit and I can't change. I can't play videogames good anymore because of my lack of concentration.

23," 

My boyfriend (24M) and I (25F) have been dating over a year. About 6 months in (when he was 23) he told me that he was regularly sleeping with a 17 year old girl right up until dating me. OF COURSE I was a bit shaken, grossed out, wanted to vomit. But technically it was legal in the state that it happened in, so he said it was nothing. 

I snooped his laptop once (I know I suck but I was concerned) and found that the only adult videos he watches has “small teen” or “young petite girl” in the title. With a lot of stuff where older men are taking advantage of seemingly high school girls. I know this is common stuff on the internet, but it’s \*all\* he watches. 

He’s also really into anime and the whole thing where every girl looks like a little girl freaks me out, and is very attracted to young celebrities who are technically adults, but look young. 

I also caught him on tinder once when we were in a rough patch. I decided to forgive him, but noticed that he was only messaging girls around 18 or 19 years old. 

His ex girlfriend (22) also looks VERY young for her age. And I have a semi young looking face for a 25 year old. He also tends to check our short/young looking girls. 

Fast forward to this week. He taught at a summer camp for high school kids. He spent a lot of time with them, and with one girl in particular. He admitted to finding her attractive, and she is 16 (still legal age of consent in his state). Now they Snapchat every day and he’s getting her frequent Jobs so that they can work together. He claims nothing is going on, but it’s super weird that it’s happening. I understand that almost all men any age will always find youth attractive, but this seems like a fixation of his. 

I’d like to add that he has a strange obsession with rape. I live in a busy college area of a city and you can hear drunk girls giggle screaming all night. But he will stay up all night to listen to in case someone is getting raped. He claims it’s out of concern but is obsessed. 

TL;DR: SO has a history of technically legal, but very young girls. It feels wrong, but am I just being paranoid? 

I am willing to end the relationship and report him to his job if things go further in order to protect young girls from predators. But obviously this is all speculation at this point.",24Jul2019,2
24,"    I met a guy on tinder about two months ago, I only matched with him because he was on vacation in the small town I live in. He messaged me three times on tinder before I decided to answer because I was bored, the day I answered is the day he left to go back home....all the way in Florida (I live in northern Michigan). I didn’t think much of it at first because I wasn’t really into him, but now we call each other daily and Snapchat each other nonstop. 
   He always tells me how I’m the only one he thinks of, and how he doesn’t talk to other girls the way he talks to me and how he wants me to come visit him. So after having a long conversation with him and a longtime of convincing me I decided to buy a plane ticket to see him at the end of November right after the fall semester ends. 
  He was so excited and told me he can’t wait to see me, and how he’ll take me out on the best dates of my life because while I’m in Florida I’m going to be staying with him at his apartment. We’re both 19. 
  I bought the plane ticket last night while we were on the phone together, but today when we were snap chatting each other he left me on read. Which isn’t a big deal, but three hours later he sent me a random Snapchat of a girl he was sitting next to on the couch. There was no context or anything, just a picture of her. 
  Is he trying to make me jealous? Does he not want me to come? For all I know this girl could be his sister but there was no context to it at all, what made it weirder was that I was left on read for three hours and then that random picture. I didn’t reply back, because I’m hurt. Do I cancel the plane ticket and just never talk to him again or do I ask him who it is? Is he trying to make me jealous? What do I do?",24Jul2019,1

31,"So...back in 2011 I started hanging out with this guy. I fell head over heels for him. We had a summer fling and he treated me like a gf without ever asking me to be his girlfriend. I had suspected he was seeing another girl but I didn't want to admit because I was dumb. Anyway yeah I went on Facebook one day and he was in a relationship. I flipped and confronted him via text and he called me crazy and we didn't speak for 6 months. 

Then I got a boyfriend and moved on. After 6 months he messaged me and we ended up hanging out here and there at night but we didn't do any hooking up it was just as friends. This has kind of gone ever since until 2015 after my bf broke up with me somehow he found out and invited me over and we ended having sex. I thought he must over broken up with his gf, but the way he treated me after sex gave me a bad feeling and then I investigated and found out they were still together. I wanted to find out and tell her but she she had deleted all of her social media. I thought I was done with him but even so we talked a couple more times after that!

35,"Just a month ago I had this really close friend. Nothing bad but then my mom saw him standing next to a gas station and just ASSUMED he steals stuff right there. He also got the idea that he does drugs those were all not true. He was nice and had a job and everything. I was gonna go over to his house then all of a sudden. My mom says quote. ""I don't like friend friend friend friend."" And told me to go to my room. I did and I was really confused. I was gonna go there the next day. Then my mom says go to room. I go off on her. She says we need to talk. Then she says. ""Did you know that he does drugs and steal?"" She told me why she did. I thought her evidence was shit and I told her that's not all true. She legit thought I was a thief. We're both black also so she thought that was a reason we ""stole"". My brother in college was there to back me up. I made many valid points. And she just said. ""Don't ask if this is true."" And then walked away talking to her friends on her phone. She later went to a party with her. ""Friend Friend Friend Friends."" Or close friends. I'm a little upset and sad I don't think I'm depressed but I sometimes still cry about this a lot. The fact is that I think i'm a criminal. And now i'm wasting my summer on my computer and phone instead of doing what I want. Now I fear to make friends cause my mom will just take them away again.",24Jul2019,1
36,"I'm in my 20s now and I have lived a very sheltered life due to my overprotective parents. I never really get to decide to do many things in my life so I grow up with a strong insecure feeling about myself because I think I can never do anything on my own. 

I just feel like I always have extreme parents surveillance everywhere I go throughout my life. Here's a brief list: 
- I've lived in the same room with my parents growing up because they wanted to have an eye on me. I only had my own room when I was around high school, my mom came to check everyday whenever she wanted (day or maybe night at 1-2am). I'm not allowed to lock my room. 
- When I hung out with friends, they would send 1 or 2 of their employees to ""guard"" me the whole time. I remember one time when I was watching a movie with friends at the movie theater and I already told my parents I was gonna go there. That movie took around 2 and a half hours. I silenced my phone since I don't want to be interrupted during the movie. My mom called me 2 times to check on me and I didn't answer. She immediately called 2 people to search everywhere for me. Yelling  my name, searched every theater rooms. I was so embarrassed I never hang out with those friends I was hanging out with again. 
- When I went to university, they bought a house near it so we can live there. I think it's fine to put camera outside all around the house, it's a common thing to do. But they also put it right at my study table to watch me. And putting a schedule to tell me what I need to do throughout the day. Everything I do has to be in their sight. 
- They sent people to play the same games I played so those people would play with me and told my parents what kind of people I talked to online. 
- Going out is limited, once or twice a month (3-5hours maximum every time I go out). Before that was bunch of difficult questions about my friends from my parents for me to answer. 
- When I first got my own cell phones, my mom always watched out how many texts I have texted my friends throughout a month. If I passed the limits of text allowance, she would get suspicious and thought I was having bad friends. She once called directly from my phone to a friend I was texting a lot with and asked him about his identity and his relationship with me. We were just friends and had a lot in common, nothing further. He never contacted me again. 
- Mostly any male person I interact with is considered 'bad'. My parents prevent them from having interact with me. Now I feel very very intimidated when I speak to people especially men. I couldn't order food or pay for my stuff at Target if there's a male cashier. Thankfully they have self-checkout now.

That's a few facts about my life. Secondary and high school years have  been very traumatic because I was bullied at school by both teachers and students, and my parents thought it was my fault or didn't know about he bullying. 

So now I want to get a job so at least I can feel a little bit of independence about myself. When I told my parents that, they opened a tea shop and they want me to work there as their employees. At that time, I just feel like I have to be where my parents want me to. They're never letting me go or make my own life decision. It's not like I'm ungrateful, I just think that I want to go out and find my own first job (or at least putting some effort in finding a job and people actually take you it for it, it shows that your effort has been recognized) and go through life on my own. Because I think I need to learn to survive when I'm all by myself. That's how everyone (or at least around me) grows up. They gain more confidence of their own abilities. They know what they are capable of. And here I am getting my first job without having to worry about resume or effort to put in. So I have a very strong antipathy feeling about my parents' control over me even though they are not as strict as they used to be. 

So my question for you guys is:
Should I go to find a job somewhere else and working on my own independent life or just work for my parents' shop?

P/s: sorry if this post sounds lame.",24Jul2019,3
37,"Idk what to do rn. My mom is mad that my fiancé and I want to move out because we want to stay to finish school here in Florida. 

We initially wanted to move but only because we thought we would finish by a certain time and sadly, we wont be able to so we thought it would be okay to stay down here. 

The reason she wants to move is because she cant afford to live here since she is on a fixed income after my stepdad died. That's fine. But what else has been going on is shes been aggressive with my fiancé and me over everything we do. She thinks we treat her like shit when she was the one who started treating us like shit.

What's fucking petty is that she confronted my fiancé over me and started saying we won't make it down here and that we are on her shit list. She also told my fiancé not to tell me anything she has said about the situation. She even asked him if he told me once we got home. She has kept things from me and only told my fiancé when she has a problem with me....

We are both just done and we don't know what to do. Idek if us moving out is a good idea...",24Jul2019,1
38,"Okay, so here’s some backstory... boyfriend (24M) has rented a house with his mother (50’s) for years, since his parents got divorced he basically took over, he was 14 at the time, he got a job and started helping with the bills, and now pays majority of bills by himself. Well he recently bought the house they were renting (quite convenient!). Me and him have been together for 4 1/2 years, and I waited until the house was completely in his name, and after many conversations about it, to move in. Well, MIL stayed as well. A little background about MIL, she is, how do I put it, very miserable. Will complain about anything and everything, refuses to look for a better job than part time at a grocery store, but complains about always being broke. My boyfriend knows it’s putting a strain on us, with her having no plans on ever leaving. I don’t have much of a relationship with her, as everything I enjoy doing she finds dumb and a waste of time. So I spend most of my time upstairs in my room because MIL invites boyfriends sister and her young children over whenever she wants, whether we are home or not. (They make a mess, eat a lot of our food, and use our brand new washing machine without asking. The washing machine ordeal has gone on for months with no end in sight.) We just don’t know how to put it lightly to her that it is time for her to move out, so we can really start our life together. I know that when something is said, I will be enemy number one, which is fine at this point. Any advice on how to bring the topic up lightly, without seeming like he is a mean son? 

I apologize if this was all over the place, my brain is scattered thinking about this

They say they will quit and I see them make a sincere effort for a few weeks but then they relapse and spiral back into the same cycle.

47,"I quit my job about a month ago. I am just finishing an MBA and had previously been a software architect and software manager, even a product manager for 2 weeks before I threw in the towel on my life.

My wife wants to take the opportunity to lead the family. We have two young girls under 6. We moved in with my inlaws. We have someone renting our house for another year (been there for a year already and are exceptionally good renters, we were lucky).

I'm having trouble finding any will to provide for my family. I feel completely broken and useless. I know I should be looking for another job, but I have no desire to look. I've always been someone who had trouble separating himself from work, so needless to say I've been off balance since I quit.

It gets worse though, i dont have much desire to even be a father. My kids are amazing, but I cant really stand to be around them longer than 5 minutes before they annoy me. My wife is cool and all, but I just have no desire to be a husband because I feel like such a failure at life. I couldnt sustain the life that I was providing for them. I feel guilty because we went from a cushy 6 figure salary to literally nothing and now I cant provide the opportunities such as ballet and sports for my 2 girls.

I know people will say things like ""find a hobby"" or something, but right now the only thing I want to do is play xbox and swim.  I'm sure I have depression. I've been addicted to porn since i was 12 years old, back in the AOL days (am mid 30s now).  I hate porn, but it is the only thing that gives me dopamine now. I quit smoking pot and taking adderall for money reasons.

Sorry for this being all over the place, but right now I cant really think straight. I'm trying.

I feel like getting another job would put me right back in the place where I was, which is exactly where I dont want to be.  But to make matters worse, I really want the nice things that I could afford before I quit my job.

Everything seems so pointless. Why get a job to get back to where all my money goes to fund things for everyone else?  Now we cant even pay our bills, but at least I don't wake up and punch holes in my walls anymore.

If I could get a job i'd want my old job back. It was actually awesome and I liked everyone, but that ship has sailed, I frustrated nearly everyone there when i put in my notice and I would be too embarrassed to go back.

I'm a fucking mess of a human. I dont even know why I hate my life so much, from the outside looking in I had the perfect life (as many had told me). Please give me some advice.",24Jul2019,5

49,"As a broke college student still living at home to save money, I am getting fed up with being treated like I'm in high school. 

My mom is pretty conservative about clothes, and still babies me with mine. When half my boobs are hanging out while I lay on my stomach, I understand and thank her for warning me. But she feels a need to pull my shirts down as far down my butt as possible when they are most comfortable and flattering when they sit on my hips. If I'm standing up and nearly any chest, not even breasts, but chest is showing, she'll tell me to pull up my shirt, if not try to do it for me.

And the reason I'm posting, leggings. My mom is a firm believer in the ""leggings are not pants"" mindset, so when I'm with her, I have to wear shorts over my leggings. I did my own thing today and went into work with just leggings and a nice plad shirt (there's not a dress code, but I still try to look respectful). My boss and coworkers wear leggings, it's not taboo there. Heck, I've seen women wear leggings without something to cover their butts lead worship at church, so its not a shy subject anywhere in my life except with my mom! Honestly, today I took advantage of my freedom and wore the leggings to work. I didn't change anything when I got home, and I did get home before my mom, so she wasn't like instantly suspicious, until I'm making supper.


Mom: did you wear those [the leggings] all day?

Me [Not wanting to lie, and trying to enforce my independence]: ""yes"".

Mom: ""just like that?"" 

Me: ""yes""

Mom: ""don't....... do that again.""

Me: ""k""

And these clothes complaints aren't just a work thing. It could be us walking down a quiet street to her having come into my room, where I was previously by myself. It's gotten to the point that one time she threatened that I would have to find my own ride if I didn't swap my leggings/shorts combo for jeans.

And to be honest, I wear my leggings/shorts combo to school and just take the shorts off.

I've just about had it with my fashion police mom, and I don't know what to do! She's dead set in her ways, and I don't know if talking will help anything, but I don't want to snap if anything else happens. Until I move out or have more independence, what do I do?",24Jul2019,1

56,"So I’ve met a guy from a dating app and we went on our first date today. It was fun and we both had a great time. He likes my personality and finds me beautiful and I feel the same thing about him.

He went to military three years ago and our conversation revolved mostly on his experiences. It was odd of me to asked him if he likes guns or if he owns one. He said he has 2 and that he likes gun. I’m okay with that but I had trauma with guns ever since my dad had this incident when I was a kid. My dad almost shot himself when he was drunk playing with his gun. I’m not scared of guns, though what I’m scared of are the possibilities that can happen when someone has it. I asked him if he has one in his car. He said nope.

He dropped me off at my place. I can’t let him in my apartment because that can lead to things that are too soon to do. Iykwim. We said goodbye to each other and hope for a next date.

When I got home, he texted me that his gun isn’t in his car. It was with him all the time we were together. I was shocked because I was totally clueless that he had it with him. His justification for carrying it with him was he’s scared that he’ll get cat fished on a first date as what happened to his brother. That I might be a fake guy and I have gang guys who’ll rob him later. 

I really like him but it’s hard for me to tell if I can trust him knowing that he hid a gun with him all the time we were together. I told him if he wanted to continue seeing me, he should be more honest. 

Should I give this guy another shot? Am I overreacting? What he did was scary cause what if he drop it? We can get in trouble for that. What else should I be wary of if I continue to go out with him?

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.iv seen dudes sit there and she seems different and happy and then she’s all bubbly then as opposed to her usually being snotty af


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

that night i messaged her and asked if, when she has free time, if she wants to spend time together outside of work...

she didn’t reply, so I let her know I’ll back away, out of respect for her and myself.

“message me anytime if she wants to talk to someone who relates and will listen without judging you, for advice, about life etc in whatever capacity you feel comfortable.”

and I went on to explain how she can talk to me without any expectations of me making any advances towards her, to talk or meet up etc...

so just kinda like a help line ya know? we won’t have any sort of relationship friendship etc... just simply a mentor kinda person, someone who relates.

62,"A little information, I have been working as a barista for 4+ years at a number of different cafes and the long-term goal is to open up my own shop. I am also in university and mostly work nights and weekends. I have been working at my current cafe for almost a year now and it is probably the most relaxed job you could ever think of. The cafe rarely gets busy and my owners are super chill with me just doing work on my laptop as long as the cafe isn't neglected. I also recently became ""Manager"" (Manager in quotations bc there aren't a lot of responsibilities and not a very good pay raise) The cafe is also really close to my home and school which makes things really convenient. 

Today I got a message from a friend that is giving me first dibs on a job for a grand opening of a new cafe. This cafe roasts all their own beans and bakes everything in-house. Which are two major things that I want to do in my shop and things that my current shop doesn't do. I would be getting the same hours that I'm currently working and the same wage as well. I personally can see myself growing and learning a lot of things from working here. 

Which is the better option? On one hand, my current job meshes perfectly with school, It's really close to school and home, there isn't a shred of stress, and some of my responsibilities give me good experience for when I have my own shop. On the other hand, here's a job that aligns closely to what I want to create, offers the same hours/wage, and would push me to grow more as a barista.

In middle school, I was sent to a school in the nice part of town. My sneakers had holes, my hair was messy, and I was awkward and shy. Perfect target. I was called names , had girls lie and tell me guys liked me, I eventually ate lunch in the bathroom. I was caught and the teacher screamed at me and said I was ""hiding"", I did it again and she gave me a look of disgust and sent me to lunch.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

High school was hell. I was harassed by a boy for a full year, had things stolen from me, hit, pushed into walls. A girl stole my lunch out of my hands one day. I had entire classes full of people make fun of me and all I could do was sit there. One year a girl threw a TEXTBOOK at me and her and her friends laughed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Years later, I still haven't moved on. I stalk my bullies social media and most of them are doing ok. ""Karma is so real guys"".

Some of them I message"" you were a bully"" and they either don't care or laugh it off. Others I message "" your are so mean spirited and wrong. I haven't been able to afford therapy yet so in the meantime this is what works. I was told I could be sued for defamation of character.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do? Karma doesn't exist.",24Jul2019,0

When looking at my options, apparently Biology is still an option as with going into majors like sociology, gender studies, etc. but I’m really apprehensive about those options mainly as bio would still require the quarter of physics that I’m dropping and I never want to even attempt another math or physics class for the rest of my life. I hate both of the subjects and even if it’s a prerequisite, I actually tried this past quarter only to just fuck up so there’s no use in trying. I’d rather drop out than do either subject. 

I’m really freaking out because summer session was a ton of money compared to the year and my parents are telling me if I go ahead and drop that they won’t help pay for my current campus and I’ll be forced to attend the same CSU as my sibling and they’ll pick my major. To make things worse the major they want requires more math and physics and I’d rather drop out entirely than touch another math or physics book.

Friend A came to us after a week long break from school saying that he had finally lost his virginity. Obviously we were all proud of him.
After a week or two  things calmed down, but then friend A cameand told us  that the girl he had slept with had gotten pregnant and she had told him that the child was his. Obviously we were shocked at this but then he told us that she wasn’t allowing him to be involved with the child’s life because of his age ( she was apparently 18-19) 
After this we were all there supporting him and trying to give him ideas on what he could do legally and such.

3 years later. I found out that he had lied about the whole thing and had been faking being upset and the updates on the child.

75,"33/f. I’ve been mildly overweight (obese as a young teen) since I was 12. Since 16 years old I’ve been utterly obsessed with my weight, my body and my looks. I think about it every day. I am extremely uncomfortable in my own skin.

The hilarious thing is that while desperately (DESPERATELY) wanting to lose weight, I have very little willpower and have never managed to shed the weight that is making me miserable. I give up every single day. My BMI is 24.5 and I want to scream and rip off my own skin. Nothing works. I have failed so many times that my will to try has been exhausted.

I genuinely don’t believe therapy could help me, and I’m unemployed, so cannot even afford it. It has driven me to thoughts of suicide many times. I find myself hating my body so much I don’t want to have sex with my boyfriend. He is also uncomfortable with the amount of importance I place on my looks, and tells me I’m being silly. 

Everyone says looks aren’t the be all and end all. But I never felt like I was lacking in kindness or a good personality. To go through life never feeling beautiful, never having felt comfortable in my body, always feeling miserable and angry and hating myself for being so physically ugly (and failing at being able to do anything about it for the last 20 years)... I am at the end of my rope. 

I don’t feel like a woman, or deserving of romantic love, because I am hideous and clearly powerless as well (clearly if I could change myself, it would have happened by now? It is genuinely the only thing that I have ever truly wanted).

My mom is a stay home mom so she is always with me during the day. My dad works a regular 5-9 job. My grandparents are visiting from their home in Taiwan (mom's side). My mom and dad aren't your usual lovey-dovey type. My dad often verbally abuses my mom, and often i'm afraid of talking back to him. Although recently when I do talk back to him he listens, i'm kind of the most powerfull member of the family, physically and verbally.

Recently my parents relationship has been toxic. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of our cars had broken down (but could still drive barely) and my father, mother, and me were the only ones aware. After my father told us that the car had broken down, he headed out on his motorcycle and my mother and I took a nap, at no time did my grandparents come out of thier room, and so it was impossible to tell them that the car had broken down. 

&amp;#x200B;

While we were sleeping my grandma took the car that was broken, and took it out to buy groceries, my grandpa, mother, and I were all unaware of this. When my father came home, he yelled at my mom for not telling my grandma that the car was broken down. But obviously it was not our fault since niether my mother nor I had saw my grandma before we fell asleep, and we had no idea that she would go out by herself. My grandma had not brought her phone and had not told anybody where she was going. We had eventually found her and we saw my grandma and my father lolly holly happily talking like it was nothing, and when my father saw my mother he ignored her. Why was he mad at my mother who was not at fault, and not mad at my grandma who was the one at fault?

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.iv seen dudes sit there and she seems different and happy and then she’s all bubbly then as opposed to her usually being snotty af


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

&amp;#x200B;

We recently moved out of an apartment, the lease is for 2.5 years (I sub-leased it and I was in the apartment for 1 year). When we did the final walkthrough the apartment folks mentioned we were looking max $800 in cleaning or whatever charges. A couple of weeks later we got our final bills and I was surprised to see close to $1600 charges. They haven't provided proofs for most of the charges. I emailed manager asking about charges and how did it bump from $800 to $1600. I am waiting for a response from them. My friends who previously stayed in the same apartment complex had similar issues, when they tried to talk, apartment people were rude and threated to put my friends to collections. What are my options here? Do I have to just pay them whatever they ask for?

112,"work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Jokingly as a said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that’ and repeated it again also and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and she checked out hunks a lot etc but got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t say anything was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually quiet as a mouse.",24Jul2019,0
113," 

I am Reaching out to reddit for life advice, I will do my best to explain things. My internet Friend who we will call ‘Ryu’ we had been playing online games and talked to each other almost every day on voice chat using discord. We got to be close friends and made plans to live together (we been online friends two years). Well after some time he and his girlfriend took a U-Haul from Nevada to Kansas and moved into a Two-bedroom apartment I rented for us. The agreement was I would support them until they found jobs and we would split the bills 50/50. 

I'm a 30-year-old single dude (born in 87) with end stage renal disease on kidney dialysis who also works part time. Ryu and his GF are both born in the year 2000 and where both working in Nevada. For the first three months there was not ever one interview or callback. My friend insisted there was no one hiring and that he has been putting in applications and calling all the time. The more I asked the more tension between us. When finally, I decided to act and went to McDonalds who I had just found out does walk in interviews in my area and got the number to setup an interview. Went home and made Ryu call and he had an interview the next day, funny thing was that they couldn’t find his application, so he had to put in another one. He has hired quickly and what kind of bugs me was the first place I inquired about I was about to get him an interview which makes me wonder if he was ever really trying.

I pay over $1000 alone in just rent, electricity, and internet which my whole SSDI check goes too and then my partime job covers food expenses, Gas, insurance, etc. The issues is they are concerned with their personal bills which are there cell phone bill and direct TV contract they are stuck in(from Nevada) which all adds up to about $300 a month but doesn’t seem quite concerned about our bills  (rent,eletricity,internet)

The other issue is that I feel like I'm being used. How is it that I can feel invisible in my own home? Ryu is a self-absorbed person and unless you take interests in what he is doing he won't give you a second thought. He never takes an interest in me as a person, I could be having a bad day he won't notice or don’t care, I even asked him about this and he admitted that he doesn’t know why he does it, I expressed my feelings and the next day it was all the same. Something he also said that night I talked to him is “all we have in common are video games and I'm growing out of that” despite him playing them 24/7, but that made me think that he may have been saying that he is growing out of our friendship?

I have given them a lot, and I never felt appreciated either. I know he not going to make enough to cover what he should be paying because they are going to cover their personal bills first and they are going to want to spend money on games, eating out, vape juice, ect.. I'm at the point that I am thinking about seeking a therapist for my mental health as everyday this is on my mind and sometimes brings me to tears.

Should I not be bothered that I am left behind whenever we walk anywhere together because I walk slow

Should I be bothered that often I feel invisible when I am at home (am not talked too or acknowledge)

Should I be bothered if I try to have a conversation and you behave like I’m bothering you?

Should I be bothered that you only have negative things to say to me?

Should I be bothered that you can’t even say goodnight when you guys head to bed that I have to say it first just for you to say that.

Should I not be bothered that I always make sure you guys have food to eat and keep the fridge stocked with your essentials but never thanked or helped with shopping.

Should I be bothered that unless i am taking an interest in what you are doing I might as well not even be there.

Should I be bothered that you have never once asked me how I was doing, how was my day or anything at all about me at all?

Even after all that, I still love my friend, he was there almost every day playing games with me when I was in some dark times and gave me the motivated to better myself, to not give up and move away from my family that had me in a toxic environment. But he is like a sponge sucking me dry, he keeps taking and taking and I never get anything back.  I don’t know how to handle it.",24Jul2019,1
114,"For about a year now, I've been spending as much time as possible, after work and on weekends, to create stories and art based around this world, that has been with me for years. To be frank, I would like to be able to make a living off of writing these stories, because it's literally the thing that brings me the most joy, and I want to spend all my time doing it. I've created a website, and post regularly, but I have social anxiety, so It's difficult for me to keep up with social media accounts. (I'm not sure if I should post the link to the website unless asked for, because I don't want this to be some kind of attempt at promotion.)

I think what I'm creating is good, and I will continue to create, whether or not anyone else appreciates it, but at the same time, I guess I'm looking for some proof that what I'm creating isn't just trash, or bad. I honestly just want some feedback form people, but wherever I post, people just don't seem interested, and that seems like confirmation that what I write and create is uninteresting. Where can I go to get feedback, or advise on if what I'm doing is good, or has a chance of succeeding?",24Jul2019,3
115,This question is mostly directed at girls. I go to a big college and we have a big gym. I usually go at the same time and see the same very cute girl. I feel like I always catch her looking at me but I might just be in my own head. I never talk to girls at the gym because I know its just not the move lol but I would really like to talk to this girl. Is there a way to appropriately approach a girl at the gym or should I just wait until the day I see her around and talk to her then. I asked a girl friend of mine and she said she would automatically shut pretty much any guy down that tried to talk to her at the gym just out of principle of minding your own business at the gym. Really just want to hear some opinions.,24Jul2019,10

117,"I've been informed I am the top candidate for a job with the state.  The last step is references, so I'm confident I will receive an offer by the end of the week.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm freaking out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've been at my current job for two years.   

&amp;#x200B;

46K + between 1000-2000 in overtime/bonus + 5% 401K match (subject/perhaps likely to decrease)  

&amp;#x200B;

plenty of vacation/fairly flexible schedule  

&amp;#x200B;

health insurance-not great but I'm also young and healthy  

&amp;#x200B;

I walk to work--it's ten minutes away.  But in about 8 months I will probably be looking for a house further away.   

&amp;#x200B;

mostly enjoy my job and I have a good boss  

&amp;#x200B;

what I don't like-I'm not sure I want to move up in the field I'm in.  It involves an incredible amount of responsibility and supervising a large team of people who are underpaid.  Turnover in the field is high.  I'm also worried about the financial health of my nonprofit.   

&amp;#x200B;

POSSIBLY free/greatly reduced daycare....but that is like five years away....four at minimum.   

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Job offer

between 61-90K  

&amp;#x200B;

2 year temp position--not sure how likely it is I would be hired on after.  Probably depends on my performance.    

&amp;#x200B;

retirement-there is a pension but it's only really valuable if I stay for five or more years   

&amp;#x200B;

health insurance-awesome   

&amp;#x200B;

time off-not great but not terrible.  not sure how much flexibility I would have as this seems to be a BIG role crammed into 2 years.    

&amp;#x200B;

It's related to an aspect of my job that I enjoy.  I'm excited because it could really get me going on a new career path, one I feel I might enjoy more.  I WOULDN'T HAVE TO SUPERVISE PEOPLE!!!!  Or deal with the turnover!!    

&amp;#x200B;

But----the job description is seven fucking pages!!!  This would really be a high level position.  One with lots of reading, writing, and public speaking.  One that has the potential to have a huge impact.  I feel I'm not very qualified.....but at the same time there were only two qualification listed and I met them.    

&amp;#x200B;

Also--I really enjoy having my time off!!  I was already thinking about a big trip to Norway next summer.  I don't think that could happen if I take this job.  

&amp;#x200B;

In a way, taking this job would be like being in a PhD program.  I would get a ton of experience/credentials.  I have would have a huge project to work on (thesis).   It could really set me up for something in the future.  Or it could emotionally drain me and I could feel suffocated.    

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm comfortable in my current position.  Maybe sometimes even complacent.  but at the same time, there are a lot of new and exciting projects I can work on....I just have to be self directed.  My boss really doesn't impose a whole lot on me.  This new position would definitely require a high level of output.  I start to learn towards staying at my current job, but I understand....I won't be here forever (I'm only 26).  So why wait?  Just take the leap now while I have a good offer in my hand.",24Jul2019,1

122,"After working at the same place, and doing Ziplines for over 11 years, I have quit my management job. Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cg4oct/a_zipline_career/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app). Well, I saw it coming, and had been looking around for new opportunities. One of the places I applied to was in a different state, and was kinda for giggles, and to see what my skills were worth. I figured for whatever reason they wouldn’t like my portfolio, and would probably respond with a negative, if they responded at all.  It was at a multi-million dollar resort in a really expensive place to live. Well the day after I quit, I got an email back from them saying that I am qualified for the position. I was kinda floored, as I wasn’t expecting it, and it presented an exciting opportunity. Here is a small snippet from their response. 

Thank you for your interest in our Assistant Zipline Operations Manager position.
We inquire with the possible qualified applicants what their salary expectation is.  We want to ensure that your desired salary is within our budgeted range.
Also, please answer the following:
When would you be available to relocate?
Are you aware of and prepared for (the area)’s cost of living?

I’m not exactly sure how to respond. If the deal is right I could see moving my wife and two kids there, but I would be moving away from my family, and my kids are really close with their grandma. The area I live in is low income, and medium cost of living. The area I would move to has a high cost of living. 

I guess what I’m asking for is advice on how to answer this email to get the best deal. How do I avoid asking for too much or too little? How long should I take to answer the email (they took about a week to respond to mine)? How long do you think I could push out the relocation, or should I be ready to do it soon? For people who have relocated for jobs, was it worth it? For people who have left close family behind for a job, was it worth it? I want to do this right, and I would love to get opinions from people who are not vested in the matter. Feel free to ask questions and I will try to elaborate if needed.

Thanks for taking the time to read my post(s).",24Jul2019,1
123,"Evening y’all, got a request for some family advice. 

Rundown; my girlfriend &amp; I are planning a move next year to either GA or TN. We looked into the economical aspect of things in both our fields (transportation and nursing) and we decided on both those states. We’re going to do more research into which we ultimately choose. 

Now here comes the advice. My parents (54 and 48) are currently living in my teenage friend who is basically their other sons living room (they pay rent) with their dog and cat. My friend doesn’t have an issue, in fact he loves having them there. My mom cooks/cleans, my dad helps with repairs around the house and also pays rent. They have a lease, which is up in February, and my friend has decided to not sign a new one but instead buy a house that’s a foreclosure and needs a LOT of work. I respect that, my parents respect that, good stuff. I thought they were going to move in with him to the new place since he offered it, but my father has COPD and lives off of SSDI and odd jobs. Roughly $2k a month, usually overdrafting his account with previous debts. He has taken out multiple payday loans before. In my teenage years they filed for bankruptcy, financially speaking they aren’t all that good with money. Their credit history is shit, and they’ve been evicted from the previous place they lived. My sister kicked them out due to an issue with her POS husband (who really is a POS). 

My girlfriend and I offered to have them move in with us when we move in August 2020. My father however, doesn’t see why in August and is making it seem like it’s my fault he can’t move in with us into our one bedroom apartment for February-August 2020. We would absolutely love to have them, however, we have no room until August 2020. They want to move back to the state they were previously in, but I see them falling behind drastically and resorting to eating MRE’s again (they did that for ~2 months before I found out). 

Any advice is appreciated. I really do appreciate you guys in advance.",24Jul2019,1
124,"To all who care: 

I am in a situation where I hate my job, want to leave, nothing to fall back on, and other factors are weighing heavily. 

Just graduated college in May with a bachelors in Journalism, minor in Sports media. Also played baseball at my school all four years. Great experience being a full time student-athlete as it is really a job in its own. 

Got a sales job through a headhunting service for graduates student-athletes, and in over a week, I absolutely HATE IT. Cold Calling, walking into business, soliciting our services, I hate all of it. I took the job simply because I needed an income and now I want to quit. 

I also drove for Lyft/Uber part time during school and I have that to fall back on if need be. Money isn’t great but still something. 

I’m looking into a job that plays much more into my degree and what I would enjoy (sports social media/marketing) but if I ended up getting the job, it wouldn’t be for a couple weeks. I’m very hopeful on this position and I’m doing everything I can to get it but it’s not guaranteed. 

I’m getting little/no help from my own parents and I have other people to answer to including 1. The lady who got me the job 2. Girlfriends parents who I don’t want to think less of me.

I want to get into that industry sooner or later, but I cannot stand this current job I have and if I quit, my only source of income would be driving rideshare. I know I shouldn’t quit my current job, but should I? 

And does anyone know of a shorter, decent way to make money while essentially in between jobs? Or while I search for a new job?

Today I had to collect some papers and go for several offices in order to ready driver's license folder ( i hope this is clear, im not a native speaker) and it really felt awesome, because I was active all day, and HAVE SOMETHING TO DO, the thing in studying is when I finish my study session, I need to go out to do something, staying at home makes me suffer mentally.

I mean on one hand I could probably get a sexy psychologist but it would be a stretch even then.

A psychology major would be wonderful. It’s not that I am not good looking. I think I am.

But here’s where I draw the line. I don’t think a neurotypical model is gonna go out of with me right (and I look at the individual) because I have autism.

Now a guy once gave me advice. He said girls like homesty. I am very honest. I am a little overweight but I was told by him “you have a good body. Lose a little weight and you will get a sexy girlfriend.”

But I’m autistic though and my social skills are inferior. My intelligence is high but that along with autism is nerdy, even if I have really good looks.

My interests are probably too autistic and not the kinds of things I think a girl is typically interested in (most of the time).

And I have psychosis too. I hallucinate. I think if I bring that up on a first date it’s going to make her lose interest. I don’t think girls like guys with mental illness.

I know a lot of girls say they like autistics but I just feel like they are humoring people like me.

But maybe I am hoping I am just being negative.

I could go out with someone attractive, fall in love immediately (hopefully), then say “ok look, let me tell you in private but I am not just autistic, I’m also psychotic” and try to be honest and I really want to lose the weight, find a girl, then do that.

But I feel like that’s a “your doomed if you do, your doomed if you don’t” scenario where you would totally fail if you were me. If I do, then I am honest but I just told someone I am psychotic and that probably won’t go well. If I don’t I am certain with my poor social skills she will see through it. I will be forced to confess because I cannot lie. And then she will lose interest.

I just don’t think psychosis is sexy and it feels like it will probably ruin the relationship.

Even if I lose a little weight (because people keep telling me “dude, lose a little weight. You have a very good body”), and I am working out and I am losing weight, but anyways even if I do that and miraculously a beautiful psychology major says “I think your hot, I cannot help it” which actually sounds like what people are implying to be nice to me, it looks to me like I will mention being psychotic and women are just not programmed to like psychosis. Then psychotic and autism makes it worse.

I’m more attracted to neurotypical women than autistics for some reason.

139,"So I posted this same question a couple days ago but it was super long and wordy so I'll condence it as much as possible here.

I'm 16 and have just left secondary school. I want to do spanish A-level in collage, since I enjoyed doing it at GCSE and would like to continue doing it. I start collage in September so naturally it would make sence to just continue my spanish studies to give myself a head start.

After collage, I want to study in iceland, because its iceland. I love iceland and icelandic. So I should learn icelandic to give myself the best shot at that goal, right?

I also love Romanian. Admitidly I started learning romanian to impress a uh.... let's call her a crush but I soon developed a love of the language. I was going to start learning Romanian again (after stopping because of GCSE exams) during the summer break I'm on now.

Which should I choose? I was told learning more than one language at a time can make it a slower process than learning them one at a time? 

Dont get me wrong, I love all 3 languages, I find learning them interesting, but I feel like spanish will benefit my academic life in collage, but icelandic will help me achieve my goals after that, in 2-3 years.

What do you think?",24Jul2019,1
140,"Hello and thanks for reading this and sorry for the wall of text.
I'm a mess, and I need some advice/help to at least get something out my life.

I'm a guy and 23 years old, currently studying to become a software engineer and currently on my third semester. I live at home with my parents, and I pay rent every month. For the last 3 years, I have been smoking weed, and currently it's bad. I started smoking because I have a spine injury, and it helped with the pain, but for the last year, I have started to increase the daily ""dose"" of weed. It have gotten to the point, where it's the first thing in the morning and last thing before bed, and I'm not just talking a joint here, it's 6-7 bong hits, something even 14 hits. This happens several times a day, and typical from 10PM, it's 6-7 bong hits every 1-2 hour until 5AM and then I go to sleep until 4-5PM, I have no work, but I do some freelance programming now and then. The worst part is, I have noticed that my memory and concentration, have gone really bad.

I keep asking myself ""Why do I do this, what do I get out of it etc."" and I have no motivation/energy to do anything. Everyday I have multiple ideas for stuff I can code, but never do anything. I end up just playing games or watching YouTube while drinking lots of cola. Even my school projects or homework is just tossed aside for playing games and getting high.

Multiple times I have told myself, that today was last day and gonna pull a cold turkey, but first thing next morning, go smoke multiple hits, and then I get mad at myself for doing it.

Anyone that have been in the same situation, and have some great advice, then it will be accepted with lots of gratitude and love.

Once again, thanks a thousand times for reading.
Peace.


TLDR: Guy at 23 years old, been smoking weed for 3 years, smoke around 50 bong hits a day, no work but doing freelance programming, live with parents and pay rent. Over the last year it has become really bad, can't remember stuff, don't do homework and plays PC all day. Started to get mad at myself and shaming. Anyone been in situation like this??",24Jul2019,1

147,"Ok so I  like my female best friend but she's making me very very confused. Before I start this will be along one and also my female best friend only does this stuff I'm about to say to me, she doesn't rlly talk to any other guys. So me and my best friend are very touchy like very. We do some things that can be very comparable to couples. At first, we only hugged and held hands and leaned on each other and then it escalated to her resting on me and her touching me and me putting my hands up her shirt and rubbing her back and playing with her hair,touching her thighs and her lips and she seems to very much enjoy the attention. She also touches my chest(not alot tho) my hair,my shoulders,puts her arms around me or around my arm, touches my back and all that stuff. Like everytime I hanged out with her I escalate it to see how she reacts and just recently I give her playful bites like on her body(ear,neck,arm,face and legs) and she tells me it feels very good and she even tells me to do it sometimes and also she likes it when I bite hard cuz it feels good to her depending on the mood(she likes it especially when I bite her neck). She also bites me like on my chest cuz she  likes how hard it feels,she also bites my neck,back,shoulders and collarbone and arm and I remark I also feel pleasure from it which she likes. I also lick her while I bite her and she seems to like it and once I liked her arm as a joke and she put her arm to my tongue and took it out and kept on doing it. She's also a sub and she says I bring out her submissiveness a lot and she also says she loves my dominance and she likes to I command to her to do things like tie my shoes or st. She likes to remark how she likes how dom I am and I do the same about her subness. Also just recently I put my hand up or down her pants and i touched her butt like her butt cheeks and she didnt mind at all and when i put my hand out to check my phone she says ""put that mf (my hand)back"" which I laughed and put my hand back up her pants. Like I even like squeezed it a little and I even have my hand on it sometimes(like on her pants where her butt is located) . I also touch her chest area like rub it but only touches her top boob area or around there and I put my hand down her shirt there too.  She also likes when I lift her up or carry her and when I pet her hair. Just recently,i got too caught up the mood and I kissed her cheek and she said""awhh thank you"".She even calls me baby or baby boy or cutie which I also do and I call her my pet(as a dom thing) and my kitty(cuz she likes cats a lot). She also doesn't like when I have attention on other ppl like girls and she says she cringes at the thought of me being intimate with other girls and she shows annoyance towards the girls that liked me like whenever I bring it up. She also compares us to couples and two ppl of the opposite gender and she says""they arent as cute as us"" or ""they arent as intimate as us"" and she likes to talk down on em and put us higher. She also once said ""that's it,my heart only has room for u"" like recently and we say how much we mean to each other and also how much we love each other. She also agreed with me when I said that another reason why im so touchy with her is cuz I find her attractive and I also said thank god I'm a dom(cuz she likes doms) and that I'm not ugly or obese or st and she's like ikr thank god u arent or else I wouldnt be touchy with u and be like this. So far so great right? Lots and lots of hints. Well yes but not. When she does compare us to couples she sometimes says ""wow we are so much cuter and we are just friends"" or things like that. She also says  how she cant believe how she has sm love for  someone(me) who's a friend and also she says wow we are awesome friends and also she always calls us a pair like she's tryna avoid saying couple. She also talks about her future sometimes and mentions a husband and kids and how she wants to care for my kids when I'm busy in the future and she says ""one day when I get a boyfriend this and this"" and just recently she asked when she does want a boyfriend(which wont be for a while cuz she says she prefers to be with me rn and concentrate on school). She says a lot of friendzone like phrases like that but she still does all the stuff we do and enjoys it.

151,"Ok so for some context I’m 13 and I’m moving to a house that’s currently being built in a month or so and because of that we were going furniture shopping with my grandparents and my mom 

So we get into one of the shops and I see all sorts of stuff that intrigues me but a theme i See is black and gold now I have all black furniture (except a bookcase) that my parents bought me and I think that the gold would go great in my room right? So I take pictures of a bunch of the stuff  and I’m pointing out all the things I think would go good in my new room!and my mom and grandparents seem to agree!!

So now we’re on the way home and I’m obsessing over how I’m going to decorate and how I can’t wait to get black and gold and my mom doesn’t object at all 

So fast forward to about 20 minutes ago and I’m talking to both my parents about my new room and the black and gold and my mom tells me all of a sudden “your not getting black and gold I don’t want your room to look like some 1970s disco party and I’m not buying you new furniture“ even though I only wanted a clock a shelf and some paper/pencil holders 

So I argue for a bit sulk and leave there room to make this post for advice

Our first real practice is Aug. 12 and she just informed me yesterday that she'll be out of town that entire week. This is the only week of the season when it's only practice. Having someone assist with practice makes it better for everyone. I responded to her email stating the timing of the vacation is problematic since our season begins Aug. 12.

157,"I knew lots of kids who’s parents were already divorced even at a young age. My best friends parents got divorced in the 6th grade. 

I’ll briefly explain, maybe it’s TMI but maybe someone can relate. I’ll try to keep it short.

My dad was diagnosed with mental illness when I was in 6th grade (minor OCD, general anxiety disorder, depression). Basically at the time my dad was extremely stressed with work/life/family and ended up having a psychotic breakdown brought on by severe sleep deprivation. He gets it from his mom. 
My mom didn’t know how to handle it. My dad has to go to the hospital for a few weeks. My dad was having severe delusions. Lost his job because of it. Didn’t get out of bed for 11 months. My mom had to go to therapy, but stayed by his side while he got his meds sorted out. 
The meds helped and my dad finally seemed back to normal up until about 3-4 years ago. 

It started when my aunt and uncle moved back into the state. My parents hung out with my aunt and uncle a lot and my dad behaved inappropriately by asking my moms sister for nudes. 
Even after that, my mom stayed with him. 
Then we moved to a new city to start over. My dad started Lyft drying for “extra cash”. My dad got a personal trainer who could “only meet up after 10 pm”. My dad started spending a lot of money and my mom only snooped to see where his money was going and realized he was paying for multiple dating sites. My dads brother saw him at the movie theatre with another woman. 
Even after that, my mom stayed with him.
Finally, last May we went on a family camping trip to spend quality time as a family. Instead, my dad was busy making two girls so uncomfortable that they called the police.
My dad was ticketed with sexual harassment and my mom kicked my dad out the second we got home. 


Anyway, my question is how many people are there out there who’s parents split up during their adult life? How did you feel about it? And how did it make you feel when they started dating again? 
I honestly thought I handled it well. Looking back I realized I’ve lost 10 pounds and hate the thought of my mom re-marrying.",24Jul2019,1

Okay, so I am currently 16-years-old and unfortunately, due to the fact that my parents don't believe in mental illness unless you were traumatized, I have not been formally diagnosed with anything.

So, ever since I was a child, I remember being very pessimistic and sad, generally. I have always hated myself and everything about myself. Of course, becoming a teenager, these things became soooo much worse, as my hormones decided to have a raving party I wasn't invited to and tore my brain up, haha. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, going into a teen (*around ten*), I started to develop some pretty bad eating habits, as I would sort of not eat to punish myself, along with hurting myself in other ways. Additionally, I became more tired and irritable which just made people sort of dislike me. Since I was young, I have always been quite shy and introverted, but at some unknown point, I began to fear socializing. It is so bad now. It may have to do with me thinking I'm ugly or something, but I truly don't know. Again, my hormones had a *raving* party that I wasn't invited to so  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  

&amp;#x200B;

In high school, freshmen year, I found myself getting worse and worse. I was always crying, whether it be in class or a bathroom stall. I was beginning to hurt myself more heavily on the daily, and I began to isolate myself completely. I found myself unable to leave my bed, complete homework, study... anything. Especially on school breaks, such as summer break.   

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my parents, particularly my mother, is 100,000 % against pills. She thinks it is giving up or signing out in life. I can't take pills for my supposed depression or anxiety. I can't get pills to at least be functioning. It sucks. But I need some advice.    

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any tips on how to energize myself or tips on how to get at least *something* done? I have impossible summer assignments, my room looks like a hurricane swept through here, it's hard to take a shower, brush my teeth... I sleep about nine to twelve hours every day, and if I could, I would stay in bed with the lights out all day. All I do is cry when I am by myself and everything just hurts. All of the time it feels like I have elephants sitting on my eyes, trying to get me to fall asleep. I can't focus on things as I used to and it's only getting worse.   

&amp;#x200B;

If you struggle like me, or if you have any tips, how do you motivate yourself to keep going? How do you keep your house decently clean, let alone your room? How do you get things done, like pay bills and stuff? If are going to recommend medicine, do you know of any natural remedies I can make at home or buy off of Amazon?

166,"I'm 19 and a student. I live with my parents and older brother. He is planning to move out soon and I envy him. He is 27 and wanted to move out long ago but my parents didn't let him.

They mean well but honestly they stick their nose in my business too much and cause pointless dramas over the smallest things. They went on vacation for 10 days and honestly it was paradise. It's the only days in the whole year me and my brother can be at peace and have some privacy. 

Our house is kinda small and me and my brother shared a room for most of our lives until we refurnised our living room and he started sleeping there because the sofa is very big and comfortable.

Anyway I've been wanting to get a job recently but they simply don't allow me to. They say it will somehow distract me from my studies and that we didn't need the money. They refuse to treat me like an adult and argue with me for the dumbest things.

For an example my dad bought a watermelon and gave me some. I'm not a picky eater but it seriously didn't taste like anything so I didn't want to continue eating it. He started yelling at me how I'm ungrateful and make a big deal out of everything.

Another example is my mom offered me a banana and I said I didn't feel like eating one. She went on a whole rant about how spoiled I am even though I've been eating healthy for years now.

And now the biggest issue they have is me going to sleep late. I go to bed at 5:30 am because I like jogging before I go to sleep and did it while they were gone. I have not much to do during the day because it's too hot to go out and most of my friends are at work. This does not affect them in any way but for some reason they think they should tell me when I'm supposed to go to sleep like I'm a 10 year old.

I even brought this up to my therapist but she didn't really give me any directions on how to deal with it. My parents raised us poorly by being overly protective and doing everything for us and get mad when we want to grow up but struggle to do so. We've had that argument about my sleep schedule for 2 years now. It's seriously irritating and they don't seem to care what I think 90% of the time. Has anyone been in a similar situation?

167,"So yesterday I got home with my four month old to find our home broken into. Door unlatched and knob dented and scraped with a huge gash in the deadbolt plate. Nothing missing but a hole in the wall in our bedroom where the knob would be like someone slammed the door open and dented it. It’s makes me think of so many crazy possibilities and I’m trying to get over it since our landlord changed the locks on both doors fixed the door and everything but I’m really afraid because my fiancé works nights and I’m alone with her all night after work. I got sent home early yesterday, but I stayed at my mothers for a visit until around ten o clock and when I got home I found it like that! We would have been home when that happened for sure. The officer that came filed it as attempted because nothing was gone even though things had been moved and didn’t even give me a report number or take any pictures like I found out later he was supposed to. My own douchebag sperm donor (my father) is friends with the guy and agrees with him of course. My issues with him are a longer and much angrier story for another day. 

My possibilities are like this; my neighbor has a woman harassing her online, that woman could have broken in thinking it was my neighbors home and went like “oh shit this isn’t her house” and left. Accidentally leaving the door unlatched. I have an ex that was obsessive and abusive in basically all the ways, if he found out I’m engaged again with a child I have no doubt he’d show up in one way or another if he got a wild hair up his ass. This guy took credit cards out in my name and bought a huge truck after I left him, I suspect him of breaking into my grandparents home and stealing from me while I was living there after the breakup and he’s why I moved back across country to get away from him. It could have been someone who was just seeing if they could get in during the day and they’d come back at night for the real thing. 

My daughter and I are the ones that are there most at night, it really looks to anyone who hasn’t spoken to us that it’s just her and I there because he gets home so early in the morning and leaves when everyone is at work or school.

So he asked me if I would go and help him grab some stuff from inside so we both go up to his room to get whatever he needed. We were both pretty trollied and having a kind of play fight on the way in but in no way whatsoever a flirty one, just two mates having a laugh.

I roll over onto my side and we lock eyes and before I know it we’re kissing passionately for what must have been a couple minutes. I have no idea how it started but none of me wanted to stop it despite never having any kind of feelings for men. 
After the kiss we don’t say anything but smile at each other and head back to the party where we act like nothing has happened for the rest of the night. 
Now the thing is, I can’t stop thinking about it. I feel like I want some more but then not long after I won’t. We haven’t spoken to each other about it yet and I don’t know whether to message him about it. I think I would be up for meeting him or something. I don’t know how to feel about what happened. I think I might have feelings for him (never thought I would type that lol). But please any advise on what I should do would be great.

169,"I'm a college student and am still very close with one of my former high school teachers. She is much older than I but we click together so well and I may or may not have a crush on her. She taught me chemistry and ap environment science during my sophmore and junior year respectively. Her birthday is coming up soon and I want to get jer a chemistry related coffee mug. I have found one for under $15 and its super cute but I'm worried about scaring her off. We talk on a weekly bases via email but I'd really like to become more than just friends. At the same time I don't want her to think I'm try to ""buy"" her love. Within the past year I've given her a homemade friendship bracelet, a birthday card, and a CD i burned with songs thay made me think of her with a letter in it telling her how I value our friendship. I also gave her an old chemistry book but she doesn't know it was from me. I denied it when she asked. Idk. I just want to make sure it's appropriate and won't rub her the wrong way.",24Jul2019,1

Her birthday is coming up and I thought about making a friendship bracelet with silver wire and amethyst and peridot gemstones (birth months) I was additionally going to make a handmade card with some stuff written in about how much I valued her friendship and stuff. I haven’t gotten close with many friends in the past so I’m kinda worried I’m being a bit too much with this idea or maybe the idea is juvenile  (in 20s).

172,"I (29F) have a good friend (27M). He was drunk last weekend and confessed over text to having feelings for me. This is something I have suspected for some time but had hoped it wouldn't come up because I already am in a committed LTR. 

I didnt see the texts until the following morning, and at that point he had already apologized over it and played it off as a joke. I pretended to be none the wiser and just went along with his joke excuse.

Now I'm wondering if it would have been smarter to talk to him sincerely about how he feels about me. In an ideal situation, I assume a conversation like that could help him realize he should move on. I feel I lost that opportunity by going along with his joke excuse.

But I don't know if he would rather me not bring it up again. We resumed regular text conversation afterwards, and I will probably rarely see him in person again since he recently moved to another state. So it feels like theres no awkwardness in our friendship over text, at least, and bringing it up again might make it awkward for no reason.

So, do I bring up the subject of his texts again, or not?

Tl;dr a friend confessed feelings for me over text while drunk but played it off as a joke. Do I leave it at that or try to addre6what he said as if it were true?",24Jul2019,1

I sent them a really harsh novel of a text message basically laying out what a shit friend they’d been and how I didn’t want to be friends with them ever again. Surprisingly, they understood finally that they’d fucked up and they said that if this is what I needed then they’d do it.

I still kept an eye on their tumblr account though, just to be sure they were okay. They’d had struggles with mental health issues and I just wanted to check in on them.

I hadn’t checked in a while but today I looked and their tumblr account had been deleted. I texted their phone number, basically saying that I know they probably don’t want to hear from me but I was concerned. No response. I called. I got the generic ‘automated voice message system’ response.

I’m freaked out and upset now. I’m at the point where I want to message the abuser’s best friend and ask if they’re okay or if she has any other way to contact them. The only reason I’m even considering this is because I don’t think she talks to the abuser anymore and she was mainly a passive force in the whole situation.

179,"I’m 23 years old, my parents are together, I’m one of 5 children. Second oldest child, oldest boy. 

I grew up in a middle income home through high school. By the time I was in college my parents were living in a $1-2m home. 


*Im not sure if any of the above matters, I just wanted to provide as much detail as possible*

I’m not even sure where to start, but my father has been cheating on my mother for approximately 15 years, that I know of. I mean seriously cheating - cheating is cheating, but in this case we’re talking payments for cars; random payments here and there, dozens, **DOZENS** of partners, etc. 

Growing up my parents often fought, I never knew why. Now I do. It caused stress on everyone my mom used to threaten to call DCFS on us and give us up for the littlest things we did wrong, think: kids being kids (we were ages 2-10 at the time). 

I began to understand it all when I saw my father on match.com as an 8 year old.  He was using the family computer. I honestly couldn’t believe it and didn’t sleep for months. I was naive and thought maybe he did this for business purposes to gain clients for his law firm. 

It went on for years he even rented an apartment for a decade or more, that was secret. But I knew, and I even explored it. 

Things that hurt me:

Him spending money on these women, dozens of them, while I slept on a couch in the living room from 5th grade on. This didn’t just strain me but also the rest of the family; my bedroom was the living room. I got made fun of for this in high school too. Never grew up with any privacy. 

I love working out and my parents kinda refused to buy me a gym membership growing up. I remember getting sad about it and ultimately using a fake ID to join a gym as a teen. 

Complete lack of a sense of family, example my father spent 4-5 days this past week “working” in AZ with chick. 

It’s honestly been so upsetting to me and caused me many many sleepless nights as a kid. As a 2nd thru 4th grader. I always went to sleep laid in bed as sometimes cried wondering if I should ask my mom if everything was ok. Cause on my dad match.com profile it said divorced. My mom knew of the cheating btw.  I still Live at home and can’t decide if I should just leave my family behind, move on and never talk to them again. 

Another thing that makes me really sad is I’d often see tickets to a sporting event on the counter, my dad would then bring a “client”. Nothing got me more hopeful than going to watch a sport with dad. 

Other small things, that still bug me are things like him taking me to my baseball game as a kid, but instead of watching hed be talking to other women. 

It made correction hard, I was always mad and When he corrected me I was alway even more mad. 

It made school hard, I lost focus and motivation sometimes, but as many know even a week or 2 I’m a semester that you’re not 100% KILLS, it absolutely kills. That’s why I was a 3.0 student. 

At this point, I don’t know what to do sometimes I want to love him and my family but sometimes I want to just leave and never talk to my family again. Just do my own thing pave my own path. 

And whenever there is issue with money, I get extremely mad, and upset. 

Example, my lifelong passion has been woodworking, since I was a toddler. My parents on my college graduation “gave” me a saw, they never ended up getting it so about a year later I bought the gear. The other day he yelled at me and said who gave you permission to take over the garage with the equipment. It honestly made me so sad and upset because. When they said they’d give me a saw I was honestly one of the greatest days ever a GREAT gift that I will love and use from the people who watched me work on my craftsmanship over the years. 

If we really didn’t have money I’d be more understanding , but it’s just the way that he sends Zelle payments a few hundred dollars to like 10 different girls it seems like every other day, and also was paying $1600 a month for an apartment basically to fuck girls in. 


Now, if you read this far don’t assume clickbait. I said I failed as a son and a brother. Here’s how I failed as a son: I am very temperamental, stubborn, didn’t get great grades, rude, etc. I failed as a brother keeping my fathers actions from them. I tried the longest to shield them, cover his tracks etc.  try to keep the family together. 15 years ago, dad was my best friend. We didn’t bond over the years and I get incredibly sad seeing real father / son relationships. 

***Now there’s one catch to all this:   I don’t know factually, but, I believe my father may have been sexually abused as a child*** 

At one point he made a reference to his brother fucking him up the ass. He never was too close with that brother and when he died, he didn’t seem terribly bothered. We were actually driving back to college for my senior year when he got the news. 

Does anyone have any advice?",24Jul2019,1

182,"Hi I’m a 20 year old college student and I really need advice because this experience is haunting me for 3 Years.

So this is what happened (excuse my englisch it’s not my first language)
first of all my Fahrer never touched me inappropriately before.
there were a few awkward situations I don’t know, maybe too tight and long hugs I can’t describe it situations where I felt uncomfortable but I knew it was accidental or a thought. 

So on that day I was sick sore throat... in the night my dad came in to my room -something he never did before- and sat next to me on my bed thinking I was sleeping but I wasn’t he was like checking my temperature with is hand on my forehead (still normal) and then took a cream for my sore throat which needs to be applied on the chest and starts rubbing it on my chest but his hand got a few times to low to my breasts (i was so shocked I couldn’t move and still pretended I was sleeping) then after it got to uncomfortable i moved a little (was then lying on my stomach)  and he stopped, stood up and pulled my sheets away and just looked and then left my room. 
The next day I pretend nothing happend.
I was still sick and he gave me medication a pill  so I could get better  it turned out to be a sleeping pill I slept from 6pm to 2 pm the next day, like a stone I was gone didn’t wake up once my mum was really mad at him he just said He did not know it had such a strong effect and thought it would help me recover faster later I found sleeping pill in his jacket and he would give me pills that are apparently for „stomach ache“ (I have a stomach problem) but I just pretend to take them and threw them away I didn’t trust him anymore he came a few times into my room after that night but I made clear to signal him I was awake so he left 

I was confused at that time and didn’t know what to do I never told anyone about it because I thought no one would believe me and he never did it again. since then I always hold my distance between us till today and it damaged my relationship with my father and it still haunts me I can’t sleep at night and get anxiety attacks thinking about it what should I do ?
is it to late to tell someone I mean it’s been 3 years and he never did it again",24Jul2019,2
183,"Sorry for the wall of text, but I really need some sound advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

The basics: I live with my fiancé who is a disabled veteran and has a small pension that is basically negligible. He has no other source of income.  I have two MAs, was in a career for ten years but it didn’t pay a living wage, I’ve been working a new job for 6 months. I make around $40k. It should be noted that my priorities do not lie in making a lot of money, but I also feel too old to be begging for a living wage and jumping job to job. 

Firstly, I was hired for a new job unrelated to my previous career. The description said it would be remote. This was important to me because I have moved twice a year every year of my damn life and I’m tired. Also, I like being able to work from home because I have found that I do less work in an office an environment than I do in a home environment. 

Right after I took the job, the company/organization found out my supervisor was leaving and asked to give me a raise to move to the city and take over her responsibilities. I asked them for a bit more of a raise and gave them the date when my lease was up. That date is fast approaching and since I agreed to move, some things have changed and taken shape. 

The hard truth is that I hate the job. It’s a dead end, the people are *fine* but I do not share the same values and there are some major walking HR nightmares. I was never trained, they are piling work on me that has nothing to do with my job description, and there is almost no protocol so even when I make mistakes, I’m hardly learning anything. It has nothing to do with what I went to school for or the career to which I dedicated the last ten years of my life (long story there) and I don’t feel anything but depressed when I wake up in the morning. I don’t give a fuck about what the organization does, but I am also a perfectionist so I will be constantly anxious to do everything correctly. My supervisor and I carry the company, by the way. Hardly anyone else works. They all take long holidays and leave at 2 PM and never answer emails / calls or follow through with their jobs. They expect us to clean up their (very major) mistakes. It is very clear they are making double what my supervisor makes, as they like to say so out loud. This is only after six months. 

Secondly, even with both the raises, I can hardly afford to move to this city. Half my monthly income would go to rent. I would have to go into the office and spend eight hours a day with these people, and this homogenous city is the last place in the world I want to live. It’s a city of strip malls and hours-long traffic. I lived in the city for two weeks to do some job stuff, and I couldn’t find anything that made me feel the way my current city feels. I love where I live now and worked really hard to come back here (I’ve lived/worked in over 20 countries and this is still the city I came back to). I tried as hard as I possibly could to like where my job is located, but I just don’t. 

The pros of the job? Well, a damn paycheck. I was unemployed last year and let me tell you, that shit sucks. The job has benefits. I mean, not good ones, but they have them. I don’t have to pay $300/mo for basic healthcare. I can spend a lot of my free time following my passions, which I’d like to turn into a job but which are both risky and far-reaching. When I was unemployed, I didn’t have time for them because I was constantly worrying about money and finding a job. I have almost no savings because...well, again kind of a long story involving my previous career choices. 

Last month something else happened that threw another element into the decision. My current living situation was getting pretty dangerous (my next door neighbor got shot by an intruder and there were many other such instances in my apartment complex) so I was looking around for another place where my fiance and I could ride out the rest of my lease for a reduced rate aka free. 

A good friend of mine has a second home, and she was ecstatic when I reached out to her. She had been looking for a renter and told me I could stay for free while I ride out my lease. So I’ve been staying in her second home for three weeks and this place rocks. I love it. It’s in a great neighborhood, it’s next to an artist’s community, and I’ve already made friends.  When I told her how much I liked it, she asked if I wanted to stay and quoted me a price that is less than half of what I would pay in the “new” city. It includes water, electricity, and Internet. I can walk to a grocery store (it’s the little things), there are parks/nature close by, I feel safe being out and about. My fiancé has good access to a nicer VA, he’s producing more art than ever (yeah, he’s an artist hence no income), and we are overall very happy in this place. The only problem is...I can’t find a job here. I’ve looked. It’s a small community. Nothing would pay even close to what I’m making now. We could use my fiancé’s pension to pay the rent, but then...that’s about it. We are both looking frantically for jobs so that we can stay in this place, but aren’t having any luck. 

Anyway, today my supervisor gave me a heads up that if I refuse to move by the time my lease is up, they will fire me, which I understand since the terms of my employment changed the minute I asked for a raise to move. I am not under any contract, but I also don’t want to be a dick, so I need to make a decision in about a month. 

Philosophical shit: I kind of instinctually feel like I should let them fire me and then give thanks that I got out of the situation. But everyone around me is making me feel like an idiot because obviously money &gt; no money. In the words of my mother: “I don’t even understand what you’re asking. Should you be employed or unemployed?” Maybe they’re right. Someone take some sense into me. 

I haven’t been able to sleep because I’m so stressed out about it. 

**Tl;Dr:** Shitty jobs still pay money. No other job prospects yet (looking). But I like where I live now, I don’t want to move to a more expensive (and subjectively terrible) place just to continue working my dead-end job. Advice me please.",24Jul2019,1
185,"I am soo much sorry if this is too long and unclear at times. I will clarify anything that seems stupid. I wrote this in anger and didn't come around to edit. 


I am in a long distance relationship with a girl. It's not like I haven't seen her at all. The thing is that she used to be my junior at the college. I have already passed out and is currently at home. Although I have talked to her during college I never felt the need to take it in a relationship path. A couple of months back we started talking and she proposed to me. After an initial cool off period or whatever it is I accepted. It was then she told me about the guy. The said guy is actually my batchmate, however we aren't friends as such. I knew the guy as a good and silent person who kept to himself.

She told me that he proposed to her pretty long back. However she turned him down immediately. Since they were kind off friends at the time and he didn't want to be 'insulted' infront of others he asked her not to tell anyone and they kept their friendship. According to him no one was giving him enough company and she was one of the few people he used to talk to. He however started telling people that they were in a relationship. I have too heard that they were in a relationship during my time at the college. 

However it turns out that he is a complete asshole. He never liked her talking to other boys. A girl once proposed to him and he told her he was already in a relationship with my girlfriend. He was soo manipulative that he took her phone and started sending messages to his phone  saying all cringy things like she can't live with out him...blah..blah... She is taking all night shifts so that she can spend time with him etc ( we are all medical students - not doctors,but we work in a hospital and we have clinical postings in rotating shifts). It seems that he wanted to show these screenshots to the other girl.  I told her it's okay and I don't care about stuff that has happened before the start of our relationship. 

Fast forward -  this guy comes to know that she is texting me and she tells him that we are in a relationship. He goes back to being more abusive and sends her messages that I am the type of guy that loves using woman and then moving on. I phoned this guy and talked to him after she showed the screenshots. Although he initially said it was mistake and he said shit about me out of anger and he won't go back to troubling her a few days later he again starts to text and call her. Almost a month ago he calls her and tells her that he wants to meet her one last time. She asks me and I tell her to go meet and end it - man to man. However he starts ranting and throwing insults at her. He finally crossed the line saying that she is a slut just like her mother and my girlfriend slapped him. That was kind of the end of it. 

A week back this guy called her during their shift and takes her to a secluded place in the department telling her that he wants to talk with her. He starts asking creepy stuff like if me and her are just in a relationship or if we have had sex. She gets angry with him however he slapped her. He tells her that she can go tell me but since I am from a different state I am not going to do shit. She was scared and intimidated. The same evening she had to go back to her home because her mother was hospitalized. However she never told me about this incident untill yesterday night. 


My first instinct was to go right up and beat the fuck up out of this guy. However now I think it's better to get someone from workplace get involved since this happened there. I really need some suggestions and help here .",24Jul2019,3

Context: Broke up with ex girlfriend of 5+ years around 8 months ago - Mutual friend of ours supported both of us and I gave him permission to support her as much as possible as she doesn't have many close friends.

I have heard through other mutual friends of something more than friendship developing between them over the past few months. Example: A friend of mine visited their house (door was locked with both of them inside) - their flatmate said they were having a ""nap"".

190,"Hi! So, to preface. I'm a 16-year-old trans man. Obviously, like most trans people, I don't have great self-confidence. Recently, it's gotten even worse as a result of my teeth. My parents have awful teeth, and growing up, never taught me good oral hygiene, brought us to dentists, or even provided us with toothpaste or toothbrushes. As a result of this, my teeth have become pretty awful. My bottom left molar is so decayed they need to do a root canal, and the doctor's not sure if she could save it or if it would need to be extracted. She also needs to do a root canal on my front left incisor and alluded to the fact that I might lose one or two teeth, since the rest of them aren't great as well, even if they're not as bad. I've been obsessing over this and unable to stop thinking about it. I've been constantly googling things about teeth or implants or root canals or how bad teeth affects your life. I'm too young for implants, and the idea of missing a tooth, especially one of my incisors or molars, feels nightmarish. I know it might seem like an exaggeration, but I legitimately would rather die than just have missing teeth. I'm an honors student with the best grades out of anyone in my grade, and I plan on going into medical school. I'm terrified that my dreams of getting a good job will be ruined by my bad teeth or by having a missing tooth. What do I do? How do I stop obsessing over this?

191,"Some background: I’m 17m and new to Reddit (personal throwaway acc.). I have 1 blood brother, a step-sister and a half-sister. 

So my dad has been a drug addict for most of my life. 

When he was with mom she was also on drugs with him, but ever since they divorced she has been 100% clean and living a semi-normal life. At the time of them divorcing, my brother and I decided it would be best to go live with mom - so we did. Ever since we moved dad and I haven’t talked, besides the occasional Merry Christmas text and stuff. 

The few times I heard about him were all bad news. He brought a total of 3 woman into his life and they’re all drugheads now. One we called step-mom for a bit while trying to move. He had a kid with her and sadly she’s is in custody of CPS. He knocked another up, then they got an abortion. The third I have no clue why she was there. Anyways yeah, bad situation.

He was recently pulled over and caught with narcotics, and he’s got a bad record so he’ll probably be going to prison. My mom knew him very well and she told me he said, “I’ll kill myself before I ever get locked up.” ... But she’s also said he gets along with people in jail. I’m hoping for the latter. He really needed a reset. 

So I guess my question for this post is — What should I do? Given he gets out alive and sober I have a whole new opportunity to talk to him like any other person.

193,"First of all, I would never flat out just be like “hey stop it”. But I have a coworker who I consider a friend, who has decided to use social media as a tool to keep them accountable for staying sober. They’re very open about their long struggle with alcoholism. We work in a field where building relationships is very important and where in their particular case, it can seem to be a bit hypocritical that they have a drinking problem. 

My coworker has missed work due to our boss helping them go to rehab. But now every time they’re not at work people talk and gossip about a possible relapse. Which by the way this person will literally post on social media when they relapse. In our field, I think it’s beginning to damage their reputation with fellow coworkers and with “clients”.

At this point I’m so exhausted dealing with people I want to find a job where I can work from home. The problem I have been running into is experience. I only have it in customer service and a lot of simple places (like dog walking etc) have said no because I need more experience. I don’t want to volunteer because I need something that will make me money ASAP. I feel like I have tried everything. Please don’t say “well just suck it up and get a job like everyone else” I’m terrified of dealing with people and I really don’t want to be depressed again. I’ve spent the last few weeks doing nothing but applying to jobs and I have gotten rejected by pretty much all of them. Any suggestions?,24Jul2019,2
196,"So first I wanna start off by saying my Dad is a huge narcissist. Everytime he gives me a lecture he always mentions how well he does his job, or about how he got a job 80 were after. Before you comment about how it's just park of the lecture I need to explain that my dad has a need to be right. I'll explain further.
 Everytime my Dad is upset at me he asks why I did whatever I did. I tell him and he ends up trying to fuss at me for making excuses. I called him out once for getting mad at me for answering his questions but he says that they are rhetorical questions. They are not and he gets angry if I don't answer.

But anyway I'll explain my case. My dad is very wealthy and he used to buy me everything I wanted in elementary school when I got easy straight A's. Now that I'm a sophomore in highschool my grade range from C's to A's and my dad os always lecturing me about how successful my brother is. It's all fair lectures. The problem is when he wouldn't buy me a Nintendo Switch, I rolled up my sleeves and did some yard work in my Neighborhood to earn the money. I got 100$ and ended up buying a used one off of Ebay for 75$ + 10$ shipping. When my dad found out I bought my own switch he was furious. Being at 15 year old I was under the impression that  if I bought it myself then my dad can't take it from me. I was wrong. First thing he did was snatch it and lock it in his locker at his work. Now I blew 85$ on a console I can't even use and my dad is in a good mood. He's one of those hard working that think that if they do everything wrong then the world has to bow down to him. He's like this to my mom to. I must stress that's he's not abusive, he's just very strick and doesn't like not being in control?
Can anyone give me advice on how to possible get my stuff back and how to deal with my dad.

P.S. my dad works in the air force stealing it from his work is not an option.",24Jul2019,2
197,"My dad is a high functioning alcoholic and has been for years, but I have never seen him drive drunk before. He is normally a bit of an overconfident but capable driver; he treats speed limits like suggestions and already has 3 points on his license for speeding.

He just got in his car and drove off drunk, and I’m pretty sure he’s driving to the nearest town (about 10-15 minutes away) to buy more booze.

Do I call the police on my own dad? Do I just assume that the roads will be empty given that it’s so early in the morning and that he’ll be fine? Do I do nothing?

I have no idea what to do. I don’t want to put anyone else’s life at risk because of my dad’s drunk driving, but I don’t want to call the cops on my own dad either. Am I being selfish/cowardly if I do nothing?

Advice, please?",24Jul2019,4

I called my mother on her phone because I was a few minutes out later than I was suppose to be. So my mom has her phone number. 

My father has tech on lock down and controls how long I spend on devices and how long I can spend online period. So they control if I receive her messages or not, or even If I can respond.

I don't drive because of my parents limiting how much I can actually get behind the wheel to get my 60 hours for a driver's licence.

My mother has set up a family meet up when I am suppose to meet up with her, effectively shutting us down.

202,"Well, this fell into my lap tonight and I have no idea how to approach it.  Tonight, I was talking to a friend over text.  Names have been changed for this story.

We will call her ""Amber.""  While talking to ""Amber,"" we got on the subject of how old she thought I was, because apparently she thought I was older then I was.  When I told her I was 35, she replied shocked and said, ""Oh!  You're the same age as ""Brad?""  Me being confused on why she brought him up, I replied ""Yeah... I guess so.""

Then, she hit me with a random punch.  ""I know this is TMI, but ""Brad"" and I screwed before, so I immediately thought of him.""  I was confused since ""Brad"" is married to my good friend ""Cheryl.""  I asked her when it was and she told me this last Janaury.  I asked her if ""Cheryl"" knew and she said she thinks she had suspicions but never knew for her.  Again, floored since ""Brad"" and ""Cheryl"" have been married 10 years, I asked how ""Amber"" and him ended up in that situation.  Well, all three of them work in the same place.  Apparently, ""Brad"" and ""Amber"" worked a lot together in an outside zone of work.  They began talking and that was that.  ""Amber"" told me she went over to ""Brad"" and ""Cheryl's"" house before work one day and had sex before coming to work.

I feel like I've been hit in the gut because I consider ""Cheryl"" a really good friend.  I really want to tell her but have no idea how.  I know this could cause some major issues at work.  I also know that ""Brad"" has never been a big fan of me, so now that I'm involved, I just wonder how I should do it.

Do I keep this secret from ""Cheryl"" or do I tell her?  Help me Reddit.",24Jul2019,1
203,"Some backstory here, me (24) and my boyfriend (25) have been together now for 10 months and are very happy and in love. Unfortunately though since the very beginning my parents have been very wary and apprehensive of my boyfriend. Claiming he does not like them or seems weird and that hes not right for me. I grew up in a very strict Christian household and unfortunately my family has discovered that me and my boyfriend have had sex and are now even more against him. 

I desperately want things to be okay between them and him and have urged my boyfriend to talk to my parents about the situation, but he has become very upset about the rude and judgmental things that have been said about him from my family and is not wanting to talk to them at all.

So basically I'm stuck in a position of having to pick between my family and my boyfriend so it feels. I'm just curious if anyone has ever had a similar situation and if there is a good solution to get rid of this ongoing tension between them and him?",24Jul2019,3

206,"I have asked for advice before and it always boiled down to go to therapy. I have been to therapy before but it didnt help. I am going to go again after I find a new therapist, I just dont even know what to ask for help about.

I am a 24 year old, never been in a relationship, and still a virgin guy. I have met shitty women who lead me on and treated me like crap mostly. The last girl I was seeing was great, almost got into a relationship and had sex but I didnt feel much for her so I caused it to end. It felt like the right thing to do. 

I am in the real world now, out of college, have a good job in my field, make good money, I try to take care of myself, lost a lot of the weight and muscle I gained a year ago unfortunately so now Im back to a disgusting skinny freak. Most of my friends are busy with their lives and relationships so I cant get them to hang out or answer my texts. I try to go out on my own, I have been going to movies alone for years now, I have tried going to bars alone and I just sit there, have a drink and leave after an hour. I just go to work, study for a certification I want to get, and then go home. On weekends I sit home in my bed all day and then go back to work on Mondays.

I go to the grocery store once a week just to be out. This is my life now and I dont see it changing one bit the rest of my life.

I was never good enough for college women, just good enough to be lead on and used for attention. I had to watch an ex friend be with a girl he randomly swore to me he had no feelings for. While she randomly denied feelings for him while we were going out and she thought I was dating every woman in the world. Another girl rejected me but kept reaching out to me asking to meet up and would cancel or not reply all the time while flirting with me and being in relationships with other guys and my dumbass tried to be her friend for 2 years after the rejection instead of blocking her.

These are just some of the stories Ive gone through. I was also told by two girls I was close friends with Im the kind of guy women settle for in their 40s, not now when they are in their 20s. As in women wouldnt date me, be in relationships with me, or have sex with me. Two other friends who are girls made fun of me for being a virgin.

I see posts on here telling guys to never talk to women at all period. That they should just use dating apps to find a date. I have been off and on them for years and get nowhere despite having good pictures, bio, and starting open ended conversations based on the womens profiles. I have had redditors check it all out and they dont know why I have trouble finding a date. I have matched with 4 women in the past 4 weeks on bumble. Not a single one sent a message and then they expired.

I cant even look at women at my job or in public in their eyes, I know Im a disgusting piece of shit to them. I will never be anyones first anything and it matters to me, I missed out on everything in college, I will never be with an attractive college aged woman in my life and I wont be that weirdo dating 21 year olds at 40. To anyone who says being with a virgin doesnt matter, it matters to me because I never got any of those great relationship or sex experiences and I never will. That is the only thing that can make up for what I missed out on.

I am not budging on that ever and I know I will never be with a virgin woman, I know I wont ever be with anyone, but that is what I want and I wont change my mind about it. 

I cant handle this anymore, I just want to live in the middle of nowhere away from everyone. I know women think Im irrelevant and a waste of space. I wish everyone was with the person they wanted to be with but that I could be away from them all so they could all be happy and I wouldnt have to be in the way.

I am not going to try anymore, I cant keep doing this. So many rules, dont talk to women, you have to put yourself out there, accept every woman but  be more attractive, only use dating apps, dont use dating apps, lie about your past or women will reject you, dont lie about your past, not every woman will be the same as the last, all men are the shitty, be more confident, stop whining, keep waiting for someone even if your 80, etc.

I am 24 years old, I will be 25 soon and my life is completely meaningless. I know Im worthless to women and I always will be. I will go to therapy but I dont know what to talk about. Do I ask how do I accept Im worthless? How do I learn my place as a single man for the rest of my life? I dont know what I need to ask and I dont even know what I want from therapy. I just know I will never get what I want and I need to accept that.",24Jul2019,1

209,"Part of my job is to review my coworkers' work to make sure that it follows proper protocol. Recently, I found out that one of my senior coworkers has been doing a minor mistake in his calculations for multiple projects for the last couple months. This is easily fixable and I pointed out this error to my managers and they agree that the error should be corrected for all those projects. 

However this coworker is very defensive and nasty when it comes to other people pointing out his mistakes. He takes criticism personally and retaliates by being in a grumpy mood around them and saying nasty stuff about them behind their back. We work in an industry where we have to follow very specific and complicated protocols but he gets very grumpy to the point where people don't feel comfortable talking to him about mistakes and then we all have to clean up his mess. I think this is partly why his mistake has not been addressed for so long. Again, part of my job is to review his work to see if it's done correctly but I don't feel like I can do my job correctly because he get very hostile when I point out stuff he did wrong.

He's quite toxic and hard to work with and most of the people who work with him have expressed the same regards. He said today that he's done his work right all along even though there's clear evidence he did not. His manager is extremely patient to the point of my frustration and is at this point doing his work for him because my coworker will not change what he's doing.

Small but heart-breaking things like that that make me feel so, so horrible, and even more so when I can't bring myself to stand up to them or explain to them how they're being offensive or how what they're saying just doesn't sit right with me. I guess I'm scared of how they'd react - worst case scenario being them telling me to 'chill' or relax or something equally frustrating. I feel so guilty!

213,So I’m currently in college and I do online classes when I have free time or during break from semester to semester I work with my dad but during semester I focus on school. Now my parents have never been to college my dad worked with his dad and took over his business and my mom in reception but they’ve always felt that they know how college works. They feel that if I’m not from the time I wake up tell I go to bed working I’m slacking. (Slight exaggeration but you get the point) I work hard but like I said they think I slack off and they want me to work again while I’m school. Sure money would help but I just wish they realized how hard I work and didn’t always want more out of me. They don’t even know what my degree is they think it’s in computer science but I’m going for game design which o haven’t hidden from them. I fear if I correct them they’ll make me drop out. Finally my girlfriend and I have been together 4 year I’ve never been happier but they seem to have some problem with her. They think she steals my money when she never lets me pay for anything and that I waste my time for school with her when she sleeps during the day due to her job at night. Things have gotten bad to the point that me and my girlfriend are planning on saving more and moving out in about a year or two when we’re almost done with school.

215,"Hi, I'm M 20. 

Recently, since a few days, I hear my dad sometimes say to himself ""eh, whatever, I'll be in a grave soon anyway"". He says this every few hours. He always wanted to buy himself a few things which we can't afford immediately as a family so he had been saving for quite some time, this year he wanted to buy a watch. Recently though we were required to do some renovations in the house which set all his savings back to zero and he, again, can't by himself his dream watch. Ever since the moment we ran out of money he keeps saying, in a very sad/depressive manner, that he'll end up in a grave soon anyway so screw the watch. 

Him saying that makes me really scared, worried and uncomfortable because he's always someone that's positive towards many things. Now what I would like to know from you guys is: What should I do?

I feel like I need to do something but I have absolutely no clue what to do in this situation.  
Could it be temporary? Could he be hiding something from the family? I have no idea how to handle this.

217,"first of all, i don’t know if this is the proper sub to be posting this in but i’ve been following this one for a while so i figured i’d give it a shot.

i’m renting an older house off campus with some of my friends and not gonna lie, it’s kind of a dump. my landlord does the necessary fixes, but the house is badly in need of updating. rent is cheap so it’s fine. i’m taking summer classes so i’m here like 2 or 3 days out of the week and one other housemate comes about once a week, so the house is empty most times. anyways, i was just in my kitchen grabbing water before bed and i saw a HUGE roach on the floor. i’ve seen some in the carolinas before, but this one was darker in color and almost the size of my palm. i started freaking out and googling how to kill it because i’ve never seen one that big and i was scared to step on it. i started searching my cabinets for something and it crawled in the floor. some of the issues with my house is that the flooring in the kitchen is lifting in multiple spots and that’s where it crawled to. i freaked out cause it disappeared and sprayed the floor with bleach cleaner. i know that wasn’t the smartest move, but i was panicking because i’ve never seen a bug that big in my life.

now i’m not so sure what to do. i should probably add that i go to an allergist regularly and when i was tested a few years ago, i found out i am highly allergic to roaches. i’ve only seen one so far, but could there be more? is this something my landlord needs to handle or is it my responsibility?

i’ve seen a lot of spiders in my house too so i bought a pack of those plug in insect killers on amazon. is that enough to fix the problem?

220,"So, like the title says, my older brother just got out of an 8 years sentence, 4 down, 4 on paper. I haven't talked to him since I was, like, 13? I'm 20 now and I have a son. 

He says he's really excited to see me and meet my son, and that he's trying really hard to get his life together. The first thing he did out of prison was make a Facebook account, and added me. Since then he has posted a lot of racist and hateful things that I don't agree with. I, passive aggressively, posted a status about how much I dislike racism and don't want it around my family. Since then, I haven't known how to talk to him about it so I just ignore his texts and calls. He seemed genuinely excited to try to be part of my and my son's lives, but I don't want my kid to learn these behaviors.

My brother isn't the kind of person I can say, ""please don't act like this in front of my son,"" to, because he's always convinced he's right and anyone who disagrees with him is stupid.

My gut feeling is that I should keep my distance and observe for a while, but not completely cut him off before he has a chance to prove himself.

230,"I’m 23 years old, my parents are together, I’m one of 5 children. Second oldest child, oldest boy. 

I grew up in a middle income home through high school. By the time I was in college my parents were living in a $1-2m home. 


*Im not sure if any of the above matters, I just wanted to provide as much detail as possible*

I’m not even sure where to start, but my father has been cheating on my mother for approximately 15 years, that I know of. I mean seriously cheating - cheating is cheating, but in this case we’re talking payments for cars; random payments here and there, dozens, **DOZENS** of partners, etc. 

Growing up my parents often fought, I never knew why. Now I do. It caused stress on everyone my mom used to threaten to call DCFS on us and give us up for the littlest things we did wrong, think: kids being kids (we were ages 2-10 at the time). 

I began to understand it all when I saw my father on match.com as an 8 year old.  He was using the family computer. I honestly couldn’t believe it and didn’t sleep for months. I was naive and thought maybe he did this for business purposes to gain clients for his law firm. 

It went on for years he even rented an apartment for a decade or more, that was secret. But I knew, and I even explored it. 

Things that hurt me:

Him spending money on these women, dozens of them, while I slept on a couch in the living room from 5th grade on. This didn’t just strain me but also the rest of the family; my bedroom was the living room. I got made fun of for this in high school too. Never grew up with any privacy. 

I love working out and my parents kinda refused to buy me a gym membership growing up. I remember getting sad about it and ultimately using a fake ID to join a gym as a teen. 

Complete lack of a sense of family, example my father spent 4-5 days this past week “working” in AZ with chick. 

It’s honestly been so upsetting to me and caused me many many sleepless nights as a kid. As a 2nd thru 4th grader. I always went to sleep laid in bed as sometimes cried wondering if I should ask my mom if everything was ok. Cause on my dad match.com profile it said divorced. My mom knew of the cheating btw.  I still Live at home and can’t decide if I should just leave my family behind, move on and never talk to them again. 

Another thing that makes me really sad is I’d often see tickets to a sporting event on the counter, my dad would then bring a “client”. Nothing got me more hopeful than going to watch a sport with dad. 

Other small things, that still bug me are things like him taking me to my baseball game as a kid, but instead of watching hed be talking to other women. 

It made correction hard, I was always mad and When he corrected me I was alway even more mad. 

It made school hard, I lost focus and motivation sometimes, but as many know even a week or 2 I’m a semester that you’re not 100% KILLS, it absolutely kills. That’s why I was a 3.0 student. 

At this point, I don’t know what to do sometimes I want to love him and my family but sometimes I want to just leave and never talk to my family again. Just do my own thing pave my own path. 

And whenever there is issue with money, I get extremely mad, and upset. 

Example, my lifelong passion has been woodworking, since I was a toddler. My parents on my college graduation “gave” me a saw, they never ended up getting it so about a year later I bought the gear. The other day he yelled at me and said who gave you permission to take over the garage with the equipment. It honestly made me so sad and upset because. When they said they’d give me a saw I was honestly one of the greatest days ever a GREAT gift that I will love and use from the people who watched me work on my craftsmanship over the years. 

If we really didn’t have money I’d be more understanding , but it’s just the way that he sends Zelle payments a few hundred dollars to like 10 different girls it seems like every other day, and also was paying $1600 a month for an apartment basically to fuck girls in. 


Now, if you read this far don’t assume clickbait. I said I failed as a son and a brother. Here’s how I failed as a son: I am very temperamental, stubborn, didn’t get great grades, rude, etc. I failed as a brother keeping my fathers actions from them. I tried the longest to shield them, cover his tracks etc.  try to keep the family together. 15 years ago, dad was my best friend. We didn’t bond over the years and I get incredibly sad seeing real father / son relationships. 

***Now there’s one catch to all this:   I don’t know factually, but, I believe my father may have been sexually abused as a child*** 

At one point he made a reference to his brother fucking him up the ass. He never was too close with that brother and when he died, he didn’t seem terribly bothered. We were actually driving back to college for my senior year when he got the news. 

Does anyone have any advice?",24Jul2019,2

232,"I'm 23/M, and I graduated December 2018 with a major in Japanese and a minor in TESOL. I am no longer interested in education, nor am I interested in continuing to learn Japanese; I've lost passion in both areas, and I am at a loss at what to do. I will say, though, that I am diagnosed with mild depression, but I am currently off medication. I just occasionally feel down. I am currently working at a local gas station, albeit extremely unhappy and unfulfilled.

I just want to find something I can apply myself to. I don't have the means to move out, nor do I have any inclination to learn a new skill. I've tried my hand at programming, but my brain just isn't wired that way. Before majoring in Japanese, I had a business-undecided major, and even then, MIS and Macro/Micro weren't my thing. I know there are so many more things out there to try, but I have no leads, and I basically have no networking done.

I feel so useless and I definitely feel like I've wasted my parents' money. Going forward, I have no future plans, and I don't have any interest in, well, anything.

Has anyone gone through what I'm going through right now? Is there anything obvious that I'm missing here? I just want to feel like I have purpose again. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks.",24Jul2019,1

Recently a lot more of guys my type have been hitting me up and at first I was like cool, but they pretty much only wanted to hookup and take advantage of me. Now about 5~10 guys HMU everyday when they want to to bust a nut then act like assholes after (I don’t fall for there traps I sometimes play into it to squash there hope and be an ass but that’s only happened like twice). 

I really just want a relationship, like someone who actually likes me but it doesn’t help that my type are guys who are straight like and are usually closeted, I’ve played the gay guessing game and it’s not fun, I don’t want to guess someone’s gay bc like they may not be and it’s not fair everyone needs to take their own time to come out, but at the same time I have guys my type like almost flirting with me (as in I’m not the only one noticing it, people coming up to me and being like why was *blank* flirting with you). I would never accuse someone of being gay or try to out someone bc once again fucked up

Sorry this is mad long but I’m literally going crazy, I know it’s just time but it’s literally just annoying and lonely seeing all of my friends have great relationships and all people want me for is a dick appointment, I don’t have a whore reputation it’s just frustrating at this point

242,"We practice soccer together pretty regularly.  One time before I noticed a large group of people going back into the woods with fishing poles.  This time I wanted to check out what was back there, so me and 3 of my friends walked through the woods until we found a path.  The path was leading thirds the river, so we fallowed it.  After a couple of minutes of walking there was a smaller path to the side of the bigger trail.  We decided to fallow this one instead.  When walking there was a fence to our left off of the trail a little.   We got to a steep downhill slope and at the bottom part of the fence was tipped over an we could walk passed it.  At this point is when we found a couple of shotgun shells on the ground.  I didn’t think much of it then.  We were a little unsure if we should keep walking or not because it would be trespassing if someone caught us.  We decided to continue because the path kept going on.  We walked up the hill a little, and there it was.  Someone had set up a tent in the middle of the forest on private property.  As soon as we saw it nobody said a word but we all bolted in the other direction.   

My friends are thinking about going back tomorrow to  explore more.  One is bringing a knife.  I don’t think it is a good idea because of the fact that he is most likely armed(found shotgun shells) and he/she may be abusing drugs and alcohol and may want to attack one of them for messing with him/her.  Also, it was trespassing on our part, so I’m not sure if we can really tell anybody without getting in trouble.

252,"I typed this really fast, so sorry in advance. 

Hey guys. A little background. I just spent the last year moving my Grandmother halfway across the country to live with my family because my grandfather passed away. I quit my job, lost out on a huge scholarship at my favorite college, missed out on major career building opportunities, and spent all of my savings to help get her things in order. I spent the whole year away from my home working many hours a day. I sold my grandfather’s construction business and his massive car collection. On top of that, my grandparents hoarded tons of old junk that needed cleaning(it was a major ordeal). They had dogs that destroyed their entire house by peeing on literally everything, the walls, the couches, tables, beds, carpets, and so on. Because she had a big attachment to these dogs, we decided that they could come along for the move, but we set ground rules so they couldn’t destroy my family’s house too. We finally made the move out and she is currently staying in my family’s house until she gets a mobile home put on the property. On day one she started ignoring the rules set for her dogs. She was sneaking them into the house at night and letting them destroy the room she was staying in. Once we found evidence that she was doing this, such as, a scratched up door and pee everywhere, we talked to her about it. It took days to finally get her to stop sneaking them in. We have a special fenced area with a nice dog house specifically for her dogs that we spent a lot of money on. Our latest problem is that she has been letting her dogs out of that yard and into our regular yard even though she agreed to keep them separated from our pets. Her dogs have now killed one of our cats and have tried to kill a couple of our others. She keeps blaming the cats which isn’t right because my dogs and cats are best friends. Plus, her dogs were already killing her neighbor’s cats at her old home. Even though the cat that died meant a lot to me and my siblings, my grandmother was indifferent and actually started petting hers dogs and telling them how good they were not even 15 minutes after they killed the cat. There is so much more that has happened that I just don’t have time to get into.

I can’t stop her from breaking all the rules about her dogs. She acts like she could care less about what I say. I feel defeated. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I need to get rid of her dogs, but she has a big attachment to them. If I do, it will probably cause a big family fight anyways. What should I do? I’m at a loss.",24Jul2019,2

256,"I’m in my early 20s and a virgin when all these happened. I haven’t been in a relationship before and wanted to discover more about my sexuality. I talked to guys on dating apps (two lives overseas, then the other 2 lives in the same big city I’m in) and we exchanged nudes mostly through Snapchat and whatsapp. I never included my face nor any identifying features in the nudes. These guys were kinda comfortable putting their faces on the nude photos and videos, because maybe they’re confident I won’t be saving or sharing them? I didn’t save any of those. These guys just ghosted me at some point, so I thought they’re no longer interested. I blocked all of them on whatsapp/snapchat when they haven’t reached out in weeks. Then, I now have a boyfriend whom I really love and seeing the future with. 

Recently, I got very anxious about these things. Like what if one day, when I become prominent in my field, I’m scared these photos would resurface. That the ones sent on whatsapp might still be on their phones. I am hoping that once they stopped talking to me, they should have deleted our conversations and saved photos if there’s any. I hope they no longer have traces of my nudes. For Snapchat, I’m not very worried because it notifies when someone takes a screenshot.  

I also talked to a guy on messenger that I used to like before, but we ended up being friends as he said he likes someone else. We exchanged sexy photos last year, but I only sent upper half of the body photos of me in swimwear (can’t remember if my face was on them). We also sent disappearing videos on messenger’s secret conversation before. This guy seems nice and he’s matured, he’s 30 so I don’t think he will go around sharing these swimwear photos of me.

257,"The story began in 2011, when my father became suicide. Our financial status was very low, but I applied to a University, after learned programming, and they admitted me.

The problem was that I couldnt afford a place to live there, so for nearly 2 years I travelled 200km daily (which means 7 hours daily). But then in 2015 I gave up and applied to another University.

I finished it in February with one of the best results (4.78 of 5) and applied a job. I also started to work while the University, and I will finish it in September.

After the graduatiom I applied a job, for low salary ( about half of the average ), but they promised me a higher salary. So after a few months they wanted to give me 10% raise, but I rejected it and got the average at last.

I work from 8 to 5, but after the work I still feel like I have to learn something or do something, so I get up between half past six and seven, prepare myself to work, and after the work I still read or learn something for a few hours (like for 11 pm) and then go to bed.

I feel like if I dont do that, I just waste my time and I wont be success. I also thinking about apply a 3rd job or something. 

Since last week I quit from this behavior and after the work I dont do anything (just watch movies or play). Since then I dont have the feeling like ""I have to read this book today, or do this software ASAP"", but I feel myself lazy and I think I waste my time with this.

274,"4 years ago, my husband our two kids, and I, finally decided to move away from the choas that is our home state, to our dream. 10 acers of rural, forested land, in solitude. The perfect neighbors, closest one is acres away. With kids our kids age. Perfect school. Perfect small community.

We baught the land in co-OP with my step father, who is a chicken farmer. We get along with him perfectly. Now, my mother is a struggling addicti/recovering addict. Who also happens to have a severe case of bipolar 1 (delusional and manic most of the time). Needless to say, she is a handful. She comes with a lot of drama and headache. But what life style doesnt?

Well, that's not the end of it unfortunately. About 7 months ago, my father and his wife asked to buy an acre of our side of the land. They gave up all their assest, sold their home and quit their jobs, to take care of my step-mother's, dying mother. They wanted to live like us. Outside of the state in the country.

We all felt a little isolated where we were. New state is a big, lonely move. My dad seemed to be in a good place. We had all spent plenty of time with them. They would come camp and visit often. Hes also a skilled mechanic and electrician. Skill sets none of us had. We figured it would work out.

Belive me when I say, none of us realised how totaly insane my father has become. I swear he has delusional manic bipolar as well.

He hid it well. But it didnt take long for us to notice he was abusing my step mother. She eventually took the oprotunity to leave in the middle of the night, and hasn't looked back on my father sens. I dont blame her. But now, I'm stuck with him as a neighbor.

Hes insane. He text me manically all day.
He hasn't gotten a job yet. Hes delusion. He has psychotic breaks. He remembers things incorrectly. Or twist them to his gradure. He does things, like fires shot guns in the middle of the night at ""hogs"". Honestly, hes a lot like my mom, (who is also delusional) but scarier. Untreated and unacknowledged. (He thinks hes perfectly sane and happy! And absolutly nothing is worng :D)

 Its putting a strain on my marriage. Its putting a strain on me. I'm so sick with anxiety I cant see straight.

I dont know what to do. We've invested all of our money and time into this place. We had a well dug. Own our trailer. Put in a septic. Everything. We've worked so hard.

My father, he gave us $10,000 for the acre. Spent $14,000 on a prefab house. Nothing was sighned. But I feel he legally owns the place. I'm an honest person, I would never force him out.

We cant divide the land, the way everything is played out. 

I feel our only option is to give everything up to him, and leave. Change my children's school. Move away from their friends. I cant bear the thought, but my dad is litteraly a stones throw away. We share a driveway. I cant reason with him. When people are delusion, they become totally unsympathetic. He wont grasp the trauma and sacrifice of us uprooting everything.

My only other idea was buying back the 10k he put down. Put it onto another acre somewhere else. And pay the 1k to move it his prefab house (wich is portable)

We cant afford it. I put all the money tword the property bill, at was my fathers request.

I know I was stupid for letting him move here. I feel like a total idiot now. I have been duped and I have let my family down. Idk what to do. Any advice would be welcomed. And thank you for reading.",24Jul2019,1
275,"Hello!
I'm having this feeling of regret for not understanding this earlier. So, like the title suggests, I really want to work as someone who helps people, be it in a mental or physical way. I was thinking about this for some time now (I'm 19) and it is distracting me from what I am currently studying which is english language and literature. I got into college last year and after the first year went by, I was really disappointed. I feel like I wasted a year of my life, not really learning anything. Don't get me wrong, I loved the idea of studying it beforehand but I guess after realising a few things and seeing how things are at the college I am regreting my decision + everyone telling me I'll never find a good paid job makes me less ambitious and interested about it. To continue my list of problems, I went to music high school - which means I didn't have chemistry, physics and biology in high school, all which I adored in elementary school and they are mandatory to take to get into faculty of medicine where I am from. Furthermore, my GPA is 4.2, and even some 5.0s here don't get into medical college. I just feel like I'm all over the place.
Do you see any solution for this? Should I stay at the college I'm currently at? I am really conflicted with my feelings. I feel like I could do so much more, I know I am a smart person and I am a fast learner and I feel like being so young and being forced to assert myself at the age of 13 where I want to be and choosing to go to music high school was a big mistake I made.",24Jul2019,1

277,"So I’ve not long had a baby girl and my partner and I really want to move in together. Currently I’m in a really cramped house, 3 bedrooms with 6 of us living here and a dog, not to mention my mums slight hoarding has cramped the house even further so you can understand why I’d want to get out. It’s also putting a strain on our relationship since I have to move back and fourth to spend time with my partner when he wants to see our baby constantly. The setback is, we’re both young and have 0 home or work experience. There’s places to rent and we could make it if we both got jobs but I’m worried we’ll set ourselves back. We wanted to continue further education and this will be difficult with a job. I’m also worried I might overwhelm myself with both a job and a newborn. Has anyone else moved out young and/or has any advice to give me? Thanks.",24Jul2019,1
278,"So I’m 26 years old and I lived on my own in Los Angeles for 7 years right after high school mainly working in the film industry. After I got laid off from the last studio I worked for about 2 years ago I really had no choice but to move home. It was pretty soul crushing. I’m currently working in a factory and hate it because its a 12 hour shifts (with a 30 minute lunch break) and I literally feel like crap all of the time; mentally, physically, and emotionally. My original plan was to go back to LA for film but I realized how unstable that freelance life will forever be even if you’re successful. Luckily we only work 3-4 days a week (it used to be 5 which was brutal)but I realize those 3-4 days would only allow about maybe 1-2 classes if that because commuting home is a bitch and I have literally an hour of time to eat shower and brush my teeth on days that I’m working. The money is ok for CA, and ok benefits, however I do have to commute an hour and a half to work and back to my dads twice a week. I’ll stay at my moms during my work days but the commuting alone eats a good chunk of my pay. Not to mention its pretty labor intensive.

Anyways a couple months ago, after lots of research via Reddit, Youtube, etc, I decided to go back to school for CS. I’ve already met with a counselor and we went over the courses that I wanna take for which CSUs I may wanna transfer to for a BS. After the counselor meeting I told my pops that if I went to school part time and continued working at the factory its gonna take me like 3-4 years to finish up at community college and he said “What’s wrong with that?” I said I don’t wanna work there anymore like it’s just making me miserable. Tbh I never wanted to work there in the first place I only went because I had 0 money at the time. I get it money blah blah blah, but I’m still willing to work somewhere closer to home just on a part time basis.

I guess what I’m tryna say is I don’t understand why he would want me to stay at that place. I do pay some bills each month and would still be able to pay those and goto school. I’ve been researching how much I’ll need budget wise cuz it looks like community college isn’t outrageously expensive. I’m also gonna check to see how much money I may or may not get from financial aid (Side note: CA offers first year full time students free tuition if you qualify) so we’ll see, definitely not depending on FAFSA to pull through I’ve already planned to be paying. 

Anyways this whole  situation has just been bothering me all day I literally can’t get it outta my head cuz it doesn’t make sense to me. I get that he would want me to have an ok paying job with benefits but I’m sorry the benefits just don’t match the long term effects it’s having on my life/health. 

I feel like I’ve always let myself just get fucked over by shitty jobs. During those 7 years I’ve been everything from a janitor, to a delivery driver, to customer service, to a post office clerk,to a sound designer(which was my dream job that I lost even though I worked my ass off). I just feel like I can’t ever get away from being in these types of positions. Man I need a therapist.",24Jul2019,1
279,"I fucked up a class and plan on dropping which essentially made me lose my chances at my current major.

When looking at my options, apparently Biology is still an option as with going into majors like sociology, gender studies, etc. but I’m really apprehensive about those options mainly as bio would still require the quarter of physics that I’m dropping and I never want to even attempt another math or physics class for the rest of my life. Saying I hate both of the subjects is an understatement and even if it’s a prerequisite, I actually tried this past quarter only to just fuck up so there’s no use in trying. I’d rather drop out than do either subject.

I’m really freaking out because summer session was a ton of money compared to the year and my parents are telling me if I go ahead and drop that they won’t help pay for my current campus and I’ll be forced to come back home and attend the same college as my sibling and they’ll pick my major. To make things worse the major they want requires more math and physics and I’d rather drop out entirely than touch another math or physics book.

283,"So I'm at a three week camp at UCLA and there is a LOT of underage drinking. However, it's pretty much normalized and I've desensitized to it. My friends roommate is constantly throwing parties with alcohol, and we just laugh about it. We told the equivalent of our TA, and she just laughed about it too and said it's normal and we can't really do anything about it and that would be a dick move anyway.

Anyway, I've made friends with some of the partier people, and it honestly seems fun. Like not that fun, but an interesting experience. I've never drank alcohol, heck I've never been away from my parents, and I have health anxiety. So I've always been anxious because ""alcohol is poison"" and I'm terrified of messing up my brain.

So I watched the parties, it's the end of the three weeks, and I kinda really want to experience it while I have a chance. I might not get another opportunity for a long time, definitely not until college. And these are small parties in dorms, like less than ten people, and everyone is in high school, so it seems a lot safer than a college party would be. 

Anyway, logically it doesn't sound like the best idea. But even my friends roommate, blackout drunk, was fine. People are drinking and getting high every night and they're fine, and I wouldn't drink that much. Something about it just sounds fun and exciting. 

Oh, I forgot to mention, I've watched from afar and wanted to go, but this time a girl I'm friends with who's a partier actually just invited me, I said yes but I'd think about it too. So I have a formal invitation to be there too. 

I don't know. I think it would be a fun and relatively safe experience, I'm just worried about the health anxiety. If I panic after because I'm worried about brain damage, I won't be able to talk to my mom for reassurance because I could never tlel her I drank alcohol without her permission. Well, I probably could, but I'd feel too embarrassed to do so.

Is it worth it? Okay, I know it's not ""worth it"" but I think it'd still be fun. Do yall at least think it'd be okay? Or like is it actually a bad idea?",24Jul2019,2

I hate how I'm not allowed to have friends, if I try to meet ppl, REJECTION, try to talk to girls? REJECTION. but other guys dont have to pay any money or anything and Idk why? 

Ive literally tried getting women gifts, than they want cash from me so I do that cause its what I was told they wanted... But they never even want to hang out or anything after that? But other men even tell me thats how you get them to like you, ive been told repeatedly personality doesnt mean shit. 

My world view is just anger at this point, I wake up angry, seeing ppl happy? Angry. I'm so mad ive started having extremely homicidal and suicidal thoughts. Im just so mad at everyone for treating me like a ugly tumor. Everyone at work meets each other and starts dating and shit but not me, everyone at work gets to hang out on the weekends and shit but not me. 

I was never allowed to have friends as a kid, but now I want to try it and I'm not allowed as an adult either. I'm angry at the whole world now.

285,"To bring everyone up to speed, I need to talk about where it all started and is still ongoing; My volunteering organization

I currently volunteer every Saturday at a local church to spend tine with mentally disabled children. We do lots of activities with them in hopes of have them accepted as a part of the society and not receive and unwanted special treatment or sympathy. Now, although i used the word ""children"" the age group of the mentally disabled ranges from 8 years old all the way to the ones on their 20s.

Ive been with the organization for 3 years now, and throughout my time there, I met ""Michelle"". She was one of the people in their 20s with mental disabilities, and has been with the organization for longer than me. At first i didn't think much of it, but Michelle began to get close to me. Now, she directs all her complaints, thoughts, concerns, and whatever she has on her mind on EVERY Saturday. She also constantly reminds me I'm her favorite and likes me the most

On the paper this doesn't sound like a big deal. but problems arise when I am busy with other tasks. As the group leader, I constantly have to make sure everyone is getting along and participate in the activities. Michelle would try to grab my attention when i am in a busy state like this, and when i say ""In a moment, Michelle"" or ""I'll get your right after this"", she throws a hissy fit. She only calms down after she has my undivided attention.

All this brings to my main point; Whenever there is no volunteering, Michelle is constantly texting me, sending me emojis, and attempts to call me. I am talking about at least 20-390 times a day. I ignore them most of the time, but it got to the point where she would try to contact me when Im at work or at college classes as well.

I really can't ignore whats being bombarded at me, but i feel like if i block her, it would hurt her feelings.

288,"


My girlfriend has a mass of issues she's been dealing with for years. Depression, OCD, Scoliosis, Schizophrenia, anxiety, and this weird stomach issue. She's had all of these since 9-10 and she is 20 now. Her mom is the type of person who refuses to acknowledge anything is wrong, even when there clearly is. So refused to let my girlfriend go to the doctor up until last year when after being sent to a therapist, she immediately diagnosed with severe depression, OCD, anxiety, and mild schizophrenia tendencies. Her mom was not happy about letting her go to the doctor (my girlfriend had been begging practically weekly for several years until the mom finally had enough) and was even more upset when she found out her daughter actually had issues. 

As her boyfriend, I've seen her go through these issues for 4 years and there isn't anything I can do about the doctor situation.  

She still has eating issues where everytime she eats, she gets stabbing cramps in her stomach (she isn't lactose or gluten intolerant). Her mom pretends these issues don't exist. 

I am wondering if there are any ways she can go to the doctor very cheaply and without having her parent involved. We wouldn't be able to use her mom's insurance, so we'd have to go uninsured. Are there any programs that work with people in this situation, and or low income people? We live in Indiana.",24Jul2019,2
289,"TW: rape

I am 17f and just finished up high school a little over a month ago. On the last day of school, one of my closest friends, ""Jack,"" was publicly accused of raping a girl we went to school with a month prior.

For some context about our friendship, Jack and I had only been friends starting senior year, but we had a serious connection that sometimes went beyond ""just friends,"" and I even lost my virginity to him. Going into senior year, I didn't have very many friends as almost everyone I knew had just graduated and left for college. It was really nice having a friend I could talk to about basically anything, and we both agreed that we wanted to keep in touch in college and hopefully as adults.

The story of the rape was that Jack and the accuser had started hooking up at a party one night at Jack's house. Both parties were extremely intoxicated, but that's about where the similarities end. Jack claimed that they both agreed not to have sex and they slept in different rooms, whereas the accuser said he raped her while she was unconscious. It's a ""she said he said"" situation, and the victim is not pressing charges.

Jack skipped our high school graduation and has become really isolated from our friend group because very few of us believe his side of the story, which is complete denial of rape. A few days into the summer, I called him to get his side of the events of that night, and felt really conflicted as what to believe. I know that false accusations of rape are really rare, but I also didn't want to lose my best friend. I basically cried for 3 days straight because I felt so confused and betrayed. A week after he and I talked, I decided that I wanted him to still be in my life. The truth was really murky to me at the time, and I decided to take his word. There was always the possibility that he WAS actually a rapist, but I figured there wasn't really anything I could do about it.

We started hanging out together again recently, and while my parents were out of town, I invited him to a party I was throwing (there weren't any people from my school who had heard about the story there, so I figured it would be nice for him to get out of the house). He met all of my closest friends who were back in town for the summer

Flash forward to two days ago when I went out to get brunch with my friend ""Amanda."" She asked me if I had contacted Jack recently, and I told her that he and I had connected again. I also informed her that I was still a little uneasy, just because I didn't know the accusers side of the story. She then proceeded to tell me what had happened that night from the victims point of view. That was stuff you could't make up. The victim nearly got rescinded from her college because she had dropped out of the one class she and Jack shared. Amanda (who was close with the victim) saw her cry every single day of last month of school.

I now feel very inclined to believe the victims side of the story, but still feel very confused. I introduced Jack to all my friends and now feel like I've let them all down by even having him in the same room as them. I really don't know what to do, and what to even tell Jack. How should I proceed with this?",24Jul2019,2
290,"This is going to be long but I'm am putting as much detail as I can so my dog's well being is the first priority.

My dog used to love other dogs until my neighbor's untrained dogs attacked him when they got out. We have had multiple problems with this over the past 4 years of this happening and they dont give a fuck and blame my dog because of his breed. He was almost socially rehabilitated around other dogs when he got attacked again  by an unleashed dog at a park (not a dog park) that we love to go to. That attack also caused me to get a large cut on my leg from falling on a tree branch by the sidewalk, it wasn't deep and didn't scar but it really upset my boy.

He's a sweetheart to people but feels like he has to defend both me and himself when other dogs walk by. He has gotten a lot better but will still puff up and growl. I do not know where to go from here when it comes to resocializing him because of his size, how people precieve his breed when aggressive, and my friends only have really old or small dogs and all it would take is a slip up for a ruined friendship or seriously injured dog.

I move off the sidewalk when people with dogs walk by and tell him, ""Stay, easy boy, it's ok,"" while holding his leash and gently patting his head. He will sit there tense and with his fur all spiked up but listen. This only works if the other dog is behaving, if that dog starts running at him or if the dipshit owner wants our dogs to ""be friends"" he stands and growls sometimes barks quietly so I back up, calm him down, tell him ""Hush"" if he barks, and if needed give a verbal warning to the other owner. Most of the time they act offended and occasionally I get chewed out for having an aggressive dog and its embarrassing and I feel ashamed. I feel like I have done a bad job taking care of and raising him. 

When he does not growl, bark, and/or when he is calm around another dog that passes I tell him he's a good boy and give him a high five which I taught him means ""You are good/I love you/you did a good job.""

The resocialization work I do is go to a pet store walk about 10ft from the door, turn around and go back to the car about 2 - 5 times to get him used to the smell of other dogs. When he's ok with that we go to the entrance without going in and go back about 2 - 3 times so the smell is stronger. After that we go to the entrance and just sit there watching people and dogs walk in and out and helping him stay calm fro about 10 to 20 minutes. Finally, we go in, walk around, and sometimes leave with a treat or new toy when he does a really good job. This takes place over the course of a few weeks to 3 months depending on how well he does and how he is adjusting but idk if there is more I can do for him to help him get over that fear. 

I have to do this every time there is an incident with my neighbor's dogs. It takes longer to rehabilitate and retrain him each time it happens. It has gotten to the point where I only walk him at the park because of those dogs and if I see them he instantly goes back inside. He usually follows me around the yard while I garden or lays under the magnolia watching me but refuses to leave the yard even when the neighbors dogs are out. He will watch them but not provoke or tease them. They will go in everyone's yards, run down the street I live on, and bark at my dog from the street. The only time my dog reacts is if they run up to him and bite or growl or if they come into our yard. I always take him inside when I see them but when i don't see them is when the problems start.

 So far no dog has been injured but having to rehabilitate him after every incident and the fear of injured or dead dogs has been exhausting me mentally. I want what is best for him and I dont know if there is more that I can be doing for him.

I'm need advice and suggestions on what to do. Until then I plan on getting a harness that says NOT DOG FRIENDLY or STAY BACK I AM SCARED for him to wear but I don't want people to be scared of him or for him to have to wear that every time we go out especially in the hot and humid south Texas weather. The leash I use now is a soft rope material that tightens around his chest but leaves room for him to breathe if he pulls (which he rarely does)",24Jul2019,1

He was pushing him and abusing him before me my friend and bystanders broke it up I chose not to speak to him after that as he’s not one to ever apologise 

 2 weeks have passed and I see him outside the nightclub he yelled and shouted my brother better watch his back or he’ll cover him in blood, that he better not go to the police once it’s done ect the whole nightclub queue and everyone could hear I then walked away

I text him saying what’s his problem why’d he say that ect and he kept threatening my brother and said if I keep going I’ll be next and asked where I was

I was sitting inside a fast food place eating and he comes storming in and cowardly attacks me whilst I’m vulnerable ripping my shirt and striking me with punches multiple times I threw a few punches back in defence and pushed him away before it was broken up

294,"sorry if this is laid out badly, i’m on mobile. for some background: i’ve lived with one of my housemates for two years already and the other for a short time previously, with no major issues. we recently moved into a new place together and they’ve been inconsiderate and all around shitty friends since.

i’m in school year round (thankfully finishing soon), so i’ve needed to wake up early on weekdays for about a year straight, so it’s not a new thing to anyone in my life. ever since my current housemates and i moved into our new place recently, they keep having get togethers at night, in the middle of the week, while i’m trying to sleep. last week, i had to shut down a dj set in front of a bunch of people, and other than that it’s just having people over late at night and generally being too loud for me to sleep through.

i still feel really shitty about having to be the asshole to break up their little party in front of all those people, and the fact that they still haven’t got the message to at least save these things for the weekend really bothers me. it’ll happen, i’ll shoot them a text like, “hey i’m trying to sleep one room over, please try to keep it down,” and i’ll hear it get quiet for a sec before they start /mocking/ me. 

i’ve made my peace with not considering them friends anymore and all that, but i still expect them to have some consideration for me as a fellow housemate. i’ve tried to make it clear to them that having people over and being loud on weeknights isn’t cool, which i don’t even see as too big of a request, but they don’t even take that seriously to begin with. i just don’t know what else to do, it’ll be a while before the lease is up (i played myself, i know), and it wouldn’t sit right with me to move someone else in my place who’s a stranger to them.

i would be really appreciative of any advice as to what my options are and ways to try and get through the rest of my time here without losing my mind. anything helps, thanks!",24Jul2019,1

296,"So my dad is an alcoholic, hes has tried his best to get better but he does not want to cut out alcohol completely right away because it might kill him from with drawl, he has never gotten praise from him trying, only the ""Get better"" ""Stop Drinking"" and ""you need to try harder"" he hasn't gotten praise in years from anyone but me and its driven him to depression and suicidal thoughts. I hear the things my grandparents say to him and they are NOT nice at all, my grandmother is most likely the only one in the argument not shouting and screaming. Whenever i try to get involved my grandparents push me out and tell me ""i shouldn't be a part of this and i'm not old enough to understand, but they don't know that I always listen in and i know everything that goes on in the arguments, i feel like i should be able to get in the ""Discussion"" i mean hes my dad after all and they wont be able to push me out of this my whole life, eventually they should let my talk about my father and let me be able to speak up, give them my input, AND MAKE A CHANGE. My dad is now in treatment and my grandparents wont let me see him until he ""meets their standards"". i'm his daughter and i think he should be able to know when hes well enough to see me. my mother even wanted him to go in patient treatment for 3 months. i understand that she thinks it would help him and that he might be better afterwards but I know his limits and his mental state, i think him being away from me for that long might drive him further to depression.

297,"So, today I was in the gym and there was a lady who was working out really hard and she was also an amputee. Stupid me with my word vomit said to her how cool she was and that I thought she was amazing. 

She then said to me: why? 

I, then realizing my absolute cockup, blurred out that I thought she was so cool at the gym coz of her leg. 

Looking back, I probably sounded like I was patronizing her. She might get this a lot or be sensitive to people commenting and probably wants to go about just like everyone else. I honestly thought she was so badass and powerful from overcoming challenges that most don’t have to deal with, but also going harder in the gym than most.

He joined over half a year ago and we've conversed since. He is really bright and has a very sound way of thinking and. So a couple of months ago I found myself to have butterflies every time he joined a conversation or such and after a lot of consideration I realized that I had developed some kind of feelings for him.

Naturally I put my feelings aside and continued to be active in this SG.


Now. Roughly two weeks ago he confessed that he had likewise feelings for me as I had for him. 

I shut it down immediately pointing out the fact that not only is he 9 years younger. He is also a thousand of miles away.

The legal age of consent where we are from respectively is long past so it wouldn't be illegal. But it certainly isn't sound.

Continuing on from that. Ever since he told me my heart has been on fire. Every bloody minute I think of him. I can't sleep and it's affecting my work as a direct cause of it.

308,"Hi there, to preface, I know they use this Reddit platform so I'll try to be as concise as possible while giving the necessary details. So, I'll just get to it then. My family has always been your typical dysfunctional type, never too close but not that distant either. We do love each other, however, we never express this. No hugs, no ""I love you""s or ever spending ANY quality time together, slowly drifting apart over time. Things have been seesawing in the past several years, as we have been working together, struggling to survive month to month, just barely, for years and years (to this day we still have major debt). A little over 2 years ago, my Sibling passed away tragically and it has devastated all of us ...life has and never will be the same without them.

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly, I feel this has caused many questions and problems to rise to the surface. Would we have continued to drift apart until we could all support ourselves independently had he not passed away? probably, yes.. Would my extended family be reaching out to us the way they are now? who knows.. However I would like to try getting to know them, but I feel like this is all forced because my sibling passed away and well.. I don't really know. This whole dynamic feels really wrong and fucked to me. My head is on the verge of exploding just thinking about all of this for the better part of the past few years, add on the fact that I still have a massive road ahead of me in terms of simply starting my life at some point (no studdies, next to zero work experience besides helping with family, never been in a relationship and so on), It's fucking depressing.. I'm in my late 20's btw. 

&amp;#x200B;

My Current issue is connecting with the extended family that has reached out to us recently, I have never contacted them.. Not since we were kids and had family gatherings. I have never used Facebook or had any 'real friends' I have zero idea what I should say, where the fuck do I begin?. It has made me realize what an anti-social POS that I've been my entire life, the person I was closest to, confided in with all my deepest secrets that I have told nobody else, turned to when I needed advice - ultimately depended on when I needed a direction in life.. has been ripped away from me. I have never felt so alone, I never kept any close friends or maintained that close a relationship with my other siblings. No matter how bad I'd like to end it all and join my sibling, I could never put my family through that shit again.

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am, looking for any advice on how to make my current situation better - I appreciate any advice or response what so ever.. I am happy to answer any questions to a degree if needed.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Just an FYI; I went through a great deal when I was very young - it made me the strong person I believe I am today, I know the goals I want to achieve and life I want to lead etc. I'm just trying to figure things out with my family due to my social ineptitude.",24Jul2019,1

Im talking cheesy Spencer’s gifts-type and concert posters covering *every* wall (like no blank space), random furniture from different places that are more in the gross side, lots of weird novelty stuff everywhere.

A bit of context : I am a 24yo French person, still living at home in less than ideal conditions (nothing too bad but lots of tension and conflicts).
I want nothing more than to leave but I am currently working at a very underpaid job (think less than minimum wage). I am trying to find another job but my diplomas are proving to be useless (English and cultural studies, mostly music).
So I’ve pretty much accepted than life (professional and, to a lesser extent, personal) is not that enjoyable. I was on anti-depressant for a few months and feeling better but the treatment is ending and I don’t have the means to start another one. But, if everyone keeps going I’m guessing there must be some higher purpose than I’m not aware of. Any tips or people in similar situations? How do you deal with the fact that life sucks sometimes?

Some additional info: I’m a musician but finding it hard to concentrate and to deal with the fact that’ll never find myself good enough.
Also weird enough but I don’t really believe in Love with a capital L so that’s not a solution.

Someone from my church had mentioned that he might just be attending to please me and not because of faith.

I confronted him and told him that he shouldn’t be going if he is uncomfortable about it and I told him that I would fully understand.

320,"I haven’t posted on this account in a while because I’ve been trying to focus on myself. A while ago I had lost the woman I love to someone else while going through a lot of other personal issues and it got the best of me. After a few attempts at suicide I decided I’d try to fix myself. 

Fast forward to now, my ex and I are good friends and I don’t necessarily think that I want her back all of the time anymore. I started working out and though I’m not in amazing shape I’m as fit as I’ve been in a while and I’m really proud of myself. I’m better with money than I was yet I still struggle from time to time and my job promoted me to a higher paying position and they’re liking me way more which makes work enjoyable. I’ve even got into dating again, though they ended up not working out I did what I thought I wouldn’t be able to do and saw another person for a bit. 

Even though I’ve done all of this and progressed so much, I still feel that emptiness? The loneliness gets me too much too often and I talk to people I love daily. Part of me just really feels that even though so many people appreciate me, I still feel alone as if I had nobody, i feel like everytime something doesn’t workout with a girl that I’m just a lost cause and meant to be alone. I constantly just beat myself up over everything I do still and I just can’t change that. It doesn’t help that I feel like nobody can truly understand what’s going on with my thoughts and feelings from time to time. 

I guess what I’m getting at is I see these posts all of the time where they say “it gets better” and that you’ve just gotta keep pushing. Realistically my life’s full of more downs than ups and it’s so hard for me to see that no matter what I have going for me.

323,"I’m a twenty year old still living at home with my mom and her boyfriend. Also living with us is my twin brother. He’s always been very emotionally volatile and prone to mood swings but lately they have become completely unmanageable. 

          Six days ago he sat me down and told me that he was extremely concerned about the state of the environment. He said that he had been frequenting r/collapse and had become convinced that civilization will fall within the next few decades. As he was saying this he was visibly distressed to the point of shaking and fighting back tears, and it really shocked me. I’m not unfamiliar with the dire news regarding global warming but I had no idea he felt so strongly about it. 
  
            I tried to calmly explain to him that he was safe and encouraged him to read “The Uninhabitable Earth” a book I had read on the subject. I thought if he read it he could see some solutions as to what we can do about climate change. He seemed disinterested however and insisted that we were doomed, and that we should leave and go somewhere safer (we live in the midwestern United States). 

           I gave him a hug and tried my best to calm him down and eventually he did. The only problem is that the next morning he began crying again and talking about the same stuff, spouting off statistics about mass species die off. He also started talking about the Epstein case- I soon found out he’s fallen down the rabbit hole on that as well. 

      After this I told my mom, and when she came to comfort him he had a nervous breakdown and began crying and sobbing, saying how he wanted children but was robbed of it because of the time he was born. 

        This has been going on for almost a week now. He’s literally obsessed with climate change to the point where it’s pretty much the only thing he will talk about, that and Epstein stuff. I had to politely ask him to stop bringing it up to me because it just got so taxing to hear about. 
           
          It’s scaring the crap out of my poor mom. Every day he has crying fits where he yells about how we’re doomed as a species and how it’s unfair that we have to witness the death of the human race. 

      We’re arranging a trip to the doctor now for him. I have to be honest, though I feel guilty about it, he’s really starting to piss me off. Am I bad for saying that? It’s just that he’s turned my mom into a nervous wreck, and it’s not easy to live with someone that is in crisis mode 24/7. 

            It’s not like I’m unfamiliar with how astronomically shitty climate change is, but I can still function in the day to day. I suspect something much deeper is going on with my brother. Even prior to these outbursts he has always been extremely disorganized, forgetful, lethargic, and prone to crazy mood swings. We had some trauma from childhood that may contribute to it. His behavior right now honestly reminds me of someone having a full on psychotic break- especially when he says shit like “Has it seemed like the world has gone crazy these past few days?” Something he says constantly. 

          Does anyone know what could be going on here and what I should do because I’m really at my wit’s end. I love him but every day is a struggle to be around him lately. He is just so on edge, ready to burst at any time, and utterly obsessed with the most morbid topics. He desperately needs to take a break from all the social media he’s using but he won’t do it.",24Jul2019,1

When I was 17 or 18 I discovered what really turns me on. It was not the hot blonde cheerleader. Not the hooters girls. Not the hot teacher. Not the money grubbing models on social media platforms. It was married women. Yes, I know. Married women. If a woman has a wedding band on her finger I am automatically drawn to her (providing she's not overweight, yikes double the asshole). The instant reaction people have, and rightfully so, is one of absolute disgust. What kind of a sick, twisted fuck would want to violate the pure sanctity of marriage? And the answer to that, is me.

I love the depraved, fucked up sexual shit I can do with someone behind their husbands back. This isn't gonewild stories so I will spare the sexual details but Jesus Christ the things I have done with married women. They tell me their husbands don't express interest or after a decade their sex drive dies down. They tell me they are overjoyed with how ""kinky' I am. Having them do things for me they would never do for their husbands in a hundred years has become my literal kryptonite. I have ruined multiple engagements, broke up 2 marriages, have probably destroyed 6 or 7 relationships and yet I just keep going. I never ""force"" anyone to cheat.

I figured I could just take my GED over the next 8 months, and have a whole year to prepare for adult life, before I turn 18.

On the other hand, there's something a bit inspiring about high school.
I like learning and taking notes, and talking, being a pretty outgoing person. 

The only thing that's stopping me is knowing that I can get my GED much earlier, and I could use my time wiser with my hobbies than in a building.

Socially, I like the idea of getting ready for something in the morning. Even the bus ride seems appealing. 
I have a lot of nice outfits I would like to wear, but I can't justify wearing them when I just go about the house all day. 

I wear pajamas all day everyday, and it doesn't make me feel fresh like when I go out.

329,"I need this web development class for my degree. The first time I took it, I dropped out and received a W grade after I got overloaded with 18 credits. I took it again a few semesters later, gave up halfway in the semester, and failed the class. Before I had given up, I went to the professors office and asked if there was anyway I could catch up on my missing assignments. He was more than willing to give me the chance to submit everything I was missing to bring my grade up.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I gave up and never got to it. Failed the class. This summer semester, I took the class under the assumption that I was going to give it 100% of my focus. 2 courses (I also retook Business Calculus for the 5th time, passed with a B-) cost me $1538. I've done 2 assignments and missed everything else, the final is in a week or so. I don't think I have it in me to reach out to him a second time, I'm just going to fail the class then take it another semester.

&amp;#x200B;

**What do I do here? Do I email him? Should I contact him upon taking the class again? What do I do to make the situation less awkward when I take his class for the THIRD time, second time in person? He's the only professor who teaches this course and it's required for me to graduate.**

330,"Hi, I need some help, last time I posted here I talked about how I was feeling depressed and almost suicidal because of some school x life problems, I got no help, Im expecting to get better help this time, I'm on my 3rd year of highschool, I'm in the most exigent highschool in my state, and since last half of the first year I've been having a big drop in my grades and in my scholar performance, it's very hard for me to concentrate and every time I try to control myself I end up failing, every night after a day of school I think about how I feel so helpless and useless against myself because of how I can't control myself, it's like if my own person is trying to make me fail and at the same time trying to get up. 
Various times I've tried to make myself feel a bit better, having a little boost of courage of doing better but end up in the same spot, failing, I've been living with this for over 3 years, it's unbearable and it's the reason why so many times I've been thinking of trying to kill myself, and I know this looks like someone trying to attract attention but it's a real problem, I can't help myself and others can't take care of me forever, that's why sometimes I feel like suicide is an option, i've always been said that suicide isn't good and all that but the idea still gets in my mind to this day, in highschool I'm a loner, only 2 friends where I can't rely on that much, I don't have any one with who I can talk with this, my family only tells me the same thing when I introduce this, they say ""it's something that you have to deal with, get up when you fall down, as simple as that"" but it isnt, I have almost no control over my concentration and I've found no one that actually could've help me, I'm asking anyone of you guys here, what can I do to stop at least this feeling of sadness and loneliness in me for ever, or at least something I can do to stop thinking about it, please be kind to reply (and sorry if there are any grammar or spelling errors, English is my second language)",24Jul2019,1

333,"Yes, this sounds just as ridiculous as the title. So I am 18 years old, I am going to college for Aerospace Science in the fall. I have a job. I am still getting a bedtime from my parents and their reason is “you wake up at 11:00am everyday when you don’t work.” Here’s my take: what is the problem with sleeping in if I don’t have to work the next day and I have no responsibilities that require me to wake up early to do them. I have many chores to do around the house, examples, feed the dogs, laundry, dishes, check on my brothers. I am just very conflicted and I want to move out, but I don’t have the funds to do so.

334,"I am getting another tattoo. I had originally planned on not telling my dad about it because I am nervous to put it lightly. My dad hates tattoos, and was upset when I got my first one. I’m scared that he’s going to be mad when I get this next tattoo, maybe even more so. My dads opinion is so important to me. He and I don’t see eye to eye when it comes to tattoos, but I feel bad not telling him about it. 

Any idea how to approach the situation? I’ve already made the appointment, I am getting it regardless of what he says, I just need help on what to do about it I guess. I had planned on not telling him, since I move out five days after I get the tattoo. It’s going to be on my calf and I live in a hot state so I want to wear shorts leading up to my move but obviously I can’t if I suddenly have a tattoo I never told my dad about. I know it seems so trivial and maybe it is, but I don’t know how to go about it. Anything helps.",24Jul2019,1
336,"Okay so my best friend has always been a supportive, loving person and she’s been there for me when I most needed a shoulder to cry on.. up until the day I realized she wasn’t everything I thought she was. I don’t want to go into detail, but she did something I never thought she would, and the day this happened, I felt so heartbroken and betrayed and angry. Im someone that likes to communicate their feelings so later that day I poured out how I was feeling and she didn’t seem to care much about it, she thought I was making it a big deal. That night she texted me literally acting like nothing happened so I decided to go along with it. This summer she has been doing/acting very weird. For example, she got her check from her job and was rlly upset that it had only came out to $200 and days later she asked me if I wanted to go w her to deposit it, i agreed, we got there and the lady made her sign some paper which had the amount of her check which was $600. I was very confused on why she had lied to me. Another thing, we are going to the same college together and we had planned everything, taking turns driving there, getting classes together in the afternoon, etc. One night she called me and told me how she was calling other schools to see if it was too late for her to transfer and that she was seriously thinking about doing it. I felt sort of angry, I know I shouldn’t but we had already planned everything and it kind of made me upset that she hadn’t told me anything and I felt blindsided by this. I know she has no obligation to tell me everything. Anyways so I applied to a job and I told her she should apply too and so she told me she tried but they weren’t hiring anymore so there was no reason for applying. Then she texted me days later saying she got the job. I was confused on why she told me she wasn’t gonna apply and she did. I know I should be happy for her but it kind of makes me angry, like this entire time I felt like she wasn’t truly my friend for always doing sneaky things and I’ve been trying to distance myself from her Bc I felt like she was envious of me but when she told me that she got the job I kind of felt envious of her. I don’t want to feel like that... am i the problem? I just want to be as positive as I can, and I truly want to be happy for her, but I really believe it would be better for me if I distanced myself Bc I shouldn’t be feeling this way about my BEST FRIEND. Mind you, I never felt this negative energy from her until that day I felt like she broke my trust and it’s been going downhill since. I kind of felt like I opened my eyes to the real her.

338,"Hey, if you're going to take the time to read this I want to thank you in advance. I understand that at my age I can't know everything and I haven't experienced as much as I could or maybe should, o think it's important for my growth to seek wisdom and advice not only from those around me, but any who can give it to me. I'll cut to the chase, I'm bored of life and feel that I don't really have a destination. For much of my life I've dealt with mental health issues and this is probably just another item in the long list of said issues, but this feels different. I don't really feel sad or worried, I just kind of feel nothing. For the past year or so I've been working out, dieting, pursuing higher education and just generally trying to improve my life in any way I can. I usually try to meditate and acknowledge my emotions and thoughts in a calm and hopefully rational manner and so far all of these things have helped. I feel much better in my personal life and many worries are gone, my finances are well in order, I am in the best shape of my life and far more physically attractive and confident than I've ever been but I just can't seem to find any reason in it all. I suppose I don't need any reason to strive for a better life but without a sense of purpose it just feels like I'm on autopilot all the time. Most real problems I have seem to just leave my mind and I don't find myself toiling with many thoughts and I just feel so exhausted all the time. I guess what I'm asking for is just some advice as to how to get some energy or direction, I just feel like my life is stagnating.

341,"Hello all! I need advice on two different situations. 

The first: I ordered custom dice from someone mid March. I “know” them through a large group on Facebook. They have several health issues, and I bought them as part of their fundraiser for one of their surgeries. They didn’t tell me how long the dice would take, but said they would be pouring them the next few days. 
A month later (mid April), I still hadn’t heard anything, so I send a message checking in. A month after that (mid may), I got a photo with the completed dice, that just needed the numbers to be painted in. 
It’s been over two months since then. I haven’t heard anything. I know the creator has had ongoing health issues (through their posts in the group, not because they’ve told me personally). 
Do I ask again? What do I do? I understand life gets in the way, but it’s been nearly 6 months now. 

Problem two: My roommate, a grown man, constantly leaves pee on the toilet seat. I’ve asked his wife to talk to him about it, and it stopped for a few days, then continued. I’ve nearly peed myself because I had to stop to wipe down the seat before going to the bathroom.

I guess we tried too many ways to get in without using my number and it forced me out of my own email.  So I go in, and the only way I can verify it’s me is with my number. No email. I press “get help” and do the few tests they have. Then they got a “we have to have time to verify that it’s you. Put in email below blah blah blah”. Problem is, ALL my backup emails are locking me out. So, I can’t going into my own accounts without using my locked out emails. So, I got my friend to help me out. I used her email, got the code. I put it in but at the end it says “Unfortunately we couldn’t verify it is you.” SOOO I try fixing one of my previous emails. I guess I tried accessing my backup email too many times and it says “try again in a few hours” and now I’ve just given up. —

345,"I’m in my schools marching band. I play trumpet during concert band and it is my “main” instrument. I’ve been playing for 5-6 years. I’m okay at it and I enjoy it, not all the time but its just iffy. Freshman year I marched trumpet, Sophomore year I got heavily involved with battery and marched bass 4 in outdoor marching band. This is my Junior year in the program and they won’t allow me to march bass again because they need trumpet players plus my directors keep saying, to persuade me, that I’m good at playing and they really want me to be on trumpet (I play 1st trumpet and I’m 2nd chair). This is not be narcissistic, this is just me explaining. Plus the head director is biased towards trumpet because he is a trumpet player. So I’m playing trumpet this year. In marching band we only have 2 mellophones this year (it’s like a trumpet but it’s pitch is shifted). The music for the trumpets this year is EXTREMELY boring and we rest for 3/4 of the show, I find this to be absolute bs because it doesn’t make any sense, why would the directors want me on trumpet so bad if we DONT PLAY ANYTHING. So as I was talking with the director I told him it would be fun to play mellophone because I looked at their part and it was really fun. So this afternoon before rehearsal he pulled me aside and asked if I wanted to play mellophone since they have very few of them. He said it would just be for tonight and we would see how it would go. And if it was good/I enjoyed it I would be put on it for the season. I loved it. Actually playing music was fun plus the part is written well. 

This causes a lot of problems. 1) there is a girl in the trumpet section which I really like and I know she likes me for a fact but we haven’t done anything yet. (She is the chair above me). She is extremely mad that might be moving sections since this happened last year too with bass. She has liked me since 8th grade (in 11th now). 2) this is the bigger one: I’ve switched instruments every single year so far, even in indoor percussion, I switch every year so far. I want to pick something an be good at it, not switch every year and be okay at everything. Plus I won’t be with my “main” section.

I want to play mellophone because the music is more fun plus the 2 others in the section are friends and funny. 

But I also want to play trumpet because I want to stick to something and be good at it, plus id get to talk to the girl I like

And yes, I know that I shouldn’t stay in a certain place for a girl, and that i should do whatever I think is where my heart is but I know I’ll have fun in either section.

The director said for both of us to sleep on it and come back and see what we think. 

My choices are mellophone or trumpet and I’m torn down the middle. I just need some advice.",24Jul2019,2
346,"So I am getting married December 2019 , and I have been engaged since dec 2018. I am a devote catholic and my future husband is an ex Jehovah’s Witness. His family is still very JW. 

From the beginning both side have been very open and honest. We are going to have a catholic ceremony at my church and his family was not going attend that part and just attend the reception. Yes, they were going to miss there son getting actually married but at least it was a compromise. I had set up a special time right after the ceremony to go take picture with them not at the church, I bought the mother a corsage, my fiancé and his mother had picked a tentative mother and son dance, I have set up the head table for his parents and my parents to sit with us.  

This whole time since December 2018 his family has been calling me and texting me asking me about the wedding and how everything was going, and I have been trying to keep them involved in everything as much as I can since they live about 4 hours away from us. We went down there 3 weeks ago to see them and when we left it was all hug’s and “we can’t wait to see you at the wedding” and “we will be there”. 

I come home from work today and my fiancé sits me down and says his mother spoke with the “elders” of the JW church and they prayed about it and they decided not to come to the wedding. 

I am furious. First i feel like a fool and like I have been being played this whole time. Then I remember what hypocritical bullshit this is because were they live they go to reception all the time. His mother has shown me pictures and videos of her and her husband at wedding receptions before, so they can go to strangers receptions but not there own sons? My heart is in pain for myself and for my fiancé. Wedding are supposed to be about joining two family’s together and his is now refusing to even show up to just the party. 

My fiancé hates confrontation and is very upset but is of the mindset if they don’t wanna come o well it’s there choice “it’s just the way they are”. My first reaction is I want to speak up, I want to at least tell the mom something like “ this is the first of many events that we are going to both need to compromise because of religion, I want you to please reconsider not coming, the hurt it would bring me if you didn’t come that scar would not heal for a long time” 

But now laying here in bed I am thinking do I even want them at the wedding, if they don’t even wanna be there do I want to beg them to be, do I wanna be vindictive and use this as an excuse to not have to compromise in the future, do I want this looming are they and aren’t they coming cloud now over my wedding? I could just shut my mouth no longer say a word to his mother or anyone else about anything, when they ask me about the wedding just not reply.

348,"Hey guys, obligatory first time posting to this sub, throwaway account, etc. I was torn on whether or not to post this on r/depression, but since I'm hoping for some general advice I thought this would be the better sub. Also, apologies if this post comes off a little rambly, it was weird to organize my thoughts on this.

So, for the past year or so I've been rapidly losing interest in everything. I used to be really into watching twitch, anime, Netflix, and YouTube, but I can't find anything I want to watch anymore. I've loved playing video games my entire life, and even got into streaming at one point, but now I can't really get into them anymore. Reading, learning to play piano, learning new languages, the list goes on and on. I'm even starting to lose interest in hanging out with my friends even though I love them more than anything. 

I've spent a lot more time on my own recently and this disinterest has become significantly more apparent. I've always struggled with self confidence, and tended to pour myself into other's affairs as a way to give myself a purpose, but I know that's not healthy for me so I've been trying to build a better sense of self. But there's just nothing I want to do. I'll sit idly for hours without feeling like I want to *do* anything. It's not that I'm lacking the energy to do things, it's just that nothing sounds fun or interesting.

I've been making sure to consistently work out and focus on self improvement, while also maintaining a regular schedule. I've been forcing myself to socialize, pursue new activities, and continuing to be involved in things I used to love doing. I'm also in school, but I feel like I'm just getting my degree because I know it'll help me make a decent amount of money, rather than because I have any interest in the field. (I do also have a couple prescriptions to help with depression/anxiety, but I recently started a new one so it'll take some time before I see any direct impact). I just feel like I'm coasting through life, completely detached and uninterested. I am pretty bummed because of all this, but I don't feel suicidal or anything. I just feel blank. 

Is there anything else I should be doing? I feel like I'm checking the boxes I'm supposed to, but I have to be missing something. Any advice on how to improve my state of mind would be extremely welcomed, and I greatly appreciate anyone who took the time to read this and offer advice.",24Jul2019,2

353,"For context, I’m a 19 year old female college student, and this summer I’ve been working at a country club as a server. The staff there is almost entirely 18-25 year olds, mostly college students home on break. I really enjoy the job and I get along really well with the rest of the staff - we get together pretty frequently outside of work, usually to drink and chill at someone’s place and swim or whatever. We joke around at work and it’s generally a fun environment. However, the richest families in my state are members of the club and I don’t get any tips. It’s frustrating, especially when my friends serving at restaurants are consistently making more money than me in less time.

To get to the point - I went into work today thinking it would be a normal day, but 10 minutes into my shift my manager told me to come with him. He brought me to a different room where our HR director Kelly was and we all sat down. They proceeded to question me about events that occurred last Saturday (7/20), when I had been working a wedding. Basically, they had gotten reports that I had been drinking on the job and they asked me for an explanation.

I had actually been drinking at the wedding - i maybe had 2 / 3 shots throughout the 8 hour shift, each mixed into a large soda and sipped here and there throughout the night. I don’t really care that it sounds bad - to explain this workplace culture would take too long, The crew feels like a family, but all you really need to know is that about 75% of the staff had a drink at the wedding, and many of my coworkers drink at work on random days.  I don’t need judgement though, just unbiased advice.

Anyways, I denied the allegations - i figured, they don’t have any proof. There aren’t cameras in the club, there aren’t pictures or texts I sent that would expose me (we have a big group message with all the younger employees who are “chill” i guess) - it’s he said she said. So, I denied, denied, denied. I said I would sarcastically joke about drinking at work, such as “Ugh I need a drink too,” or “Maybe I should pour myself one,” etc., but that I was never going to seriously do it. I explained that sarcasm and joking around is my personality, and that someone must have misinterpreted what they heard. More was discussed, but I eventually was told I could go back to work. They then came and found me 10 minutes later and told me that, because they had “multiple reports” that they actually had to suspend me for 3 days and that they will let me know on Friday whether I will be “terminated” or not. 

SOOooo - I may be fired. It seems likely to me, even though there isn’t hard evidence. I just think they won’t want the liability. But, should I wait to see what happens and possibly get fired ??? OR, should I quit before that happens? I need this job for my resume and I would rather not say I was fired from the job. I know that if I quit now I would most likely still be able to use of my managers as references, since we had a good relationship. 

Here’s the last thing I have on my mind - I was genuinely thinking of quitting already because I’ve been fed up with getting no tips. I’ve already applied to a few jobs here and there m. And, honestly, even if my name is cleared I don’t think I will ever feel comfortable working there again - it would be too weird and embarrassing. So I think I would still quit even if I don’t get fired. The only thing is, can you even quit when your being investigated? on such short notice? (2 days?) honestly, SOS this has been making me insanely anxious alllllll day long. Any help would be welcome, thanks ;)",24Jul2019,1
354,"We broke up about 3 weeks ago. The past week or so we’ve met up about 3 times under the context of hanging out “as friends,” but it’s turning into more of a friends with benefits situation.

We cuddle, kiss, have sex and watch movies. Essentially we’re pretending that we’re dating even though we’re not.

Realistically I know that we’re not getting back together and I don’t have any expectation of that, and I don’t think she does either. However, she said she still loved me today and I told her I love her too.

Being with her under a FWB situation is better than nothing I guess, because I do want to try and be her friend somehow. We’ve tried to hang out platonically without physical intimacy, but it seems pretty inevitable at this point.

We both agreed this probably won’t last too long once feelings grow back more and/or one of us starts missing the other a lot (which has already happened a little bit for the both of us). I think that’s a pretty realistic expectation so it seems like we are on the same page about it for now.

Basically I think we both are having a hard time letting each other go and it’s really sad, but I do still enjoy being able to have her in my life in some way. 

My question is should I ride it out until it starts to get uncomfortable for one of us or just break it off now? Obviously I don’t want either of us to get hurt, but I also do want to enjoy being able to spend time with her while I can.

I also wish there was a way I could remove myself of my physical feelings towards her so we could just hang out platonically like a normal friendship, but we both are all over each other when we hang out. I strongly desire to have her in my life, but I don’t know how to go about becoming her friend. If anyone has ever been in a similar situation I would appreciate your two cents.",24Jul2019,1
355,"Hello everyone, this is my first post here and I hope that you’ll be able to help me! (At least a little bit) 

I (18F) was a really ambitious en independent person till the last half of the final year of high school (so let’s say March 2019). I used to have a lot of hobbies and I was fine being and doing things on my own. I was able to watch Netflix for hours, study with interest and in the meantime I liked to travel to even close places on my own. 

I got into a relationship in January/February and I know that my SO prefers the independent and ambitious side of me (he’s also like that). 

It all went downhill when the last months of school came. The pressure of finals was incredibly high, and as I also struggle with anxiety, quite unbearable. After and even during the exams I got incredibly burnt out. 

Nowadays nothing gives me satisfaction anymore, my concentration is shit and I’ve become really dependent on my SO. This whole situation is kinda ruining my life. I have a long summer vacation and I constantly feel like I’m losing time to do stuff but I also can’t find the motivation and focus to do things. I also notice how this burn out makes my anxiety worse and is a negative influence on my relationship. 

How can I get out of this? I’m clueless and I really want to fix this and go back to my normal self.

TL;DR- got burn out because of school, it takes a toll on me, now I don’t know how I can go back to my independent and ambitious self.",24Jul2019,1
357,"Hey, this is my first post but I feel like I need to get it out there and off my chest. I have ADHD and anxiety disorder (actually diagnosed by a doctor) I also believe I have depression because of the past two years and I have the common signs of depression. To sum it up my parents divorced, my grandfather that lived with us died, my dog I was very close with died, my mom takes her frustration out on me and the uncertainty in my ex’s (we will call her Maddie)  and I relationship. I went $7,500 in debt on a credit card and spent it on useless shit. And on top of that I bought a $13,000 car. I have lost multiple jobs due to the lack of motivation. I sleep like shit, eat like shit and overall feel like shit. As I said before Maddie and I were together for 3 and a half years, since sophomore year of high school. Over the past year and a half things started to get rough (around when my depression started.) We would argue over small things like where I would sit on her bed to play a game or how to share the blanket. These arguments would just turn us both defensive and turn into something way bigger than it had to be. The only things that are entertaining to me are hockey, video games and hanging out with my one friend.


Anyways now to the my home life. Over the time that I started to lose the jobs, my parents started to crack down on me telling me I had to get my shit together. My dad has always been the more approachable parent because he was understanding and would try to help me but when he got frustrated he would flip out and yell and take my shit away like my Xbox. My mom will just yell at me about anything because that’s how she was raised. If I didn’t do something right away she would start yelling and hit me or call me stupid or something like that. She also does this thing to embarrass me in front of people, she would point something out like “you’ve been wearing that shirt for three days... that’s disgusting.” In front of her friends, my friends or just in public. Eventually I got a job working for a small construction company that was my moms co-workers husbands company. She told me to not lose the job because it would make her look bad. I was genuinely excited for this job because it was chill and a good work out. I got mono two weeks in and had to leave for two weeks to recover which was fine with the boss however it fucked up my sleep schedule because i would stay up late playing. I tried to fix it but I woke up late to many times. It’s my fault but I felt like a disappointment to my mom. My parents took away my WiFi and Internet due to my lack of a job and they were “testing” me to see if I was really motivated to get a job. Which meant they waited 4 days to see if I had gotten a job or not. Now this only set me back more because I didn’t have connection to search for jobs and they wanted me to drive somewhere that had connection and find a job or go store to store applying. Eventually when they realized that didn’t work they gave me back my internet but no WiFi. Eventually after a week and a half of more “testing” they decided that they needed to kick me out every morning when they leave the house and not to come back until they are home which would force me to find a job. I got a job doing postmates however it doesn’t make enough to be worth it.  So know I wake up every morning at 7-8 am and get home at 10 pm because that’s when dinner rush is over. During this talk/argument (about kicking me out in the morning) my dad said I was very close to being kicked out of the house. And I don’t know why but that hurt me a lot because the person that always had my back, the person I told everything, the person I wanted to make proud so badly but never could, the person that I looked up to most would say he didn’t want me in his life anymore hurt me, I had a full blown panic attack and stormed off to the shower where I cried and eventually showered. When I calmed down I came back out and reluctantly turned in my house keys and left for my mothers house. Anyways this family life caused a lot of stress.

This is where it all ties together. I don’t know why I’m sad all the time. I don’t know why I feel like ending it wouldn’t be the worst thing to happen to me. I don’t know why I’m always so unmotivated to do anything except sit there and watch YouTube or scroll through reddit all day. I concluded that maybe I should take a break with Maddie because the small petty arguments we had could only be making things worse. So we went on a break. Nothing changed. We still talked the same amount, still hung out the same amount and we still argued the same amount. After about three weeks of this I decided I wanted more space so we broke up. We agreed to stay exclusive because I care about her and still love her and she feels the same way but I needed space. This space worked we didn’t talk as much and most importantly we didn’t argue...for a couple of weeks. Eventually we had a big argument and she sent me a long message saying how we can still be friends and how I’m great person but she wants to be friends for now and maybe we can try it again in the future. Now at first I was feeling good, no more talking to Maddie=no stress maybe the occasional talk every couple of days but nothing over board. Well we didn’t talk for about a week and then she texted me and we talked. I’m not going to lie I was a little flirty and she was flirty back and things were going good. We called later that night and while we were talking we were laughing and for the first time in a very long time I felt happy. It was weird because I genuinely can not remember the last time I felt that way. That when it hit me that maybe I was taking this whole thing for granted and that we can fix our issues together. Well the next day we agreed to hang out but, she says I’m not allowed to hang out at her house. She later admits that she lied to her mom by saying she was working out while seeing me. This made me feel bad and then she said we had to go someplace public and she couldn’t be in an inclosed space with me. This made my heart sink it felt like a giant weight in my chest dropped. We hung out, everything goes fine. I’m not really in a good mood the whole time but she’s used to it so it’s no big deal but she could tell something was wrong. Now to yesterday. We are on the phone and for past couple of days since hanging out I have always texted or called first which makes me feel clingy to a girl that I broke up with. Anyways she could tell something was wrong and made me tell her. I told her that I want to try it again and that I feel differently about all of this etc. She said that I probably just thought I feel differently and realized that she means a lot to me and that I just miss talking to her and using her to rant to. This made me feel like total shit. Today I called but when I called she told me she was very anxious because of home cleaning and other chores. She only answered in one word answers and said it was because of the anxiety. I’m not completely sure if she is telling the truth but I think she was. I still felt hurt because of yesterday’s talk and now this. It just easy to draw up that she doesn’t like me anymore even though she says she loves me. I don’t know what to do now I don’t think I can handle being her friend. This was supposed to decrease the stress so I could focus on my home stuff but instead now all I think about is her.",24Jul2019,1
358,"I’ve been studying engineering for a little over a year now, and the entire time, I have felt no real sense of self-worth or fulfilment from my studies. Sure, there are moments where I feel a tiny bit of pride in myself — when I scored highest marks on a lab report or exam, for example — but even the feeling of accomplishment I got from that was extremely fleeting. 

Maybe I should start from the beginning, or at least from high school. You see, I never was the biggest fan of mathematics or the sciences in high school. It wasn’t that I found the classes too difficult; rather, I simply didn’t really get excited about them the way I did in other classes. 

Where I truly thrived was English, Band, and anything else that required creativity and/or critical thinking. Unlike most people in my class, I loved writing analytical essays as well as short stories and plays/screenplays. In my free time, my friends and I would write, direct, and act in short skits and videos, some of which we would show our teachers and classmates for fun. I took playing the trumpet so seriously that I was given the band’s most prestigious award my senior year. Looking back at it, winning that award was the last time I ever truly felt like I had achieved something. 

After high school, most people believed I would go to an Ivy League to study pre-law, or do something to do with writing or cinema, so when I decided to go into engineering, many people were shocked. My old band director had even commented on my decision to my younger sister, who is currently in high school. 

“Your sister needs some type of creative outlet in her life,” he would say. “If she goes into something in life where she doesn’t have that to focus on, she will burn out.” When my sister told me about what he said, I laughed it off, but deep down, my band director’s words struck a chord (pun intended). A year later, and I know for certain that he was right. I think about his words on an almost daily basis. 

The most stressful thing about the situation, if I’m being completely honest, is that I never really wanted to be an engineer. I wanted to do something I was passionate about, but my parents were opposed to the idea. You see, my parents are very traditionalist, conservative people, and my father comes from a long line of doctors, so for as long as I remember, they basically told me that I had to be a doctor as well. After a lot of convincing, they were also okay with me wanting to be a lawyer. Since engineering degrees in undergrad can get you into both law school and medical school, I basically had no other option but to go to engineering school, or I could say goodbye to any financial or emotional support from my parents. 

All of the reasons above have led me to feeling like my life is nothing but monotonous, meaningless drudgery. I think this has also led me down a depressive spiral, but whenever I talk to my parents about these concerns, they just brush me of, saying something like “oh, you’re just anxious about how you did on that last test, but when you get the results back, you’ll feel happy again.” The problem with that hypothesis is that even when I know am doing well academically, I still feel empty. I try to find joy in my life — I try so hard that I’ll often pretend that I am enjoying myself in an attempt to “trick” myself into being, at the very least, less miserable— but nothing works. 

I understand why my parents want me to go into the fields they want me to go into. There is definitely more job security in being a doctor or an engineer than there is in any job within the creative sphere. Still, is it even worth it to have job security in a job I never wanted in the first place? I’m not trying to sound like a privileged teen who thinks money is meaningless. I know that you need money and some type of job to even survive in the real world. However, is it really worth sacrificing that feeling of accomplishment and self worth I get from doing things I am actually passionate about just to have some superfluous spending power?

What should I do? Part of me wants to just stick it out and finish my degree and then just run off to NYC or LA where I can do something in the creative industries, part of me feels like I should just live out the life that my parents wrote out for me before I was even born, and part of me just feels completely lost, as if looking into my future is the same as peering into an endless pit of emotional destitution. At the end of the day, it seems like I have two real choices: live the life I want and risk disappointing my family, or live the life my family wants and disappoint myself. 

I know this has been a very long read — if anyone has even managed to get all the way through it — and I’m sorry for taking up anyone’s time. I really appreciate any advice that anyone has for me. 

TL;DR — What should I do if I am studying engineering, but it gives me no personal or emotional fulfilment whatsoever?",24Jul2019,2

My boss left her dog with me, an 8 month old shih tsu X, when she didn't want him anymore. He's an absolute delight and we love having him with us. My older GSD (neutered) has been odd with him. They'll play and he'll be fine. But he's been so boistrous since his arrival. My other GSD (a female) absolutely adores him and treats him likes the puppy is her baby.

Last night, my male GSD went for the puppy. I don't think it was with the intent to harm, but he did snap at him none the less. Because he has a chipped too, when he caught the pup it did make him bleed and scare him. The pup ran into the kitchen and was screaming. My female GSD then went to check on him and kept sniffing him like she was checking him over. Unfortunately, my third dog (another shih tsu x) walked in and my female GSD went for her and grabbed her by the neck and made her bleed.

I have absolutely no idea what to do. My female GSD has never gone for my third dog before as the Shih Tsu is head of the pack. We're now considering rehoming the pup and I'm absolutely devastated. Is there anyway we can avoid this? The pup is male and uneutered. Will neutering him solve the problem? I honestly think my female GSD panicked and just wanted to protect the pup but I can't risk my third dog getting hurt again.

371,"For context, I’m a 19 year old female college student, and this summer I’ve been working at a country club as a server. The staff there is almost entirely 18-25 year olds, mostly college students home on break. I really enjoy the job and I get along really well with the rest of the staff - we get together pretty frequently outside of work, usually to drink and chill at someone’s place and swim or whatever. We joke around at work and it’s generally a fun environment. However, the richest families in my state are members of the club and I don’t get any tips. It’s frustrating, especially when my friends serving at restaurants are consistently making more money than me in less time.

To get to the point - I went into work today thinking it would be a normal day, but 10 minutes into my shift my manager told me to come with him. He brought me to a different room where our HR director Kelly was and we all sat down. They proceeded to question me about events that occurred last Saturday (7/20), when I had been working a wedding. Basically, they had gotten reports that I had been drinking on the job and they asked me for an explanation.

I had actually been drinking at the wedding - i maybe had 2 / 3 shots throughout the 8 hour shift, each mixed into a large soda and sipped here and there throughout the night. I don’t really care that it sounds bad - to explain this workplace culture would take too long, The crew feels like a family, but all you really need to know is that about 75% of the staff had a drink at the wedding, and many of my coworkers drink at work on random days.  I don’t need judgement though, just unbiased advice.

Anyways, I denied the allegations - i figured, they don’t have any proof. There aren’t cameras in the club, there aren’t pictures or texts I sent that would expose me (we have a big group message with all the younger employees who are “chill” i guess) - it’s he said she said. So, I denied, denied, denied. I said I would sarcastically joke about drinking at work, such as “Ugh I need a drink too,” or “Maybe I should pour myself one,” etc., but that I was never going to seriously do it. I explained that sarcasm and joking around is my personality, and that someone must have misinterpreted what they heard. More was discussed, but I eventually was told I could go back to work. They then came and found me 10 minutes later and told me that, because they had “multiple reports” that they actually had to suspend me for 3 days and that they will let me know on Friday whether I will be “terminated” or not. 

SOOooo - I may be fired. It seems likely to me, even though there isn’t hard evidence. I just think they won’t want the liability. But, should I wait to see what happens and possibly get fired ??? OR, should I quit before that happens? I need this job for my resume and I would rather not say I was fired from the job. I know that if I quit now I would most likely still be able to use of my managers as references, since we had a good relationship. 

Here’s the last thing I have on my mind - I was genuinely thinking of quitting already because I’ve been fed up with getting no tips. I’ve already applied to a few jobs here and there m. And, honestly, even if my name is cleared I don’t think I will ever feel comfortable working there again - it would be too weird and embarrassing. So I think I would still quit even if I don’t get fired. The only thing is, can you even quit when your being investigated? on such short notice? (2 days?) honestly, SOS this has been making me insanely anxious alllllll day long. Any help would be welcome, thanks ;)",24Jul2019,1
372,"For about the last 6 or so months I have been working as a cam girl. It was tough at first but I found my niche and had been making enough money to pay my half of the rent plus some food. 

My best friend has been working as a stripper this past year and I noticed she had been making a significant amount of money, the most out of all our friends. Just from observation I estimate that she earns (a minimum!) of $5,000 per month. 

So I decided for the last few months to take pole dancing classes. I’ve spent about $350 on classes, as well as $150 on stripper heels, along several hours each week practicing dancing. I also told my boyfriend how excited I am to make a significant amount of money and that hopefully we can move out of our shitty apartment into a more glamorous apartment. 

Well, I got a job at the same club that my best friend works at.  I’ve spent three days there and it’s been absolutely miserable. 

I feel disgusting. And objectified in a manner I hadn’t felt as a cam girl. I feel stupid for not anticipating this. I assume camming feels better as I don’t often see the men and they can’t touch me either. At the club I have to sit and flirt with them as they touch me, and more times than not they will not give me any money for the time I have spent with them. Yes, it’s a job and I am suppose to work for it - but at least with camming I sit in my bed and the men come to me. They can waste my time too, but at least I don’t have to approach anyone. 

I’ve been asked for sex multiple times. The thought of them touching me makes me nauseous. I’ve had multiple lap dances and every time the men will lick my nips and try to get their hands as close to my pussy as possible. They will aggressively grind on me. I felt like a sex doll. Again, I feel like a dumb bimbo for not assuming this is how things would go - it’s a damn strip club for fucks sake. 

But I feel weak. All this time I spent. I have wasted my boyfriends money and talked his ears off about the money. I also wasted my best friends time, asking her a million questions about it. 
I still wonder if I should keep trying and endure the misery and see if it gets better - or weather I am just traumatizing myself. I felt as if I was going to have a panic attack last time I went in. The idea of men having control over me makes me sick. 

I don’t understand why this feels so much different than camming. I’m just being viewed for my body there and shove dildos up my ass - yet when I go to the club the idea of talking to men makes me sick. 

So again.. should I keep trying and feel it out , or not bother hurting myself anymore?

375,"Hello people,

Since 3 years, I have been part of an online magazine which has a fairly good reputation where we work. We have a lot of followers on our social medias and it's not unusual that people know about us when we talk about the association.

When I got in, it was as a writer. With time I became chief editor and quite literally yet unofficially the second man of the association. Forwarding to today, I have a very good knowledge of the health situation of this magazine and it's not good. The permanent team isn't big and can't realize all the work : objectives are high, ressources are low, and the leadership is not efficient in any way. This last part is in my opinion what's taking it apart : we are all volunteering for this and have a life besides. This require the best in terms of organization and processes and stuff. We suck at organization and processes and stuff. He's not the only one to blame, but the ""boss"", with all the positivity he's got, struggles like hell to federate people and give specific roles to people.

The result of this is that each time we try to organize something, it's either never going happen or will develop in a very slowly and rather messy way. The association is now 10 years old and even with all our followers, I am seeing new associations creating events in collaboration with each other, doing so much better than us.

Well, you get it : I am in a non-moving object with huge inertia. Or a store with a very nice display and nothing in the back. Or whatever metaphor you prefer for it.

I have 2 solutions :

\- Choosing to get my sleeves up (again) and focus my energy in the parts of the association and projects I believe in.

\- Leave the association progressively (or not ?) and join a team in another association of the same type to enjoy a good organization. The problem here being that today's colleagues became friends and I care about leaving without losing them as friends.

So when I found out I loved him it was too late and he was already asked out by this other guy. It made me really sad because I've never been so close to a relationship before, heck I've never even been kissed. It made me feel like I missed out on my only opportunity.

I was heartbroken and at first I was sad, then I was ranting and mad, and then I was just in denial and tried to look for ways to be with him anyways hoping some window of opportunity would open up. I went to the movies with this guy, I even leaned my head on his shoulder! I know I'm such an awful person. I just felt so hopeless like there wasn't anyone else.

From there I kept getting more and more clingy and he kept getting more distant towards me. It was never too far I would just be flirty and stuff when I know I shouldn't be. Our friendship was never the same as it was before. And eventually by the end of my Junior Year we weren't friends anymore. He became a person who I just couldn't even look at from embarrassment.

Now I'm just done with my Senior Year, whoop Dee doo still alone though I probably deserve it. I'm not in love with the guy anymore at all but looking back at how immature and selfish I was, I regret it and I would like to at least to apologize to him and even his boyfriend but I don't even know how to reach out to them. They're only a text away but I just don't know what to do.",24Jul2019,1

380,"For about the last 6 or so months I have been working as a cam girl. It was tough at first but I found my niche and had been making enough money to pay my half of the rent plus some food. 

My best friend has been working as a stripper this past year and I noticed she had been making a significant amount of money, the most out of all our friends. Just from observation I estimate that she earns (a minimum!) of $5,000 per month. 

So I decided for the last few months to take pole dancing classes. I’ve spent about $350 on classes, as well as $150 on stripper heels, along several hours each week practicing dancing. I also told my boyfriend how excited I am to make a significant amount of money and that hopefully we can move out of our shitty apartment into a more glamorous apartment. 

Well, I got a job at the same club that my best friend works at.  I’ve spent three days there and it’s been absolutely miserable. 

I feel disgusting. And objectified in a manner I hadn’t felt as a cam girl. I feel stupid for not anticipating this. I assume camming feels better as I don’t often see the men and they can’t touch me either. At the club I have to sit and flirt with them as they touch me, and more times than not they will not give me any money for the time I have spent with them. Yes, it’s a job and I am suppose to work for it - but at least with camming I sit in my bed and the men come to me. They can waste my time too, but at least I don’t have to approach anyone. 

I’ve been asked for sex multiple times. The thought of them touching me makes me nauseous. I’ve had multiple lap dances and every time the men will lick my nips and try to get their hands as close to my pussy as possible. They will aggressively grind on me. I felt like a sex doll. Again, I feel like a dumb bimbo for not assuming this is how things would go - it’s a damn strip club for fucks sake. 

But I feel weak. All this time I spent. I have wasted my boyfriends money and talked his ears off about the money. I also wasted my best friends time, asking her a million questions about it. 
I still wonder if I should keep trying and endure the misery and see if it gets better - or weather I am just traumatizing myself. I felt as if I was going to have a panic attack last time I went in. The idea of men having control over me makes me sick. 

I don’t understand why this feels so much different than camming. I’m just being viewed for my body there and shove dildos up my ass - yet when I go to the club the idea of talking to men makes me sick. 

So again.. should I keep trying and feel it out , or not bother hurting myself anymore? 
Thank you.",24Jul2019,1

390,"Sorry for the wall of text! The story is long and complicated, and takes place over a couple years. Bold is for important details.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, I'm 19F and I'm (happily) engaged to my wonderful boyfriend, who we'll call Mike. Mike and I have been dating for over 2 and a half years now, and have been engaged since 8 months in (but we wanted to wait because of housing, financial, and social reasons). Well, a few months into our relationship, Mike meets this girl who we'll call Jane. He meets her at work because she was a customer at the store he was working at, and Jane asks for Mikes number. He gives it to her. They become friends, and, **without telling me**, they **go and get coffee a few times**. Mike **doesn't tell Jane that he has a girlfriend**. Jane doesn't ask. Mike even let Jane **come to his house** and **I had no idea**. The only reason I found out that Mike and Jane were hanging out was because I casually called him to ask what was up, and he said he was at the mall with her, a girl who I didn't know and had never met. He invited me to join, so I did because I feared that he would cheat on me. Jane was introduced to me as a threat, basically.

&amp;#x200B;

A month later, Mike introduces her to my small group of friends, who were the only friends I had at the time. They instantly love her. **She says upsetting and rude things a lot** (though Jane claims she's only joking), so **I get quite upset at the things she says all the time, every time I see her**. When I got upset about what she said, I expressed it to my friends, and they stood up for her. This led to bottling, and eventually **I had an argument with her** and then **I stopped talking to my friends** **when** **they sided with her in the argument**. I was alone, isolated, friendless, and depressed. I talked to nobody but my boyfriend for **months**.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward about a year. I still don't like Jane. Never have. Mind you, **I'm very sensitive**. I have issues with telling when people are joking, but she literally has no distinction. So, **she says many many things over time that hurt my feelings more and more** but I bite my lip in front of her because Mike has expressed that he wants to stay friends with Jane. He complains that we can't get along, so I try harder. I smile, I try to understand Jane's side of things, and I keep my mouth shut because **I want Mike to be happy**. **She hurts my feelings anyway**. I express my feelings to Mike, **he** **stands up for her**, and my confidence lowers. My self-esteem lowers. This repeats in an ugly cycle and I get more and more false visions that Mike's going to leave me for Jane, even though **I know he wouldn't do that.** 

&amp;#x200B;

So, **I tried to talk it out with Jane**. I decided that being vulnerable with her might be a good idea, because it makes a person more relatable. *Nope*. Jane took what I said and **spit it back at me**, especially when I said I was having confidence issues. She said that she **never did anything wrong** and that **I just had issues**. I got angry and told her she was frequently rude. I'm very upset at this point and want to isolate myself (it's sorta a coping mechanism). So, when Mike messages me saying he's gonna come over that night, I told him I think I just want to be alone. He said ""Don't worry about Jane, babe."" So Jane had told Mike what was happening before I did. He agrees with me and (***without me telling him to***) tells her that they can't be friends anymore because she hurts me so much. *Outrage*. She tells me I'm **controlling**, that **I have Mike on a leash**, that **I'm abusive** and **trying to isolate him from people**. At this point I'm feeling quite useless and suicidal. I get so sick that I sleep for **14 hours straight.**

&amp;#x200B;

Next day (today) I discover that she sent Mike a message with a link to a YouTube video. ""**10 Signs that You're Being Abused**."" He tells me, and I'm very upset, so I ask her to not send things like that. She repeats the 'controlling' and 'abusive' accusations. I asked if she wanted to call me so we could really talk it out. She agrees, and after being nice for a while, I tell her that **I'm just not comfortable with Mike hanging out with a girl I don't really know**, and that **I'd really like to get to know her before letting him hang out with her alone**. She says that's controlling and that I need to ""loosen my leash."" **We agree on him at least telling me that he's with her**, but **I'm upset that she's dictating my relationship with my fiance**. I don't control him, **he gets to make his own decisions**, but **I feel like a healthy boundary should be put into place when it comes to opposite-sex friends**, and I feel like **I should know the girl he's hanging out with** *especially* if she's trying to paint me as an abuser and controlling and manipulative. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is she right? Am I controlling/abusive/manipulative? Do I have Mike on a leash? What should I do in this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;** Fiance hung out with a girl I didn't know a bunch of times without telling me. I met her eventually but never liked her because of it. My friends like her more, so I remove myself from the friend group and am alone for several months. She's rude all the time, but my fiance stands up for her every time she makes me upset. Confidence is lowered. I try to find a solution, she throws it in my face and we get in an argument. She tells me I'm abusive. I ignore it until she tells my fiance the same thing. I ask her to stop, and she's acting 'friendly' now. I tell her that I'm not comfortable with my fiance hanging out with a girl I don't really know. After arguing we settle on him just telling me that he's hanging out with her (I don't have to be there). She is still calling me abusive/controlling/manipulative. Am I? What should I do?

391,"I've started working for a hotel advertised as a ""night porter/cleaner""
The typical night porter does a bit of cleaning on their shift anyway, naturally organising and restocking, maybe a bit of vacuumimg.
I've just started this week and the list of things I have to do is 20% front desk admin and 80% public cleaner. Meaning I start the night doing general night audit tasks for like an hour or two, the rest of the 8 hour shift is vacuumimg all of the hotels public areas, inclusive of three conference rooms, a restaurant, a bar, the lobby and the back staff room. I'm also required ""daily"" to mop all of the 4 bathrooms, 5 elevators, the lobby area, the bar and restaurant area. I'm also required to chemically clean all bathrooms, glass doors, dust and clean all areas stated above and Empty all bins within the hotel. This is a very brief summary of the list, theres more tasks on there and I'm not against physical labour, I'm fine with cleaning, but I get paid the amount of a night auditor, I've done my research and a night cleaner earns more.
I'm usually not a nit picking kinda guy but I feel as though I'm being shafted to do something that wasent exactly advertised, not to mention the head housekeeper would walk in and litteraly do this whole ""wipe her finger across a wall or desk"" then rave the heck out of you if there's a tiny bit of dust on her finger.
I just want to check if anyone else has been in a position where they have a ""dual role"" and get paid the lesser amount? Is that right?
Also if my situation is ""okay"" but Australian fair work standards?
I know it's complaining, but night work is already hard enough, but to know you're getting shafted and being played a bit of a fool makes me feel a bit kinda deceived, I think I may just leave the job and go back to square one because bringing up my greivences would probably just cause more trouble, especially when they could just hire an international student who wouldn't care.",24Jul2019,0

He also said how he doesn't want to stop speaking to me now but he doesn't know how we'll work at university and that he doesn't want to hurt my feelings. 

Is this just his way of saying he doesn't want to talk to me? Or should I just leave things for now if he's uncertain?

396,"Hello, I’m not sure how to start this, so I guess I’ll begin by giving some context. I’m from Southeast Asia, I’m a 19 year old female, and the apartment building in question is one my mom lives in as my parents are separated. I visit my mom two to three times a week.

There are several doormen who work in the building, all of whom take turns with their shifts in a day. There are doormen for the front doors of the building, and in the back, which is the entrance to the parking levels. I see the doorman (who I’ll refer to as DM) about once out of every, say, three visits to my mom. I smile, greet him, and thank him for holding the door open. He returns the smile and greeting, and that’s it. That is the only interaction I have ever had with him. He looks to be within my age range. 

Somehow he found me on Facebook, and requested to be my friend. I have never spoken with him, given him my name, or any other personal information. There is a log book in the apartment building, but I don’t sign it anymore as the employees in the building know me and wave me through. The first and last time I signed it was about 7 years ago, far before DM was ever employed there.

I’m sorry if I sound neurotic, or if I’m making a big deal out of this, but I’m confused and uncomfortable. I denied his request and I was thinking of blocking him, and I never use Facebook anyway, though I do keep it as my school has a group page on it that posts updates on classes and lectures.

I am 13yrs/o, and only child with seperated parents and living with my mother. I have zero contact with my cousins (4 cousins) on my paternal side due to family problems I won't be talking about. On the other hand, I have two cousins on my maternal side but they live overseas.

The two cousins on my maternal side are the point of the story «19M, 21F». Also, keep in mind, that I am their only maternal cousin, and they have A LOT of cousins in their paternal side

Since they live abroad, we never usually contact, however we would have occasional DM's, and liking each other's Facebook posts and photos. But they usually come home every year or two for vacation.

We have an age gap «5 and 7yrs», but when we were children, we were absolutely close. Really close. I just can't explain, but we'd do shitty things and stuff. Fast forward to when I was 7yrs old, and that's when I've noticed things between us were definitely changing A LOT. They were around 12 and 14yrs old here. They would hang out with their ""other cousins"" on their paternal side. And they looked very happy, I was not really close with their paternal cousins but they'd invite me at least once whenever they come visit my country. I never felt socially awkward around because I was a child back then, and didn't care. Same goes for when they visited my country when I was 9yrs old.

When I was around 11yrs old, they visited again. It was for my my female cousin's 18th birthday. Normally I used to be really happy whenever they'd come home and visit us, but around this time, No I did not. I reacted with, ""Oh congrats that they're coming home"". They come home, have the party and stuff. At this point, it was unavoidable for me to notice I was awkward around them. It was really clear. Then comes the barrage of their photos with their other paternal cousins which they hang out with for multiple times, and makes me kind of sad that I was never included because I'm an only child and I wanted to have company, but my mom said it might be because of age difference to which I had agreed to. But i don't know, around that age, it really hurts that you and your blood relatives do not really have a relationship. 

Then here we come. Aged 13 me. They come home and visit again. ""oh ok"" way of thinking hits. I never really wanted to think that about my cousins. But it just really hurts for me that I do not have the validation that I am their cousin and I feel so left out.

 We can't even make a proper conversation without an awkward silence afterwards. At my age right now, I was already thinking that *it's kind of pointless* to continue to have have a relationship with them, because I never feel any validation from them, so I tend to prefer to avoid talking to them and maintain my borders around them «such as finding a way not to sit next to each other, not looking each other in the eye». I know they can feel that I'm drifting away from them. It actually also really hurts for me in my part because I do not have a proper relationship I don't want this to happen but also I don't have a proper relationship with my BLOOD RELATIVES. If that continues, then I will continue drifting and I will go further and further. But, at the same time, I do not want to drift away from them, and I want a way to have a bond before it's too late. 

I feel so left out from all the other people that I have a good relationship with their cousins. I don't want to have a falling out in the future. Sorry its quite long. But please give me advice on what to do here. I do not want to have a falling out with them, and I genuinely don't know if they would even care if we do fall out from each other.

At my age right now, I was already thinking that *it's kind of pointless* to continue to have have a relationship with them, because I never feel any validation from them, so I tend to prefer to avoid talking to them and maintain my borders around them «such as finding a way not to sit next to each other, not looking each other in the eye». I know they can feel that I'm drifting away from them. It actually also really hurts for me in my part because I do not have a proper relationship I don't want this to happen but also I don't have a proper relationship with my BLOOD RELATIVES. If that continues, then I will continue drifting and I will go further and further. But, at the same time, I do not want to drift away from them, and I want a way to have a bond before it's too late. 

I feel so left out from all the other people that I have a good relationship with their cousins. I don't want to have a falling out in the future. Sorry its quite long. But please give me advice on what to do here. I do not want to have a falling out with them, and I genuinely don't know if they would even care if we do fall out from each other. I do not

409,"Hi all, 




I'm on a trip with two good friends. We are in England right now. We flew here from California, where I did not sleep at all on the plane. We landed around 7, and hung out and walked around until we could check into our hostel at 2pm. At that point, I checked my email (I'm a special ed teacher) and see that one of my students died. My favorite student of all time. 






It took a while to process, but then being exhausted from not sleeping 24 hours and hearing the news, I got really really emotional. I was crying really hard and not very consolable. I also drank a lot. My friends are both special ed teachers also. One of them told me to ""deal with it"". One was supportive until a point and then threatened to call the cops on me and refused to let me into our room. 





Now they've just gotten dressed and left for the day without inviting me along. I think they're really mad at me but I feel like I was grieving and exhausted. I'm debating flying back home so I can attend the funeral and be depressed in private. 





What should I do? I feel like I need to apologize but I don't think its fair that I have to apologize for being emotional over the death of my first student. My friends have both lost parents, so maybe they think my grief over a student isn't warranted? They haven't spoken to me all morning. Are the giving me space or are they just super mad at me? Not sure what to do or who to talk to and everyone in California is sleeping.",24Jul2019,1

We're trying an open relationship, but it's not quite going as planned. We're both bisexual so we have a broader range of people to choose from, and so far he's hooked up with one guy and had a sorta kinda date with another. I haven't slept with anyone yet, although I have an old fuck buddy/good friend and we both REALLY wanna hook up again, but we haven't been able to meet up quite yet since I recently moved over an hour away from him. Here comes the problem: my fiancé and I are trying to compromise on expanding our sex life, but every time he sees me messaging another guy, he gets incredibly jealous and upset to the point that he drinks himself into a stupor. I had to remove both of our guns, all sharp objects, and all pills from the house because he was so distraught. He actually told me to take away his gun so he wouldn't have the temptation. I'm totally fine with him sleeping with other girls, but he can't stomach the idea of me sleeping with other guys. We both battle with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, and even though we take medication for it, it doesn't always work. He's been extremely suicidal lately because of the open relationship thing and the problems it's causing, and so far I haven't slept with anyone else because I'm honestly terrified he'll put a bullet in his head. Neither of us have been in a relationship this long and I'm quickly learning that I'm NOT good with monogamy. I've always had a VERY active sex life with countless partners and now I feel tied down to one person. It's like I'm trapped and I hate it. I'm unhappy with the current state of our sex life and have tried very hard for the last 14 months to be faithful but I'm seriously struggling. I don't want to be selfish and do what I want without regard to his feelings because 1) that's not how relationships work and 2) my satisfaction isn't worth him possibly taking his own life. We can't seem to compromise on this and it's starting to tear us apart. I'm really unhappy but he's clearly in excruciating pain. Help?

414," I posted this on /r/legaladvice as well but I need as much advice as I can get. And I know this might sound weird or like a troll but I'm being genuine here and I need advice, thanks.

Hello, I am currently very paranoid about something ongoing in my life that I could use some SERIOUS advice for. I'm a 19 year old male, and when I was 17 I took part online in some really immature and stupid activities that I'm scared will haunt me for the rest of my life. Essentially you could say I'm a ""celebrity"" I became one when I was 17 and got a little too big of a head for myself and decided I was hot shit. So I started using this program known as Discord, which is essentially a giant chatroom with the ability to call for various communities on different subjects. I joined a discord community surrounded around mental health issues and met a horrible group of people there who pretended to be my friends. Essentially there was a 16 year old girl (Or at least she claimed to be) on the server who I really started to fall for, so one thing leads to another and eventually we're both masturbating over our microphones to each other on cam. I start doing this with more and more women of about the exact same age (Keep in mind I was **seventeen**) and with this a lot of nudes of mine surfaced online (Underage nudes technically). Well news got out about my little sexpidition in the Discord community and shortly after everyone in the server knew, including the owner. Now what the owner did I will never forget, she found out a ton of personal info about me and my boss and she EXTORTED ME by saying if I didn't pay 200 dollars to her she would send my boss my nudes along with a fucking disgusting fake story about me being a pedophile. Well she sent it to my boss and my career was slightly halted. I also found out one girl I exchanged nudes with who I MADE SURE I confirmed was 18 (I asked her directly and asked for proof) started trolling me by saying she was 14, which may or may not be true.

So now years later I realize that those girls I did those things with are most likely very mentally unstable and probably wouldn't have an issue with trying to sue me for financial gain OR get me arrested for attention. I'm not just being paranoid here, some of these women try to contact me to this day for various purposes unrelated. What are the chances of this coming back to me legally if I just move on? I live in Oregon I might add which has some really good romeo and Juliet laws. All of the sexual encounters were completely consensual and if taken to court I could prove with the cache along with my date of birth that I was underage at the time.",24Jul2019,0

421,"Hi. I've been with my Girlfriend for nearly 4 years. I have struggled with depression and anxiety in the past but finally got to a good place with the help of medication and counseling before meeting her.

  The past year hasn't been great. She is struggling with her own mental issues and I'm trying my best to be there for her but she makes out it's all my fault that she's like this.

  She has become very insecure and paranoid. For example, if I'm browsing reddit on my phone she will accuse me of talking to other girls, I even show her my phone and she doesn't belive me. I have never cheated or even spoke to other girls so no reason for her to be suspicious.

  I work full time, 5 days a week. If I don't respond to a text instantly she says I'm ignoring her and starts another argument.

  She says I'm ashamed of her because I dont post pictures of us on social media any more. I haven't used social meda for years and am trying to keep off it.

  Everytime I try to show her affaction she says she doesn't like it but then she will complain that I don't show her affection. The whole thing is just messing with my head at the moment.

  These are just a few things and I guess I just needed to vent a bit. I feel like every conversation is just negative all the time and feel like my depression is starting to come back. I don't know what to do because I do love her and am scared if I leave she will get worse :(",24Jul2019,1

424,"So...I met a girl online a few months ago. We got along well and eventually developed feelings for each other - which we've both expressed directly. We would talk (normal calls and video calls) regularly and for long periods of time. 

&amp;#x200B;

She has now gone to summer school (before embarking on a two year masters course, which she had enrolled for before we met). I'm trying to be supportive and I've told her I don't mind waiting for her, so we kept talking. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's now been at the summer school for about 12 days and I'm noticing a difference in her. She's not as attentive, nor does she make as much time for me any more. We still talk, but it doesn't feel the same. I find myself chasing her the vast majority of the time, and although I don't always mind being the one to initiate contact, it's nice to feel wanted and have the girl do it too. She used to do that, but since she flew out, she's cut back a lot. She takes longer to get back to my messages and sometimes, when I don't initiate contact, days will go by without her saying anything. I spoke to her about it when we finally spoke and told her how it doesn't feel nice to be left in the dark like that and that it doesn't take much to send a message. She said, ""You're right. I'm sorry.""

&amp;#x200B;

Before she flew out to summer school, she asked me to come visit her, which I will be doing in a couple of weeks. After she arrived at summer school we spoke about what we could do together whilst I'm there. She said she can't wait for me to arrive, which was nice to hear.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I sent her a message saying good morning and that I was thinking of her. She saw the message and hasn't responded - it's now been several hours. I understand she may be in class etc. but if she has time to see the message, then she has time to respond with a good morning back. That's what I'm thinking anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying not to overreact, I really am, but she has definitely changed since going to summer school. This is a new experience for her, and she' probably really busy taking it all in, so I'm trying to be understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess what I want to know is, does it sound like she's losing/lost interest in me? Should I bring up how I feel when I visit her? If so, what is the best way to be delicate, but direct about it?

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way.

I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

431,"I’m in law. I started a new job in February with an amazing salary. I’m currently on probation and my boss told me that I’m not performing at the level someone at my level should and he wants to lower my grading (ie reduce my salary). 

Even if my salary wasn’t affected, I would not want to stay here. The team is toxic. The work isn’t good quality. And my boss isn’t impressive (senior lawyers need to appeal to clients and he doesn’t, generally). 

For the reasons below, I’m deeply unhappy with what has happened and how it happened, but also with the way the department operates. 

I am currently looking for a new job and it shouldn’t be hard to find but ultimately I need to get through this until then. How?

#Context

1. He should have assessed me properly at the start 

Initially, I accepted this as I was hired with very specific experience. But I had a bit of a realization. Firstly, he was 100% aware of what my experience was when he hired me. Secondly, I wrote up a 28-page document for him in response to a writing exercise he set for me. So he brought me in at the higher level knowing exactly what I could do and where I had no experience. 

After that, he didn’t offer me any feedback until I went and asked him for it. He then told me it was too late to change anything. Basically, either I leave or I accept a lower salary. 

I’m not saying that my work is perfect, especially where I have no experience with what I’m doing, but I haven’t been given any feedback or assistance. Nothing has changed since February but I feel like I should have been offered the lower salary back then, before quitting my old job. So I feel like I was tricked into coming here. 

2. He’s cutting costs wherever he can

He isn’t very busy and isn’t making a lot of money. He’s done a few things to reduce costs and our small team keeps shrinking. He’s making no effort to replace people who have left and he seems to be pushing people who are here out by sending them on secondment and allowing sabbaticals. 

I feel like my _drastic_ salary cut is largely, if not entirely, part of this process. I think this is extremely disingenuous. 

I found out how much work my department gets and it doesn’t compare with our competitors. Before I started, a well-respected senior partner told me that my boss talks a big game but won’t deliver the work. 

When I joined and stated my experience, I was told that I’d get enough work. That kind of work isn’t coming in and I don’t think he’s well-respected in our fraternity. 

I was told that he tried to find a job at another firm but they rejected him and his mediocre practice. 

3. The operation of the department 

The people here aren’t nice people. 

I’m told that my boss likes feeling like an “alpha” which is why he hires women exclusively (bar one non-alpha male). He wants the women to pander to him. They’ve created a cult around my boss, who needs to be bowed down to. Apparently, you must never openly disagree with him, but find a way to sneak in the idea in a way that makes him think it was his idea. It’s pathetic. 

Another woman is known as Dr Evil. She has told us she doesn’t care about us. She is deliberately condescending and rude. She sent an email to her junior, copying me, and completely humiliating her. Other team members have asked me how I put up with it but I just have really high self-esteem. She’s a lot like Umbridge from Harry Potter.",24Jul2019,9
432,"My mom, sister, step father and I recently adopted a young 1 year old German Shepard/ hound mix. At first in his cage he seemed angry but when we took him outside he became playful and friendly. We thought it would be a great chance to help a young dog out and brought him home. We had a rescue before who had unfortunately passed at the ripe old age of 13 so we have past dog experience but we in no way were prepared for this.

He was crazy and playful when we first brought him back- all was well. One day when we took him to PetSmart, he bit my sister in the foot on the way back. We thought nothing of it, thinking that maybe he was overstimulated at the time. The day after he went in for surgery to get neutered and when he got back he targeted and but my sister multiple times. He is an 80+ pound dog and she is only a young teen. She was bitten multiple times on the hand and if it wasn't stopped could have potentially broken or worst case lost it had we not stepped in (my mother who stepped in also got bit pretty bad on the arm). We had realized since the time we got him that he was more responsive to men but seemed to tolerate everyone, but is now directly attacking my sister, including only barking at her when she walks past his cage.

Since the attack about a day ago we've kept him in his cage for most of the time except to let him out and feed him. He was so kind at first but now that we've locked him away he's become vicious to most of all of us, not quite to the attacking level for my stepfather, mom and I but has started growling at us.

We are stuck with him for multiple reasons now. Not only are we stuck with him because he just got neutered but also his previous owners never got him a rabies vaccine (had all of his others). He is now on a ""quarantine"" for 10 days because of the attack and outdated vaccine. Even if we found a shelter we are now legally unable to get rid of him. 

Now we are stuck with a dog who is harming one of us and slowly turning on the rest of us and I feel like we are treating him awful because he is practically confined to his cage now. We called the pound and multiple shelters and most won't accept him because he's aggressive but now we can't either way because he's quarantined. He's constantly whining to be released but tries to attack my sister when let out. We also fear he may be a liability is he manages to bolt out the door and attack someone else. 

We are really at a loss. We really don't want to have to put him down and we never wanted to give him up but we are essentially forced to...

Last night I got talking to him and he told me the older he gets the more attracted he is to men. I'm on the only one he's told and I really want to help him. He doesn't have the Internet or a smartphone. I wondered if there are any sites that let older people (hetero, homo and bi sexual) get to know each other and arrange a date or a day out together. He is so lovely, hard working, well loved by everyone and has given a lot of his time and effort into making our town a nicer place. Now I hope he can find love with the power of the Internet.

434,"So I’ve not long had a baby girl and my partner and I really want to move in together. Currently I’m in a really cramped house, 3 bedrooms with 6 of us living here and a dog, not to mention my mums slight hoarding has cramped the house even further so you can understand why I’d want to get out. It’s also putting a strain on our relationship since I have to move back and fourth to spend time with my partner when he wants to see our baby constantly. The setback is, we’re both young and have 0 home or work experience. There’s places to rent and we could make it if we both got jobs but I’m worried we’ll set ourselves back.

437,"So...I met a girl online a few months ago. We got along well and eventually developed feelings for each other - which we've both expressed directly. We would talk (normal calls and video calls) regularly and for long periods of time. 

&amp;#x200B;

She has now gone to summer school (before embarking on a two year masters course, which she had enrolled for before we met). I'm trying to be supportive and I've told her I don't mind waiting for her, so we kept talking. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's now been at the summer school for about 12 days and I'm noticing a difference in her. She's not as attentive, nor does she make as much time for me any more. We still talk, but it doesn't feel the same. I find myself chasing her the vast majority of the time, and although I don't always mind being the one to initiate contact, it's nice to feel wanted and have the girl do it too. She used to do that, but since she flew out, she's cut back a lot. She takes longer to get back to my messages and sometimes, when I don't initiate contact, days will go by without her saying anything. I spoke to her about it when we finally spoke and told her how it doesn't feel nice to be left in the dark like that and that it doesn't take much to send a message. She said, ""You're right. I'm sorry.""

&amp;#x200B;

Before she flew out to summer school, she asked me to come visit her, which I will be doing in a couple of weeks. After she arrived at summer school we spoke about what we could do together whilst I'm there. She said she can't wait for me to arrive, which was nice to hear.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I sent her a message saying good morning and that I was thinking of her. She saw the message and hasn't responded - it's now been several hours. I understand she may be in class etc. but if she has time to see the message, then she has time to respond with a good morning back. That's what I'm thinking anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying not to overreact, I really am, but she has definitely changed since going to summer school. This is a new experience for her, and she' probably really busy taking it all in, so I'm trying to be understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess what I want to know is, does it sound like she's losing/lost interest in me? Should I bring up how I feel when I visit her? If so, what is the best way to be delicate, but direct about it?

438,"I'm a long time lurker on Reddit, so pardon my low karma. I'm also on mobile and English is not my native language, so please forgive me for any error in general.

My older brother is 31, and he is a total menace. He has no regards for others and always has to have things his way. He is overweight and throws a tantrum like a 10-year-old whenever he doesn't get anything he wants, and that is at least twice a week. He dropped out of school in 9th grade, so he doesn't even have a high school diploma to do any type of work; not that he wants to work, because he's just living off our parents. The only type of ""work"" that he does is being a drummer, and he is not very good at it either; he only takes some wedding gig now and then, and the pay is worth maybe a meal. Nevertheless, he is addicted to slot machines, and burns everything that he earns into those. He is also a kleptomaniac, but only steals from our parents and relatives, also for gambling. 

I feel like he has some kind of mental illness, but can't pinpoint it to anything, nor do I want to make any assumption. For context, we live in Vietnam, so our parents had been very hesitant about bringing him to a hospital, since my dad is a respected ophthalmologist and they don't want his reputation to be affected. Also, they said they did bring him once when he was little and started to show irregular behaviors, but the doctor didn't say it was anything. I think it's because he was so little that they didn't know what to make of it. Now, he is 31 and still exhibits those behaviors, so there is definitely something wrong with him.

The reason I started posting this now is because his behaviors has been the same for the last 20 years, and recently I feel it has reached our limits. The last straw was the latest vacation that our family took, in which he had been very consistently childish and throws a tantrum just because he didn't get to have ice cream as early as possible. And it has been the same for every vacation that we have. 

I talked to my mom and she agreed to take him to the hospital again, which is the biggest one for mental patients you could find in the country. The problem is to find a way to convince him to oblige, since he doesn't believe there is anything wrong with him. So, how do I convince him, or if it comes to it, trick him into going to the hospital to check on his mental status as soon as possible?",24Jul2019,1

440,"Hello kind people of Reddit. 

As the title says, I will start working soon and I am looking for a place to stay. The town where I will work is a fairly small one with not much to offer. This town is neighboured by two bigger cities.  The way I see it, there are two options.

1. Look for a place in the small town. It'll be close to work and I won't need to commute as much. However, I won't have as many social opportunities and if I felt like having a night out in the bigger cities, I wouldn't have a place to stay. Basically, I'd be living exclusively in this town with some occasional day-trip somewhere else.
2. Rent a place in either of the neighbouring cities. These are 8 and 17 minutes away from the town I'll be working in. Nothing too tragic, I think, but I am afraid it could get on my nerves as times goes by. On the other hand, I will have plenty more things to do when not at work.

Personally, I'd be inclined towards the second option, but I've never had to commute in my life, let alone for work, so I am not sure how that would work out. Do you have any advice?",24Jul2019,1

Then the next day I emailed  her again and asked her could I get a bus pass for the first week of work as I worked a week in hand and apologised again also about my misunderstanding and she replied ‘that’s fine graham, don’t worry, if you want to come in to office ‪before 5pm today‬ I can sort this out for you’. Later that day I  went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she’d of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass, so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (but sounded annoyed) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised and said 'did he?' And then she said 'just we have to contact them to confirm your employment' Then I said 'Its ok I understand' and she went quiet as she written the paper form out for me then just asked when I’m next in (my new job) I said tonight and she said ‘tonight?’ (Idk if she was passing conversation or asking about travel expenses).  A moment later she passed me the form and I stood up to go and said thanks, then she leaned forward slightly sitting down with her hand out and said 'awwwwwwwwwww, awwwww (more like rrrrrrrr) (it was prolonged than what I typed like an gap filler tongue tied I think) and said a few things then I said ok and slowly walked away (out of nervousness) she then said 'let me know if you need anything else' I just said ok and slowly walked away and then she said ' oh..and I'll stay in contact to see how your getting on, I'll contact you by email if that makes things easier for you' and smiled (I mainly Contacted her by email) (she said it all upbeat and bubbly) I said 'oh ok thanks, great' (I'm really shy)she said 'awww ok' then she turned back around sitting on her chair and said 'oh and...(I turned back around again) well done' and smiled and then turned back to her computer. she said well done a lot since I got that job",24Jul2019,0

He’s insulting my looks more than ever, he’s constantly lying about where he’s at or what he’s doing, I feel trapped.
 
He basically posts on Reddit saying he’s depressed and deep down hates me as a person. He says he wishes he never met me, etc. I don’t actually know if he knows I read it but I assume that would only mean he’s speaking the truth. 

Anyways. I met another man locally a bit ago, the kindest man. A gentleman all around, tells me the sweetest things, always reaches out to me/checks up on me, and is generally showing a lot of interest romantically. He’s basically everything I’m missing in my ex of six years. And what do I do?

473,"First post, TLDR at the bottom.

I was up for a raise at work so we had a semi annual review meeting with my direct boss (let’s call her Gina) and her boss (let’s call him Jim). Meeting starts off great, lots of compliments on my work ethic, productivity and my performance the first half of the year.

Then things get weird. Jim made a comment suggesting my productivity had to do with how “smart” I dressed that way. When I asked him to elaborate, he said I was being defensive. So I told him I wasn’t necessarily disagreeing with him, but I just wanted to know what he specifically meant so I can make some changes if necessary. I told him I wear the same “uniform” everyday: slacks, a blouse and heels with the occasional flat shoes. He went on a tangent about how I was being defensive and then makes a comment along the lines of “maybe it has something to do with how your father raised you.” At that point I put my hand up and asked “are we bringing my father into this conversation?” He doesn’t know that my father didn’t raise me. Not sure where that came from though.. 

Jim backed out of that conversation, probably realizing I was upset and went back to my appearance. Saying there are days I look “better,” maybe some days where I “don’t stand close enough to the razor in the shower,” and that I should buy new clothes. 

He also said he wanted to rip my earphone out of my ear anytime he sees me with it because he doesn’t understand how I could be productive while listening to music. (I only ever have 1 bud in and I’m sitting with a bunch of sales people who talk loud and are on phones all day, it tunes them out). Anyway, he never answered my question to elaborate and instead went on a tangent about our different “realities” ???!

Conversation ended with me actually getting the raise I wanted, which honestly confused me more after what had just been discussed.

Gina was there throughout this and didn’t say anything. When I asked her about it after, she said they had discussed what they were going to talk about in the meeting and those things weren’t on the list. She said she also felt uncomfortable and at one point thought I was going to get up and quit.

Our office is small (less than 15 people) so I’m now finding myself comparing to the other women in the office. Some women wear T-shirt’s and sneakers, which I never do. My clothes are always ironed/clean/neat and my hair always neat. I’m not sure what to do, I’m just super upset about it. Should I confront him again and ask him to elaborate?



TLDR: Boss commented on my clothes, the fact that maybe I don’t shave my legs everyday, that I’m being defensive and the way my father raised me. Should I confront him and ask him to elaborate?",24Jul2019,1

477,"I (M,24) am studying computer science. To the end of your study you can do an internship 20 weeks, so you have some work experience when you graduate. So did i. I started in April and have three weeks left. During the internship i wrote about a project i did. This piece will count like an exam at the University. The grade for that will be decided by a prefessor and my boss. When i signed my contract here my boss told me he wants me to do that project and then i could use that project as a foundation for my thesis. The thesis would require me to renew my contract. 

Fast forward a bit. Im not really liking the work here and think it would be better for me to write my thesis in a different company and about a different topic. I think i want to work on something different in the future. 

I have made that decision for me like to weeks ago but im under the impression that my boss just assumed i will stay here. Since he is the type of guy who gets amd when things to go as he planned i was afraid of talking to him. Especially with him having a big influence on the grade i will get for my work here. So i always thought ""tomorow you will go and talk to him"". The usual stuff people tell themselves when they want to avoid doing stuff. He was talking about a potential topic for my thesis a few times, but i missed those opportunitys to tell him im not sure about my future. 

Today my boss came in my office and was like ""Oh btw your new contract will be ready tommorow"" .

So he did assume im continuing my work here. 

I know that i should have talked to him earlier and avoided this situation. But maybe you can give my advice how to handle this situation the best?

Thanks and i hope my english is good enough",24Jul2019,1

It’d be mostly a music channel, so I tried putting my name in it somehow. But it just doesn’t sound good. 

So, maybe I should just ditch my own name, and come up with something else! 

My mind wandered to the first name I used on world of warcraft:

“Rohmsury”.

I liked it because it reminded me of the word rosemary.. but it’s kind of random, and doesn’t really mean anything. It might not be eye-catching enough, either.

Maybe just “Rosemary”.

482,"I've struggled with severe depression and social anxiety all through my teens and spent these past years isolated sitting at a computer, pretty much living as a hermit. I've had a handful of acquaintances through high school who I would try to make small talk with during class, but I haven't had anyone I would call a friend since I was maybe 10. 

Now I've just 19 and am feeling better, but I feel like I missed a huge part of my development. I have no idea how to communicate with anyone, especially with my peers. While everyone my age is preparing for their future and figuring their lives out, I feel like a 14-15 year old wanting to be rebellious and learn to date and do stupid teenage stuff. Everyone around me is already over that phase, and I feel like I missed my opportunity to make the mistakes needed to be able to function in the world.",24Jul2019,1
483,"So growing up we had no money. I remember dreading going back to school because everyone would be wearing their coolest clothes for the first couple weeks, have new supplies, etc. All while I’m wearing things that weren’t cool or new a year ago.

Now that I’m a mom, I see the flip side. Knowing the first day of school is looming and being sad and anxious that I can’t afford anything new for my child. 

My daughter is only 3. I’m just a waitress, but if I budget properly, I’ll be able to afford to get one kid enough stuff for back to school that it makes a difference. 

How do I go about finding out who i can help? I’m 30, so none of my friends have kids in high school/middle school and we don’t have siblings in school either. Because school isn’t in, I don’t know if I could contact the principal. 

Do you think this is something I should do? Having reservations because 1) I can’t offer an unlimited shopping spree. There will need to be a budget. I can buy some jeans and some shirts and maybe splurge on some cool shoes. Backpack and supplies, and that’s it. 2) am I teaching a kid to be materialistic? 

I know that material possessions and name brand clothes are not important in the grand scheme of things but when you’re that age, going without what everyone else has is tough and that’s if you’re not also dealing with a bad home life on top of it. Sometimes just wearing an “American Eagle” shirt would make me feel like I was normal for a day. If nothing else, I hope it teaches a kid that one person can make a difference. 

I just really think we need to stop debating and fighting politics and realize we have the opportunity to make our world better if we slowed down and asked a neighbor how you could help them. 

That is all.",24Jul2019,27
484,"So a few months ago,I made a post about me leaving/separated from West Point, the United States Military Academy. While I have come to terms with it, my parents aren’t exactly fond of it. In fact they aren’t supportive of it at all. Right now my dad is dealing with family issues that have been around for a year since my grandfathers passing and my mother was diagnosed with cancer and is in need of surgery. When I told them I was leaving, they became extremely hostile and began berating me for wasting my life and that I had squandered everything like the prodigal son. My mother told me that I’ve been taken off of the life insurance and that they are lawyering up against me for all that I’ve cost them. Right now my plan is to go to community college for a semester then head over to either Rutgers, Boston College, Syracuse or Howard University. Right now I’m afraid to go back home and I don’t have anywhere else to go. I’m afraid of the hostile environment there and having my siblings in the crossfire. I’ve been battling bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts for a year which I’ve kept quite from them due to them not being as open minded and accepting on such topics, considering people who commit suicide as weak.

488,"So I have this memory in my head of being at the swimming pool with my uncle when I was really young and being in one of the changing cubicles with him (no he didn’t molest me) and I noticed that he had an erection. Of course at this age I didn’t really understand what it was, so I asked him why it was like that. I can’t remember if he responded or not. Nothing more than that happened, but I don’t understand the whole situation.  My uncle has always been a really kind and lovely man who’s never done anything sexual to me, he had a family with two healthy sons who are now fully grown and happy and healthy. So there’s no reason to believe he might have done something to them. Other than this weird out of place memory of my uncle, I have nothing but happy memories of my time spent with my uncle and that side of the family. The memory itself is really foggy, and maybe my brain has changed it over time. I’m not sure what to think, any advice? I can’t tell my family about it, because if it turns out to not be true I could really destroy my trust with that side of the family and cause hurt.

489,"So I love my job. I work in an office full of intelligent, kind, professional people and I love everything about being here. Now to the issue-

The office area is small, with 1 ladies’ room and 1 men’s room (1 toilet each, no stall, just small room). I am a female and generally go to the ladies’ room. But sometimes it’s occupied and I will go in the men’s room instead. I few weeks ago, when the ladies’ room was occupied I went into the men’s room. I looked to my side and there is a wall full of dried booger’s staring back at me. It bothered me so much I came in early the next day before anyone came in to clean the wall. 

At first I thought maybe it was an old intern or someone who doesn’t work here anymore. But now, I see there are additional boogers on the wall!!! After I cleaned it! 

My father in law says I have no standing because it’s the men’s room and I shouldn’t be in there anyway. But it’s disgusting! It makes me question which one of these men I work with is the culprit! And if it bothers anyone else besides me (a female)! 

Part of me wants to sneak in and put a passive aggressive post-it on the wall. Do I do that? Do I do anything? Or do I just chalk it up to the male race being generally nasty af?",24Jul2019,1
490,"Honestly it’s just a shame that I can’t do anything right at this point, and I feel it’s too late to do anything anymore. I’m currently 16, with one sibling, a 13 year old sister. Earlier in my life, when I was still a little brat who I can’t stand thinking about anymore, instead of welcoming my only sibling and accepting the loving embrace of a person who only wanted my attention and love, I hurt and ignored this person who I was kin to, my only sibling to ever exist and I shut her out and hurt her. I don’t know why my little shit self thought it was a good idea to push her into a thornbush, ram my bike into her, not talk to her, talk to my friends instead of her, nearly drown her, and probably so much more that I can’t even remember, and didn’t think at once in my little shit brain, “maybe I shouldn’t abuse the only fucking sister I have, and maybe show her some love that she’s been looking for her entire life, from the big brother that she’s supposed to look up to and take inspiration from.” I was her brother, I was the person who she was to supposed to go to for support, I was supposed to be her mentor, I was supposed to set an example, and instead of being an actual reasonable human being, I abused the person who loved me. My only sibling in her only childhood, and I decide to abuse her. Recently I’ve been trying to reconnect, try to actually be a fucking brother to a person who I constantly shut out for my entire life, but I believe it’s too late. She shuts me out, and hates my guts. It makes me sick what I was like, makes me want to just go back and slap some sense into my little shit self, and tell myself to actually be a brother, to be a person she can look up to, and not one that she has to loathe. It’s horrible. I just want to be a brother, but now that we’re both older, I think it’s too late. I’ve tried everything, and I love the times when we can actually talk and be siblings, but eventually I have to fuck it up again and say or do something that just makes everything worse again. I don’t understand why I can’t do anything right to just connect and bond with my only sibling. I know it’s all my fault too. I know that when I did that, that’s how she ended up like this now, because she watched me do it for all those years. I just don’t know how to talk to her. I fuck up every conversation I have with her at one point, and she shuts me out because I did the same. It’s my fault for this, and I don’t think I can make things right. My worst fear is that later in life, she’s still going to feel this way about me, and I won’t have the chance to talk to the person I should know the best. It’s torturous, but I guess this is just karma catching up to me, making me feel like she did for all those years, while I just kept on being a little shit to everything and everybody. How would I even go about fixing it? Every time we’re together for a long period of time, we have a few days where we talk like normal, and then suddenly something happens and we get in a fight, and it just gets worse. How would I even talk to her anymore after that? How can I try to reconnect with my only sibling?",24Jul2019,1
491,"TL;DR at bottom.

So I currently work as an artsit for an architectural visualisation firm, I've been here since 2015 and generally the job is pretty good, very small team, extremely leniant and easy going, great atmosphere at times, other times it can be quite intense but generally I'm quite happy. I've felt for a while that I am not really going anywhere at my current job, I've been told I will have a £2000 raise in January 2020 but aside from that there is no real room for growth. I've been offered a position at a more established company, bigger team around me to absorb knowlege from and develop as an artist - I feel that's what my current job lacks. Some days I don't really have motivation to lift a finger because it's that easy going, the director sits browsing Amazon all day - really inspiring confidence and motivation. I do work on some pretty big projects but when they come in it's a case of late nights and weekend work.   


The new job is a £4000 raise on my current, it does however involve a 50 minute commute whereas my current office is a 10 minute cycle from my home, I would be no better off financially after petrol costs and an increase in student finance repayments. Where I believe I will be better off is in my personal development, growing as an artist and learning new skills from the team around me. Also there will be no weekend work and no overtime. My decision is whether to risk it and give up a reasonably paid, easy going job for the potential of bettering myself.

At the end of my freshman year, I had made relatively a lot (I was a loner before freshman year) of friends, most of whom I went out with at summer.

At the start of this year, my sophomore year, I was at my peak. I had 3 different groups I hung out with: (1) an otaku clique,  (2) a group of people with different interests, and (3) a group for online video games.

I left my second group after knowing them for 3 years and started hanging out with the otaku clique because I thought I would feel more welcome with them, and because my close friend hung out with them.

Not soon after, my third group disbanded because of an argument and the otakus haven’t been talking to me at all, to the point where I feel ignored. I don’t sit at the second group’s lunch table anymore because I’d feel weird going back after leaving so suddenly, plus they have inside jokes that I’m not a part of and I feel like they’re happier without me.

Hopefully somebody gives me some advice, despite it being very common for teens.",24Jul2019,0

497,"DISCLAIMER: This actually happened a few months ago but now I think its safe to share.

So I (M28) and my wife (F26) have been together for 5 years but only recently wed. We just moved in to our new apartment and are getting ready to have kids and all that. Recently I noticed she has been staying at work for suspiciously long times so I got a gps tracker and put it under her car to see if she really stays.  
  
TURNS OUT that shes been going to a hotel every friday. So I did a stakeout the next week to see if she was going inside. She was and I covertly followed her up to the floor she was on. I found out the room she went to then went back to my car. I called up the hotel asking them for the name of who bought the room claiming I was a police officer and that it was an emergancy.  
  
Lets say his name was Greg. Well I searched him up on FB and he was friends with my wife on there. I saw in his pictures that he had a tattoo on his arm and later that day I had clearly reconized the SAME EXACT ONE on a surviellence video from my towns police FB page. It was a video of a robbery where he came in and handed the cashier a note, took the money and left. I took a screenshot of it and sent it to my friend who works at a tattoo shop cus I reconized that it might be his style. He said that it was his work because the client came in with a custom request. BINGO!  
  
I then asked for his clients name but he was hesitant. He said that he couldnt just give out confidential information like that but I eventually got it out of him.
  
So I called up my phone company to get the call logs from my wifes phone and narrowed down his number. I sent him a text saying that he was gonna be fucked cus I had called the police and knew what he did.  
  
He asked ""who is this?""  
I said i'm ""xxx and im ruining your life because you ruined mine. Get ready for a rude awakening.""

He goes to jail for booking but next week notice that my wife is going to the hotel. 

At this point i've had it and as soon as my wife gets home I start going through her purse and throwing all her shit out...  
  
 booyah 
    
Found her burner phone, went on it and aparantly the greg she was seeing was a completely different person. I saw the texts and immediatly started bawling my eyes out. She told me she was sorry and all that. I told her that I would forgive her (I really wouldnt) if she let me go talk to the guy next friday.  
  
Fast forward next friday I walked in the hotel and asked for a key to room xxx. The hotel front desk lady asked what buissness I had and I told her I was the undercover officer who called last week and was doinf an investigation. I got the key and proceeded to walk up to the hotel room. I waited for about 3 hours but no one came. Then I went home and all my shit was gone. The police come to my apartment because apparantly the hotel manager took the surveilence footage and brought it to the police asking why an officer was going through his hotel. I was charged with ""impersonating a police officer"" and sent for booking. 
  
I get to my cell and guess who's in there with me? Thats right its the same greg from the robbery. And when they brought me there he heard my name being called.

Safe to say I got the living shit beat outta me, lost my wife, all my stuff and my job because I was in jail for so long.  But hey at least I got this story so I've got that going for me.

498,"My partner went to a yearly conference last week. I don’t know any of these people. 

My partner, a co-worker and this “guy” from
another company are in a cab on the way back from an event (drinking for sure) and guy starts telling a story about a woman he slept with at the same conference last year. 

Guy says on the way home from a similar event, this woman was all over him in the cab, and ended up giving him a hand job. They get back to the hotel, up to her room, guy went to the bathroom and when he came out she was passed out on the bed. So he left. Guy says the next morning she was acting weird and told him to stay away from her, never talk to her again, etc. She either told guy or someone else (not sure..) that she blacked out and woke up with “pain.”

Now, that whole story sounds shady as hell to me. Guy is saying he came out the bathroom, saw she was passed out, just looked at her and left? You wouldn’t have tried to wake her or see if she’s ok?? I don’t buy it. Whats more, said co-worker was ALSO in the cab with them last year (guy must have forgot), and said there is no way she gave him a hand job. None of it adds up.

So weeks go by and things are fine with us, we speak everyday and hang out a lot but one day she was being a but funny on a night out so I asked her if she was ok and we spoke. At the end of the conversation I asked if we would be best friends or I was mistaken. She said we would just be friends or good friends. I was taken back a bit and was like ""wait I thought you said we would be best friends."" She said ""I don't remember what I said and she was sorry for saying that if she did and she just wants to be friends.

What makes it harder is that we were best friends and we opened up a lot about mental health from my part and from her about her past and we both helped each other. And when we started to argue I just wanted to fix it be best friends and continue to help each other. And me going through shit I would like to have someone I can turn to. She helped a lot but it's hard to open up if she's being weird with me.

Now this is just happened.

So am I in the wrong?",24Jul2019,2

Wrong. 3 months pass and my mom's in the hospital for liver and kidney failure, another month later we put her in hospice, she's dying, and she's pumped full of morphine killing her faster because her kidneys can't operate, and I'm such a scared kid for being 15 and being 5'10 and 300 pounds, I've since been going to the gym so my weights not really gonna be a problem just so ya know, butim freaking the fuck out, I decide, she's a normal human being right? She will understand the gravity of the situation, and how much I need someone to talk to, so I text her maybe 5/6 times over a four day period, she called the cops on me, and I got a telephone harrasment charge, it's been 7 months since then, my ex has a new boyfriend, he goes to summer school with me, and I am still madly in love with this girl, it's been over a year since I've even seen her in person, and I don't know what to do, I want to wait till she's 18, she turns 18 in 2022 on August 12th, I dream about her daily, and I miss her so much, what should I do?",24Jul2019,3

I think that experience made me more wary with guys but I want to be in a relationship.

513,"Hey all. I’m kinda in a rough spot and could do with some advice. 

I’m an IT major at a state university, going into my second year. My first semester was the best time of my life, loved living with my roommate and away from home, loved the environment, loved learning about all the shit they gave me. The only class o did somewhat poorly in what the class they had me take on C++, which was a required course for my major. I passed with a 69.5 rounded to a 70. I almost didn’t pass, but I figured that’s ok, I’ll start ‘getting it’ next semester. 

I was wrong. Next semester was infinitely harder than the first one. Long story short, all 3 of my required courses I ended up failing. I finished my first year with a 2.25 GPA. I think I’m on academic probation and lost a scholarship. I figured no big deal, I’ll just take a summer class or two, raise my GPA, and try again. That takes us to now. 

Wrong again. I was not prepared for 2 4 week summer classes. I work full time and between work and my classes, I’ve been really depressed. I’m failing my summer courses right now. I don’t want to improve or try harder, I’ve given up, I haven’t done any schoolwork in 3 days. I feel like utter shit and all anyone is telling me is “oh you should just try harder.” Well I’m trying, and it isn’t working. 

Anyway, that leads us to the actual substance of the post. I hate what I do, and I’m no good at it. I can’t code worth a shit, and I’m not interested in anything else. I don’t want to drop out because I love school, but I don’t know what else to do. Any advice would be great.",24Jul2019,21

 Recently I noticed she made a change from just posting pictures of her pet cats to more sexy-ish stuff I guess? It like more photo of her in make-up and showing her boobs and butt. This all started around the same time she took a mysterious trip to California?

I thought it was a litle odd and recently she linked to a cam models pornhub video trying to promote her ""friends"" new video. And while I haven't seen anything about her I'm starting to get suspicious?

Let me say upfront that I don't have anything against porn actresses/sex workers i just thought it was odd that my friend was getting into it. I don't think I'd really try and stop her from doing it I was just nosy and curious.

519,"&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying I'm going to commit suicide today or tomorrow, but the thoughts are very overwhelming now.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in an abusive household where calling police will only make things worse, and if things escalate too much I can move into my grandparents' place, but again, not without it's consequences.

&amp;#x200B;

Those issues I could live with, but what I can't live with is finding no joy in life. Today I got the news that I failed my first year at university, having chosen subjects that I didn't really like. But even if I persued subjects I liked in the next year, I feel that I am mentally and physically not able to cope with the workload needed to get through university. That means my past year has essentially been wasted, and that I'm gonna have to go through another year of uncertainty, where I don't know if I'm doing alright or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Living in an abusive household my whole life has messed me up bad. It's created a deep sadness and dissatisfaction in me that I carry everywhere I go. I feel like I can't relate to anyone, and the few friends I've made have either left me or I left them because my issues of needyness and dissatisfaction keep cropping up. I've been to multiple councillors/therapists. I've payed 50 euro for a few sessions (and 50 euros every week is a lot for someone like me) which didn't really help. I've been on two anti-depressants which did not help. Therapists/councillors/people have told me they suspect a whole range of mental illnesses in me, consisting of: depression, anxiety, OCD, APD and ASD.

&amp;#x200B;

If I want consistent therapy and/or medication I have to pay for it and it will probably milk my bank account dry. If I want to make friends I have to sacrifice study time and mental energy. If I want to really figure out what to do in life I have to meet new people, make friends, and get into social activities. It's just an endless circle of problems.",24Jul2019,1

I don't know what the outcome of the session might be. I don't know if it would cost money. I have entered the number 3 times but can't bring myself to click that bloody dial button.

523,"So this has been bothering me for a while.

Earlier this week, my friend and I were standing in line at my university's cafeteria when someone cut us. It seemed like this person knew the two people in front of us, because he started talking to them as soon as he cut us. My friend was a bit sad because the line was moving extremely slowly, so I tapped on the shoulder of the person who cut and told him to please not cut, as everyone in line had been waiting a long time. He started yelling at me about how he had also been waiting a long time for food from other stations and to mind my own business. One of the people he was talking to also told me that they were actually saving him a spot in line so he wasn't actually cutting.

So my question is: should I have just kept my mouth shut? Was what I said wrong?

524,"this is incredibly puzzling and I don't get it and neither do people I've asked irl

I (27f) have a cat. we go to a brilliant kind-hearted veterinarian (mid-40m).

vet is incredible. i've went to him with my previous cat (who since passed). the amount of free care or incredibly reduced prices he gives me is staggering and were all his making, i've repeatedly asked to pay him more and he refused. i've given him plenty of gifts since (including a coffee machine). he's a truly good person who does that for other people, too. collects kittens from the street each winter and nurses them back to life.

he doesn't have communication problems in person - creates eye-contact, is articulate. 

he is available on his phone 24/7. 

my current cat is old and has many health issues so i text my vet a lot. he never initiates first contact with me.

however.

there'd been several instances where, in the middle of the conversation (me asking him about some medical stuff), he just sends me a picture-dump of some wounded animal he'd taken care of. extremely graphic (a kitten with a bone sticking out of his mangled leg - and then a pic of the leg that was later stitched. a few days ago it was a cat paw with a gaping hole, in five pics, of its slow recovery). and there's no context. so i ask what's that. he answers, very briefly. i tell him he's great. (he is) 

the conversation ends there, every time. 

i know he's not interested in me because i've already tried asking him out for coffee last year and he rebuffed me (very respectfully), saying he can't because he's overworked for months to come. it was never brought up again (no means no and all that). i'm pretty sure he's not married (no ring) and i never hear, even in passing, on any kind of significant other. 

what gives. i'm already over the crush i've had on him, but i just don't get this behavior and it bothers the heck out of me. 

i'd really appreciate any insights you have on why he does that.

thanks in advance!",24Jul2019,1
525,"A week after ending his 4 year relationship, he went on this online dating app for hookups. There he met me (I was living 2000 miles away) and we started texting all day every day. He did not initiate meeting up as much as I did but I assumed that is because I'm way more open than him and he's really shy. When I offered to meet up, he was super happy and nervous. Later he told me that it was a bit soon (3 months) but that he still wants to see me. I did not take this the wrong way because he was the one showing me all the attention and efforts in texting. So we met, slept together and I gave him hints how I don't want to share him from that point on, but I guess we weren't yet official because I was scared to ask him that openly. 2 months later (when we were official), he flew to my country 5 times in a row and I saw that he was in love.

Fast forward 8 months, we live in the same city and he told me how he slept with other women before we met and how he almost slept with another one few days after I came to meet but they did not even get to kiss, he just wanted to get it off his chest because even that intention gives him guilt now. He said how after that long relationship he did not plan on having anyone, especially long distance, and was unsure about the whole thing with me but eventually fell in love. He is going above and beyond to make me forgive him, is seeking therapy to deal with his ''insecurities'', and is hoping for a chance in the future. I forgot to add that we are broken up. Is this worthy of another chance? I really love him but I am very confused.",24Jul2019,0

527,"So last year one of my closest friends (M17) decided to text me(F17) his feelings for me, but I didn't take him seriously, because he'd constantly joke around like that, like for example he ''jokingly"" asked me out on a date twice and ofc both times I rejected him. So me, thinking he's just joking again, I send him the ""Friends"" song by Marshmello &amp; Anne Marie lol thinking it's no big deal... Except he responds with ""omg how could you?? You're so mean and disrespectful! I don't wanna be friends with you anymore and if you tell anyone of our friends about this, then I'll tell your crush that you like him and then beat him up!!"". And at this point I was very confused, so I kinda spammed him asking if this is for real, but he didn't reply, until the next day when he texted me ""it's OK I'm not gonna tell him, I'm not stupid"", then again he stops responding. The weekend comes and we're out hanging out with our group of friends who don't suspect anything, and I'm trying to act as if nothing happened, but the dude acts like I'm not there, he avoided talking to me and looking at me, and our friends obviously noticed that, so when I wasn't around they'd ask him what happened and he'd tell them that I'm just really annoying him and he doesn't want me around and that they should stop asking me to hang out, which confused our friends a lot, so then they asked me what happened and I told them that it's between the two of us and they should just let it go, but then they kept asking him what happened and he got angry at me saying that now everyone will find out, because they keep asking him, because of what I said........... And so several nights like that, we hang out, he's super suspicious of me, thinking I've told them, when we all get home, he texts me stuff like ""omg you told them I know it you totally did you'll see I'll tell ur crush"" and at this point I got tired of his bs, so I really did went and told our friends, and they said that they really don't care that he got rejected and he should stop acting like that, but they also said that they'd keep quiet about knowing this, because of his threat to tell my crush I like him. So months go by and he decides to stop hanging out with us, because we're ""losers"". But one of out friends wanted us to be friends again and he pushed me into texting that guy again asking to be friends AGAIN. So yeah we texted, he made it clear he doesn't want to be friends at all and I apologized and said I'd leave him alone, so we hadn't texted since.... Until.... One night, one of my friends calls me to hang out and well I go... And to my surprise, our ""nice"" guy's there as well. But he's acting normal and he's even talking to me and laughing at some of the jokes I make, so I think to myself ""maybe he's over the drama and we can be friends again"", but not even a full week has gone by and he's again texting me stuff like ""omg stop acting so friendly with me! I told you I don't wanna be your friend, don't get used to hanging out with me!!"". And now I don't know what to do with this guy, at first he was complaining to our friends that I'm annoying, then he told them that it pisses him off that I'm acting as if he's ""homeless"" (he texted that to one of my friends and he also said that I'm probably ignoring him, because I know that if I open my mouth he'd beat me up), then he's acting like nothing happened and now he's telling me to stop acting friendly..

my mum is in a relationship with my stepdad and they argue a fair bit but every argument i've heard, was instigated by my mum about something irrelevant, like, 'my stepdad got the wrong spices for curry tonight so now my mum can't each lunch or sit down for the rest of the day because she needs to sort out the spices' or 'my sister doesn't want to eat right now so now my mum's having a breakdown and calls us all selfish brats'. 

i get some things are frustrating for her but she will start a fight and when my stepdad argues back, she cries and plays victim (my stepdad has some sort of thing where he's clumsy, it's on the autism spectrum i think, but he dropped a mug and it broke and my mum called the police because i was in the same room as him when he dropped it and she came up to my room crying about how his behaviour is not normal). 

i love my mum to bits but when i hear her crying i just roll my eyes because i think it's about something stupid. there are times when she is genuinely upset and obviously i get that but she cries so much about stuff that no one cares about. 

with the curry spice story, she moped around the house for 2 hours complaining about how she will need to get pasta from the shop because she can't make curry with the spices stepdad got but she made it anyway and it was better then her recipe (stepdad's a chef). she still complained about how it probably tasted bad and made passive-aggressive comments about it all night.

529,"So about a week ago, my wife decided to try and do her own nails at home while I was working. This effectively turned our small apartment into a noxious, heinous-smelling nail salon. Upon my return from work I entered through the door and immediately proceeded to have to leave because the smell (similar to paint-thinner) was simply overwhelming... Gave me a massive headache. My wife (cutely) said ""Oh I'm used to this, I've always gone to nail salons growing up.""   


So, I demanded that we open all the windows and doors to air the place out and did so for a few hours. In addition we burned some candles after I suspected most of the (possibly flammable or reactive) fumes had left the place.   


Problem is, it's almost a week later and while the smell is \*pretty much\* gone, every time I enter the apartment there is still a slightly nauseating/irritating smell of toxic and bitter smell from her failed nail experiment.

536,"I'll give you a bit of a backstory, last year a lot of shit happened, I got kicked out of the house, lost my job, became depressed and lost my friends all within the same month, one of my former friends (who was the leader of my ex friendship group, let's call him ""H"") started being an asshole to me around this time because he wanted to hang out everyday and I kept dismissing him because I wanted to talk with my girlfriend over Skype after work (she lives in a different country) and hang out with him maybe twice a week at most, he eventually turned funny with me and started saying really hurtful stuff while also unfriending me on Facebook, after that I became pretty paranoid of him, he and another friend (let's call him ""K"") of the group were making more of an effort to try and get me to hang out with them and H started being nice over text but I was in a fearful and paranoid state of mind, so I ignored him for months and he ended up blocking me, he is the type of person who holds a grudge forever, can't take any kind of criticism without getting angry, never takes ""no"" for an answer and everything has to go his way, he was the only real one I had a problem with in that group because K would just always listen to him, H was also at the center of the group which meant if he hated me, there would be problems in the group.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now and I haven't had any friends for around 18 months, I really want to get back in touch with a different friend from that group (let's call him ""V""), me and V always got on great and H doesn't like V anyway so that's great, the only problem is is that K is the best friend of H and K is also good friends with V, H dislikes V but he can tolerate him, but if I become V's friend again I'm worried I will have to encounter H at some point and possibly get into a heated argument or worse, a fight.  


I should also mention that V is best friends with a former friend of mine (let's call him ""C"") from a completely different friendship group, me and C get on okay and C has actually messaged me asking to meet up, so it's a good opportunity for me to be friends with both V and C together, but C is close friends with a bunch of guys who I really don't like and don't have good history with, these guys don't presumably hate me like H does but they are bad news and I want to stay away from them.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, in order to be friends with V again, I have to be friends with C (who I don't mind, but he is a close friend of the bad guys) and there's a good chance of having to be friends with K too. (who I like but he is best friends with H)

&amp;#x200B;

Is it worth trying to be friends with V again? He is at the center of everything and I don't want anything to do with H or the bad guys again, I should also mention that while I don't mind C, he has had a history of being a shit stirrer and he will want me to hang around with the bad guys because I used to be friends with the bad guys before while V never had anything to do with them, is there a way I can just hang around with V and C without having to see the bad guys? I know that while V and the bad guys are both close with C, they hardly if ever see each other, they are a totally separate group but because of my previous friendship with the bad guys, C and the bad guys will want me to hang around with them. I like K too but he is way too close to H for me to want anything to do with him. There's no point explaining to K that I don't want to be friends with H because he is his best friend and will always try to involve him in stuff.

  
Thank you for reading and I appreciate your answers, I just don't want to be involved with H or the bad guys again because I know no good will come of it, plus I don't want any confrontation.",24Jul2019,1

I have a medium story to share through which I wish to get advice by providing insight. I am 23M, I had very close friends during my teen years which was toxic and as it turned out towards the end of it, they constantly lied and took advantage of my good side, during this friendship the only criticism directed was done in an overly manner, making fun, teasing and holding it against me and them in this case. Nowadays, I find myself in a position where every time I make a new acquaintance or try to make friends, I feel the like I have not showed them enough of my bad side. With new friends, I only treat them with the respect I wish to receive thus limiting the boarder through which they interact with me, with ones I wish to become closer friends I desire to be the one who crosses the respect line first so they are not the ones to take advantage of my side. I may be sounding hypocritical to some I know, but bad experiences which molded my perception (which I genuinely wish to change lead me here). I know there is white and black in life, but isn't that what life is about? creating a world YOU wish to live in? I end up feeling their awkwardness when they to the point of the relationship where THEY usually go making fun or insulting someone and I wish I took initiative at an earlier phase. Don't get me wrong, insults of friends go a long way of offering cold spoons of truth which help one's self in working on themselves.

542,"So here's a bit of backstory so you know what I'm dealing with and I'll try to make it as readable as possible:  
&amp;nbsp;  

I've been struggling with anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder for years.The combination of the three has made life very, very difficult at times. For reference, I used to be so bad I could barely leave my couch (the only place that felt clean/safe), much less my house. I've made a lot of progress since then but every once in a while something happens and I regress to some extent. I've lost multiple jobs as a result and have been told by my doctor that I would qualify for disability. I refuse to go down that path though.  
&amp;nbsp;  

That said, I work in a dog grooming salon as a dog bather right now. I love my job most days although some things are a literal nightmare for me, such as getting peed on, as they set off my OCD and I pretty much mentally collapse. Still though, I've managed to keep this job for longer than any other job in my adult life (9 months so far) and my manager says I'm her best bather.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Recently, said manager asked me if I want to become an actual groomer. Our company has a grooming academy and she wants to send me. It would take a month of training at the academy then I'd be back, working at my home store, contractually locked in for two years.  
&amp;nbsp;  

At this point I should mention that prior to the offer, I had been looking for other work as the bathing doesn't pay enough or give me enough hours. I can actually do it (most days) but it's nothing to build a life with. This very well may be what I need but it's a huge step up in responsibility and potentially stress (which is usually what negatively impacts my mental state).  
&amp;nbsp;  

Let's be honest. I'm terrified here. I have tons of negative thoughts floating around in my head and I don't know what to do. I'm scared I'll fail out of academy. I'm scared I'll hate grooming. I'm scared they'll cut my hours, as they did to one (admittedly bad) groomer, and it won't be enough. Most of all, I'm scared my mental health will regress too much due to increased stress and I'll have to quit (which would saddle me with a $5,000 bill).  
&amp;nbsp;  

Do you folks have any advice? It's been on my mind for days and I'm not much closer to an answer for her than I was when she offered me the promotion in the first place.",24Jul2019,3

545,"A few days ago I made a post about reporting my neighbors to the apartment office because on multiple occasions we’ve smelled weed coming from their apartment (one occasion the smell came into our apartment) and their garbage gets left in the stairwell. Not sure if this has anything to do with my complaint, but last night, 3 high school aged girls slept in the stairwell by their door with nothing but one throw blanket to share between them. I didn’t see them out there last night, only this morning, and I offered breakfast and a bathroom and they declined. I told them if they needed anything to knock on my door.

I’m making a big assumption that maybe the parent living there kicked the girls out for the night for smoking weed (we smelled it again last night but didn’t report it). Not sure though, and I don’t know about any child abuse going on either. Should I mind my own business and let this scenario play out? Or get involved (not me but police or some other authority)? I don’t want to be a snitch (again) but now I’m just concerned.",24Jul2019,5
546,"As I'm trying to keep it vague (I'm still looking into my career choices), I classify 'designer' as someone who deals with producing designs for commercial use. Eg; Interior design, Graphic design, Architect, Product Design etc

Some context:
-I'm a poly student, about to graduate and will most probably work for a few years before pursuing my degree/masters
-I am an introvert and have mild social anxiety. I get a mini panic attack when it comes to communicating with people, especially people who I know I'm gonna interact with often (hell, just posting this makes me nervous)

Being an introvert and having mild social anxiety has been a problem that I've been dealing with since I'm a child. Despite this, I've been able to make a number of friends in school as I have had the time to build up my relationships with them. However, as I'm nearing my 'working life', I'm afraid that my introvercy and social anxiety may cause me to loose out on and even completely miss key opportunities that may come my way.

In some ways I already see this happening. Whenever I change my class or finish a project, I always find myself left out in collaborative works and social gatherings. And I get that it's completely my fault for not actively seeking these out but I have no idea where to start and just thinking of reaching out to people I don't know that well freaks me out.

Now, with what little experience I have through internships and from looking up the web (and also some really small side gigs I've done for my friends), I've come to realise that socialising and networking is really important as a designer, whether it be looking for a job or reaching out to more clients. This really scares me. I consider myself relatively well skilled when it comes to designing, however as mentioned above, I'm trash when it comes to any form of socialising. During my internship, I've seen many talented people doing small (albeit important) work even though they can be doing so much more, and they have told me of their dreams of starting their own business or working more meaningful jobs etc but then delaying these dreams indefinitely due to the stability their current job gives them. And I don't mean to say that there's anything wrong with that, but I'm afraid that I'll end up settling for a more stable but boring job because finding the job that I really want to do is too difficult a dream for me to achieve. 

If you guys have any advice on how I can deal with my introvercy/social anxiety or have any tips on how I can not miss out on crucial opportunities and seek out jobs that I want to do I would really appreciate it! This thought has been looming in my mind for a while now and I would like to at least relieve it a little.


TLDR; I'm about to start working in the design industry and I'm afraid that being an introvert with mild social anxiety will greatly affect my chances at getting the job I want.",24Jul2019,4
548,"So this might appear like I'm trying to show off, but I just want you to see how weird everything is :

I'm a 20 year old guy and I technically got everything going for me. I'm one of those child prodigies that you see on tv. I always won every tournament in school, not just the intellectual things, also the sport things. I skipped classes. I got paid private lessons by the government, because my intelligence was so promising. I was also the famous kid throughout my entire school career that everybody liked. On top of that I won the genetic lottery when it comes to my face. I'm 20, but not too long ago I approached a \~ 30 year old good looking woman on the street and she blushed when I talked to her, which is just one of many examples. I already dated several girls, some of which were models. And my character (even though you will probably see me as extremely arrogant right now) is also fine. I usually don't show off like that and I usually don't care about all of these things and I'm a rather calm person who tries to help other people. Not because I want to appear nice, I know that I also have really shitty traits.

So intelligence, looks, personality. I technically got it all. But I feel like complete shit. My most negative trait is probably my height of 5'8 and I usually blame my height for my issues, but I know that my height is not the problem. Because my issues started long before I even cared about my height.

I just don't know what it is. I already had this as a kid. Did anybody of you ever experience a really deep insecurity, that didn't care about reality at all ? I just don't know what to do. I feel I will never fix this annoying shit.",24Jul2019,1
549,"I just went back talking to my ex, I was feeling heartbroken and sad without her, because she was really the only one who listened to my feelings. I stopped the relationship because I got too angry, I kept running away from my feelings when I was with her, because she degraded all my feelings even though she actually listened to them, so about 2 months ago I got out of the relationship, she was my first love, and I really do love her. But since I stopped the relationship, I never ran away from my feelings, I started to understand them and actually had peace. Until 5 days ago where I contacted her again. I instantly realised that I got distant from myself for her, because she’s closed and very complicated. Until now, where I kept asking her if she even cared for me - because I really didn’t feel so. So I began shaking, my teeth started clapping, and I got an anxiety attack - just like I used to in the relationship. This girl, she’s so worth it, I love her so much, but at the same time, I have to forget myself in the relationship, I have to run away from my feelings. So I stopped the contact with her again because she was accusing me of all sorts of things. I’m highly sensitive so the relationship overshadows all of my feelings. I get easily overstimulated.

559,"\~2 weeks ago the air conditioner in my dormitory in my university started leaking. It leaked when I **turned on my air conditioner** for 15\~30 minutes and when it leaked, I am there to move my laptop away and turn the air con off. The leak lasts for a short while, around 15 minutes max. After that, I requested maintenance to service my air con and they did service it last week. This Monday, I turned on my air conditioner and I turned it on for a total of \~ 2 hours. Because the air conditioner was recently serviced and it did not leak while I turned on the air con, I assumed that it will not leak. But, I was wrong when I came back from class to find out that the air con **leaked few hours after it was turned off** and it leaked on half of laptop ( My table is directly below the air con and I almost always leave my laptop on my table. I have been doing this for 1 year without any problems until now). I immediately asked for help and got the laptop battery removed ( While trying to remove the battery the laptop fan was moving and we suspected that for whatever reason the accidentally turned on the laptop for a short while). There was water that reached inside and the water that was visible was wiped off. I kept my laptop under an electric fan for \~24 hrs and fortunately it could turn on. But now, the thing I am afraid of is that there might be any potential water damage done that could shorten the life span of my laptop. I have sent 2 emails to the maintenance team, 1 on Monday when I found out what happened to my laptop, 1 on Tuesday after I was able to switched on my laptop to ask for compensation for any damage done that could potentially shorten the life span of my laptop (after letting someone check if there is any damage). Until now, the maintenance team ignored those emails and I am not surprised for it. I am just wondering whether or not if I were to go to maintenance team this Friday to tell them this, will they pay for the damage done? I took photo but they were not that clear because I took it after I cleaned most of the water off from my laptop, there were just water droplets that are visible.

560,"20M. I had a crush on one of the girl i knew for 3 years. I never told her anything. 1 year ago she moved to USA permanently. I didn't know about it. Fast forward, she knows i had a crush on her. She told me that maybe she would also have given it a shot if she told me early.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is i am getting too creepy. I text her everyday and check to see her last seen. I am getting too desperate and all. She is not coming back for atleast a year or two. We had a decent conversation with continuous flirting and then i ruined it. I just became too needy and desperate. And after that she didn't even seemed much interested. She just answers if i ask her something and then the conversation is over until i text her again. A simple example:

&amp;#x200B;

M: How are you? 

S: Fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then the conversation is over until i text back. So i unfriended her 2 days ago and she suddenly out of the blue messaged me sending me a video and telling me how funny it is. I mean it was so weird she never did that before. I mean she comes to talk once every 2-3 months then she just rants about if something bad is happening then we keep talking for few days and in some way i ruin it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i am in dilemma. At one hand i want to move on because our conversation just gets too awkward and it seems i am the only one putting all the effort. On the other hand i have this weird crush on her. It just feels like i don't want to move on.  There is also another thing that the girl is rich. And i am like from the middle class background.

563,"Hi guys, (I’m hoping I’ve posted this in the right place, sorry if not)

So today I (32f) went into a popular clothing store and immediately felt eyes burning into the back of my head. I turn round and see a young sales assistant standing in the next isle peeping through the clothes and just watching me. I was with my mum and my 3 small children, 2 of which were in a double buggy. We were shopping for a school bag for my eldest who will start school in September. I am mixed race and so are my children. I couldn’t quite believe it at first so I went round into the next isle and she just sort of stood there like a deer in headlights and started fumbling with the clothes rack. I didn’t say anything to her because I just felt humiliated and instead put back my things and started to walk out. On the way out I see another young girl just standing a few isles away watching me leave. Not in a subtle way but just stood there watching me as I walked by. I’m not the confrontational type so I just walked out.

This has happened to me a few times in this store but I never actually address the issue with staff members or management I just walk away. I’m also not sure whether they are being instructed to do this by management or if they’re being trained to, but either way it’s not acceptable.  I know they discriminate because of the colour of my skin because every other person in the store was white and some had children in pushchairs but they were not followed or watched by several members of staff. 

There have been times when I’d go home and cry about it because I just feel so embarrassed and humiliated that someone would just look at me and my children and think to themselves “yeah they look like the type that would steal from us”. I’ve never stolen a thing in my life. So today I filed a complaint with the companies head office and asked them to review the cctv footage to prove my point. Im not sure what else I can do to stop this from happening again? 

Overall, I’m just getting sick of being stereotyped because of the colour of my skin and it’s really getting me down. I’m aware that the easiest option is to just not shop there anymore but this isn’t the only chain of stores that I’ve experienced this with. There are several. I get anxiety just going out in public sometimes but knowing I’m being watched and followed makes me feel a million times worse.

569,"So I am currently working as an intern in this large corporation, it's my second week there. Currently there is hardly any work to be done, but hopefully it will pick up later on. However I have difficulty connecting with my coworkers, here's why (imo):

* It is my very first internship/job, I am currently a student. 

Before the internship itself, I expected the atmosphere and overall interactions between colleagues to be really formal. However, everyone are like friends in my department and it really threw me off, I have already mentioned that to my coworkers and I still can't tell whether they understand what I mean.

* There are no other interns.

That makes me feel a bit lonely. I consider all of the 5 colleagues in my department to be my superiors. As far as I am concerned, it's really hard for me to engage with them as I would engage with a fellow student or an intern (if there was one). 

* Every single one of my colleagues is from a different generation. 

I am 21. My colleagues are over 30, one's 40. It's super hard to find common interests, plus I haven't yet grasped the work specifics fully to engage in conversations about work...

---
Overall it's been a great experience and my colleagues genuinely put in effort to try and connect with me. But I feel like I was really reserved in the first couple of days (due to reasons above plus lack of a proper sleep schedule), so now I can't even tell if they like me anymore... I mean, we wen't on a few lunches together, but now I don't even get invited to joing them, so I am going to lunch with fellow students that are doing internships or working around the area.

Honestly I've never had problems socializing, but this is just such a new experience that must've thrown me off track.

When we left ,we hold hands under my umbrella ,till we got to the bus station and when her bus arrived ,she gived me a long hug and left,telling me im an amazing guy and we well meet again for sure.

For me ,she was the girl of my dreams, but then...I texted her after i got home, if she got home safely, she responded me in the morning and we texted a little, like 2-3 messages.

After this i asked her a question (on  Tuesday ) ,she didnt respond, then i send her a tumbleweed gif on  Thursday ,bcs she didnt respond till then and i didnt want to be pushy.Still no response.

After that on Sunday i texted her asking if i did anything wrong or something like that.

Still no response...

On the next Tuesday  she finally responded ,telling me ,she had phone problems for 2 days and was out of town, and she told me she have some things to take care of and we meet on bad time,and she told me im an amazing guy and had a great time with me ,and to take care..

I asked her if she,at least, wanted to be friends bcs i wouldnt like to lose a person like this. And she avoided to respond that and wished me all the best.

So,guys, what\`s your advice ? Should i just try forget about her? Im not a snowflake , dont get me wrong, but for the first time in a long time , i felt like i have a heart, im thinking about her way too often,even tho i might have lost her.

Im looking forward for your comments friends, im rly lost and i dont have anyone to advice me.

Thank you!",24Jul2019,8
571,"Hi, I'm a second year university students... I've been 'hanging out' with this group for the past 9months ish... Quotation because it keeps feeling like I'm forcing myself to be friends with them. It started out me being friends with this one guy because the other three (theyre a group of 4) doesnt understand memes and internet jokes, so he kinda end up talking with me a lot...

Anyway skip over, i just realised now that i dont feel good whenever i hang out with them... They never include me in their convo, so its more of me just sitting together or close with them. At first it felt good to hang out with them (i didnt have any friends during my first year) but now it just gets... Tiring. The guy who talked with me most was able to be comfortable enough with me that he talks to me about his worries and stuff, but whenever i try to talk about my worries i dont feel listened... When the four of them walk together, i was always the one who got pushed to the back. They would invite each other to go to starbucks right in front of me and not invite me. They dont give a shit about my birthday but cares and already plans about what they would get for each other's birthday. They think that I'm too serious in my study but they always ask me for stuff or for help...

I was so upset and sad and just... Feel heartbroken that they dont care about my birthday... https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/c8ov7m/i_turned_20_and_im_upset_that_i_had_to_celebrate/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

My last straw is that the guy who I'm closest with said that its hard for them to be friends with me because I'm too serious and the way i joke is too aggressive (like how i like to hug the girls (im a girl too) and how i sometimes joke ""I'll kill you lol"" and how the way i talk is a bit like the guy's)
But like...
I joke like that because I'm comfortable with you guys...
I dont joke like that with everyone. I joke with them because i think of them as my friends...

Originally the group was the 4 of them, and i kinda slide into the group (or maybe they actually hates me but cant do anything about me) because im close with one of the guys.
Should i keep trying to be friends with them? At this point i dont feel good hanging out with them. I dont feel wanted or needed or listened but idk if this is real or if this is just my anxiety acting up.
I talked with the guy I'm closest with and he said that i should still try to be friends, but I'm trying so hard already...

tldr: i dont feel good hanging out with these people anymore, should i keep trying to be friends with them or just be by myself until i graduate?",24Jul2019,1
573,"So I have a manager who, despite my multiple efforts of telling him otherwise, schedules me during hours that I shouldn't be working. I work part-time in a retail store. Our policy is that once we're hired, we submit availability sheets to whichever manager writes our schedule. 

Pretty much if you cannot work at a certain time or day, you shouldn't be scheduled then. I've spoken to him multiple times about not scheduling me outside of my availability. It got so out of hand (working too many hours, scheduled on days that I am noted as 'unavailable,') that I even went as far as to schedule a small meeting with him to tell him about my health and physical condition, which is not in the position to work the hours he tries to make me. What I told him was extremely private to me and I don't recall telling anyone about it in recent memory. 

At this point I've had it with him, and I'm not exactly sure where to take it. I told him something extremely private and personal in hopes he'd sympathize with me, like a normal human. And our company actually did away with HR, and made all HR functions user interactive. So yeah, I feel a bit stuck, other than quitting. But I really need the money. 

Any advice is appreciated.",24Jul2019,10
575,"On March 28 (read: almost 4 months ago), an artist I follow made a post saying they were having money problems and offering commissions. I have commissioned this person twice before, in 2015 for a fairly minor portrait and in 2017 for a pretty elaborate project. Both times, I had a great experience with them and received art that I cherish. With that in mind, I moved some things around in my fairly tight budget and decided to reach out to the artist right away with a new commission, as they requested. 

The portrait I requested is of an OC of mine that the artist has already drawn from the 2017 project. I heard back from them pretty much right away, and they said they’d love to do it. They were very positive about my idea and emphasized how much they had enjoyed our 2017 project. Right away, I put together a bunch of reference photos for them on Drive and shared the link to that folder.  Then I paid in full ($145) on that same day (March 28) since I knew they needed the money, planning to tip them once I received the portrait. On their commission request form, there is a spot for a deadline that suggests a birthday or holiday that the work would need to be received by; I said, “No specific deadline as this is not a gift!”

When I commissioned them for the big project in 2017, I received the first sketch just over a month later and had all six complete artworks within 2 months. 

This time around, in 2019, six weeks passed and I hadn’t heard from them at all. I sent a very friendly email on May 8 asking for an update or if they needed anything more from me, and they didn’t respond. 

On May 28, two full months after our initial exchange, I emailed them again letting them know that I would really like to know that the work was still on their radar. They responded saying they had been really busy (they recently launched a webcomic they had kickstarted last year) but that they were hoping to dedicate a full week or two to commissions. They said if they didn’t finish by the first week of June, they would give me a second portrait for free. 

On June 30, I had heard nothing from them again. This time, I sent a more curt email requesting an update on the piece we had discussed and saying that I did not need a second portrait, thinking maybe that the idea that they’d have to do two was keeping them from working on the one I already paid for.

It’s now July 24, and I still haven’t heard from them. Our last exchange was on May 28.

Here’s the problem, other than the obvious: I feel super bad for this person. They are always posting about their personal trials like their chronic illness flaring up, their mom kicking them out, having to move apartments on very short notice, etc. I know they’re trying to make it as a professional artist, which is obviously a tough life. Most recently, they posted on July 4 that they had to put their pet to sleep, and then on July 20 that they were going to have to sell their guitar for groceries. 

The thing is, I’m a teacher, so while I have not been in dire financial straits for a while, I don’t exactly have a ton of disposable income. Also, it’s not like they’re a teenager; we’re both in our late twenties.  Finally, although I didn’t request a specific deadline, I think four months to wait for a piece for which I already paid in full is pretty excessive. For Pete’s sake, the D&amp;D campaign this character is from is almost over now!

So my question is this: Where do I go from here? I seriously doubt that they still have my $145 to refund me, and frankly, I do still want the portrait. What do you think?

Tl;dr: Sad-sack online artist ghosts me for four months, what do?",24Jul2019,1
576,"Title pretty much sums it up. I feel stuck. I’ve applied to jobs for years and nothing has come through. Recently I had two interviews for a big job that an income of double what I’m making now. Got denied the first one and can’t even get a response on the other. I’m 26 (27 in August) and barely make enough to pay for rent. I have 9 years in cnc machining and it’s gotten me no where. I just don’t know what to do. I’ve been considering liquidating everything I have and buying a one way ticket to the other side of the country, seriously. 

I wanted to join the peace corps to do something totally unselfish and different then anything I’ve done before, but due to not being bi-lingual and only having experience in machining was told it was not gonna work out.

At this point I can’t even figure out what I want to do. My whole life I wanted to be a comedian or an actor but it’s too late me I don’t have enough resources to fully commit to anything except trying to survive.

577,"So this happened last night but I guess you could say it's a reoccurring issue. For the past month and a half, I have not been interested in having sex with my boyfriend (bf of 1.5 years), something we used to do like 3 times a week. I have always strongly struggled with addressing and properly handling my emotions and I do not like intimacy with others so even dating was a big deal for me. It's a character flaw that I've been aware and struggling with for my whole life and it deeply bothers me. 

Now my boyfriend is bothered by the fact that we don't connect anymore like we used to. He is frustrated because this is something that he wants for the rest of his life and expects this from a healthy relationship. 

I tried to tell him that I'm not sure if I'll feel like this forever but I'm not going to promise him anything. 

He then went on to tell me how much it hurts because it's like I don't love him and he misses it. That he feels like there is no solution - yet he doesn't want to break up. 

Then I spent the night sobbing because now I'm feeling guilty for something that has deeply bothered me before I met him and now I'm hurting him because of my own flaw. Once he realized I was crying he held me. His words weren't very comforting but at least he showed that he cared still. He told me that he wants to support me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then this morning he was in a sour mood and after I asked if everything was okay he just said, ""Obviously talking makes things worse"" and then refused to continue. I started my morning already feeling extra sensitive about what happened last night because I can't remember the last time I had been that deeply affected. All I really wanted was for him to ask me how I was doing- he's never seen me that upset before. Instead, he sloppily made the bed and drove himself to work after I offered to drop him off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I feel emotionally numb because I really can't handle these kinds of things. I drove myself to work and half the time I forgot I was driving. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any insight on this? I'm afraid I'm not giving him the benefit of the doubt and really listening to him but I understood that the impression is that sexual preferences were something that you just had to innately respect and work on. Please, any help would be great - I'm terrified that my character flaw has caused such an issue and I don't want him to think that I don't love him.",24Jul2019,1
578,"So obviously I don’t really want to intervene but I might have to if anything happens again / gets worse.

The problem is this guy is also my friend, he treats me like his younger brother when I see him and I’d never think he has it in him to do any of his stuff.  But of course the physical evidence of the bruising on my friends neck shows otherwise.

579,"Long story short: Started a new job with a small law firm (4 attorneys) in January as an associate attorney. I'm getting married at the end of September. I was planning to invite everyone at work but I've noticed in the last 2-3 months that everyone has been either really distant or outright cold. For example, the receptionist will talk about her life outside of work everyday to everyone except me, in fact she barely says hello to me at all. I can tell all the other attorneys are friends, but none of them make an effort to include me on work or outside of work stuff. I generally come to work and have no interaction with anyone for the entire day, other than a rare passing hello.

581,"I'm not really sure how to start/explain/finish this rant cause it's just a mess. Here we go though. 

A little info to start, I have been with this seasonal  establishment for 3 and a half years now and with people quitting mid season/ not coming back for the new season I found myself in a managing  position. I explained to the owners at the start of the third year(last year) that I didn't want that position so they brought in a new person last year  will call them Bob and they are okay anyway off topic now.

The issue being is we got a new ""co-worker"" this year who is proving to be a problem they are slow at the job, instigate Bob and has left us hanging multiple times last night being the third time. 

So anyway Bob and coworker had an exchange of words about a month ago and they don't like each other Bob is getting scolded? By the boss for something of the sort last night and co-worker is being lazy again.

We are half an hour before we close and co-worker manage to pile a shitload of work to do in the last hour and a half, then has the audacity to ask me for there food that we were cooking for them at the end of the night this is free food by the way, they didn't pay for it.

I take a second to think and look at the big ass mess they made over the 3 and a half hour shift they worked and I have to put my foot down and say no if you want your food you have to do your job, says they will and asks for the food again.

It was already cooked so I'm pretty sure they wanted to eat right then and there I say no again they proceed to come into the kitchen take off there ""uniform"" put a smoke in there mouth and leave.

I don't like doing stuff like that which is why I didn't want to be in a managing position just doing that alone made my body shake. I also really don't want to work with this person now but given the issue they were having with Bob I feel like they will be back anyway even though they just straight up walked out on the job.

There is  more info to be added here but that will make the post very long the info being what Bob and coworker fought about and some other factors being the instigating and one more point",24Jul2019,1

586,"(Apologies for my English, it's not my first language)

I (F/25) am an INFP and I've been working in the corporate world for 5 years. I have no degree except a high school diploma. I have started at 18yo as a data entry clerk and worked my way up to a coordinator. I am now working for a national public railway transportation company catering to passengers (I make 50K a year).

To summarize my financial situation, I think I can allow myself for a little time out.  My mom passed away last October right before my grandmother last December. I have been lucky enough to inherit for a large sum of money.

I have invested 80K in a rental property which will bring me 2600$ per month once paid off in 25 years. My passive income at the moment after paying off mortgage, insurances, municipal taxes is approx 500$ per month from that rental property. I still have 10K left in my bank account, and will inherit of 40K in September and another 15K in December. 

I am wondering if I should continue working in the corporate world. I know that my salary + inheritance will help me qualifying for a 2nd loan and that leaving my job will make it harder for me to make a 2nd investment. If I change path, I will most likely experience a drop in my salary, I will probably end up making 35-40K... 

I have enough to survive for months, even years...  Part of me wants to invest the rest of the money but deep down I know I need a break.

I have had quite a hard life (not that I am a special snowflake and I'm sure many of you had a hard life too). I never got the chance to stop and breath and had too many mental breakdowns.

I have always been late for my jobs, approx 10-30 minutes late every day, for 5 years, because I am struggling to get out of bed due to lack of sleep and motivation. I have been warned by employers but they always kept me because I gave my whole heart into everything I did. 

Right now it feels different. I don't give a shit about my job. I've been here for 5 months and made no friends. No one is eating lunch with me. No one ever asked me how was my weekend. I just wake up, go to work, stay at my desk in silence and stare at my computer, almost paralyzed, because I can't focused. I hate this job so much I am barely able to work.

3 weeks ago I have told my boss that I was going to quit but gave them a notice of a month and a half. The plan is am I leaving the company toward the end of August.

I don't know how I'm gonna make it up until then. I have been missing work once a week for the past month. Mentally I just can't take it anymore. I feel alienated and soul-less. I am completely drained and don't have an ounce of energy to put into my work. My boss is really sad and a bit upset to see me go. She wanted to find some solutions so I could stay, and I appreciated it. I agreed at first but changed my mind a few days later. I realized that nothing will help making me feel like I am part of something, unless I quit and start working in a job that is more human-oriented. She asked HR if I could stay part-time but they refused.

I am 25 and had enough of the rat race. I feel enslaved to the corporate world. I feel like I am living my life only to be working. I can't relax on weekend because all I think about is the fact that I need to wake up on Monday to go to work. On Friday I too tired of my week to do anything. Saturday is the only day of the week I feel like I am actually living. I have insomnia at night due to the stress of having to work the next day and put on my corporate smile.

I have became bitter. I can't stand the passive-agressivness of communications in the corporate world. I feel lost. I am also an empath. I feel what other people feel, very very strongly. 

There are many jobs I'd like to pursue but they feel a bit unrealistic. I'd like to open a shelter for homeless people, work with people in need, help new arrivants with immigration procedures or help them find works and smooth their adaptation. I'd like to open a no-kill cat shelter. I'd like to be a social worker. I'd like to give back to the society, through meaningful connections. I'd also like to pursue my passion which is drawing portraits.

I don't know if I am being too idealistic. I just know that I can't go on like this forever. Do you have any advice for me? Does salary and title matter or should I content myself for a low paid job that will fulfill me?",24Jul2019,1

She didn't give me a chance. This is the email I sent regarding the place she put me at. I looked them up, and I do not like what I saw. We get 2 internships. I didn't choose my first one, but I wanna be able to choose my second one, and a couple of my friends feel the exact same way. I told her that I was thinking about Med Express (I'm a Medical Assistant student), but she told me that ""My PCP is there, and he's wonderful, and I've had interns there that loved the place and some were even hired there"". It's like my concerns were pushed aside because of what she thought. She also belives this is a self concious thing, and kept saying ""You'll be fine! You did great at your last internship. You'll be just fine!"" The only reason I did so ""great"" at my last internship was because no one allowed me to do anything. At the place I want to go, I'll actually be allowed to do things.

I told her that I saw reviews online about the place, but she told me to ignore them, basically saying that what patients say doesn't matter, what only matters is what she thought of the place.

 I still don't have an easy feeling about this place. I do not feel comfortable going there. A friend of mine said she knows a few people who work there, and they do not like it at all. The training was bad, the bills were not paid, and the management was terrible. I want to go somewhere where I know I'll like it, I know is a good place and I know I'll want a job there. In my opinion, it wouldn't be rude to ""double back"" them, as I haven't interviewed with them. I also don't think it's fair that we don't have a heads up of where we're going before we're placed, and I know I'm not the only one that feels this way. A few of my friends also think that we should have more of an option, and to be allowed to research the place before we go in. I can't look at the assessments, because you told us that they were being uploaded online. We have no access to them, and it's not right that we can't see what other people thought of the place. ",24Jul2019,1

I haven't been ignoring her, she has had multiple opportunities (BEFORE she needed something) to talk.

what if someone rear-ends me in my car (for example someone very drunk) and i am severely injured, in this case i wasn't even doing anything bad, and no matter how much i was driving well, i can't do anything about it since it's someone else fault

what if i have a chronic severe illness some day (cancer or whatever)

what if , what if what if.

call it depression or whatever you want, i think i'm being realistic. putting so much effort in ourselves (health, food, shape, work, money etc etc) and at the end of the day, something out of our control might happen and ruin alllll those efforts.

i just read a story here that reminded me of this ""problem"" i have (i don't think about it all the time or avoid doing things because of it, but it's almost daily on my mind, at bed time usually or at least once a week)

599,"Hey guys so I just want some advice, because I've spoken to my friends and girlfriend and they all have vastly different opinions.

So basically I am starting university this year but going directly into 3rd year as I went through college first, during my time there I was able to get a bursary, as my mum was earning just below the bursary cut off limit. However, this year we are over the limit by about a pound so we don't get it. To make matters worse my sister just turned 18 and is also going to university this year, so the Extra money would have been good for her too. And to top off everything because we're both now over 18 my dad no longer has to legally pay child support, so we won't be getting any financial help from him.

So to help with transportation costs to and from uni as well as help paying the bills my mum wants me to get a loan. I'm hesitant though, as I already have a part time job, and have saved up quite a bit of money,so I'd rather just pay her straight up, but she feels bad taking my money. Any advice?? Open to hear anything",24Jul2019,1
600,I’ve been a mess these last 3 months. My ex started dating a close friend of mine about a month after we broke up. I found my dad dead on Easter. My grandma passed away on my birthday. My betsfirends mother passed away. It’s just too much.,24Jul2019,10
601,"So currently I have some crazy opportunities to go for some projects I am passionate for but it is a pay cut to what i make now. My parents are old and have very bad English so I live by myself in the city and pay the mortgage for the house they have been living in. I have been supporting them for yrs since my mom has a minimum wage job and my dad is a janitor who plans to retire soon. I have been stuck trying out new passion projects because my life revolves around working to support them. I get they are my parents but it feels like I'm not going anywhere in life. my current job pays really well but i am bored of doing the same easy stuff each day. I don't want to grow old regretting not taking risks to become successful in things I have a drive for. What should I do?

My current options are....
a.take a pay cut and not have enough to support parents bills but pursue my dreams
b.be stuck working high paying job thats isnt really improving my life or putting me closer to my goals

602,"I have been on reddit for a while now, and I never really had any friends or anything and most my human contact is online cause nobody at work likes me and nobody at school likes me. 

I have tried to meet women and I'm an ugly male, so that's not really allowed, but I being male and old wanted to know what its like to be with a girl. I see other people doing it talking about it, and even bragging about it. Yet when I bring it up im told ""nope your not allowed to have relationships bud."" With no explanation.

Ive tried dating sites and nothing but rejection, girls at work reject me, at school girls reject me, girls who do talk to me try to get money out of me. But I see other guys I know constantly meeting girls at school and work (some ppl I work with go to school with me) and even have sex with these girls like its nothing. 

I was introduced to the incel community here on Reddit, and I started agreeing with a lot of the stuff they said, cause from personal experience it seemed true, women do just kinda use me for my money that I work very hard for, (I work a lot of hours) I have friends who are girls, but even they sometimes ask me for money and I just always Give it to them cause I want them to love me like I love them. The incels say that I'm just being a cuck and since I'm not chad that's my only value to them. 

I started going on MGTOW and I agree with a lot of what they say, but it also scares ne if being in a relationship with women is even worth it, cause I do personally, want a family one day, a wife and a little girl preferably, but if I voice this, I literally had ppl on MGTOW say ""a daughter? Get ready to have daddies little angel use u just like any other woman"" and it fucking scares me. I wanted to raise her to be a hard working independent girl.... Is that not possible? 

Ive been told marriage will just get me ""cucked"" (they use that word a lot) while my wife fucks chad while I'm working that my wife will never work and will get 50% of my income to not work a day in her life. But like I said I have friends who are girls and one of em works as much as me, and shes a little nice girl I thought... Her dad was in the military... She just joined the reserves and still has a full time job. Is she bad? She is mad cause I am involved in these communities and I use incel terminology a lot. But she finally started not being mad at me again. 

My mom works 7, 12 hour shifts a week. And makes more money than my dad, who works 5 8 hour days a week. And theyve been together for over 22 years. (As old as I am matter of fact)  

This confuses me so much cause I consider myself to be a forever alone ugly buggy, but I don't want to believe all women are bad, yet they all treat me bad, so the incel community kinda made me feel like I'm not the only one women have abused and taken advantage of. Ive had thoughts that all girls are the same and shit and incels basically made it confirm in my head that what I thought was right, cause I did come up with those thoughts on my own before discovering the communities they just made it more apparent, I guess thats what they call going from blue pilled to red pill or whatever, but I really feel sad when I think the world is like that. 

I want women to be just like regular humans like me. Is it possible since I have just basically put myself in a feedback loop that I'm only seeing the bad things women do and none of the good things?  

I just really don't know what to do here.... I'm banned on like every sub for saying incel shit lol Idk where I could go as far as communities and I dont have friends. I just am not sure how to change my perspective or viewpoint of the world. Cause this shits making me depressed.

I know nobody will probably even read this or they'll just think I'm a ugly incel douchebag and need to die. But I really could use some advice here. I want to be happier and expose myself to things that will make me happy. I wish I at least had friends.... What Should I do guys? Has anyone else been in this situation?",24Jul2019,1
603,"So I hired a part-time 3D Modeler for a project I'm working on (been managing a team for 2 years). He's young, super energetic, and loves what he does and that's what got me to hire him in the first place. He's only been working for three days, but the problem we faced was that he is a little slow in his work. Not because of lack of skill, but because he'd go off track from the references and wouldn't follow the directions given to him.

So the art director said ""Try to be a little more efficient with your time because the models are going a little slower than expected. I know you're trying to make things perfect, but we would prefer them done."" **Efficient** was basically another way of saying ""Stick to what I'm telling you to do and there's no need to go off track"".

He got very emotional and went off on a rant and started explaining (aggressively) all the steps he has to go through (which we are fully aware of) and how he's working all the time even longer than the hours he's being paid for because he really cares and all that. I **completely** understand why he got emotional, and it was mainly because he really was working hard, but the statement that really triggered me was ""but if you think I'm slow you can find someone else who's faster to do the work and they would only give you as much as you pay them and not everything like I'm giving you"". That statement really triggered me and gave me a red flag, which is that he has a problem with criticism and communication with him in the future could get difficult. I let myself simmer a bit because I was really upset with the way he was talking, then contacted him the next day (today) and told him about the decision.

I don't *think* I made the wrong decision, but I feel really bad right now because he really does love his work and wants to do his best, but communication and the ability to take feedback and adjust is very important as I'm sure everyone can agree. I have people on our team who I'm brutally honest with when something's not right and no one's ever taken it personally like this. But I still feel reaaally bad. Is feeling bad normal? Am I wrong to have done it so quickly? Should I have given him a warning and more direction? Or was I right to have that concern and I'm just being a softy right now?",24Jul2019,5
604," We all have done it, and we continue to do it. 

Judging by definition is forming an opinion or coming into a conclusion, but it usually has a negative notion to it, because people that form an opinion about someone or something usually end up forming a bad one. Fast judgement is the correct term though, because judging normally takes calculations and thought.

People by nature always try to relate to something so they can understand it and that’s where fast judgement comes in. Let’s say person A encounters person B, they don’t know each other, but for them to make sense of each other, they each form a quick judgement about one another and they move on with it.

Now, what I want you to take from this is very simple yet important.

1-Try not to make fast judgements, take your time in forming your opinion about someone or something.

2- If you catch yourself judging, give the benefit of the doubt to the person and make it a positive opinion instead of a negative one.

We all have a **story, a struggle and a reason** for the things we do. So, keep kindness in your heart when it comes to the world around you.

605,"I live in a 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate that is currently on a month to month lease. He is not a terrible roommate, but regardless living with him has increased my anxiety greatly. My main complaint is he likes to watch TV a lot, usually 6-10 hours a day, leaves his dishes in the sink until no more dishes can fit (I put mine straight into the dishwasher and there is plenty of room for his too), he is almost always home (their have been times where he hasn't left the apartment for upwards of a week), and he constantly complains about how hard his life is and actively tries to point out how much harder his schooling and life are than mine. I can usually put up with this type of stuff, but it really tires me out after awhile. I understand that it is his apartment too, but if I ask him nicely if he can do dishes or turn down the TV volume he says he is too busy or I have no respect for him. I'm about to began my final year of college and have been thinking about getting a studio apartment near campus, which would be nice as I wouldn't have a 40min round-trip drive, would be closer to work, and price wise would be almost the same. The main issue is he will be pretty angry that I am moving out, I will likely be moving out of the current city once I graduate, and just the hassle of moving (although I don't have too much stuff, my bed is the largest item).

613,"To all my friends out there. I think I had enough of what life has given me. I think nobody wants me around. My mom she went back to India 1 month before and barely talks to me, barely texts me. In fact my mom texts and calls all other relatives ( including my dad ) and her friends frequently but not me. The same thing happens to my dad too. When he leaves the country, he keeps in touch with all the other person except me.

They are strict parents, and therefore I grew up under strict rules, and all my decision was taken by them and they withdrew me from every activity ( I am the only son out of 4 kids) as a kid. I studied hard till 12th grade. My ambition was to be a pilot, believed my parents that they would send me to some flying school... But I was wrong. My whole family pressured my dad to send me to a medical school to become a doctor. And this was the first time in my life! I revolted against my parents. I got so MAD! BETRAYED! because the promised me to send me to a flying school. They warned me that they will never send me to a flying school and I have to become a doctor. 
When my dad knew that even I won't change my decision he said I can go for anything except for pilot.  That time I joined engineering because I had no choice.

Due to all this bullshit.... It affected my social life too. I not so humorous since I was bought up by strict parents, I don't know what to talk to people, what makes them interested, how to give others a good time. I have a list of friends who doesn't care about me, doesn't even know if I'm existing in this world, even my own classmates! I am always an option for everyone, the very last option. Nobody! Literally nobody! Cares about me. Even my best friend who has been with me from kindergarten left me for popular kids.... I am all alone! I'm depressed! So depressed that I cannot focus on my day to day activities , hobbies or anything!

Someone please advice how to improve my social life.... I don't care about my parents or my ambition, I've got time to do all that! But I'm a zero when it comes to social life... The invisible guy, kid nobody wants to be around with! Someone who is always boring because I can sense it from the peoples behaviour towards me! I'm always left out! People only remember me when I'm with them, like right in front of them! They never remember to call me for hangouts! The only person who reminded to people of me has now left me too! Darn it I cannot get close to anyone! Everybody knows me, makes small talk to me but nobody wants to be with me. They all laugh like something is funny when they hear my name being called or spoken about. Even the little friends who I thought will be with me has changed. I think I'm one of the biggest loser out there in college and in people. I'm being having suicidal thoughts lately but I'm trying not to think about it too much!

614,"After my aunt’s divorce, she really changed. She started calling herself a witch, started painting, purchased amulets and essential oils. If she feels good like this, then good for her, but this is not the problem.

After I expressed that I don’t believe in healing-powered crystals, she wouldn’t get off my back. She keeps confronting me and trying to convince me about them, started wearing even more of them and is carrying them around and even trying to sneak the crystals into my room (as if that’s going to convince me). 

Again, I don’t see anything wrong with people believing in these types of things, if it gives you a reason to get out of bed in the morning and also serves as a nice accessory then go off I guess. But my auntie also believes that they can *physically* heal you, and has a young daughter that trusts her with this.

I don’t want answers like “There is no arguing with people like this” or “Let her believe and practice what she wants to” because this is not about her practices, but about her bothering me anytime I see her. What do I reply to her? What can I say that will either convince her that its not true (Difficulty: Impossible) or at least get her off my back? I asked her to stop but she won’t listen. She wants a “conversation” with me and I have no idea what to say to “I can feel the energy pass through me anytime i have amethyst near me”.

622,"This have been a recent development and neglect from my part to not seeking help sooner but I feel like I need to express this in order to think reasonable.

Anger and frustration are very close to my heart and have been for a quite awhile from growing up. They always come and lash whenever I'm in no mood or that the berating can be going on for too long for reasons that seem to because of minor mistakes or other things. One family member I unfortunately have come to love and is still living in the parent's house is my big brother.

Now it's very rare that I start to really develop my rather explosive outbursts from how tired I am from them. But when you really and I mean really distaste someone for their personality and mainly how they approach you. You start to think they're not really a good person or even someone that shouldn't really be berating you. Or even because they view things or say things that just make you boil inside.

These thoughts have just recently created from the past few months from passive aggressiveness to just complete ignorance to now frustration at them now. Because from a recent engagement it started to really take effect into something much more vile and pretty unpleasant. I'm fully aware how insane I sound and pretty blinded I am from rage at this point. I just went outside to cool my mind but it just came back with a reason thought.

So now I'm thinking of just commiting extremely violent acts towards them releasing all of this pent up anger I ever had towards him. He's a terrible person yet he feels he's someone that superior.

I planned and thought but never go into it because of the sheer things that could very well put me away. So I please ask of you for actual professional help and things that could stop me from commiting a violent action that may involve blood and harm.

625,"So I am getting married December 2019 , and I have been engaged since dec 2018. I am a devote catholic and my future husband is an ex Jehovah’s Witness. His family is still very JW. 

From the beginning both side have been very open and honest. We are going to have a catholic ceremony at my church and his family was not going attend that part and just attend the reception. Yes, they were going to miss there son getting actually married but at least it was a compromise. I had set up a special time right after the ceremony to go take picture with them not at the church, I bought the mother a corsage, my fiancé and his mother had picked a tentative mother and son dance, I have set up the head table for his parents and my parents to sit with us.  

This whole time since December 2018 his family has been calling me and texting me asking me about the wedding and how everything was going, and I have been trying to keep them involved in everything as much as I can since they live about 4 hours away from us. So I have been telling them every update asking for advice sending them pictures of everything. We went down there 3 weeks ago to see them and when we left it was all hug’s and “we can’t wait to see you at the wedding” and “we will be there”. 

I come home from work yesterday and my fiancé sits me down and says his mother spoke with the “elders” of the JW church and they prayed about it and they decided not to come to the wedding. 

I am furious. First i feel like a fool and like I have been played this whole time. Then I remember what hypocritical bullshit this is because were they live they go to wedding reception all the time. His mother has shown me pictures and videos of her and her husband at wedding receptions before, so they can go to strangers receptions but not there own sons? My heart is in pain for myself and for my fiancé. Weddings are supposed to be about joining two family’s together and his is now refusing to even show up to just the party. 

My fiancé hates confrontation and is very upset but is of the mindset if they don’t wanna come o well it’s there choice “it’s just the way they are”. My first reaction is I want to speak up, I want to not be disrespectful but stick up for myself and at least tell the mom something like “ this is the first of many events that we are going to both need to compromise because of religion, I want you to please reconsider not coming, the hurt it would bring me if you didn’t come that scar would not heal for a long time and it will do great damage to our relationship” 

But now laying here in bed I am thinking do I even want them at the wedding, if they don’t even wanna be there do I want to beg them to be, do I wanna be vindictive and use this as an excuse to not have to compromise in the future, do I want this looming are they and aren’t they coming cloud now over my wedding? I could just shut my mouth no longer say a word to his mother or anyone else about anything, block them on social media, when they ask me about the wedding just not reply and go silent.

I’m not exactly positive if this is the correct subreddit, but I’m in a desperate need of help. Apologizes in advice for poor format. 

Context,

my EX and I had a rough breakup with both of us heated and in tears. He told me he developed feelings for another girl two days prior to our breakup (I mentioned that to him in a later confrontation, he denied it). I was also traveling, consequently it was hard to talk to him (9hrs difference). We were already long distance, so it wasn’t too difficult with being intimate. We kept in contact after the breakup and I’d occasionally text him and every time I’ll bring up the his wrongdoings and argue with him. I was just so angry. I kept telling him I miss him and he says he does too which I don’t understand.

I couldn’t let him go and so he make a compromise with me. He told me if the girl doesn’t reciprocate his feelings toward him, he’d try again with me. I even asked if he’d leave her for me and he said he doesn’t know. Now, Im completely destroyed and hurt. He assured me that he felt more with me and loved me more. He doesn’t love her...then why did he leave me for her? He tried to justify himself by saying his feelings for me were fading and liking another girl isn’t a problem. He said he was burnt out and he was confused about his feelings towards me. I was so hurt and I kept begging him to stay but he said this had to be done. He felt that I was being distant and couldn’t handle the time zone difference.

Finally, I cut contact with him officially, but that within a week I texted him again. He told me how much he misses me and thought of me everyday..less when he’s with the girl though. Does that mean he’s still in love with me? He even willingly offered to leave the girl for me if that meant getting back together. I accepted and asked him for screenshots. He showed me but the texts were edited. I started to suspect if he really did leave her for me. I also found out he’s been flirting(?) with the girl the day before I came back into his life whilst telling me he still wants me. He justified himself by saying that’s how he talks with everybody, except boys..? Now that we’re back together, we continued to fight and talk affectionately. I was too overwhelmed with euphoria with him back in my life to care about anything else. I really did love him and knowing how easily he replaced me hurts.

Eventually, I began having second thoughts and I told him. He agreed with me and we both decided to mutually end the relationship. He said we rushed into this. We both didn’t want to lose each other either, so we decided to be FWF (Friends with Feeling)..stupid I know. Essentially an open relationship except there isn’t a relationship, FWB basically. But there’s a twist, we promised we will let this continue despite being in a relationship or not. I didn’t know what was going through my head when I agreed to this. I know it’s wrong but I still want him in my life. He told me he still loves me in a way and still likes me. 

Should I let this continue? I can’t help but ponder if I’m being played again or manipulated.  Please help, thank you.

EDIT: He’s also been referencing back to a lot of sexual things we’ve done and how much he misses them. Maybe he only wants me to fulfill his sexual needs instead?",24Jul2019,1
629,"As I type my Grandmother (Nan) aged 71 is in intensive care after having her spleen and some of her bowel removed.

Yesterday she was taking a taxi home with her best friend, aged 79, who I'll call Nancy. They were heading home on a beautiful sunny day having just had a lovely day at the garden centre. 

They're travelling down a dual lane road at around 50-60mph. The taxi driver's phone rings. He answers ,no hands-free, and begins having a very animated discussion. At this point the friend says ""he shouldn't be doing that, that's illegal"". At the time she said this they notice the road merge into one lane; and in front of them is a large skip truck stationary in the road, getting closer and closer.

The whiteboard by my nan's bedside stated the crash happened at 45mph, he didn't even look up at the road it seems. 

Nancy wasn't wearing a seatbelt and died instantly, landing to rest on my Nan bleeding from her nose and mouth. The driver suffered pelvic injuries and was brought to hospital with my Nan. PLACED IN THE BED NEXT TO HER in the hospital with her fully conscious but braced from head to toe.

Injuries: Many ribs broken on both sides, ruptured spleen, bowel damage, broken sternum, lung bruising, huge bruising/haematoma from the seatbelt. She's going to be devastated that she has a stoma.

I used to take comfort in the fact my nan found Nancy as she's never suffered fools and hasn't really had many people she really gets on with.

There's just so much more I want to say, I don't even know the full extent of her surgery yet.

She has 2 Sons (my uncles) and me and my Dad to help out and I'm currently back to get some rest as she isn't going to be woken up until tomorrow and both Sons are still at the hospital.

What can I do to help my Nan best? 

This is so much for someone to go through and I want to help her as best I can. By help I mean anything; how to comfort her the best, how to best assist her recovery, any legal advice and how I can help best with her future.

Thank you in advance.",24Jul2019,1
630,"   I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",24Jul2019,0

Im gonna try my best to keep this short, with as much detail as possible. For quite sometime I have been a pretty depressed kid. Going on to my 18th year of life my depression has gotten significantly worse and in my current relationship I’ve kinda let it ruin the whole thing. I’ve neglected my girlfriend, Isolated myself from her when I’ve should’ve opened up to her, got jealous over guys doing stuff for her I should be doing, and just hurt her without even doing it intentionally. We broke up about a week ago and where gonna give it space until I had a mental breakdown, and ruined that as well. Now she wants to start over as friends and work from there. Because she’s had a shitty boyfriend who has did worse shit to her and she doesn’t want to commit to someone who resembles his traits.

635,"I’m a 17 year old female, and I live with my single mom. We have an awesome relationship most of the time, but her recent actions have caused me to be very upset with her. Last summer when I started driving, my mom allowed me to set up a checking account. However, since I’m a minor it was set up as a “student” account. The bank employee offered my mom a debit card linked to my account as well, with her name on it and everything. Of course she accepted. Prior to the last few months, she would borrow small amounts and pay me back promptly. About 2 months ago, I got a job at a fast food place. I work a lot, so my paychecks usually look pretty good. Unfortunately, this means that my mom has started taking larger amounts of money from my account. Last month, she even put the cable bill onto my account. She also deposits large amounts of money to “keep it safe” but takes it out a few days later and confuses how much of the money was mine and how much was hers. Right now, she owes me about $200 and it will likely be much more by the time she gets paid at the end of the month. In the last few days, she has bought gas, gone out to lunch with a friend, and gone to several fast food places, all with my money. She always pays me back at the end of the month, but it has gotten really inconvenient because I don’t have that money there when I actually need it. Last week, I went to an outlet mall with my friends and I was the only person who couldn’t buy anything because there was nothing in my account. I really don’t mind her borrowing smaller amounts, but it’s really becoming an issue when I go to buy something and my card declined because she used it all up. I really love my mom, and I understand that she needs some help sometimes. I just really feel that since it’s my money, I should have some say in what is done with it. Every time I try to confront her about it, I get in trouble for being “rude” and “disrespectful”. So what should I do to stop this, or at least reduce her borrowing? Is there any way I can confront her about this, or will I have to wait until I’m 18 and can open my own account?",24Jul2019,175

639,"My (20f) bf(21) and I are going through a rough patch at the moment. We love each other and we have had certain plans for the future that we've been planning for a year. A month ago he told me he could not go through with it as planned for multiple reasons. While I do understand these reasons I still wish we could have gone through with the plan as originally intended. But I know we can't and there's no use in dwelling on it or trying to change his mind. The final outcome will still be the same with the substitute plan though it will be harder for our relationship. I've been thinking a lot lately and realised what's taking a toll on me is not the new plan itself but the fact that my boyfriend changed it after a year of planning albeit for understandable reasons. I think I feel some resentment towards him but at the same time I love him to bits and I know he could be the one. But it makes me feel insecure about the stability of our relationship that he changed his mind only 2 months before a big event that we've been planning for a year. How do I proceed? I do love him and I want to be with him. Can I stop the resentment and the feeling that I've lost security?

Edit to add info
The original plan was that since he's Australian and I'm European he'd study in my country for 3 years so I can finish my studies. I'm in the middle of getting my degree he hasn't started uni yet. After that the plan was to move to Australia together. He was supposed to move here in September. But he doesn't want to anymore mainly because he couldn't get a work permit for the first 6 months,  my country is expensive af and his money is worth less than my currency. However uni is paid for by the state. There are other reasons as well but I think that's the main one. So as I said the outcome would still be the same, I'm going to Australia once I get my degree but it will be long distance until  then.",24Jul2019,1

642," Through  a miracle, I've been going on dates with a friendly and beautiful woman  who has a professional job and doesn't already have any kids or  husbands or ex husbands.

I clearly  need practice giving compliments; it's not something I'm in the habit  of doing. She is a very attractive woman and I'm especially shy about  saying that because to me it sounds cringey.

She  is accustomed to receiving compliments on the regular (I've seen it  happen! Strangers just tell her how pretty she is!) and she has prompted  me a few times that I need to do that. I playfully do what she says. I  am working on it but still don't want to be so shallow that I only focus  on her appearance. I don't want any relationship we have to hinge on me  feeding her that 24/7. At the same time, I know it feels great getting  compliments and I probably need to give them to her more freely.

648,"I've made this post on a throw-away account for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

So, over the course of the last year or so, my sister-in-law had fallen on some extraordinarily hard times. She found herself losing her job, and as a result, she got her car repossessed, and then finally was evicted from her apartment. All of this found her living in my apartment with my wife and I. This is where the trouble ensues.

Our apartment is a two-bedroom, which we moved into with the intention of starting a family. That second bedroom was intended for our baby (who is currently on the way), but it is now occupied by my sister-in-law. Letting her move in was suggested by my wife, and I agreed thinking (foolishly) that it would only be for a month or two at most.

It's been nearly 8 months now.

She's thankfully found herself another job, but she's made no effort to pay off any of her mounting debt. If she were making an earnest effort to get out from under all of this, I'd be a bit more sympathetic. She also has a 2 year old half the time, who wastes no time in tearing the apartment apart, and has stained the carpet 10 times over with God only knows what. She also has an unemployed bum of a boyfriend who spends most of his free time (all he has is free time) at our apartment, eating all of our food and shooting our utility bills sky-high.

To make matters worse, my wife's other siblings (who are profoundly irresponsible, and also unemployed) often find themselves bumming around the apartment as well, typically at the invitation of my sister-in-law.

All this makes my wife furious, and she's constantly stressing about how we're going to have room for this baby, but she's also far too sympathetic to my sister-in-law's plight to kick her out (which I can understand, to a point).

I feel for my sister-in-law. I really do. She was dealt an unbelievably shitty hand. But I don't know how much more of this I can really take. I haven't been able to relax in my own home for almost 8 months, to the point where it doesn't even feel like home anymore. I find myself looking for any opportunity for my wife and I to leave for a while, just to get some peace and quiet. It may sound selfish, but I just want my sister-in-law out. 

This also may sound selfish, but my wife and I have some very exciting new experiences ahead of us with our quickly approaching bundle of joy, and I really don't want an audience 24/7 while I experience them.

I can go back home every now and then to see her, but I can't be next to her all the time, and she wouldn't want that for me.

Ok so about 6 months ago i got in an accident and lost all my memory ( if you're wondering i got everything back now), and when i was seeing for the ""first"" time my friends i really felt that i liked one (i'm gonna call her J).

So i talked to my best best friend about J and he told me that even if we were very good friends, went along very well it wasn't possible for us to date and that she had already rejected me in the past (in 2015) and she felt really akward with me for a long time .

After she rejected me we stopped talking for more than a year and now we are again really really close, more than ever before. We went just this week on vacations together with mutual friends and we were really acting like a couple (being all the time together, teasing around etc...) (but maybe she was just being friendly?).

For the past two years i have tried getting meaningful romantic relationships with other girls but things never worked out and a few months back i thought: ""Well in fact J has everything i would want in a girlfriend"".

J is intelligent, really funny (she knows her memes),open minded, beautiful, and i could continue for a whole paragraph but you get the general idea, i feel really good with her and i love her deeply.

I know J thinks i'm attractive, intelligent and funny, so i suppose you're thinking : ""Well if you know she likes you why don't you ask her to date ?""

Well for two things:

\-The first is that i would never want to lose her if she gets akward after possibly rejecting me because i love her.

\-Second is that J has never dated anybody (she's 17 too) and I have talked with one of our mutual friends (which i have known for 13 years) and she said when asked about us dating : ""Well i've never seen J being interested in someone and to be honest i don't even see her dating in general""

So now we have a child together and now I see myself as a mom and wife, nothing else, like my whole identity is that. I could not tell you what my hobbies or interests are because I don’t even think I have any other than being a stay at home mother, is this normal when you have a child? I just feel like there has to be more to life than this. I’m questioning everything right now and just want someone to give me advice, is this a sign I need to be on my own or just power through these feelings?

676,"I had a job interview yesterday for an AMAZING opportunity that would help me ten-fold. I made sure to leave my house one hour early (it takes me a half hour to get there) but because of a tree being down and the whole road being blocked from a storm the night prior, I ended up being 5 mins late. Literally. 9:35.

I called the employer about 20 mins ahead of time once I noticed the ETA was late, and she was understanding. When I got there, she said her parents lived in the same area as the storm and she knew it was bad because they lost power. I still felt AWFUL and can’t help but think about how this might effect my opportunity.

The rest of the interview seemed to go well, I didn’t stumble over my words or anything and my answers were clear and I was honest. The two ladies were very kind and we made casual conversation. The one made a comment along the lines of me seeming “all in it” referring to the job, and they asked me if I would be willing to work in their other location because it’s closer to where i live, and I said yes.

She handed me her card and told me to email her my references and regardless I’ll hear from her by Friday or on Friday. I did just that and now it’s the waiting game.

I’m so nervous and I can’t stop thinking that me being late ruined my chances which sucks because I literally left an hour early to ensure I would be on time. :( how would you handle this?",24Jul2019,2

678,"Sorry for the clickbait title. 

Tldr - I farm and ranch for a living on the family farm. Dad and I got into an argument over something that doesn't matter. Found out that night he doesn't want me to carry on. 

____

 He doesn't think I have the motivation or drive for it. Sounds like it's done more or less. Makes me sad and scared because this is the only job I've had since I was 13 years old. 

I have a two year degree in Precision Agriculture, I don't know what that qualifies me for, or if I'm that good. 

I have a very calm demeanor when handling jobs. Especially around cattle. I know how fast things can turn if I get mad or angry.

Most important thing to me on the farm are the dogs and cats. If I leave and the cattle go they don't have much to do anymore. And they might go ""to a good home.""

Not a make or break aspect but the dogs mean alot to me. They are my kids. I raised and trained them. I'd feel like w failure if I left them. 

___

As far as options go for me, I'll be leaving with some income. Idk how much and it doesn't matter to me. It's there, what I earned. What I need to sustain or protect. 

""The world is my oyster"" so to speak, but I don't have very many goals. Farming and ranching is all I knew. I recently got started woodworking and I played video games for my off time. 

I could go back to college for my four year degree. Which would be nice. Maybe go for Ag Economics, Finance or Logistics. 

I'm not mechanically inclined. Which probably influenced my dad's decision as well as wanting to keep the safety and security of the farm. And guarantee a rent check to his three kids. 

One thing he told me is the opportunity is there out in the world provided you're willing to work. 

I think I'm willing to work. But I don't know. Again, you're reading words from someone who more or less worked with his dad all his life and by himself or with his cattle dogs. 

Any advice is appreciated. Any stories stating what you did and how you got there also appreciated, well, definitely appreciated.

679,"I trained MMA.

I still train but a little on / off.

Since starting I have realised how hard it is to actually fight, and how street fights can literally break out and I can be knocked out without even knowing a fight is starting 

Since this I have become so much more aware of my surroundings and developed a type of social anxiety when going to busy places. I’m an extrovert so this really angers me that I feel this way and I don’t even know what I can do about it.

I feel like I’m always looking at my surroundings and always thinking what would happen if I fight broke out, could I take that guy in a fight etc... 

Which literally makes no sense because I’ve only ever been in a fight in competition.

Any advice on anything I could do / try.

680,About a month or so before I came left for college my mom left my dad a note on the kitchen table before she went to work. They usually would do stuff like that and I would always sneak read them before the other parent came home because they were always really sweet and I’m nosy. But this one wasn’t sweet it was about my mom saying that she felt my dad didn’t trust her anymore. It had me shook but I pushed it out of my mind. Then over spring break she tells me they were separating and I figured the note was about that. Then a couple weeks ago we were going to visit my grandma because she just moved back to New York. We were calling her and I went to text nana and my mom took the phone from my hand and said just keep calling her. I thought that was weird because she always used to let me text people for her while she’s driving. But before she took it away she had a message from one of my dad’s friends. I only noticed it because my mom deletes texts as soon as the convo ends and that was the only one on there. I figured it was nothing because she was kind of friends with him too but it was still kind of weird. But today me and my mom were taking photos on her phone and I was sending them to me and there was a message from my dad’s friend that said “I can’t wait until 4 o’clock”. My dad was talking about his friends and he was like “I don’t know what’s going on with Bob(that’s what we’ll call the friend). He’s been really distant lately. I know he has things going on in his life but he’s being so secretive”. My mom also changed her phone password and won’t tell me what it is even though she would always tell me so I could do things for her while she drove.,24Jul2019,1

She sat between me and another woman Im friends with, talked to her she said something, smiled at me and looked deep into my eyes and didn't stop smiling and it felt awkward, if I didn't break the eye contact she probably would've continued. One day I sat down waiting for class and sat with another woman and she came in for class walked over and started waiting very close to me, hovering over standing in my personal space, she walked right in front of me and started getting close to me and I could smell her but she had her back to me. This was the closest she's been to me. There was a whole room not a lot of other people. When I talked about another girl flirting with me and asking for advice from a woman I talk to in college to not lead her on. She joined the conversation said that the other girl will continue pushing boundaries and persisting if I don't say I'm not interested and ignore hrr. She started this stuff after I asked for advice, . I told her someone said my hair looks like the clown from it and she said that's not nice.

If she records what they tell her, she just draws random scribbles that never make sense or are anywhere close to legible.  She seems to really believe that she can, but hasn’t ever really brought any evidence to the table besides my ancestors giving me vague advice.  At this point, I’m starting to worry she’s suffering from psychosis or schizophrenia because she has developed a very serious drinking issue over the past few years.

I’m sure they can handle a relationship with an older person. I talk to young teens on website chats all the time and they’re so hot but I can’t pursue anything with them due to my age.

692,"Hi all,

I am 23 years old and a few weeks ago i had an offer accepted on a house. I have paid a small part of the solicitors fees for them to start doing the checks on the house. I have had a mortgage offer accepted by the bank , also had quotes for home and life insurance. Its all going well apart from the fact that i\`m having second thoughts about buying the house. Its not the house that\`s the issue, its my job. 

I earn decent money and have a flexible working time but i\`m not really doing anything interesting. The company i work for is  based around 200 miles away but they have a small laboratory in the area where i live. There isn't much of a chance to move up in the lab where i work,and a number of people have been there for way longer than me and are still analysts (Nothing wrong with that, its just not what i want) . One of my friends from work recently moved to the head office as she wasn't happy with her role in the lab. She has been saying that the work is more interesting and she leaves work feeling like shes actually done something.  I have said in the past that i would like to make the move to head office and my manager thinks it would be a great move for my career.

There are currently no positions available in head office but some will be free in the next few months. Do i buy the house and stay in my current job and hope to get a promotion or find another job in the area? Or back out of the purchase and hope to get a job in head office?

696,"**very sorry for the rushed writing, I'm confused at the moment and this is word-vomit of how I'm feeling**

We are both medical students in the and have been dating for almost a year and a half, since April 2018. Due to the nature of our degree, we don't get much free time, but at university we've always made our relationship work so well, and although there is some up's and down's, she's a great girl, who I've always believed is *the* one. The time we spend together is magical and she never fails to put a smile on my face, even when the stresses of medicine get to me.

However, holidays have always been an issue, we live far away from each other and our extremely strict parents don't allow contact with the opposite sex at home (at 22 ik this sounds ridiculous) and neither of our families know about our relationship. So we tend to become fairly distant over the long summer breaks as texting and calling is difficult. Summer break is a shit time for us especially.

This holiday, I've been abroad for a couple weeks and she has a full-time summer job at a residential camp. This camp is a busy place, where she has a senior welfare position and has large amounts of paperwork and first-aid to attend to, but she does have a free day now and then. So this is where the issue comes. At uni, we both give each other a lot of attention and are always there for each other. At this camp however, I feel like she's actually forgotten about my existence and I feel like shit because of it. I have been starting all the conversations recently, I have been the one to call and I have been the one to try and plan a way we can meet each other over summer. Her messages have been really dry and I've felt like she's giving me very little emotional investment. We called this morning after 3 weeks and I said I was frustrated with this and didn't like the way she was being so unaffectionate. She apologised and said that she feels like the camp is a bubble and sometimes she just forgets to call. I found issue with this because surely you can't forget about your SO?? Either way, she said she'd be try harder, apologised for being a bit shit and asked if I was free next week to meet, which I was.

So i believed everything had been fixed and OK. A few hours later she messages me and says that the camp is paying her £2000, of which £1000 will be going to bills/ overdraft and £1000 would be going to savings, so she didn't want to spend any of the savings money to come and visit because apparently this pre-contrived figure of £1000 is so important? It would cost about £80 to come and visit/ stay with me for a few days but she says this is too much.

I raised this with her but she says I was being disrespectful of her savings, however I feel that spending £80 to see your boyfriend after 5 weeks isn't a big ask, especially when she can save a few pounds a week at uni and make up for it? Either way, with the dry texts, lack of contact and now this situation on top, I feel a bit shit, unloved and I'm not sure whether she still wants this relationship. I really don't feel like I'm asking much from her, I don't ask for constant texts, I don't interfere with her day and all i want is a bit of affection back!

I know if it was the other way round, I'd spend that money without hesitancy to see her. But maybe, she's just busy and I'm overthinking everything. So what do I do now?",24Jul2019,1

700,"So a little bit of background info. I live full time in the Midwest U.S., and this past Spring, I went to California on an internship from January to April. The lady I lived with was a sweet, kind, old(ish) lady. She's around 60. It was just her and I living in a house.   


I received an offer to go back to California for the fall too. So I called her in May to let her know. She was ecstatic to have me back living with her. She told me to give her a call closer to the fall. Which I have attempted to do so recently.  


I first tried texting and calling her a few weeks ago, but received no answer in either way. Her phone will ring completely, then go to voicemail. I had left voicemails. Yesterday, I tried messaging her on facebook, but still have yet to hear anything either. I do not have any of her relative's contacts, and since I am not friends with her on facebook, I cannot view any of her friends. I also do not have any neighbor's contact information.  


I am unsure what happened to her, but obviously something is going on. Does anyone have any ideas on how I should go about trying to contact her or find out what happened to her? Worse comes to worst, I could write a handwritten letter and send it in the mail. I thought maybe she was out of the country, but would her phone ring completely, if so?

706,"Hi everyone

My (ex)boyfriend has broken up with me for about the 15th time now. We have an on again off again relationship - by his choice (to break up) and mine (since I keep taking him back).

At this point nothing feels real anymore. When we're together I'm waiting for the next big blow, and when we're broken up, I'm waiting for him to come back to me... 

We fight over the dumbest things and they become huge because we suck at handling confrontation together - he wants to shut down and pretends the problems don't exist, and I tend to fixate until we do something about it. If I don't, it won't get done! He'll avoid it into nonexistence - but that's not how I work.

Help me, please. I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore - I'm scared he's going to get in touch. I'm scared he's NOT going to reach out.
He actually told me that he only keeps coming back because he's lonely and because of sex- but he sees no real future with me. I just don't understand why someone would waste my time like this when I've shown them love.

All this time, I thought he came back because space and time apart made him realize that he loved me. How foolish I was. 

This guy has messed up my mind in more ways than I can articulate- it has been a whole year of one thing after another - I'm depleted. I have nothing left to give to anyone. 

I feel empty and useless and pathetic. And I'd really like some guidance from the community here on what to do.

The fact that the language here isn’t the best thing I can speak, me speaking the language here is horrible (barely understandable) so I have no idea what to do, i’m just so bored and I feel like this is not going to get any better because once i’m back to my own country, School starts, i’m about to turn 18 so I have to work to pay off my monthly stuff, it’s vert frustrating that a vacation can suck this much",24Jul2019,3
708,"I’ve been suffering from severe anxiety and depression for the past 5 years. During this time I’ve put on a lot of weight (like 3+ stone). I used to be skinny and really active so this has really affected my confidence. I can’t go outside without wearing a jacket or something to cover my arms. I haven’t worn a dress in years. I’m constantly self conscious and trying to suck my stomach in. My mind is constantly on how I look. I avoid leaving the house most of the time because I feel too insecure to go out. I keep making excuses to my friends whenever they ask me to go out. I no longer have a life. 

I’m working on losing weight but it’s a difficult and long process. I’ve put my life on hold for the past few years because of my weight. Whenever I want to do something I think ‘no I’ll wait until I lose weight then do it’. I feel like I don’t deserve happiness until I look good. I know it sounds ridiculous but I’m in such a bad place right now and I don’t know how to allow myself to feel happier when I constantly just feel disgusted with myself.

711,"I'm attending a wedding as a plus one with a man I started dating roughly a month ago. It's his younger brother's wedding and I've not yet met the brother, as he lives in a different region of the country. I've recently met his parents, other siblings, extended family, etc. and it seems like we're on a decent trajectory to ""officially"" date. Because of this, I'm a bit more cognisant of the gift I'll be giving the couple. He is gifting them a handcrafted gift that is very sentimental, so I'm curious as to what I should give considering the circumstances.

Is money the easiest route to go, given that I don't know them? Is it tacky to give them money? They're also travelling to have their wedding, so I don't want to burden them with a gift. If money is, in fact, the best route - how much? I've never attended a wedding as a ""single"" before.",24Jul2019,1
712,"So I just received a job offer for 8.5% higher than I currently make. Current position bonus is 15% with payout around 50-60% payout (expecting it to go down since industry sucks) but the new job bonus target is 7% with payouts up to 200% possible (I’m told last few years always paid above 90%...much more lucrative industry). New company also includes a 4% 401k deposit in addition to matching. Vacation and benefits are a wash. 

In both positions for the region and industries, I’m near the top of the salary range taking into account experience, education, and position. 

I’m thinking of asking for a 2.5% increase to make up for lower target bonus.

730,"Hey everyone,

So I may have a pregnancy scare on my hands - I'm hoping I can get some feedback from r/AskMen and see if my panic is justified.

I've been seeing someone for a bit. She's a virgin and a bit anxious about sex, so when I spent a few nights with her we didn't have full vaginal intercourse. The furthest we went was touching my tip (uncovered) to the outer vulva/near her hole as a sort of tease. This would happen a few times, with me later finishing on her chest. Afterwards I peed, cleaned myself, we showered, and would wait a full day (and more showering/cleaning/pee) before doing this again.

I was worried so I bought her Plan B with the most recent activity being within 24 hours and the latest being within maybe 40 hours-ish. She took it and had the side effects associated with it (headache, nausea, lethargy, etc).

Her period is now 10 days late. During those 10 days she's had a lot of travel and work related stress, so I think that may be interfering with her cycle. Realistically, what are the chances that she is pregnant?",24Jul2019,1

733,"What's up guys, I don't normally do this, but I'm at a crossroads. About a year ago, my friend I've known since 6th grade moved in with me. He is extremely draining for a couple of reasons, I'll list out momentarily. Once I do, I'm just wanting to know how to breakthrough to him, or how to handle the situation. 

Reasons he is draining 
1. Lazy). He is extremely lazy, in all facets of life. I'm tried time, and time again to find a way to motivate him. Getting him a job was one of the hardest things I've ever done. I had to fight him to apply to places, I had to fight him to follow up on those places, and had to fight him to go to the interviews. The laziness also extends to other aspects of life. It's a battle to get him to do simple task such as cleaning up after himself, stop leaving lights/ps4 one 24/7 etc.

2). Argumentative, he likes to argue about every little thing, and it is annoying. For example, we stayed at an airbnb, and one of the hosts only rules was ""do not park on street, park in driveway"" he refused to do so, because he didn't see the point, and his logic is he he doesn't want to do something, or doesn't like something, then he just wont do it. It's literally one of the most annoying things I've ever been apart of.

3). Selfish, he is liter the most selfish person I have ever met in my life, he will not do anything unless it directly benefits him, this especially irritates me, because I consider myself unselfish, and have done so much for him, fed him, given him money, helped on his rent, gotten him job, interviews etc. When it comes to him, I can't even get a simple thank you after I bless him when he sneezes, I get no thank yous for anything. It's to the point where he is trying to be manipulative, he'll say let's make a deal, I'll do this if you do this. Or we can do this, or this, I'll leave it up to you. 

4). Unsympathetic, kind of piggybacking off of selfishness, he walks around with no regard for how his actions affect the people around him. I have stuck my neck out far too many times for him, and he has burnt bridges. When he was looking for a job, I called my connections that took me time to build up, and asked if they'd interview him, some said they would give him jobs on the spot, just for him to schedule interviews, then miss them because he ""didn't remember what day it was"", or some other bs excuse.

5). Cannot take a joke, I am the person who is the loveable asshole, I joke with literally everyone, it's just who I am. He takes negative intent on everything, it all goes to heart, no matter how many times I tell him I'm joking, he gets so butthurt, in his defense he did have a screwy childhood, but he'll get mad over the smallest things.

6). Destructive, this one he doesn't mean, but it's still frustrating. He literally destroys just about anything he touches, and I have no idea why. He has such a lack of awareness.

7). Pessimist, he is probably the most negative person I've been around, he constantly jokes (talks) about suicide, or other b.s. Not only that, but he believes nothing good will ever come his way, no matter the situation. Anytime something happens not matter how big, or small he will find something negative to say about it, and it's starting to take a toll on me.

8). Excuses, I have never EVER met someone who makes more excuses than him, he literally has an excuse for everything, he calls them reasons to justify them to himself. Example, we were getting ready to smoke (we live in Washington) I lit my blunt, and gave him the lighter, he didn't know hoe to work it, nothing fancy just a standard bic lighter, so I showed him how, and gave it back, after 5mins he still couldn't do it, and said ""I'm just not good at stuff like this, never have been, never will be"" there are more extreme cases, but I'll keep it light.

9).dependency. again, he is the most dependent person I've ever met, if he cannot do something he expects it to be done for him, no matter how big or small the task. I offer to teach him, but not do it for him, and he bitches, and moans. He wants everything to be handed to him.

10). Temper tantrums, he constantly whines, and throws temper tantrums, over the littlest shit, you tell him no, he whines, tell him to leave you alone he whines blah blah blah, I feel like I'm roommates with a toddler.

11). Irresponsible, he makes stupid decisions constantly, I got him a job, so he could start taking steps to relief, and while I was away visiting friends for a week, he quit the job because ""it wasn't for him"" without having anything lined up after, what's worse is I didn't hear it from him, my friend had to tell me. This was a few weeks ago, and he still has no job, he refused to even look for one when I offers to help. I got him an interview, at another place where he would be hired that day, but he moved it to another day, so he could play video games. Turns out the guy I spoke to wasn't there that day, so he interviewed, and didn't get the job. All because he wanted to play fucking video games. 

I could go on, but I'll stop there. Now before you guys go at him too hard, I will say, that he didn't have the best life growing up, and has had his fair share of mishaps/badluclk, but it's no excuse to let it weigh you down. I try to talk to him, but he is extremely distrusting, and keeps everything inside. I'm honestly pretty tired of it, but I really want to see him happier, but I don't want the burden anymore either.

734,"So, basically i’m enjoying single life, but i do have feelings for him and he told me he has strong feelings for me. Things get heated between us and often we get close to having sex and its normally him that resists / stops himself. He admitted having sex for him sometimes does cause him to catch feelings, but he already has feelings for me so whats the problem! So i’m left wondering will a guy really not have sex with a girl cuz he doesn’t want to become too attached to me? Or maybe he doesn’t want me to become too attached? I don’t even know what the reason could be. 

Some background: We newly like eachother, we just started hooking up 2 weeks ago, but have been good friends for a year now. Just recently we have been seeing eachother in a different light. 🙌🏼

735,"I worked at a nonprofit organization under a woman who had a terminal illness, which required her to pull around an oxygen machine. When I started working for where I work, out of kindness, I did things like go fill up her water for her, get the things out of her mailbox, etc. She would also ask me out to lunch pretty often during the time we worked together.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, she became attached to me I think. I grew really tired of spending all the extra time at work with her... she talked a lot and talked about her problems to me all the time. I didn’t really even respond much, except just listen. Every day turned into me spending at least an hour or two hours of her asking me to come to her office and just talk. I was sick of it, but kept a straight face.

&amp;#x200B;

The Executive Director decided suddenly that it was time for her to retire because her illness was getting worse and she couldn’t do the majority of her work duties. She didn’t fight it and left pretty easily, so I was relieved that I got a new boss that actually acts like a normal boss.

Except now, my old boss won’t stop calling me. She calls to “check” on me, and asks me out to lunch. I went one time, and it was awkward.

738,"I took a new job this year in March, so far it hasn't been at all what was sold to me. 90% of my day i just sit in front of the computer and browse stuff, its to the point where i can't stand coming in and some times i leave 2 hours early (i work 4-10s) what little work i do have i can get done in a hour or two. All of the technical stuff which is what i figured i would be working on it contracted out i report the problems and they develop a patch or add it to the list of problems to fix during the next quarter visit. I feel like I'm wasting my time and my degree here, its a fair odd industry everything is air-gap, i can't really do any outside learning on a Corp. computer because of how locked down things are and i am in the middle of no where so there is no cell service or moblie data. 

Not to mention they place is going though a ""Do more with less"" phase and I'm asked to work on days off and iv even been asked twice now to come in and be on site for 24-hours in case of problems and sleep in my office.

Because of this i know what is out there and it makes it really hard to get up in the mornings.

744,"Okay so I just turned 19 and my bf is currently 22. Right now we’re living with his mom until we get on our feet, my bf has 4 other siblings and we’re in a small apartment. His family and I hit it off really well when we first met but they moved away for about a year until we moved in with them, I thought everything would be fine until his little brother (whose 9 btw) started being weird. Like constantly stare at me and try to talk to me and only me toward the point that it gets annoying. So one night my boyfriends family and I were all going to sleep and I was one the bed, his little brother was laying on the couch next to me (my back was turned towards him) and we’re all watching a movie. As I’m watching the movie I felt something against my butt so I look behind me n I see the back of his hand touching my butt so I moved his hand and simple told him to stop, about a min later I feel something again but this time really lightly (like he wasn’t trying to get caught again) and I look again his hand was touching my butt again so this time I jerked his hand away from me n said it loud for everyone to her saying “if you do this again I’m going to slap you” and then my bf stepped in and said “what is he doing?” And then I told him and he told his brother “ if you keep doing it I’m going to tell your mom, okay” and he got no response so he said okay louder and then his little brother said okay. So then the next morning I went to tell his mom what happened and she said she’ll talk to him and once she talked to him she told me what he told her saying that he was falling asleep and his hand accidentally fell. So I was telling her I would believe that if he didn’t try to do it another time lightly, and that I didn’t want her to think I was overreacting. She was saying that I wasn’t because around his age that’s when he’ll become interested in girls. So I was still worried out about it and mentioned it to my bf and he was basically saying of course he’ll lie about it he’s a kid and that boys will be boys and he doesn’t want to get in trouble. I just feel upset that nothing was done and that his mom knew he lied but she didn’t confront him about it. So about a week later I was talking to his mom while he was in the room , I was putting on my bra (I had a shirt on so everything was covered) and I didn’t really thing he would be staring at me because his eyes were glued to the tv but his mom noticed it and made him turned around, then 2 days later I was getting ready for work. Keep in mind this is a small apt so there’s a bathroom, living room  and a room and that’s it. So I’m trying to get ready for work because his mom was in the restroom so I was putting on my shirt in the living room everyone was sleep besides my bfs little brother and my back was turned towards the doorway I saw him at(I felt like he walked out quietly so he wasn’t heard) so I felt like someone was staring at me so I turned around and say him looking at me the entire time getting dressed and when I saw him he put his head down and turned around so I told him to go to the room and he was actin like he was doing anything. So I went to work that day and while I at work I was texting my bf about the situation and he was basically saying that I shouldn’t get dressed in the living room and that he would talk to him (he still hasn’t talked to him also). I only put on my shirt out of the bathroom because I was rushing to be on time for work I jus feel uncomfortable around him now because things keep happening. Am I overreacting? Should I say something to the little brother? Should I jus leave it alone? I need some advice because I’m not sure how to go about this.",24Jul2019,0

746,"My ex boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) broke up a couple days ago mutually. We just felt like we weren't right for each other and it was time to move on. We have been together for 4 years. I thought I would feel a lot better after ending the relationship but I don't. I'm having a hard time telling people we broke up.

He is off at his friends house staying there and slowly moving out of our apartment and I am keeping the apartment. While I am crying myself to sleep in our bed, he is apparently having a great time smoking and drinking with his friends every night. He also is quick to move on so I'm sure he already has a girl in mind to rebound with.

I lost most of my friends during the relationship and am pretty much by myself. We did agree to stay friends after taking a break from each other. But right now I am pretty much alone. I don't have close friends to help me get over the relationship. I also suck talking to people which is why I haven't made new friends.

Any advice on how to move on from this? I didn't think I would be this upset after ending the relationship because I've been thinking about it for a while. We had a codependent relationship which was one of the reasons we broke up. 

I don't think I would be so upset if I had someone to talk to about it, but I don't want to go complaining to people about my break up. I lost a couple of my friends from complaining about the relationship so much to begin with.

 Any advice?",24Jul2019,1

748,"Hi Reddit, 

I had to make a new Reddit because I don’t want my friends to see this and worry about me or think I’m getting deported.

Don’t know how to start, but I entered America when I was a baby, I have a Greencard that expired 2003, I would have been around 3 years old that time. I also have a passport that expired 2017, would have been around 16 around that time. I didn’t know about this until I was 18, when I moved out. My biological mother lost alot of documents and until a week ago, no one knew where my social security card was. 
My situation is scary. I’m 19 now. I’ve been trying to find a job so I can earn some money, I just graduated high school. 
I’m trying to renew my German passport right now. The German Consultant of Atlanta needs me to prove that I never tried to get US citizenship (because if i did, I won’t be able to get a German passport)
Once I get my new German passport, I can get my state ID... meaning work, college, even get married if I wanted! I can finally open a bank account! Health insurance! 

I’ve submitted my Freedom Of Information Act, but I don’t know if it was accepted or what the situation regarding that is.
I really need to talk to someone from USCIS. Anytime I call their helpline, a bot requests my case number, I don’t have one.

Guess my general question is how can I get in touch with an USCIS agent who can look into my file and confirm to the German Consultant that I’m not a US citizen?

And my wife who is pregnant would need health insurance as well and my current employer has very good medical insurance. But my wife needs a heart valve replacement because one of her valves is narrowing. And they would need to perform the procedure thru the groin because they can't do open heart surgery due to her being pregnant and risk of losing baby. I believe the procedure is called a TAVR procedure. We found out about all this yesterday.  I got the job offer today. What advice would you have for me.

However, I have a sister that is a Marine Vet and isn’t really helping. She insults my weight that I am working on losing, calls me stupid and says I’m not fit enough to join and I’m going to be real with you guys, I’m not the mentally toughest however I know that if I join the Marines, it will help me turn into the person I want to be. She says that I’m gonna have a bad time because I’m bi, mixed, and a girl which is a really stupid excuse since I’m sure there are plenty of girls/ guys that are LGBT and claims that I will regret joining and will want to leave (I’ve seen people that wanted out but wanted to go back in when they’re out, including her. She made my other sister not want to go to the Air Force because it’s horrible and did it out of jealousy yet, she parades her car with USMC stickers and posts online “I MISS THE USMC TAKE ME BACK!!1!1!1!1!”. I’m sure everyone has seen these people or at least heard stories). When I announced that my choice of joining the Marines after HS on Insta, she reposted and said “my wonderful sister is gonna follow my footsteps” but in reality, she only wants to get attention and will most likely do anything to ruin my reputation in the Marines once I graduate MCRD and I’m sure that if I somehow die while I’m in there, she would parade my dead body around or my old pictures around in social media saying shit like “sHe WaS mY bAbY SiSTeR, wE hAd fUn tOgEthEr aNd I rAiSeD hEr!!1!1!1!!” She never wanted to be a part of my life at all since I was born, mainly because I wasn’t the girly girl sister that she always wanted, and only said “I love you” to me once after the Sandy Hook shooting. I can’t deal with her anymore, she always wants to start a fight with me every 2 seconds and will do anything to make herself seem smart and right. I also babysit her kids while she goes to college yet she claims I never watch her kids even though I have failed a few classes (that I eventually passed in the end) because I had to watch her kids and they are a handful meaning I can’t go anywhere without them screaming. She also wants me to respect her because she’s my sister and a Marine. I’m gonna be real, she has no redeemable qualities and although being a Marine is admirable, it’s not something she should use as a “oops I did a bad thing lemme pull out my military title and all my sins will be cleansed from me” card. She may be book smart but she is extremely immature and irresponsible for a 30 year old. I know sisters are a pain but sweet baby Jesus, she is insane.

Insurance information:

I live in Virginia. I left a job at the end of last month. My old job told me it would be 972.00 if I wanted to continue it one more month. Meanwhile, my new employer said he'd pay for my own policy. Two insurance providers told me I'd have to go through [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov/) which I did. The gov said they wouldn't process my application until I had a letter saying I'd lost insurance... So here I am, they've got their letter, I've got no insurance and a wandering testicle, and even if I pay today the plan won't start till August 1st. I called Cigna directly and they told me even if I paid them directly I'd have to wait. They even said if something happens before then the emergency room will be happy to take care of me. Hurray! Wait....

Medical information:

I was hospitalized 10 years ago when it felt like someone stuck a knife in my groin. The pain came and went about 5 times. Doctors figure it untwisted itself. I haven't had that level of pain yet but I did get one sharp jolt. Right now my main symptoms have been mild abdominal pain. Left testicle keeps moving around and contracting up and forward.

765,"Throwaway because some people might recognise pictures from my main account. I'm also trying be be as vague as possible in case he sees this, so please let me know if I'm missing any information you think is important. 

So there's this guy from my school who recently got into my friend group. He's constantly making sexual remarks about me, mainly the things he wants to do to me, how he wants to be alone with me and I'll have to fall in love with him, etc. I'll spare you the details. 

He kind of a socially awkward guy who doesn't really have any other friends, and I'm quite certain he's just making bad jokes thinking they're funny somehow. But I, as well as many others in the group, have told him multiple times that they're not funny and it's making me uncomfortable. Still, he keeps making those remarks and every day it seems to get more and more explicit and creepy, and every time I tell him to stop he just acts like we can't take a joke. 

I thought about reporting him to the school or even the police, but have hesitated each time I was about to do so. For context, he's an international student who's been in the US for over a year now, which in his country means that if he goes back he'll have to start over with his academics. I've looked into it and I'm quite certain if I report him he's almost guaranteed to get deported. That's a problem for me because his roommate, who's a good friend of mine, will have to take on the rent alone, which is a huge financial strain for him. But most importantly I don't want to ruin someone's life because they made some shitty jokes and don't know where the boundaries are. 

A few days ago his roommate sent me an audio file of him again saying all those creepy things and this time with a new line about how he's gonna knock me out so that he can do stuff to me because I've stopped going anywhere near him altogether unless there's others present. Again, I'm certain this is supposed to be a joke because he doesn't have the upper body strength to make a five year old cry, but I also can't seem to explain to him that these jokes are making me really really uncomfortable and get him to stop. 

I really don't know what the right move is here. He lives in the same building as me so it's not like I can just avoid him altogether. I also really soundly want to see him deported unless he really meant every word he said, which I have no way of knowing.

772,"As the title says, I'm a Masters student pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I love CS - programming, problem solving, technology in general - I have a really strong passion for the field. Now, as much as I like the field, I've come to find that I absolutely hate certain aspects of it, namely the theory-heavy portions involving statistics, math etc. I have a terrible grasp on those subjects (but I know it's also the foundation of CS...). 

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I'm currently a year into my Masters degree. At my university, we typically do 1 year of courses followed by 1 year of thesis research. I'm currently 3 months into my thesis research on a topic that my supervisor assigned to me and I absolutely hate it. I find the topic he has given me to be unoriginal and not impactful in any way and on top of that, lots of existing work is already out there; work that I feel I would never be able to improve upon because 1) it involves advanced understanding of machine learning, statistics, math etc. and 2) it's just not a subject I'm passionate about and I feel demotivated every time I think about it... As I said, I am 3 months in and I have literally made no progress. My supervisor suggested I read up on papers and attempt to reproduce their work but lack of resources, available source code, and theoretical understanding has made this incredibly hard. I also feel that my supervisor is not that invested in me as I'm fully funded externally (I'm essentially a free worker for him).

I'm now at a crossroads with regards to what to do - a part of me really wants to drop this degree...I'm already working fulltime at a job I love and doing this degree parttime.

Many of them have filled in for my absences while I attended classes and generally have been very encouraging about me pursuing a higher education. Alternatively, I've also thought of suggesting a new research topic but I can't think of anything original...

I told my (ex)friend at the time and told her what I felt and what he did. She listening to ever word and it was nice to tell someone. Around two years later, she is dating him. I had very conflicting feelings. I still was getting over him so I didn’t really like him at the time, however, when it came to her, I tired my best to support her in her first relationship(because she had a pretty bad rep when it came to guys). 

This is where it all started. I, another friend, and she wanted to do a “girls night” and me wanting to see her and show her my support for her new relationship. Once I got to her house, everything seemed fine, we were talking about jobs until our third member got there. Once she did, we all went to the pool. At the pool it was mainly our third member and her talking and me making some comments here and there, until we asked her a question. She starting talking about unrelated things to the question like, past mistakes, her have sex with my ex, and more really personal “you should not be telling other people” stuff. After saying all that she then finally answered the question. 

Fast tracking a bit, we are at her house again and she is texting him or he texted her, I don’t know. After she was done texting, she looked m in the eye and in a low Tone, “I’m going to a breakfast date with (name)”. She said this a few times while looking at me in the eyes. 

That’s pretty much the main thing but I’ll put the other things down here:
-trying to make her a bigger person (physically)
-telling me that her dogs hate me
-refusing to offer food to me and my spouse 
-making sure I can’t hear a movie I was trying to watch
-making out in front of me and everyone everywhere

I know this is really long and probably really dumb but this has been on my mind for over a year now. I just don’t understand why she would do that out of the blue. I am very hurt and angry at what she is doing. She was my friend, I listened to whenever she was down and everything. I don’t know how to handle her from now on  and I don’t know how to deal with this.

788,"I live in Canada (Ontario). I work at a fast food restaurant that’s part of a small chain. I’m supposed to get paid minimum student wage because I’m 17. The thing is, I’ve been working at this place for over a month and have worked more than 50 hours and my boss still hasn’t paid me. We are supposed to get paid bi-weekly and I haven’t been paid once. They owe me around $700 at this point. I’ve asked multiple times about pay and shed to be paid but they just make excuses or have explanations. I’ve been told twice that I’d be paid next week and it never happened. My manager says it’s the owner that’s in charge of pay checks and I’ve never met him but I have his phone number. I messaged him once asking when I’d be paid and he said “Thursday, tomorrow”. I never got paid that day. I asked the manager and she said something about the office closing and that she’d ask him Monday (she didn’t or I didn’t hear anything). I don’t know what to do, I need new glasses and I have no coverage, I’m deadass broke.

789,"I saw a neurologist for my migraines, and she gave me some medication that helped me. However, the one visit alone cost me hundreds of dollars under my high deductible plan. She wants me to come in again in order to renew the medication (and I suspect will want to have me do this many times in the future because doctors tend to be rent-seekers).   


Is there a cheaper way than seeing a neurologist to just get the prescriptions set to refill? For my anti-depresents, the fee ends up running me only $25 every year or so, so I'm guessing there's a cheaper alternative out there for this too. I don't currently have a primary physician, but is the best option just to get one, tell them what medication the other doctor prescribed, and ask them to renew that prescription?

Now my sister hides her face from him ( religious things) and my X is married to the guest's sister, however they r on the verge of divorce and they havent met for 2 years.

Despite this, they are well bonded. We have a dog cam and when no one is home, they snuggle each other when they sleep. I’ve even given the older one a bath before, which she is afraid of, and the younger one licked her face for comfort.

I have a problem with my best freind (we've known each other for 2 years). Recently he found his path, (being gay). I was fine with it, and it didn't really bother me until he started making nasty jokes towards me. Keep in mind that I'm straight and live in an area full of homosexuals. Me and my freind talk together over the internet (PS4). 

Me and my freind were playing minecraft and we were joking around and playing mini games. Until we went into my world and he placed a sign in front of me saying, ""I got feelings for you."" I have been thinking about my sexuality and how maybe I could be bisexual. None of the Less it still shocked me and I  couldn't tell him anything yet. I couldn't think straight, the whole overwhelmed me which enabled me to give him a response.

803,"I know most of us are hard on ourselves and we all go through times where we feel like we fail at everything. I've been going through this for what feels like a year now and I don't know how to stop feeling this away or have some sort of success. I'll start from when I felt like this. A year ago whenever I graduated from high school I knew I wasn't going to attend college after that for personal reasons and I still don't plan on going to any schools as of now. I decided not to walk the line because of issues I had with the school and I didn't want to walk the line for a school that I felt didn't treat me and many others fairly so I made that decision for myself to not walk the line. I remember my girlfriend at the time was sad and annoyed with me for my decision. Throughout the night classmates and teachers kept on questioning my decision and made me feel like I had failed them even though I know I owed them nothing I still felt that sense of failure. Especially from my family, I felt that sense of failure from them. This only happening a year ago it's still something that sits heavy on my mind. A few weeks later I started working on my own clothing brand and I made all my designs by hand and spent a two weeks getting everything together and what not but it failed. There could've been a lot of reasons why it failed, maybe because I didn't have enough friends to support me with them and the ones I did have didn't seem to care about it, whatever the reasons were, it all came back to me, it failed because of me, I didn't do enough. I was also making music and it's still something I do but I don't release any of it anymore. No matter how much I shared my music it would rarely get any plays and I know I'm not the greatest artist ever but just getting one play was a difficult task. Again I feel like I failed. Then the moment I fell apart and I'm still struggling to come back from was when she ended things with me. I know I had my flaws and wasn't very happy and maybe it was for the best but I feel like everything I did didn't matter or was wrong because she said so and I didn't have any say. According to her she never messed up and I was the one at fault. I flew to her to try to make things work but even then my efforts weren't enough, I wasn't enough and I still feel that way. She seems to be having a lot of success and happiness now which I'm glad she is but to think I was what held her back makes me feel so incredibly bad. I failed the one person I thought I'd always have, I simply wasn't enough. I lost her and a lot of friends in the process. All those other times that I felt like I failed I was able to get back up and keep trying, but now I just can't get up. I don't know how to get out of this hole I'm in and I feel like it gets worse everyday. I've lived my hometown all my life but now it doesn't feel like my home, I feel like everyone here is an enemy of sorts. I'm afraid to go out somewhere because I don't want to see those people. I think I'll end up moving in a year or so because I can't stay here any longer because I feel like I'll get worse if I stay here.

808,"So I’m 21, and I’ve had a few jobs throughout the years, but all of them have been seasonal and easy to land. 

When I was in high school I helped my mom out at the practice she worked for, and because I was her daughter I never had a real interview, one day I went in and basically just started working there. I worked at that job on school breaks until I went away to university. During my first year at university I didn’t worry about getting a job because my parents wanted me to focus on my education, but after my second year I felt that I needed to get some real job experience and started my search. In my second year at uni I got a job at our bookstore, and there wasn’t really an interview for it. I applied for the job online and was invited for an “interview” that wasn’t actually an interview, but rather a meeting where a group of us went in to fill out some forms so we could start working. I worked that job until my final semester when I needed to get an internship to finish up my degree. So, I applied for an internship at this non profit and it was not hard to get, at all. There wasn’t an interview for this internship, all I had to do was fill out an application, get a background check, and complete my orientation. 

All of these jobs were easy enough, but what they all have in common that has led to me feeling at a disadvantage is none of them have required a real interview. That hasn’t been a bad thing for me in the past, but now that I’m looking for a more “adult” job I know that I’m going to have to do interviews, and it just makes me anxious. To paint a picture of how anxious interviews make me, I actually had to do an interview for one of the grad programs I applied to, and I did terribly at it. It took me too long to answer the questions, I asked for clarity multiple times, and I choked over my words throughout the entire interview. I just couldn’t seem to get my head straight and it was an awful experience. I ended up not getting accepted into that school, and I feel that it is due to my lack of interview skills.

Anyways, I’m about to start a Master’s program at a school that didn’t require me to interview before being accepted, and I want a job so I can sustain life, but also have something to fill up my days when I’m not in my classes. I’ve looked into working at learning centers and I even had an interview at one of them, but unfortunately things didn’t work out because of the schedule of my classes. Another thing with that interview is that the people interviewing me included a family friend and her boss, so the entire time the family friend was vouching for me, but during the interview her higher up kept telling me that I was shy and I “needed to break out of that.” Anyways I was still offered the position, but I truly feel that it’s because I know someone who knew someone. 

I just feel that me being quiet is often seen as a weakness, and I am unsure of how to overcome that. I’m a very strong person on paper, in emails, and even on the phone. I know I can present myself strongly in certain situations, but something about being face to face with another person while they’re asking tricky questions just gets to me. I really need help because I want to be well rounded and viewed as such. I know I am a hard worker, but it takes me a while to get comfortable. I guess what I want to know is how do I change myself to not be so anxious? How do I make myself comfortable (or at least fake it) when I’m in an uncomfortable situation? How do I get hiring managers to hire me when I’m a quieter applicant than others? 

TLDR: I have very minimal experiences with the interview process and I get anxious when I think about having to complete interviews. I’ve applied to a few jobs, but thinking about having to complete an interview makes me not want to apply to jobs at all. I feel that my anxiety, quiet demeanor, and “ shyness are all holding me back and I don’t know how to overcome them so I can actually get a job.",24Jul2019,1
809,"So last night I picked up a less then trustworthy sexual partner and do to the fact that music was  being played I told her my passcode for my phone. I then fell asleep and after I woke I checked my safari history to see several shopping sites with expensive items in the trolley and an unfamiliar after pay account being used. 
I think she could of linked the account to my phone number and debit card and made the purchases on this shadow account which I don’t know the email to. I immediately disabled my card and called my bank who told me that hadn’t been any sign of fraud and that my card had been locked all day. I fear that even though everything looks fine there’s going to be huge payments looking for me in two weeks when the initial payment is due. So if anyone’s got a better idea than me about what I’m potentially in for, and if the debit card can be connected to two seperate after-pay accounts at once, I would love to hear.

811,"So I (F26) and my oldest friend (F26) are drifting apart. I’m not really surprised as we’ve clearly been growing apart for a long time... but we met when we were 9 and on our way to sleepover camp, so it’s really really hard to step back and not think about this person. I grew up with a lot of drama in my family life and was admittedly awful at socializing for a long time and now that I’ve worked through a lot of those issues and have a stronger sense of self worth (yay therapy!), I’m seeing all the ways this person has let me down as a friend regularly and rarely follows through with literally anything, including as a general support system, and constantly invalidates not only my future goals but also the very real struggles that she’s literally seen me go through.

We met at sleepover camp (in our first year, on the bus going there) and never lived in the same city (except for briefly for about 2 years put together), so I’m used to reaching out and being long distance friends... I have no first cousins, so she was the closest person in my age range that I had to extended family. Now that I have a better perspective on healthy friendships and a more supportive friend network, I’m seeing how far from true that is, but it doesn’t change how I feel about the past and friendship we created together for literally 17 years of my life.

812,"I was going to post this on r/AITA, but after talking it over with my sibling, I thought it would probably be best to ask for advice. I get the feeling that I would be seen as asking for attention/validation if I posted it there, which is not the case at all. My sibling suggested that I post my situation on an advice subreddit instead of AITA, which after consideration seemed like a good idea. 

This is what I've written; what I'm requesting is how I should handle this situation (as in whether I should go through with my feelings or to ignore them and listen to my mother).

.

This post is probably going to be confusing (and long), so if anything needs to be cleared up, let me know and I will gladly do so. (I apologize for the formatting)

So the basics (or I guess a sort of TL;DR): my mother's not the best and doesn't really treat me well. My friend's family treats me like a second child and they support me and like me, or at least tolerate me. My mother hates my friend's family, and frequently tells me that she doesn't like them. My friend's family isn't exactly fond of my mother either. I've been thinking about considering my friend's family as my actual family, but I feel horrible about this (due to my mother's feelings). I'd like to know if I would be an asshole if I went through with this.

So. I (now 17F) started to live with my mother around 7 years ago, and ever since she got custody of me, I think she's been abusing/neglecting me. She's yelled at me, called me names, threatened to kick me out, and has overall been very hostile towards me. We do have good moments, but they're short-lived. She went to go see a boyfriend and was gone for a week, leaving me and my sibling at home with not that much food (I stayed with a relative once they found out) and she's told me I'm the reason she wants to commit suicide. 

I hate her because of all of this. I can't believe that someone can treat someone else like this and can actually get away with it. 

Now I'm not saying I'm the best child and ""she does all of this while I do nothing!!!"". Because of unresolved issues involving my childhood, I'm an angry person and I yell a lot. I do tend to talk back to her, and because of this we scream at each other a lot (around once a week, maybe less). I'm currently in therapy trying to overcome this, and I'm also seeing a psychologist and taking medication. I feel that other than the anger/backtalk, I'm a pretty good kid. I don't do drugs, I do pretty well in school, and I tend to treat others with respect. I don't exactly treat my mother well because of things she's done in my childhood and because of the way she's treated me while she's taken care of me (I'm a bitter/petty person, as you can see), and I'm trying to fix this.

But anyway, onto my situation. I became friends with a girl (I'll call her Marie) in late 2017 through a mutual friend. We quickly became good friends, and now we're pretty much inseperable. We've helped each other through a lot of problems, and we have a lot of common interests. I used to go over to her house all the time, and because of that, I've gotten to know her parents pretty well. They've been nothing but nice to me, and they often offer to take me and Marie out to go watch a movie, eat, shop, etc. They've also helped me when I was scared; when they had a disagreement in public and saw me shut down and cry (due to flashbacks of my childhood), they apologized and we all promptly left and went home to chill and calm down. When they heard about me not having that much food at home, they gave me a bunch of bags full of food so that I would be good for the rest of the month. When the power went out at my house, they let me spend the night and took me and Marie to school the next day.

They've even offered to let me go on a week-long beach trip with them (fully paid)! However, once they heard about my anxiety about being in an unfamiliar place and being scared that my dad would find me, they thought it would be best to not let me go. It was a mutual understanding; there's no hard feelings between me and them.

I can't say the same for my mother. Once she found out I wasn't going, her opinion of them soured and she told me that I wasn't allowed to hang out with them anymore. I was eventually allowed to spend the weekend with Marie, but only because I had ordered tickets for a movie a month prior to the beach situation. I've been allowed to go over there since then; the only thing I hear from my mother is that she doesn't trust Marie's parents and that ""if they hurt you again, don't come crying to me. You'll see I'm right, ConflictedTrashcan.""

I've been told by Marie and her parents that I'm welcome anytime and that it's always a pleasure to have me over. I honestly can't thank them enough for what they've done for me. I've thought about making her parents stickers that say ""best honorary mom"" and ""best honorary dad"", but I think that'd be overstepping my boundaries. I love them as though they're my actual family.

This part right here isn't exactly connected to the issue, but it adds to my feelings as to why I like Marie's family. I was doing a mental health assessment with a specialist (I don't know what to call her, basically she's a sort of social worker that can come to a school if a student's feeling suicidal), and when she asked me who I could trust the most (as in an adult), I said Marie's mom. Ever since my mother found out, she's said some things that don't feel very good. She said to me ""well why don't you move in with them, since you like them so much?"" and one time while dropping me off at Marie's house, she said ""have fun with your adopted family!"". Once Marie's family heard about those remarks, her mom said ""well we do have a guest bedroom... that could be her bedroom!"" and ""I ought to just pick up ConflictedTrashcan and bring her over here... but I won't because I think that could be considered kidnapping"", while her dad said ""the best thing ConflictedTrashcan needs to do is to get away from that woman. I know I shouldn't say that, but my goodness.""

I've been thinking about all of this for a while, and I don't know if I'd be doing the right thing if I treated Marie and her parents as my actual family. While I do hate my mother, she's the only one I have. The only things that are holding me back are the nice moments we have had, as well as the fear of her guilt-tripping me and getting pissed at me.

.

That's it (except for a WIBTA question at the end). I've been conflicted about my feelings and I honestly don't know what to do anymore. Any help/advice is appreciated, and thank you for your time.",24Jul2019,2
813,"Hey.. This is my first post on reddit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I feel like I'm..... a walking dead. To give you a bit of background, I was a good, hardworking kid in my high school years. I was an A+ student and was steadfast and hardworking, during the second half of my gr 12 year I've become more laidback.. skipping classes and not handing in assignments, things that I've never done before. I felt rebellious. On the last day of high school most of the graduating students felt excited, but at the same time sad that they have to leave it all behind. Meanwhile I was finishing up my overdue English homework.... on the last day. Nevertheless I was still able to attain a high enough grade to get into the Faculty of Engineering. 

Once in university I begin to turn back to the old me once again, doing well in the first half of the semester... but then for some reason... I just got tired of university life and said.... fuck it. I was tired most of the day, wandering through the hallways to get to my next class like a soulless skeleton. the same goes for the second semester. At the end of the year I finished with the minimum grade possible to stay in the faculty...and VWed(Voluntary Withdraw) two of my classes, right now I'm taking Calculus 2 one of the class that I VWed. 

I've become lazy and started to avoid responsibilities. I now sit in a room all day and just go on youtube mindlessly. I've tried changing but... it just seems like I don't have the energy to change anymore. Even just thinking about changing seems like a huge effort that I'm not willing to undertake. I'm somehow comfortable with this loser-like state that I'm in. Deep down, I know this is not the way to live life, I know that I'm not gonna get anywhere if I'm like this... But I'm putting it into action.

Second year is about to start and I don't want to be like this anymore..... I don't know what to do.....please help.",24Jul2019,2
815,"I posted about 10 or so days ago in AITA about the situation and why I ultimately decided against attending my partner’s sister’s baby shower. I thought she would understand but I think she’s trying to hold it against me. You can look at my post history to see the baby shower dilemma if it’s necessary. 

Anyways! The mother-to-be set up another event to “celebrate her and her partner bringing another life into the world.” Tbh, isn’t that what a baby shower is for?? She also put in the description that it was to celebrate my partner’s (her brother’s) birthday as well. She also added “no excuses and no forgetting.” So I kinda feel like that was taking a shot at me for skipping her shower. She also texted my partner asking if I was actually gonna come to this event. If she’s gonna be petty like that towards me then I don’t even know if I want to go.

820,"Growing up, I kinda always knew but I never realized that it was actually thought it was bad enough to worry about because, as far as I could tell, everyone else I knew was in a similar boat. Then around a year ago I found out that (in their opinions. I don't wanna start a discussion on this) spanking and being hit once is enough. Thanks again to the new series of strangers l things, I found out that I was abused even more and again when I told my friends about the time my Dad almost made me eat my own vomit at the dinner table. 

I've been looking at stuff online and everyone keeps talking about how certain things trigger them, like a certain sound or smell that reminds them of the abuse. The closest I have is struggling to hear people yelling at eachother (idk what it's like when I'm yelled at anymore. It hasn't happened in a long time) but I always chalked that up to my parents divorce a few years back and not the abuse.

So now I don't know what to do with myself. I'm planning on getting therapy when I go to uni in September, but I don't know what else I can do, if anything. I feel like I have to do something, because this is kinda eating me up inside, but I have no clue what I can do.",24Jul2019,1

During the course I did the typical ""looking at her and then quickly looking away"" thing but she caught me a couple of times and I smiled to her when that happened and she smiled back, I kinda feel like she did it just to be kind though.

So, what can I do? I probably should mention that part of the course was a field trip and well, we didn't have bathrooms so we ended up talking about literal shit without any shame a couple of times, yet I find her intimidating enough to get nervous about sending her a text.",24Jul2019,1

Every year her niece who’s 15, (I am 21) comes into town to spend the whole week with her. She will take her shopping, to the movies, theme parks etc. My friend asked me if I would like to go to a movie with them the day her niece comes in and has hinted in the past she wanted me to try and take her out to do activities during the day while she is at work. I feel a little awkward about hanging out with her niece because it’s a reminder than I’m not truly family and I’m jealous that this young girl has extended family that actually cares about her. This is obviously caused tensions with my friend because she wants the two of us to bond so we I can take her out to do stuff while my friend works. I don’t think it’s necessarily fair to have to entertain her niece the entire week while she works. She invited her down again this summer, not me. Yes, I obviously have a jealousy issue and don’t want to share this person who I’ve claimed as my mother/aunt but I’m really trying to find some advice to help me be less threatened by the situation and coexist with her “real” niece peacefully and be able to enjoy her company to avoid alienating my friend.",24Jul2019,1

1. We live an hour away from each other.
2. She lives with her ex-boyfriend for the next year (she signed a lease with him as a roommate, then she decided to date him, then she broke up with him only a few weeks after moving in; they've been broken up around a month now).
3. Her ex-boyfriend hates me (he thinks she broke up with him for me), won't allow me in their apartment, and constantly pesters her about me.
4. I am still dependent on my parents right now (I'm fresh out of college and job hunting), and my mom is not a fan of this girl and my dad thinks I should not get into a serious relationship right now with *anyone*.

Because of this messy situation, I figured I eventually need to have a conversation with her about this not being the right time to enter into a serious relationship with one another.

1 - Attend the university of Alabama in roughly 3 weeks. Almost all of my high school friends are going there, I've already accepted a bid to a fraternity and everything. Do another 4-5 years of school that I really don't want to do.  


2 - Stay home and work for my dad, help him with opening his business, start making some serious money. Be around to help with my mom who has some health issues, don't know how long she'll be around. Start trying to make content on the new call of duty coming out soon in my free time, as gay as it sounds I've always loved the game and want to play competitively. Would give me something to do in my free time and I really enjoy it.  


I'm so torn on this, my friends will all be leaving and my girlfriend is already in college 2 hours away. I feel like if I stay I might end up being really lonely and just feel like I'm missing out. On the other hand I start making good money, get to be with my mom, and can try to become a content creator, (youtube vids, streaming, I know this isn't easy) but it's something I've always wanted to try.

826,"So basically I have a problem and I thought the best place to for advice is good ol’ Reddit. I’ll try and give a hopefully short summary of my problem and what I am to do about it and if anyone has an opinion/advice in regards to what I should do than that will be heaps appreciated.

So I am an only child (15-m) being raised by a single mother and in the past our relationship has ranged from ok to very good. Although I did notice in the past that she had a shorter temperament I chalked that up to just the everyday stress of being a single parent.
However, in the past year and a bit she has developed a somewhat serious physical medical condition and along with that she has also become much more prone to angry outbursts and bouts of hysteria. These have progressively increased along with her becoming more threatening and aggressive towards me and the only other close member of our family, my grandmother (her mother). This behaviour has lead to her threatening to throw me out of the house, saying how horrible I am as a child, saying I should’ve gone with my father (an alcoholic who left our family), etc. She’s also repeatedly insulted my grandmother, told her she was a useless mother,etc,as well as threatening to stop helping her with some errands (she doesn’t speak good english so she needs help with certain admin tasks).In addition there have been occasions where she has broken glassware and decorations in anger . Furthermore, she has started saying things such as, “I regret being born”, “ It seems you don’t need me cause I’m so horrible”, “It’d be easier for you if I just went”, etc. Most of these and other borderline suicidal suggestions have come after my suggestion that she visit a psychologist or counsellor.  

So that’s my problem and as I mentioned above I’ve tried up to now to solve it by suggesting to her that she visit a psychologist,etc. Whilst the first two times I suggested it she seemed somewhat apologetic about her actions and open to the idea now she has rejected it outright. Up to now I have also generally ignored her behaviour until it ceded and hoped that she would change but I see now that is not the case. I see three options out of this: 
1) I can see if it goes away as she begins treatment for her illness and just wait it out.
2) I can try and find some resources on mental health helplines and organisations for her and see what they suggest.
3) I can contact the government child services department and report her behaviour- but this would be an absolute last resort for me as that could lead to a tipping point for her mentally and possibly the loss of custody over me  and as much as I want to have some peace I still love her deeply and I don’t want this end badly for her.

P.S I know I said it was going to be short and I’m really sorry but I’d be very appreciative of any suggestions on what to do folks :)",24Jul2019,1

829,"I’m sure plenty of you are familiar with Omegle (the randomized video website) and where this is going...

I got naked on Omegle a few months ago, barely showing my face (I was 18 at the time) and at the end of the video session, the guy told me it would be posted to PH, XHamster, and another site exclusively for Omegle Porn Captures. I didn’t really care TOO much as my face wasn’t really ever shown. (It did for one second but my room was dark)

Anyways, I searched frantically on those sites and a couple towns trying various tags like “Omegle porn” etc for months, and finally found a video of myself on one of them last week. So I have two questions.

1.) I do not really care if the video is ever taken down (my face is hardly shown) anyways...if I were to message this particular porn sites mods, would they likely take it down? Would I need to send any evidence that’s it’s me?

2.) what I found disturbed me. I found a website of “Omegle Porn” that *seems* legal. It has a disclaimer claiming everyone is verified to be 18+ (Although that’s not possible as they’re Omegle recordings) that being said, while MOST looked 18 or around that age, a decent amount seemed they could plausibly appear younger, like 15 or so. My question is *how* in the world these sites remain legal? The site has a very straightforward url and name, and it appears as a first result in BOTH Google *and* Bing. I know those engines do a good job of removing illegal pornography, but are Omegle videos not included for some reason? Why???",24Jul2019,1
830,"So about a year and a month ago, i figured out how to make my car make a cool noise by disconnecting a line from the turbo. it makes a little whooshy noise. My friend wanted me to try it on his car, and he told me to disconnect a line. I pulled on it and the line broke. We laughed it off and he said it was no big deal. I gave him my number and told him if its broken i can pay for it. 

Just a few days ago, he texted me asking me if i was the guy who broke his mini cooper. Then he texted me that he wanted to hang out sometime. He then called me, and told me that he was getting his car serviced and that they could not do it because of the broken line, and told me that it would be $870 dollars to fix, mostly because of labor. I seriously do not believe him, mostly because it has been a year since this has happened. I've called the dealership he said he was taking it to, but they can not give me a price. I seriously do no think close to 900 dollars should be the price for a broken hose that was broken a year ago. What should i do?

He had been in there for a while, and sometimes he smokes in there so I asked. It's the only shower in the house and I spent the whole day up until then cleaning. He yelled, said this was ""his time"" to shower, and that we should all know that because he gets home from work around 2 (i asked him at about 4:15). I then apologized, said I had been cleaning and that I was kinda gross (reeked of spray cleaner, sweaty, etc.) But that I asked because I could wait if he was. He cut me off, said he ""didnt want to hear it"" and proceeded to tell me every time I've ever inconvenienced him or been a bitch. Hes been accusing me of doing things I havent done, saying I always am a burden like this, etc. I had had enough and said I had shit to do, so I went to leave and he said that I ""only work 3 days a week so I'm not even busy"".

I keep trying to explain things to him but no matter when I bring it up, or how calm he is if I try, he will talk right over me and not listen, and use whatever I say to attack me. I could tell him how much work I have to do to pay for college, not even the essays and papers I have to prepare otherwise I wont even be able to start in the spring. I've been walking on eggshells with him for months. I dont even think he would listen if I screamed it. He would just see me as a crazy female. Hes made it clear how he sees females (not that it matters here, but since I'm a female I'm seen differently and cant be ""equal"")

He does this all the time. He admits he has anger issues, been when shown where he might be over reacting he just wont accept it. It makes him more mad. My dad wont do anything, he just says ""he should be moving out soon"" but my brother plans on staying a while. My mother isnt in the picture.

839,"Title might be weird, but really that is my question. After some bad relationships, I realized that I have some unsolved issues, which might go way back in my childhood. I did not get enough affection as a kid so in my romantic relations, I would always be too needy, clingy, crave attention and affection, to the point that I could not bear being alone for a day. After realizing this, I decided to go cold turkey for a while. Which is not really happening to be honest, cause me and my ex are seeing each other sometimes as we are still good friends.

However, I stoped using Tinder or any other means of finding a date, stopped flirting and everything as I think I want to understand myself first.  On the other hand, I am thinking how can I get better at being in a relationship if I am not in one? So would it be better to try something casual with someone just to learn to become better at it? 

Last ‘relationship’ I had (one week) ended really bad as could not accept that the guy would not hang out with me one evening. After, I told myself that I will learn these things, as I know what I am doing wrong.

841,"I started water polo about 6 years ago. I was never big into sports and never a competitive guy but my dad wanted me to play the sport he loved so much because he thought I would love it and it helps me get in shape. While it did get me in shape, I hated every minute. I started to excel in the sport as I was signed up for training through Olympic development programs and club training. While the practices and games brought me a few friends, it has always felt like I have had no life outside of water polo, all the talks I would have with my dad were him just telling me what to do different to improve on the next game or practice. Sometimes he would talk for more than 2-3 hours at a time on an aspect of polo and I couldn’t get out of the conversation without him taking it as disrespect. I have been denied opportunities to go to parties, go see my friends, or even see my girlfriend on her last day in California because I had a tournament then next day and I had to be well rested and focused on the game. All this led to resentment of the sport and occasional darker thoughts as I felt like the feeling of emptiness would never stop. Luckily these thoughts have mostly dissolved but my feelings for the sport have not changed. Later on I got offered a full ride for water polo at a d1 university. Here the water polo team is the big sport on campus and all the athletes on the team live and breathe and water polo, and the coach is very hard-nosed and treats his players as if he was a drill instructor, which I do not respect or admire at all. I’ve talked to my parents about how I feel that my experience in college will be miserable due to these factors but they just keep saying it would be an incredible disappointment and a huge waste and shame if I were to throw away this gift I was given for water polo, and I also feel like I cannot turn down this scholarship for both my parents and myself. I just want to know what to do,  to play and try to find happiness or just cut it off now, or any other options?  It all seems like a lose-lose. Any and all advice is incredible appreciated.

842,"I'm 19 (M) and I've been wearing prescription glasses my entire life. My glasses (the actual glass pieces to be exact) keep getting scatched everyday (slightly but surely) and I don't know how. I'm trying my best to keep glass portions from getting into physical contact with anything else. I don't put them on table, I don't touch them, moreover, I even have a specific glass stand on which I put my glasses everyday before I go to sleep. Yet somehow they keep getting scratched. 

Even thought I don't have any problems with vision while wearing them I still find it very irritating and frustrating. My previous pair of glasses (which I've had for around 3 years) became scratched to the point where sometimes using them was a problem. I didn't get a new pair until the old one literally broke in half (because glasses are expensive in general) while I was cleaning them (I guess the shaft was too loose, I don't know for sure so don't ask). Now that I got a new pair (which I've had for over 3 months) I started taking care of it more than the previous pair but I guess all efforts are pointless.

So the question. These glasses are quite scratched now, so how do I prevent my glasses from getting scratched more? And how do I prevent my glasses from getting scratched at all in the future?

843,"To clarify, I never have and never would steal from a person or their home.

A few months back, I stayed over at a good friend's house (we'll call her Alex). A few days later, she told me she had 25 pound go missing from her safebox on the phone. Her stepdad had also been over who recently broke up with her mum (she thinks it was him now, but she didn't then), or she said she could have miscounted, whatever. I felt like she would have thought it was me, because who wouldn't in a situation like that? It was literally only me and her there. I kept asking if anyone else had been over, if she thought any of her family would do it, etc etc.

Then about a week later, I went shopping with her and her mum, and the money was brought up. Her mum was going through her purse and when it was mentioned looked right at me really quickly (or maybe I was just being paranoid). This is a family who do a lot for me. I hate the idea they might think I just fucking steal from them. 

A few days ago, I went to a party with Alex and some of our other friends. Today, one of them mentioned they'd had 10 pound go missing, and was wondering if any of us had picked it up.

845,"My parents divorced when I was about 3 years old and ever since, my mom has raised myself and my sister without much help from my dad til I was around 13... he’s been out of the picture since I was 13. 

My mom is one of my favorite people. But she is SO dramatic. Ever since I started growing up, she’s gotten harder to deal with. The older I get the more she seems to treat me like a baby.. for example, I was dating two guys, one for 2.5 years at age 17/18, and another for 1.5 years at age 20/21, she would constantly call me and yell at me to come home and stop spending so much time with them because she needed me to help at home. I’d come home and she was fine and there was nothing to do. She always wanted them to pay for me, never half and half. Never wanted me to stay over event though my sister, who is younger(19), could do what she pleases for the most part..

So there’s some background.. now, something WAY more important.  I am 22 years old, just graduated college (first in the family) and finishing up a full time internship with a minor league team that I have interned for as a game day for 2 other seasons. I have amazing experience in sports. I have come so far from being a shy person who was scared of everything, to being out going and performing during the games, calling, and approaching people. This internship means the world to me. It has gotten me multiple interviews and gave me the chance to travel to other stadiums to interview. I have been doing this and college to get somewhere and make something of myself. 

I will most likely need to move. There is absolutely nothing 30 minutes or less around my home that is hiring. Ive looked for hours. I sit at my current job looking on websites like indeed and can’t find anything. So I tell my mom, I need to move. She doesn’t want to hear it. All I get is a lecture on how rent is expensive (not like I can’t find cheaper rent or a roommate). I get told about bills, food, gas, everything. I understand this. I do. But my mom is going to run me dry by making me stay here. I have a part time job that will help me save, but not much.... and what I want to work for is hiring now. I also need a new car, and have money to use for a loan. She knows this and tells me “you need a car” but then goes about buys stuff for me to get my car fixed rather than just get a new car....

We got in a heated argument last night about me looking for jobs. I would mention ones around here and to her they’re “bad” or not good enough. So I mention moving and she doesn’t want that. I know she wants me safe and secure, but she fucked up with money and now it’s holding me back. We live with my grandparents because of it, and they make my life hard too.. 

 I don’t want to end up like her financially. Which is why I’m working so hard. My internship pays shitty, and my hours suck, but it is helping me find jobs all over the country. I told her it isn’t me just thinking I know what I’m doing, I’m getting this advice from people her age and older at work. She refuses to help me with money for moving because she doesn’t have it either. Even if I say a job will help me, she says “no it’s not a good idea.” I’m so scared and confused on what to do.

847,"Hello, I’m 19(F) and things seem to be getting increasingly more overwhelming, and I could really use some advice on what to do or words of encouragement.
I am going into my second year at a university, and I am using loans to help me. My family does not have the money to support me (which is fine) and although the debt doesn’t usually bother me (because you know, everyone has debt) it’s starting to get to me. Everyone talks about student debt like it ruins your whole life, like I am doomed to go bankrupt, hate existing, etc. 
Yesterday I wrecked my car. It isn’t totaled but the other person’s car might be, and I am technically at fault because she had the right of way (she was speeding, it was a parking lot and I didn’t see her). Accidents happen but now my insurance is about to sky rocket, and i have to pay $1000 deductible to get my car fixed. My dad has me on his car insurance, which I’m super thankful for, but I think he’s going to remove me from it and I’m freaking out. I use my car for everything, primarily getting to my job which is decently far (hour and a half during the summer, it’ll be closer when I’m back at school) and I NEED the job for rent this year. This is the first time I’ve ever had to pay rent, and as you can imagine i don’t really have the funds for an $1000 deductible. 
My parents are also moving half way across this country, which is scary to me because my mom’s alcoholism is getting increasingly worse and i don’t know if I’m ready to be far away from them. It’s why i stayed in-state for school. Her drinking is hurting their marriage, and meanwhile they are about to up and move their whole lives. It would be easier to handle if they didn’t come to me for all of it, they refuse to speak to each other in a constructive way so they pour all of it onto me. To top it off, my boyfriend is graduating soon and although we’ve talked it through I’m very nervous. I understand it’ll work out the way it’s supposed to, but it’s just another thing I have found myself worrying about. 
I have an anxiety disorder and it was under control for a while, but it’s starting to get very intense again. Things are feeling bad. Really, really bad.",24Jul2019,1

I have a lot to unpack, but the biggest struggle and the thing I want to tackle most because it really affects my day to day is my sex life. I want to talk about it in detail with him to get to the bottom of my issues so I can figure out how to have a healthy sex life with my husband once again, but I'm also afraid of being too explicit or inappropriate. Should I go to a sex specific therapist or is this okay to talk about with him? Just to be clear, the sex issue is a direct and obvious result of my trauma, so it's not like a random side effect or something.

851,"I have a friend that my wife and I have been trying to help for years try to get his life together, but at this point I am starting to no longer see the point in trying. I have known this friend almost my entire life and my wife has known him for over 10 years. At this point it has been going on for 12 years.

&amp;#x200B;

He has been complaining for years that he doesn't know what to do with his life and that people look down on him. He says he now has bipolar depression and is unmotivated all the time. We graduated high school in 2007 and he hasn't really held a job for very long since and hasn't gone to college longer than a a month. He has only had a job twice and both times it was only a couple of months and working for his parents business. He moved across the country to attend a school then dropped out. He stayed across the country for 2 years then was forced to move back by his parents. He did a 9 month trade school and managed to graduate, but now he doesn't want to use the training. I should note that his parents are paying for all of this as he has no income. I moved to another state when I graduate college and last year he moved to the same state as me, which my wife and I think it was to be closer to us. Ever since moving here he wants to hang out all the time like we use to hang out back in high school, but since he has no income he always wants to do something cheap that neither my wife or I enjoy, or he wants to know if we will help pay for him. Funny part is despite all this he somehow manages to live with a roommate, bought a new car, buys brand new video games, buys paid content on MMOs we play together, buys the latest video game consoles, etc. We use to go skeet shooting together, but I had to stop after he wouldn't buy clays or ammo because he claimed he didn't want to keep ammo at his house due to his depression despite having his shotgun at his place. His roommate has guns and ammo so that isn't a valid excuse. He owes me at least $500 on skeet shooting alone.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are thinking about cutting him out of our life at this point. We keep telling him to get job and message him places hiring that are for the trade he trained in. Every time we bring something up that may help he ignores us. We don't see it changing anytime soon unless something drastic happens. He isn't a teenager or even in his 20s anymore...",24Jul2019,2

853,"I’ve lived with the same group of friends for the past couple of years and we’ve been great together, but recently as we’ve looked at housing for the upcoming semester (we all go to college), I’ve become more and more interested in living by myself. We basically have a week left before we get evicted so we have a narrow time frame for what to do and the only realistic option for living together involves renting a house that’s expensive, cramped, scummy, and all-around awful. One of our friends though gets depressed when by herself for too long, doesn’t drive - so shopping becomes near impossible without us to drive her -, and relies on us in a sense for emotional needs. If I get the apartment by myself I’ve promised to help her as much as possible and to make sure we all still stay friends. It actually might be possible for her to live with one of the other friends in a two or even 3 bedroom apartment but that’s only a possibility. I myself face a busy year and the privacy a one bedroom apartment affords will be useful for getting ahead of the workload- not to mention I find living by myself (as weird as it sounds) something I think I’d really enjoy. So, do I have a moral responsibility for my friend’s welfare to such an extent that I can’t leave my friend group or can I live by myself at the risk of my friend’s welfare with the promise that I’ll try my best to help her as much as possible?",24Jul2019,1
854,"So a little backstory, I am a 22 year old college student studying Animation and Game Design. I thought this would be a good career path as I've always thought animation was cool and I did some 3D modeling as a hobby in high school. I am at a point in my degree that I need to have a full semester long internship with a bunch of requirements, then once I do that, I'll only have 1 more class until I graduate.

Throughout my classes here at my university, I have enjoyed maybe 1 or 2  in my required coursework. I am currently working an internship in which I work with 3D modeling and surfacing, but.... I hate it. I find myself putting off the work until the last minute because I don't enjoy it.

I am already behind due to trying to find an internship, as I was supposed to graduate May 2019 if I was to follow the 4 year plan. My parents are paying for my schooling, so extremely grateful for their generosity, and I hate the thought that I wasted these past 4 years. I have pursued various career options within my field and none of them have intrigued me, learning more about them have only steered me away from them.

I would like to think that I have an opportunity to take over my family business someday which would provide me a steady and well paying job (6 figures); however, I am scared to tell my parents how I feel and that I might just want to throw in the towel with animation and work to take over the family business eventually. I would say my parents are fairly strict and i'm afraid that they would be incredibly disappointed in me. Maybe even enough to look at me differently and see me as not good enough to take over the company eventually as they've always told me I needed to work for someone else for awhile before I could come work at the family business.

I feel like i'm lost and there isn't really a career path that I can see myself taking. A part of me wants to move home and just devote myself to learning everything about the family company, but another part of me wants a job I LOVE and look forward to going to everyday. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the rant.",24Jul2019,2

It didn’t have any desire from him just felt more like pecks.
I really enjoy this guys company and we get on so well, we’re always laughing but I don’t know if I’m sexually attracted to him or whether it was just an awkward build up.

864,"Hello all, I am in need of some help with making an important decision regarding my career and switching jobs. 

Little background: just graduated college a few months ago and have been working full time at the place I did my internship for school. Over the past 2 years I’ve become relatively important to the small business I work at but have been in a rut the past few months.  I feel as if I’m overlooked/not taken seriously/wasting my time. 

The company I work for is a small business with 3 managers and ~10 production employees.  The 2 other managers have been at the company longer but have expressed their distaste for the job as well (for other reasons).  As I said previously, I have not been enjoying my job because of how easy it’s gotten. I know a lot of the reason Is because the company is small and still growing but I’m not learning anything and feel as if I’m wasting my time. I don’t see any challenges or room for growth. The work is mundane, tedious and boring and essentially I’ve learned everything I can in my current role. 

I’ve also had the feeling over being overlooked and underpaid. We work 6 days a week but only the production workers and myself (the other two managers don’t bother to come in for whatever reason).  Yet, even after putting in more time and hard work, I still have yet to be given a fair pay, a desk, more challenging work, etc. 

My main issue is that I’m relatively close with my boss and we have a good relationship and I don’t want to see it go to waste or turn poor if I choose to leave. I’ve mentioned my feelings that I’ve expressed here multiple times and still have yet to receive more challenging work. 

The part that bugs me the most is that my boss dislikes the other two managers and constantly tells me how their days are numbered and how lazy they are, yet never confronts them about anything. All they do is sit in the office 90% of the day listening to music or on their phone. 

Is it time for me to move on or should I wait it out?  Please send help",24Jul2019,1

868,"Slightly long post; my apologies. 

I’m a 21 yo female who is lost beyond belief. I recently returned home (United States) after living abroad (Western Europe) for 6 months. 

I have made memories and friends that felt as though they could last a lifetime while I was away. It was truly the greatest period of my life so far. Because of time differences and general life happenings, being home has been a strain on my friends I left behind. 

Now that I’m home, I feel numb. I have a boyfriend of 2 years who means the world to me and is in love with me in a way I have never imagined would be possible. We have plans to move to a new state together and talk about our future often. Other than him, I have my childhood best friend. We’ve been close for 20 years and while we’ve had bad points, it’s always been clear we love each other. 
 My childhood friend and I have been drifting apart in my month home. I confronted her today about how I hate feeling as though our friendship is no longer wanted on her end. She said nothing, got out of my car, and walked away. I’m devastated and feel so alone now. 

I’ve been depressed and suicidal since I was 15 and have had very good and very bad periods of life. Since I’ve been home, it is the worst it has even been. I love my bf, but currently I feel friendless, homeless (another long story), unwanted, and suicidal. 

I do not have the money or insurance to go to a ‘mental health hospital’ to spend a week getting my mental health on track. But everyday I think about ending my life. The only reason I won’t is because I’m afraid of how my boyfriend will be if I’m successful, and if I’m not, I’ll go bankrupt from hospital bills. 

I want to get on antidepressants and possibly bipolar medications but I’m afraid of opening up to a psychiatrist and legally them having to put me in a hospital. I want a future but my thoughts are getting worse and worse and I don’t know what to do. How do I handle all of this in a structured manner? And are there resources that can prescribe a medication online? I’m too afraid to see anyone and confess how suicidal I am.

869," I recently moved out of an apartment two weeks ago. In the time being, I had most of my things boxed up in the living room ready to go. Most things were in plastic bins, but there were also cardboard boxes that held kitchen appliances and bathroom things. An old roommate informed me last night that they had found two bed bugs under the cover of the futon in the living room, one was dead, one was killed. Nothing else was found, none of my roommates have experienced any bites, we haven’t found any spots that bed bugs leave behind.

My mattress is very white, and the coffee table I had in the living room seems to be free of any bed bugs. One of my old roommates would sleep on the futon every night, so what do you think the chances of them staying only on the futon were?

I also have all new furniture for my new apartment except for my bed. I have a foam mattress, so I don’t have a box spring and I have a metal bed frame. In packing and unpacking all of my clothes, I haven’t noticed any signs of bedbugs. I'm wondering if it's possible for the bed bugs to stay confined to the futon if he was sleeping there each night.

We are having the apartment inspected tomorrow and should have the results. Should I let my new apartment complex know that I may have bed bugs, or should I wait until the bed bugs are confirmed in the old apartment?",24Jul2019,1
870,"My SIL is just unbearable. She’s dumb, she’s rude, she’s extremely socially inept, she’s got this totally undeserved arrogance, she’s annoying as fuck. When I first started dating my wife this was fine because I only had to interact with her in small doses. Also in a way this was kind of endearing because she gave off a vibe of a child who just needed some adult guidance that wasn’t her parents just telling her what to do. I figured eventually like most teenagers do that she’d grow out of it. Unfortunately now she’s in her early twenties and hasn’t matured a bit. In the spirit of trying to help her grow up a little, I got her a job with the company I work with but in a different department. 

Anyway, this was fine for a while because again it was short bursts of having to deal with her on occasion. Then about six months ago my wife and I evicted our roommate. He was just disgusting, wouldn’t clean up after himself, you could smell him around the corner and through doors and we had enough. So we ousted him and our landlord (wife’s mom, I know, bad idea, but we’re planning on buying the house from her so i thought would be fine) basically told us SIL would be moving in (she didn’t specifically say “do this or I’ll evict you” but it was STRONGLY implied). SIL was in a really bad living situation at the time so I set aside my minor annoyance with her  to do my new family a solid, and I agreed. I had some stipulations though that I made clear to my wife and SIL. I made her sign a roommate agreement that outlined them and it was signed, so I at least felt like my voice was heard. 

Over the last six months shes violated every single thing that she agreed to. She’s not helped around the house AT ALL. She’s taken up loudly singing at all hours of the day and gets FURIOUS if we tell her she needs to quiet down because she’s recording for her singing group. Her dog has destroyed several things around the house and when we’ve approached her to replace the things that he’s ruined she’s told us no. The list goes on for several more pages but suffice it to say that she’s terrible to live with. And not only that, I have to work with her too. I can’t escape her at all. She works the same hours I work. 

Currently she’s planning on moving out whenever her boyfriend moves to town (he lives across the country, but is apparently planning on moving soon but any proof of that remains to be seen). But in the mean time I need something to prevent me from losing my shit. Any advice on how to deal with her would be GREATLY appreciated.",24Jul2019,1

874,So I have a family member who has always been pretty creepy. Like hes been accused of sexually abusing animals and he was recently released from jail for molesting a kid. While he was in jail he had been asking for people to mail him pictures of weird weapons and said he changed to some weird religion ive never heard of. He refused to stay on medication and bragged about fighting the guards and causing problems on purpose. Basically he loved prison. He told his cell mate before he was released that he would ve coming back and this time it would be permanent.  He has a huge grudge against me more than the person who put him in jail because If i hadnt been trying to help the kid he messed with(long story and I didnt know what was going on until later) his sick actions would have never come to light. So hes been trying to call me non stop getting my number from other people when i change it calling over and over even though i dont answer and then block his number texting to see if i want to talk trying to add me on social media. When i went to block him on fb i saw his background picture was a picture of prison bars it really creeped me out. So would it be overreacting to want to move instead of renewing a contract to buy a house that is half paid off or am i just being paranoid?

876,"Me: a 19 year old female, currently a University student 

My problem: my crippling worry over everything.

To understand where I'm coming from, I have to give you insight on my backround: My parents are immigrants that moved to Europe before I was born. Growing up I would always watch my dad juggling 3 different jobs, not being at home, being tired all the time. At the time, I didn't understand what was going on and because my dad tried his best to always be there for me and my siblings and for example play with us, I never really knew how hard he was working to bring food on the table. After he found a well-paying job he was diagnosed with a medical condition that forced him to quit his job. Now that I am older, I can tell how hard life has been and still is for him and what he did for us. Luckily, the government supports people with low income. My dad works on his own in a small business. The government has weird financial regulations that I don't want to get into but the springing point is that over the years he sometimes had to pay thousands of euros of support he got (which we needed) back in one go. Sometimes he had to pay thousand of euros of taxes even though he had barely made any money. He gets a lot of bills and he is so burnt out that he sometimes postpones paying until they add up to a big sum he can't afford. And he tried suing and setting this straight in court but that mostly resulted in him paying for lawyers on top of his other payments. I have watched my father suffer and I could and still cannot help him.

Because of this I am terribly afraid of the future. I have a crippling fear of failure. I worry over the smallest of paper work because I am afraid that if I make a mistake, someone is going to make me pay a huge amount of money (which is unreasonable, I know). I am afraid of debt, I feel guilty spending money on myself, I feel guilty that I can't support my family and wont be able to until I graduate, I am afraid that just the smallest mistake will cost me my future, I worry that some kind of governmental institution is coming for my.

877,"For those of you who don’t know what olanzapine (zyprexa) is, it’s a medication that is used to treat schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. Unfortunately it also makes it hard to lose weight, slows downs metabolism, and makes you crave food.

I used to be on this medication. I went off of it due to a medical emergency a year ago and lost a lot of weight but due to the fact that the replacement medication was a disaster, I was put back on but on a different brand.

That short period of time when I was thin before I was but back on was the only time I ever got complements from girls. I got more than one in a day by girls all the time but to some I was also a creep, due to the fact that the new medication didn’t exactly treat hallucinations, which I have without medication.

I was put back on but as a safety precaution I was put back on on a different brand. I regained the weight and immediately no girl had ever complemented me on my looks since.

My doctor has put me on another new medication that partially sort of works BUT I’m scared I will get put back on olanzapine because I don’t know that it will kick in enough to save me. If it does, in another week I may start losing weight. If that happens then maybe I will have to worry about the health benefits of losing weight too quickly which happened to me on the second medication. But if this third new medication doesn’t work, and the only way for me not to have completely sick thoughts and hallucinations is to be on olanzapine then I’m gonna be depressed. Olanzapine slowed my metabolism down and makes me crave food and I gain A LOT of weight on it every time they put me back on immediately after I start the medication.

I just start craving food and have a very hard time with self control.

So if I have to get back on olanzapine then how can I stay thin because I’m told I am attractive when I’m thin (although I think people might just be humoring me to cheer me up because I also have depression and generalized anxiety disorder and autism which adds to the depression and psychosis).

882,"I'll try keep it short as possible. Basically, I (23F) am worried about my sister (28F) and need advice on how to, or if I should, approach her on this topic.

Having 5 years between us has led to us never having a close relationship, ever. We aren't really in each others lives, I still stay at home while shes 40 miles away. I try and message from time to time but her replies are conversation stoppers most of the time. When I see her for family occasions or when one of us visits she never seems that happy. My mum, brother and dad all feel the same and separately we have asked her if shes fine but she snaps at us. To me I feel like she is holding a grudge against us (our family) and no one knows why. Just last week I found out she was going on holiday for a week alone and maybe I'm overthinking it but it shouts red flags to me.

Thing is, I'm quite scared to approach the situation as I feel if I sat her down and asked if she was ok and suggest speaking to someone she would retaliate horribly. Over the last 12 years she has slapped/hit everyone bar my mum when she was drunk or angry. So the idea of trying to help is daunting in case she takes it badly. Also, I wouldn't want to push her further away, especially since she isnt just down the road.

Is there anyone who has been in a similar situation and can suggest what I should do? 

I will say she does have a good friendship group where she lives so I know she isn't alone and whenever I see her with friends she seems genuinely happy.",24Jul2019,1

884,"Hello. I am writing to ask whether what I think is considered homophobic and if yes, how to address it.

I grew up in a small East European country, where I never knew gay people growing up. The only way I knew about them was from television or early (for me) internet. I now think that they definitely did not portray them well. It was mostly stereotypes, weird stories on news or they wouldn't be shown at all. I also was brought to Church every sunday and attended a lecture every week at school. So, I had a long lasting belief that there was something very wrong with gay people. 

Then I started to read more. Learned English, got pc for studies and like thatthe whole new internet opened up for me. Suddenly, I started interracting with gay people more. I talked to them, though not very often, on chatrooms, read stories that weren't weird but rather heartwarming, etc. Over the time, my views morphed into what I think to this day. I fully support gay marriages, I don't feel or think weird in any way when interacting with people that I know are gay(in the beginning I did), I try and talk with my friends if they say something homophobic, etc. Well, hard to explain. I guess it's the point when I consider myself being fully supportive.

Hovewer, not long ago I was watching a series and there was a scene with gay people making out. And suddenly, I couldn't watch it anymore. I stopped it for a sec, then skipped it a bit and I felt myself kind of cringing. And now I question what I really think about it. I realised since then that I also still kind of believe in some minor stereotypes, like ""gay"" voice, and some other. I also am not sure how I would react if someone from my close circle came out. 

So, dear reddit, am I homobophic? And if yes, what advice could you give me?",24Jul2019,5
885," I’m a 24 year old woman living in Los Angeles and have over the past years grown increasingly depressed over where I live. I feel disgusted with this city, when I go for a walk I literally feel dirty after like there’s grime on my skin. There’s so many aggressive people as well and as a woman I’ve gotten in a few close call situations over the years.

 To add some context I spent a small chunk of my short life on a farm and near nature and it was probably the happiest I had been. Even after that I lived in a town for a while that was at least less urbanized. The only reason I came to LA was because this is where my family is and I have resources here. Now that I’m back I absolutely hate it. I feel like my soul is shriveling up everyday.

 My problem now is I am a student and don’t have the funds to just get up and move. In fact I’m actually quite strapped as I shelled out all my savings to help a family member. So I’m currently living paycheck to paycheck. Id ideally like to move eventually but I don’t see it being a possibility for a few years.

 I guess what I’m asking for is advice from other city folk who feel like they’re being strangled by this life as well? What do you do to feel not so claustrophobic? What are some free or extremely low cost ways to surround yourself with natural things? I know this will sound like hippy nonsense but I really do feel like this lifestyle is poison. I guess I’m just looking for coping tips for until I can get out. Also I don’t have a car at the moment so going on trips is a hassle but if it’s cheap enough I’d consider it. I currently hike about twice a week but as anyone from LA can tell you most hiking trails are filled to the brim with insta influencers and dog poo.",24Jul2019,3
886,"Okay so there’s this artist I really like. I’ve been to four of his shows in the past 4 months, and I’ve met him every time. It’s gotten to the point where he recognizes me and waves at me and smiles when he sees me. So I was really trying to not catch feelings for him, and I was always really shy (he’s shy too) so we never really spent much time together. UNTIL this last time. We hung out for a bit and the vibe was just different. There were other fans around so we couldn’t like have a deep convo but he kept trying to get my attention, and every time he’d do this he’d touch me (he never did this before and there was no reason he would need to touch me to get my attention) and when he would talk to me he’d look me in the eyes and continue touching me. Then when I showed him the Polaroid of us together he said it was cute, and when I asked him to sign it and passed him the pen our fingers touched for longer than was necessary, and he continued making eye contact. Then he asked me what I wanted him to write but we’re both awkward I couldn’t figure it out and he couldn’t think of anything and we were giggling and licking eyes again. Then I told him how I feel like I’m a total weebo when it comes to him and he teased me about the fact I thought a weebo meant a overly obsessed fan girl (which is doesn’t- thanks urban dictionary for embarrassing me) and I said well then what’s it called? And he grinned and said ‘just a fan girl’ and then he teased me again when I gave him and the other artists on tour with him this thank you note. I had asked him to give a copy to one of the artists who was still inside and he said ‘hmmm who’s that?’ (He knows who it is he was just giving me a hard time) and then I said the artists real name and he laughed and gave me this look like I was baby (but in the cute way,) thennn I told him he can’t read it in front of me and he teased me more by saying ‘you mean I haveeee to read it in the van?’ And I said yes. And he laughed again. Then it was time for me to go and he touched me again and said ‘thank you for coming to all these shows. Get home safe ok?’ 

Anyway. I feel like that was him flirting but I’m also awkward as fuck so I could have just been reading into it. 

I should add this is never going to be a thing so please don’t tell me to shoot me shot. He’s in a relationship and things are complicated with them and I just came out as trans and I don’t know if he even likes guys.

887,"So I have a flight Monday from NY to Florida, I’ve made this flight before about 4 times already but only 3 of them were alone. I do mostly fine at the airport by myself, despite having awful anxiety, aside from knowing which lines to stand in. However, I just acquired my college ID badge, which should make this my most current form of identification as I don’t have a state ID or a drivers license. 
The problem with this is that my plane ticket uses my legal name and my ID uses my preferred name (I am getting it legally changed in the next two years). The ID has my photo on it, the first names just don’t match. Will airport security give me trouble for having a different name on my ID than on my ticket? Should I just use my old high school ID (it has my legal name on it)?",24Jul2019,1
890,"Obviously first off this isn’t an “I’m willing to move” problem. If I can’t find a solution I just deal with it but I’d like to find a solution. 

This is beyond normal kid stomping. I’ve lived with kids my entire life and never have I experienced this level of stomping noise lmao. It’s genuinely like there’s a herd of buffalo above me sometimes. And it will go on for hours sometimes, just stomping feet going back and forth across the ceiling from my bedroom in the back to the front door, and it gets hard enough to make things hanging on my wall start rattling. 

We’ve tried talking to them. One day it went on for literally 7 hours straight and was still happening at 11 pm. My boyfriend went up and knocked and when they answered he said and this is almost a direct quote because I was below listening, “hey I don’t know if y’all realize how loud it is but we’ve been hearing your kid stomping back and forth all day and now it’s late and it’s keeping us awake. We’re tired as hell and need to-“ and the guy immediately started yelling at him about how fucking dare he curse in front of a child (yes the guy angry because his kid might’ve heard the word hell started screaming the word fuck in front of him) so my boyfriend threw his hands up and said “okay I’ll take it to the leasing office in the morning I guess” followed by the guy slamming his door and another hour of what was clearly two adults now purposefully stomping directly over our bedroom

When we went to file a complaint we got told that the guy was already there earlier claiming my boyfriend almost broke down his door and then screamed obscenities directly at his child and was making threats. And they believed the neighbor over us. 

This kept going on and we put in another 2 reports and kept asking if they’ve even talked to these people at all because it’s only gotten worse. There were times the woman living there would be in the parking lot heading to her apartment at the same time we would. She would regularly flip us off and tell us to fuck off, and when we each got in our respective apartments she would immediately start just jumping up and down to make noise. I tried to get it on video but despite multiple people clearly saying they could hear the stomping, the leasing office claims they couldn’t hear anything on the video. 

And then we got a notice saying that if either party put in any more complaints, we’d both get evicted. Apparently they claimed they feared for their fucking safety because they heard my boyfriend yelling loudly multiple nights when I know for a fucking fact he’s never done so. And the leasing office routinely believed their complaints while telling us they believe our complaints are fake and a result of prejudice because were white and the neighbors are Hispanic which I felt was just a throwaway line to get us to stop bothering them

Anyway, it’s only ramped up since then, it’s like 4-5 days a week I hear their kid stomping for over an hour and they’re still always giving us dirty looks and usually flipping us off. If they recognize our car behind them on the street leading up to the turn into the complex, they’ll purposefully drive as slow as possible and brake check us multiple times and a couple times just straight stop in the middle of the parking lot until we try to go around them, and then they hit the gas so we almost get hit by their car. 

The leasing office is clearly not going to do anything about it and I don’t want to run the risk of eviction because I complained about noise again. We kept finding cigarettes on our porch which is directly under theirs and we’re on the second floor so there’s nowhere else these butts could come from but then and I still can’t complain about it despite that being very blatantly against the rules (the first floor neighbors threw a massive fit about it tho when the butts were getting to the ground by their porch and their puppy tried to eat them)

I don’t know what else to do. Another neighbor kept leaving their garbage on their porch for days at a time bringing a ton of flies to the parking lot and it just smelled terrible, and an anonymous neighbor leaving a note on their door finally made it stop. But if I leave a note they’ll most likely be able to claim it’s me and I will get in trouble. But I’m just so tired of these constant loud nonstop stomps that just don’t end for hours and have almost no pause breaks except when the kid seems to climb on a couch and jump off. Can’t make official complaints, can’t try talking to them politely, I don’t want to accept that just dealing with them winning and getting to purposefully bother us for fun is the only solution here. 

Any suggestions on how I can resolve this issue?",24Jul2019,2

893," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.iv seen dudes sit there and she seems different and happy and then she’s all bubbly then as opposed to her usually being snotty af


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

908,"     So I’ve been best friends with this girl for 3 years, we met in 6th grade. When we first met we instantly became friends, we had all the same interests, she was super nice, and we had mutual friends. 

     We hung out a lot and the first red flag I saw was that she’d often ask me to buy her things, at the time I thought nothing of it because she’s not exactly well off, her mom can’t really afford all the things she wants so I thought I’d spoil her a bit since I’ve got extra money. But I soon realized she was using me for my money because not only would she ask for things but when my family went out to eat with her she’d always order the most expensive thing on the menu she would also come over and eat all our food then leave.

     The second red flag was that she would just use me in general. She would come over and ignore me and play video games on my PlayStation or my little sisters computer, she would ask me if I would drive her to a place where our other friends would be so “we could all hang out” but then she’d just ignore me again. 

     The third and fourth kinda tie together I guess, but she had so much emotional baggage, which I’m not saying is her fault but she would dump it on me. She thought since she had been through so much that no one else’s pain mattered because she’d dealt with worse. (She often compared our traumatic experiences always ending in hers was worse) I have baggage too but whenever I’d try to talk about it she’d say it’s not her problem despite me always being there to talk when she needed it.

     The fifth is that she knew I had a huge crush on her for the longest time and one day she said she liked me back I was so happy. Then the next day she said she just wanted to be friends and I went with it even though I was absolutely crushed by it. This happened 4 more times, one of which happened when she was dating my brother behind my back. I finally lost interest and started dating other people but she didn’t like that and would always try and steal my boyfriends or if it was a girl she’d try and get me to leave them for her.

     The last couple little red flags so far are still happening and it’s that she won’t ever just be happy for me like I finally found someone that I really love and she’s been trying to steal him ever since we met even though she set us up, she’ll take his phone when they hang out and mute my messages or text me acting as him to try and get us into fights. She’s also been doing this thing where she’ll hang out with other people, which I’m totally fine with she can hang out with whoever she wants, but she will tell me she’s hanging out with other people and the thing is that she just got back from a 7 month trip in which I haven’t seen her in 7 months (she didn’t text me or call like the entire time but whatever) as soon as she got back she hung out with all our friends except me.

     I don’t know why she’s doing these things I’ve been nothing but nice and accepting no matter what but it just keeps happening. I’m torn on what I should do, do I just drop her completely or am I overreacting and this is just normal?

     Also sorry if this is too long or wordy I’m not the best at explaining things I tend to add too many unnecessary details.",24Jul2019,1
909,"Title says it all.

I've been job searching for two months and I finally got an offer from a company (lets call them Company #1).  

They're not a bad place, but the position is less than ideal for me.  It is really far away (about an hour) and pays less than I had hoped (these facts were given out over several interviews - I didn't know all of this up front, so my interest in them slowly dwindled over time).  

There are several other companies (Companies #2, #3, and #4) that I have had interviews with that are more ideal.  I have no idea if/when the other companies might offer me a position.

I have two worries:

1. What if I accept the offer from Company #1 and then within a few weeks I receive an offer from Company #2, #3, or #4 for a job that I'm in love with?  I don't know if it's OK to leave Company #1 for another company (it feels like a horrible thing to do, even though it would be the right thing for me).
2. What if I decline the offer from Company #1 and then no one else wants to hire me?  Then I lose my house.  Then I'm more miserable than if I just took the offer in the first place.

I'm so stressed about this situation.  I really could use your advice.",24Jul2019,1

925,"

last year i began this retail job where this sweet woman my age worked, in a different department..

Without ever really talking to her much, I randomly emailed her asking her out.. she denied me because of her boyfriend..

 a few weeks went by and she randomly accepted the facebook request, and also seemed more pleasant than usual around me at work (yet we work in different depts)

So I messaged her shortly after, and we began conversing... she began opening up to me, we unexpectedly connected and we've realized how much we have in common. Lots of important and rare things we connect on.

I had a hunch that the relationship with her boyfriend ended..

After about 5 days I decided to ask her to talk in person over coffee again, because we were having good conversation and the feeling was mutual...  and she said she’s busy with her two jobs.. so I asked her to talk on her lunch break and she agreed.

Conversation went well,
and later that night I messaged her asking if she wanted to, when she’s less busy, spend time together outside of work... 18 hours
went by with no response,

and me feeling vulnerable for putting myself out there, and afraid to get hurt, messaged her saying I’ll back away, that it would be nice to meet up, but I won’t push.

no response. 

I then sent her a fairly long message about how she can always reach out to me for advice, just someone to listen etc.. which I kinda did when we began messaging two weeks ago.. her life is tough and I wanted to be there for her even if it means never meeting up ever.

She hasn’t replied and probably won’t, seems a little irritated which is weird because just we get along and she enjoyed conversing with me..

I usually do this though... I put myself out there and ask someone out, then less than two days later come back with a farewell email, but still letting her know Id like to meet up..

then a selfless msg about how she can always contact me for any reason.. 

It’s just my way of protecting myself and moving on quickly to ease the pain because it feels like she’s not interested, yet I simultaneously say my goodbye yet make it known that I’d still like to meet up.

My mom thankfully got a better paying job, but wants to continue to lease with her friend until she can afford to buy a two bedroom complex and rent herself. The only thing is, it’s sucks here. At the risk of sounding ungrateful, the family is constantly arguing and the children (elementary and middle school age) will never leave me alone, and the fact that my room doesn’t have a door doesn’t help in the slightest. I also have two cats whom I love dearly and have raised since kittens, and my moms friend hates them and is possibly allergic so they’re forced to stay in the basement. It’s overall just a stressful situation, and because my mom knows how introverted I am and that I’ve mentioned wanting to move in with a friend in a similar living situation, she said she’ll help me find a place. Now here’s the thing, my mom has never been exactly dependable, so if I want to get out of her ASAP, I have to take matters into my own hands.

939,"My mom is a very sensitive woman and she has a ton of things on her shoulders.  She desperately needs a therapist.  The problem is that my dad is very controlling with finances and can be emotionally abusive when it comes to money.  He would never allow her to spend any money on therapy.  Their church offers financial support to people in need of therapy, but my dad makes a fair amount of money, so she doesn't qualify for their financial assistance.  Also, the church leaders are all friends with my dad, so when my mom has gone to the pastor one on one for counsel/support with the stresses of her marriage, they don't believe her because they all think my dad is such a great guy.  How can I get my mom some emotional support/professional help?",24Jul2019,1
940,"I was invited to go to the pool and watch movies with a group of my friends in a neighborhood 3-4 minutes away.

I will be with her for the rest of summer and our schedule will go back to normal though

The thing is, I rarely ever get to hang out with my friends because I’m always stuck at home watching my siblings or some other thing in everyone’s schedule that prevents me from doing it...

944,"I am a typical teenager when it comes to sleep.  I get too little on school nights, and on breaks I'll go to bed late at night and rise at noon.  This July, though, its been quite extreme.  I've found myself regularly going to sleep past sunrise and getting up at 3 or 4 in the afternoon.  Due to the nature of my family life, I'm more or less allowed to do whatever the hell i want, because of a lack of responsibilities but a simultaneous lack of parental guidance, as my mom is going through personal problems that take up all of her attention.  
     Anyways, I've been trying to fix it.  At first my solution was to force myself to pull an all nighter, and at once go to sleep at 8 in the afternoon, walking up at around 8 in the morning, and going from there (ps my goal is to wake up at 5).  But i can't ever stick to this.  I nearly always accidentally fall asleep at around noon, accidentally take a 3-4 hour nap, and then don't properly sleep until 2 or 3 in the morning.  Lots of attempts with this technique has yielded little to no results, and i only have 5 days until school starts, including today. (Starts on Monday).  
     The thing that worries me is how extremely negatively my body reacts to all of this.  I've felt like total shit.  No motivation to do anything, sudden spikes of extreme sadness / anxiety.  i've mentioned this to friends, and they often say i could just be nervous because school is starting, but the thing is I've been looking foward to it since the first day of break, due to my exceedingly boring home life.  I've been keeping time sheets of when i sleep and for how much, and my natural want to sleep never lines up with my recent history of how much sleep vs awake time I've had, its always in correlation to the time of day.  I finally had a good streak going, which projected me to fall asleep around 12 AM, and i did! But i just woke up at 4PM! i slept 16 hours for no reason at all.  In 8th grade i had pretty extreme sleep problems, and when i spoke to my doctor about it, she said to stop using my phone and that will fix it, and both of my parents refuse to get me any sort of medicine, because drug abuse sort of runs amoung my siblings and they are afraid i am going to get hooked.  I understand the fear, but i watched my brother and sister destroy their teen years, and my dad fall into alcoholism, and vowed within myself to never ever touch drugs or alcohol, so i know that would never happen.  
     Ive rambled too much.  My point is, should i be worried about my health, like, do i have a serious mental issue here? Any tips to fix my sleep schedule? Anything is appreciated redditors.",24Jul2019,1
945,"Never in my life did I ever expect myself to go to Reddit to vent my irl problems, but it seems like some people have been helped out by the community so I am willing to give it a chance. Pretty much all of my ""friends"" have abandoned me and I feel like my family wouldn't understand my situation much so here I am.  


So in my Freshmen year of college I had 0 friends since most of them either went out-of-state or to a more prestige college and by Sophomore year we just slowly stopped talking naturally so I knew I needed to make some friends.   


Luckily, on the first day Game Design class I met 2 other people and we both struck it off right away. For the first 3 months I started off just talking to them in class and a text here and there and after 6 months we were constantly playing games together, hanging out in person, and texting each other. At the same time, our group of 3 grew into a group of 6 after we met some more people in the same class or who were a friend of a person in the group.   


Sophomore and Junior year were great, we hung out at least once every week and constantly played games together.  


However, once Senior year rolled around I realized something had changed. Progressively over the year I noticed that nobody was talking as much to each other in our group chat and whenever I asked them if they wanted to go hang out at each other's houses, they started giving ""I don't know"" or ""Busy right now"" responses. Once we stopped hanging out with each other in person after school it then became just not talking to each other at all after school.   


We still talked to each other in class and that felt normal but on the last month of school that's when I really got a gut feeling that something wasn't right. All of a sudden, everybody in the group was more talkative in class and I could sense that they were doing something behind my back because our group chats had been pretty much dead for the past 3 months. I didn't do anything about it, I thought that maybe the thought of finally graduating was reviving the group so I was content.  


*Fast forward 1 week after graduation:* Nobody from my group had messaged or called me and our group chats were pretty much dead (Last message from them were in April). Okay, maybe they're applying for jobs, some of them have girlfriends to maintain a relationship with, who knows.  


*Fast forward 6 weeks after graduation:* Still no message or call from anybody in my group. I've been the only one reaching out via text to ask how they're doing and all I get is a short response. I decide to call one of my friends who I would consider to be close to since I have shared some of my private issues with them before.. no answer. Next day, I send a text saying ""Hey, what's up?"" and all I get is a response saying ""Nothing much"". After this I decide that I am just going to cut to the chase and ask if he wants to hang out, his texts sounded reluctant but he ends up agreeing and I meet up at his house on the weekend.   


We played a couple matches of Fortnite and mid-way through a match he suddenly says ""I need to use the bathroom, finish this game for me"" so I sit down on his chair and start playing. After 3 minutes the game crashes and I wasn't able to relaunch it after 3 tries. So I open chrome to search for a solution and the first thing I notice is that he has a tab open for ""Slack"" which is like Discord but for businesses.  


I open it and the first thing I see is a list of all of my ""friends"" names there as well as some other people that I didn't recognize. For the past year they have been secretly working on a startup game company and I wasn't invited. Their first message dates back about 2 weeks before our Senior year even started. I searched for name on there and there wasn't a single trace of me in there, I didn't exist to them. I saw screenshots for 2 different games they have been working on for the past 6 months and also found out that they have secured some money to rent a studio in a nearby office building.   


I quickly tab out and I see that he has Discord installed so I open it up and guess what? It's a different account than from the one I have always talked to. I went through all of his discords and found one that had him and every single one of my ""friends"", same usernames, different accounts. The last message was literally 3 minutes ago. I search for my name and the first thing I saw was a message from my ""friend"" who I was just playing Fortnite with saying that he was going to let me come over just because he was ""Annoyed"" of me and that after this they were all going to block me and refuse to talk to me at all. I keep going deeper and I find that they had considered asking me if I'd like to be apart of this journey to start a game studio about 3 days after their Slack was made. Some of these ""friends"" who I've shared personal stuff with, who I have always treated good and vice versa, started saying ""I was not intelligent"", ""Dead weight"", and ""Wouldn't contribute financially"". They've been going to the movies, beach, and even made a 3 hour trip to Miami without me.  


I don't know what to do now. These were my ""friends"" and for the first 3 years of college they were. Now what? I'm honestly bummed out since this happened 5 days ago and knowing that they are never going to talk to me again out of choice is just making me feel like crap.",24Jul2019,3

Well, then this hacker began unfollowing everyone..expect me since I had them blocked. Then the real drama happened. I got a DM from M and she asked me if I knew this girls acc was hacked. I said no (I lied for whatever reason, I was tired, ok?) but then she found out that Indeed knew she was hacked. She questioned me about it, I give a simple explanation and apologize. No big deal, right? Well she starts suspecting me of being a hacker. I try to convince her otherwise. She says alright and drops it.

961,"Ok so here's the scoop. I currently work for my family's business in their marketing team. I have done so part time for two years while attending college and getting my bachelors, and fuller time while finishing a video media degree under my family's advice for a year, under the impression that I will have a full time job at the end of this. I decided fine. I'll make the investment in myself if that's what it takes to land a steady job. I finish my second degree tomorrow. Over the past month I've been trying to figure out with hr and my family what the long term plan is now that I will be able to actually dedicate 40 hours per week to it. Each time I go to hr, i get told to talk to my family as they're ultimately the one who makes the decision. That's fine, I treat it like a normal job and ask formally what the long term plan is yadda yadda. Each time I get kinda pushed off and told we'll figure that out. As said before I finish my second degree tomorrow. I get called into my grandfather's office and I am sitting there expecting a full time offer since that's what's been built up to. Nope. I get told ""so what we want is you working 35 hr/week at the same pay grade you're at, then evaluate in 3 months where we're at and decide from there what we're going to do.


Now at the start I was told that by now, I'd have already done that and I'd know whether or not I have a full time salaried job. I still don't.

I am a good employee. I'm first one in last one gone, always go above and beyond without complaining, and have brought up leads by over 80% over what they were before me. 


The shit I deal with for this job is stupid too. First of all my pay is roughly half of what the average entry level person makes in my field in my area. Second one of my family members who approves all content I produce looks at me and treats me more harshly and negatively. I had a coworker and I create two videos each, at the same quality, and submit them under our own names as a bit of an experiment, since this ""perk"" is pretty clear to him from the outside. The one submitted by him made by me was fine the one made by and submitted by him was fine . The one I submitted made by him she had issues with. Same with the one I made and submitted.
The commute is garbage. I sit thru 1.5hr of traffic each way and drive over 40 miles each way to work, spending a fortune on gas and putting ludicrous miles on my car. I can't afford to move out responsibly on the hourly wage I'm at, with the hours I'm afforded.
Lastly I was talking to my father who works there about moving etc he said ""you'll probably want to find a full time job before you do that"" maybe I'm reading into it too much but to me that comes off as ""yeah there's not space for you"" 


Essentially I'm wondering, how do I go about quitting once I've found something else? At this point I've lost any and all tolerance for this job. It's been made very clear to me by now I am NOT respected at all in my current position, and I don't see that changing in any way shape or form anytime soon.

975,"So.... Over the past years living with my mother (I’m about to go to college) I’ve developed a really bad habit of throwing all my clothes on the floor of my closet because I have so many of them.
Now I’m getting older, I really want to change this habit, so I was going to weed it out and figure out what clothes still fit me, and suddenly realized there are SO MANY of those disgusting moth larvae. Everywhere. On sweaters, on underwear, on so much. I’m terrified.
So far, while my moms out, I only took a few clothes out of the closet that I saw them on and tossed them in the washing machine on hot water.
I’m worried hot water isn’t enough to get rid of those gross larvae and eggs, I CANNOT tell my mom because she will have a FIT (she’s NOT fun when she’s angry), and I’m really kicking myself now because I feel like such a fucking idiot and I never should have done it in the first place. I’m just so angry with myself. I’m crying, my moms going to come home soon, I’m just so upset. I can’t believe I did this and these stupid fucking moths are invading my wardrobe.
I’m just so scared, and on top of that, I have a huge bug phobia.
I want to fix this, as an emerging adult, by myself without my moms help. Am I doing the right thing with taking a few articles of clothing at a time and putting them in the laundry on hot? I’m just worried it’s not enough. I don’t even know if I want to wear those clothes after THAT.
If anyone has any other tips please help!!",24Jul2019,2
976,"I just can't.

Often, when I was younger, I thought about it and cried a lot. What will I do, when mum dies? What about my older sisters? What about my boyfriend? 

I just confirmed that a while ago. Last Christmas, our dog passed away, she was 16 years old, loving, playful dog, full of joy and love and life... And then it hit me. It was my second dog that passed away and even earlier, my brother killed my fish by accident and even if it sounds stupid, I started crying over all the pets I lost. I was thinking about how they look at us from heaven (even that I am strictly atheist, which makes it hard for me to believe they are somewhere with us still) and how they just wait for us there and how they still love and miss us. 

I think I can't live like... I fear that at any given day, someone close to me will die and I will never get over it... Everyone is telling me to be a man, get over it, that they are gone and that it's the only thing that is sure on our lives... But that is the opposite of helping...

977,"She’s bipolar and had to be taken off of her meds because she was having a reaction and after a couple weeks, well. Let’s just say she likes to run away and Mexico was her last destination.

She had an episode today and ran away, her parents filed a missing persons report and I eventually found her and took her to her doctors office after basically telling them leaving her off meds for two weeks was malpractice. So they gave me an appointment. When I got there three workers came in and separated us. They asked me to leave. I have power of attorney when she is conscious so I gave them the forms and said you really need to keep me informed it’s not legal to do this. They kick me out anyway. I called the police and the police said you can call them back tomorrow when they reopen, but that’s pretty useless advice because they already told me they’re not telling me what’s going on

Whether I should still be hanging out doing this is another good question. Last time I told the whole story on here a moderator deleted it and said I was just looking for pity and reaffirmation :-)

She told me that she was busy and that I should go and buy some food with my money and she insisted she would pay me back. I was originally planning to buy food for the three of us but my mom sent me a short grocery list that totaled around 50 dollars I am 16 and unemployed so it kinda hurt my wallet but I was fine because she said that she would pay me back. A few days go by but this time she’s at home but we ran out of water so she sent me to go buy some she also told me to use my own money this time she didn’t tell me that she would pay me back but I just assumed she would fast forward to present day I needed some money and when I asked her to pay me back she started yelling telling me that i live in her house and she buys groceries all the time (isn’t that what parents are supposed to do)

979,"Hi r/advice, I welcome anything you throw at me. This is a topic that I felt was going to come at me eventually, not this quick. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Quick backstory:** My 13F sibling and I 25F share a laptop, kind of. It's mine but she's homeschooled, so she will use it for studies when I'm at work, etc. Instead of doing her schoolwork, she will browse YouTube, Reddit, play Minecraft, etc (I mean so did I when I was her age but..) Our mother has now downloaded a program that will keep her on the school sites until a certain time of day to keep her focused and the screens can also be monitored if need be. My boyfriend generously lent my sister a laptop to use indefinitely, for schoolwork. Our mom also had to install the program onto this laptop because she was falling behind on her work and doing anything else. She still has access to my laptop, because of some things she has saved, no big deal.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, after using my laptop, she won't log out and just shut it and move on, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I've asked that she just sticks to hers because she told me that she doesn't need any of the files on my computer, just the contacts if she wants to message people, fine. I've had to log into her account to log off many times recently. Yesterday, when I was briefly in her account, her Google hangout was open (something she was doing instead of her schoolwork) and I admit I did take a glance because she must of been using my laptop to 'sneak around/digress' from doing her work so I was annoyed. The conversation was with another girl she knows through homeschool groups, talking about their relationship rules and not telling their parents and such. Now, I had a feeling that my sister (forgive me for possibly using the wrong/offensive terms or words) may be somewhere on the LGBTQ+ spectrum, hell, I think our whole family may know at this point, but we don't officially know. I logged out and said nothing, I haven't seen her yesterday or today, where again I had to log her out of my computer and I saw quickly they were having further discussions about them two and not telling either parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's not like she doesn't have access to Hangouts on her computer, she just clearly doesn't want to be monitored (which I don't blame her). It seems to me that the only conversation she's trying to hide is this one, but is she hiding it when she is supposed to be doing schoolwork? Also yes, it's the end of July, but she is so behind on her work that she basically did this to herself.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I mention to our mom that she's getting around her schoolwork by using my computer and possibly out her in the process (which I really don't want to do, but I also am sick of the two of them fighting about her being behind and her missing out on free time in the summer) or should I let it play out? Or is there a better option?",24Jul2019,1
980,"I need advice... my sister and her husband are serious pieces of shits. My niece was my sisters first child. She ditched my niece when she was 3 months old in the middle of the night to go be with her now husband who she had only known for maybe a month! My mom and dad raised her until she was 3 years old and then my sister came back home and said she was in a better place and wanted to take her back. My parents refused but after constant pressure and constant insisting from my grandparents, uncles, aunts, and sister they finally gave in but have regretted it ever since. My sister has since then had 3 more kids and my niece has always been treated differently because she is “not his kid”.  My sisters husband is violent and a manipulator. They are ALWAYS fighting/ arguing. He can’t keep a job and he won’t let my sister work because he doesn’t trust her. He’s always accusing her, he’s beaten her several time, he’s just evil and has brainwashed my sister. Every time my family helps her out when she calls us crying our relationship with her takes one step forward two steps back because he manipulates her and she turns against us and then the cycle begins again. Of course she accepts the money or whatever is being offered first! So my sister has kept the kids isolated most of their life from us but 2 years ago my niece was finally able to meet her dad. My sister REFUSES for him to be apart of her life apart from the 1 month he is allowed she does have full custody but because he pays child support he’s allowed to have her 1 month out of the summer. During that month he has let us known we can see her or keep her a weekend whatever we want because he knows how much we love her. So back to this toxic environment.. she lives in a sketchy ass part in Texas in the middle of nowhere right now. They are constantly moving around because they can’t pay their rent. The two towns they stay around are just trash. He is violent, a coke head, and an abusive person. I had my niece this weekend and she wouldn’t eat. I asked her why and she said she’s just use to it now, that her step dad constantly yells at her and tells her he doesn’t want her EATING HIS FOOD so she just doesn’t eat. Last year her dad was so close to getting the custody changed with a lawyer but my niece told him she wanted to go back to her moms. When we asked her why she did that last year she said her mom had promised her so much stuff but she knows now she can’t trust her mom.  She doesn’t want to go back to that toxic environment and her dad is a really great guy. Her step mom and dad both went to the army. They have a nice home, great jobs, she has two half brothers and a half sister and they all welcomed her with open arms. She is starting to think about her future and knows that going back to her moms won’t be good. Due to a family medical emergency this last year he can’t get an attorney again to try to go for custody. My sister know my niece wants to live with her dad. My niece has begged her to let her leave but my sister refuses. When my niece left to go for her month to her dad my sister didn’t let her take anything. No clothes, no makeup, no cellphone. (BTW my mom pays for 3 cellphones and 2 of the 3 My sister took away from her. The third my mom most recently got her after she came out for her month.) She said if you still want to stay with your dad after this month you can come back and get your stuff and go then. Well the month is almost up and my sister said nope not going to happen and how dare she even do that to her. That she can leave when she’s 18. She won’t talk to anyone but my niece when we tried from my cell this past weekend or he tries to reach out. She’s told my niece that she better stop asking people to call her to get her to change her mind that it’s between her and my nice and that now all of a sudden she wants to act like “them”  and join programs and think about her future. So is there any advice out there?? Can’t my niece go herself and tell the police or someone she doesn’t want to stay with her mom anymore. She’s turning 17 in November. Or do we have to wait until my sister matures which will probably be when he’ll freezes over!",24Jul2019,1

985,"Hi everyone,

I work in a consultation field that specializes in helping people with general dating advice, preparations, planning etc. most clients are single men, but admittedly, some are married and wanting to get into the dating world will reach out. 

So, fast forward to a client who was really booking a lot of consultations: he was nice, but had some cold quiet tendencies I was helping him work on - just really some self awareness techniques and such, but otherwise very chill and easy to work with.

After a year of coaching, I found out he lied about being single when he asked me to look at his social media to see if I had any tips, he was married. His wife was beautiful, successful and they had many mutual friends.  I mentioned it and he explained he was about to divorce: no problem, that happens but I’m not open to helping clean his social media for dating until he does. After that, he got very persistent with me.

He started bringing me gifts, insisting they were platonic (not unusual as some clients are super grateful and generous when they’ve finally got the hang of the dating world) but then, after a massively expensive holiday gift that I told him was too much - he playfully said he loved me. He wouldn’t take his gift back and just said I was very special, I deserve it , keep it. 

Over the next few months, I tried drawing the line more and more, explaining professional boundaries but he kept pushing for months, more frequent communications, prying into my personal life, more gifts - often wanting to drop by my house to give them to me when I was ‘too busy’ to fit a consultation in my schedule.

I finally stopped seeing him as a client, told him my personal life was too busy and complicated so as to avoid rejecting him, and while he seemed to understand, he still messages me. It was very frequent at first but now really just when he can find an excuse (Holidays, things that reminded him of me), it’s been over a year. I’ve been polite but professional, but I honestly just want him to go away. His name in my inbox brings me so much stress.

What should I do? How do you make an overly attached, generous person leave you alone without rejecting them so hard they are put off from trying to date others.",24Jul2019,1

989," 

I've been dating this girl since June of last year, we met working together last year's New Year. I have never felt so loved, understood, accepted and cared for in this past year. She used to go out of her way to be with me, go out, etc. and she would always surprise me with many different meals, experiences, etc.

We still work together, at a different, charitable establishment that we are both passionate about (one of the reasons we bonded so quickly). She moved up to a managing position throughout this past year (I'm newer on the project, she is on occasion managing me, but not quite).

In recent weeks, she's been distant. We live in separate houses, though I sometimes go over after a long day at work, or just when I miss her. She's been a safe space too, since I still live some family (single parent, siblings- she just lives with roommates), and I sometimes have family issues that cause me stress. We made a deal not too long ago that I won't go over too often because she really values her alone time- as do I.

As she recently began a managing position- a big step up in her life, I understand she is very stressed during this time. She also studies languages, reads frequently, does yoga and various workout sessions in her spare time, which she takes very seriously as a day to day routine. Though more recently, she's been very focused on that, and I have felt as if she is not as invested in me- not as she used to be, anyways. Not that I'm expecting her to show up with flowers when I see her, she does still very much care for me, but she's been distant.

We had planned a trip that I was really looking forward to for a few months- my friend and her boyfriend invited us. It was due next month, but I saw she didn't request the days off, and I could have sworn that the many times I asked her she was excited, but she told me she doesn't want to go. I understood. She instead planned a trip in a different city for herself the same week. This upset me as I just heard about it- and have been telling her I have been wanting to go there for a while. She told me she would pay for the trip we initially planned but doesn't want to go as she doesn't want to be around my friend and her boyfriend, she doesn't like the idea of the trip (which I had thought she did), and just in general , wants to be alone. I understood, but it hurt me.

I saw her this morning and we talked for our relationship. She told me she believes we have different goals and outlooks on life, and that she doesn't want to hang around me when she just wants to be alone, but she doesn't want to upset me either. I told her I respect her, but she has been so great to me when most other aspects of my life have let me down- and I feel in this past year, she has helped me grow as we shared feelings and experiences together. She told me she doesn't think she likes being in a relationship in general, it's too stressful for her to constantly care about someone, and that she just enjoys being alone. This is her first relationship, and my second. I asked her if she still wanted to be together, her response was ""maybe."" (after hesitation)

This is very sudden and I don't know how to feel. Our conversation ended there as we were talking over breakfast but she had to go to work (I knew this). It feels sudden because a month ago, we were expressing so much love for each other, we planned things, went on nice dates and she was so great to me. Even earlier this week, she was asking if I was coming over, and I was planning a home-cooked meal and a relaxing night for the two of us.

I have been hurt, let down, and let go by many people, family included. This hurts more, though, because this is the most I have loved and been loved back, and the most care and understanding I have had reciprocated. It's hard to have someone care for me so much, and then all of a sudden say that they just want to be alone in life. I still love her, and she says she loves me but that I need someone who can be more ""there"" for me and listen to me more, and be as excited about life and other people as I am. I just miss how it used to be.

I respect her feelings and choices. I'm not asking for advice on how to save a relationship- frankly, I don't understand where we stand right now, anyways. I just don't know what to do, how to feel, or what to say in general. I feel like I have been wasted, I feel uncared for, I wish I had spent more time with her when things were the way they were before. I wish I didn't ask her about this trip in the first place. I can't even do things by myself as I am younger, and significantly smaller (we have a foot difference in height). I'm not even going on this trip anymore since I only wanted to go and experience it with her, not with my friend and her boyfriend.

It's difficult because we work together as well, and by all means, we maintain a professional work environment, but it would be difficult to see her. I'm moving to a different project in the next month or two, anyways, but for now we will still see each other at work often. We both work full-time.

I just don't know what to do. I just feel terrible- I don't feel like eating, sleeping, going to work. I feel stressed and alone.",24Jul2019,3

992,"So i'm 26 and my brother is 42. For the past 15 years he has been in and out of prison and been a drug addict off and on. Meth, crack, benzo pills etc. He also  suffers from depression and anxiety. He may have ptsd from 8 years in prison as well. He says he has been clean for a few years. But it is a fact that he abuses his anti anxiety medication like ativan and clonazopam. He also is on government assistance because he has heart failure. He makes enough to live and pay his rent but he is always broke a week after payday.  Every month like clockwork. This is when he starts calling my mother and dad (they are divorced) for money or food. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now i live with my mother who is 65 and has a lung condition called copd. She has since quit smoking but it affects her day to day life and she can no longer walk around too much. She has about 30% lung volume. I help her do whatever she needs with things like shopping, cooking, taking her to doctors appointments etc. She is on government assistance as well. This is why she can not afford to keep giving my brother money. This causes a huge rift between me and her because i know what she is doing is wrong by giving him money so he can buy cigarettes and whatever else he is addicted to. I feel she is enabling him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now a big problem is me telling her i'm no longer driving her over to his apartment. He manipulates her into coming over saying he is lonely and then every single time she leaves with $40 - $100 less. It is just a scam for him to corner her and get money. Each time she has realized this and she calls me to come back and pick her up early when the plan was for her to spend the night or weekend there. Please note that i have multiple times delivered care packages over to him with food etc when he is broke. Tons of times !

&amp;#x200B;

I told my mother today that i will no longer drive her there anymore. I heard him on the phone giving her shit for not coming over. My mom told him i was sleeping so i could not give her a ride. This is not true because i was up and she knew it. She told me she was just telling him that because she is too embarrassed to tell him i won't take her over there anymore. She is saying i am cutting off my nose to spite my face. She is making me feel like the bad person. And this is my whole issue. I cannot get my mom to see it from my point of view. I think my brother has caused me ptsd since i have been dealing with his shit since i was a kid. I was too involved.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so frustrated. My mom is sick and my brother will only call her when he needs money or food or a favor. He won't call her to see how she is doing. She has been the one who has had his back through all the addiction, all the prisons, court hearings, rehabs and hospitals. And the second she denies him money he attacks her verbally making her feel like shit.

Please tell me if i am in the wrong and what i should do.
