1,"So, not really sure what I’m asking.. because we’re no longer dating. But my on again off again (ex?)gf seems to be a compulsive liar. 
I’ve only caught her in lies a few times, but she would always turn the tide when I did. So I just started believing everything whole heartedly as to not upset her fragile mental state.

She claims to be very mentally ill, on the verge of suicide and slightly autistic. But, now also has been diagnosed with psychosis...

She could very well be telling the truth but it seems like she’s trying to scare me away without breaking my heart, so I’ll give up on her. Because she is also a straight A psyche major, and has used mental conditioning on me before. 
She used the Pavlov’s dog treatment on me to make me like a certain artist.

The thing is I walked once and it crushed her, after 5 months she threatened me with suicide and drew me back in just to keep the on again off again cycle going until recently. 

No one in my life thinks shes any good for me, and I believe it, but would never tell her that. But she constantly tells me all the things I’ve done or do wrong, and that everyone in her life says the same about me.

I feel very strongly for this girl, but is it time to move on? Is there another approach? I’m no good at mental illness’s, and walking on glass for 2 years and some has been exhausting. 

I should also note she thinks I’m the toxic one because, and I quote “I ask for too much”.

The last three things she brought up I asked for was to bring me a heated pogo, give an arm rub, and to stay the night (all over a one week period).",08Oct2019,1

4,"weird. I can't explain how stupid I feel. how disgusted by myself I feel.

&amp;#x200B;

it started a month ago, I was watching this guys youtube videos, and thought, well, he seems cute! and I watched his videos daily! like I was fucking obsessed. 

&amp;#x200B;

he is 18, makes youtube videos, he speaks English even doe he isn't from the USA.

&amp;#x200B;

on one of his videos, he shows a part of his neighborhood, and I thought well, I think I can find out where he lives.

so I started doing some google image search, nothing came in. I became so obsessed that I rewatched all of his videos again to see if I could gather more info. I did end up finding more info.

&amp;#x200B;

turns out he doesn't tell anyone where he is from, just a hint here and there.

&amp;#x200B;

I rewatched the video where he shows part of his neighborhood, and I noticed something. a place. so I started searching for that particular place in that country. I found it. I found the street he lives in, I found the same house he lives in. 

&amp;#x200B;

it was fucking difficult but i managed to find out where he lives

&amp;#x200B;

when I found it I was so happy! like why would I feel happy? I'm a fucking stalker. but then I realized, how fucking disgusting it was. why on earth I did that? I mean what was I expecting? go and see him? and what would I say?

&amp;#x200B;

idk man, I feel so guilty now. now I can't even watch his videos. I feel awful.

what can i do to stop being so fucking disgusting? like wow, can i pls stop? i feel embarrassed",08Oct2019,1

Tl;dr: should I go back to school at 30 or pursue independant studies for career options. 
30yo dude, getting ready to go back to school in the fall. A couple years of college previously but no degree. Spent a few years in Real Estate, sales for the automotive industry for both oem and aftermarket. I've worked cs and lower management positions for financial institutions etc and am currently driving a forklift 8 hours a day. I have a ton of interests and hobbies ie. Mountain biking, music, photography, sim racing, firearms, fishing and hunting etc etc. I'm having a hard time deciding if the next 3 years, and the associated cost, to get a degree (engineering or zoology) would be better spent on pursuing something I already have experience in, like music or Real Estate, or if I should stick to the degree path.

7,"G'day,
24 years old from Adelaide Australia. 
I feel like im at a cross roads in my life. I'm sick of my job (Diesel Mechanic) trucks and trains are sucking the life out of me. 

Im looking at joining the Royal Australian Navy to upskill, but I'm currently unsure. I have a medical and final interview and I'm in.

I have a girlfriend of 2 years, she said if i go to the Navy shes going to leave. Not a overall big problem as I have a strong friendship group.

What other career paths can you recommend? Open to University, open to sell up and move cities but i just don't want to be doing the same shit for another year.

15,"  My (29/F) sister (47/F) has for a long time been my biggest cheerleader and an unconditionally loving family member.  I want to preface this by saying that I love her very, very much.  However, my entire family, no matter how divided we may seem, have always agreed on one thing: there's something not quite right with her. \[Quick back story: we all came from an emotionally and sometimes physically abusive house hold. Her father was emotionally absent and away from work, and my mother is a very cruel and alcoholic woman.  My sister was diagnosed with epilepsy when she was about ten.  This was back in the seventies, so the medication's side effects from what she's told me were often worse than the seizures themselves. My mother says she started acting aloof, reckless, and out of touch with reality after her seizures started. My sister herself suspects one of her current medications, which also treats bipolar disorder, might be masking her symptoms of that as well.\]

  Fast forward eighteen years later. She has five children varying in ages from 9 - 23, and none of them have ever been taken care of properly.  I don't mean they didn't listen to Baby Einstein enough or didn't get enough play dates.  I mean my sister is a hoarder and a complete slop with up to 2 dogs and 9 cats at any given time.  She is at least $60,000 dollars in debt from things like buying an RV to move across the country, deciding not to, putting her cats in there to live, and the wreck it with scratching and spraying.  My dad once gave her money for groceries and she immediately drove to Starbucks and got extra large drinks and snacks for seven people instead.  
Where she could pay for braces for her children or taking them to therapy for the myriad of physical and emotional health issues they all have, she sinks $10,000+ into Disney World almost every year, sinking herself deeper into debt, and now they've each each been at least six times. Fun fact: they now hate Disney World.  
  She completely ignores her children's complaints against their living conditions and her treatment of them.  The two youngest have complained at school so many times about fleas and unfit sleeping/living conditions.  CPS has been called on her times and they all somehow find nothing wrong.  They are all kind, loving, intelligent children with varying emotional disorders and absent fathers.  She's all they have and she lets them down constantly.  
  (I should mention here that for the past two years she's lived with her boyfriend across town and her 22 year old son acts as makeshift father for T \[now 21\], and the two youngest \[16/M and 14/M\] and she knows they don't get to leave the house and they stopped going to school.)  
  I know this sounds like I'm just bashing my sister, but stay with me.  This is not to condemn anyone with mental health issues, or to judge anyone who has made any of these choices.  I myself am a recovering alcoholic, adult child, former bulimic,  therapy go-er, anti-depressant taker meditater yoga-doing volunteer-er people-loving Psych major.  I have done so many senseless, selfish, and cruel acts when I was living in my sickness. I understand the pain she's operating from; after all I grew up in the same place.  
  All of this is to paint a picture of my sister and the life she leads and subjects her children to.  I know she loves them, I just honestly believe that mentally she is a child operating an adult woman's body. Whether that's from her being an adult child of an alcoholic, complications from the medicine she took as a kid, or some undiagnosed mental illness (or illnesses), I don't know.   
  This leads me to the biggest flaw she has that has and the one that has the most impact on this situation: she is completely delusional and lacks almost any self-awareness. Nothing in her or her children's life is her fault at all, and in fact everything is perfect and working wonderfully.  
  Thanks for staying tuned in ladies and gent because this is where the case at hand really begins.  She only has one daughter. We'll call her T.  T is vibrant, imaginative, open-minded, insightful, loving, and loves to sing.  She has always been this way and I've continually turned to her for insight on things that my adult brain is overthinking. She's wise and loves cats.   
  I get a call from my sister one night that T (at this time, 18) has tried to kill herself.  When I call T at the mental hospital, she tells me she didn't really want to die, she just wanted them to give her Xanax. (T is very uneducated when it comes to drinking or drugs.  She had never gotten high or drunk before. I know it sounds like I could be kidding myself, but we talked in depth and she didn't know what any of that was. This makes me think she was suffering from overwhelming anxiety and not an actual drug addiction.)  A few days later, she said voices told her to do it.  I was very skeptical of this response because it wasn't her narrative a two days prior.  I would be totally willing to accept that she could be schizophrenic, except she didn't exhibit any other delusions or paranoia, and most of all it sounded like she was lying.  I've known her since she was born and I had never noticed anything like that. It didn't feel right.  
  A few months later as she's adjusted to her medication, we get to talking because I want to check in and see how this all is affecting her on a deeper level. She confesses to me that she never heard voices and her mom told her to say that.  She said she felt the medicine was starting to make her feel weird and less like herself.  I asked why she continued to take them and she said, ""Well my mom wants me to, so.""  I tried to talk to my sister about this, but to no avail.  In this same conversation, T told me that my sister's boyfriend hits on her by saying things like, ""You look really good in that."" or ""Are you wearing that for me?"" If she won't hug him when he asks he gets really moody.  He told the kids (to my sister's denial) that he's ""Just with your mom to screw her,"" which is exactly how he acts anyway.  My sister says it's part of T's psychosis, but the other kids have said he's made weird remarks too...  
  I've always known he was condescending, capricious, selfish, self-centered, full of self-loathing and straight up cruel to my sister, but this knowledge really shook me.  Over the course of two years, I watched my niece shrink more and more into a girl I didn't know, who is too afraid to drive, has no friends, leaves the house less than once a week, and looks like a human zombie.  Her eyes are always huge as if looking at some imaginary horror, her speech is jumbled and her reaction time is very slow.  She seems to be in a constant state of unreality and psychosis.  She is unrecognizable from the girl I've known her whole life.  When I called T for her birthday last week, it was like talking to an elderly person suffering from dementia.  It was almost nonsensical.  
  As much as it killed me, circumstances brought me across the country to live.  I happen to be visiting my home state this week though.  When I spoke to my sister today about staying with the kids, she said I could not spend the night at the kids' apartment (remember, she does not live with them).  She said T's psychosis is unpredictable, and she's been saying lately she's being molested.  She said she can't remember who it is so she's going around accusing random people she knows. She also mentioned that T has to spend the night with her at my sister's boyfriends house often. When I asked how often T is with my sister and her boyfriend, my sister said, ""Every other night.""  I asked her why not switch T's medication or start weaning her off, my sister made a lot of excuses and was very vehement about T needing to stay on them without naming a fear. When I asked the other kids about this, they said T doesn't say anything like that when she's there, only at my sister's boyfriend's apartment.  
  (On a side note, I found out recently that my sister was trying to subject her 14 yo son to a wheelchair.  She convinced him that he couldn't walk properly when he was just a little overweight from not ever leaving his room.)  
  Okay, so now here is my dilemma. I want to disclaim that I could be TOTALLY WRONG about what's happening to my niece. Even though my sister's boyfriend sucks doesn't mean he's trying to fondle my niece.  Maybe T really did hear voices but was too ashamed to admit it so she pinned it on something else.  Maybe T really did make up my sister's boyfriend being creepy towards her.  Maybe my knowledge of my sister and her behaviors totally clouds my judgment and makes me biased.  
 That explanation aside..what if I'm right?  
  What if my gut explanation, that my sister's delusion of literally nothing, not even her children's emotional pain, is ever her fault..has gone too far this time?  What if she encourages my niece to take these pills because having a delusional daughter who makes ""false"" accusations about her boyfriend is easier to deal with than considering her daughter is telling the truth? What if she couldn't handle that she created a life for her daughter that T wanted out of SO BADLY that she either a. tried to kill herself or b. at the very least wanted to escape from..?  What came first..my sister wanting schizophrenia to be the answer for T's problems and the boyfriend's remarks happened after the medication began and it was easy to contribute it to that....or did my sister's boyfriend make these remarks before this happened and this was a convenient way to shut T up?  
  Regardless of how it started, I believe NOW that she is keeping her sick intentionally. Whether because she won't take responsibility for T being sad enough to want to die, or because she really wants her boyfriend to be innocent, I don't know. I think that T knows she's being molested, and is either too afraid to name the accuser or is in such a haze that she can't discern what is real or can't retain the nature of events happening to her.  And I think it's my sister's boyfriend.  
  T is 21 now so legally I don't think I can do anything through the system. Talking to T is almost literally impossible, and my sister won't hear any suggestions to change up T's meds.  If I could afford to and had the space, I would just move T here with me, but I'm at a bit of my crossroads myself and cannot bring her into this.

24,"I just started at a college 14 hours away from home almost 2 months ago. Took some time to get adjusted and find new friends, but I met some people through my roommates and folks from snap. Basically, I started hanging out with my roommates and a girl we’ll call R.

She’s incredibly nice and outgoing. We have a lot in common and have hung out almost everyday since we met, sometimes alone but more often in our little group. Recently, I’ve picked up a few potential signs that she might be a little into me but I haven’t been sure. She’s super nice to everyone and loves being around us all but I’m starting to think she’s directing more towards me.

Here’s my problem: one of my roommates, call him S, has almost the same personality as me: acting kinda silly and funny, but also can be serious and overall fun to be around. I was the exact same way back home with my family and high school friends but haven’t really found that happening at all since being here. R always laughs and messes with S when he’s playing around with her and vice versa. It strikes jealousy into me like nothing else and I really just want to be in his place. I know that I love to be the silly guy but for some reason, it’s been dormant ever since starting college.

S most certainly isn’t attracted to R romantically and I know this for a fact, so I’m not worried about that. I just know that she’s always laughing and enjoying when he’s acting this way. My real question is how do I make that part of my personality show? I really like her as a friend but I’ve developed a crush and it’s killing me that I can’t be as close to her as S is. I just want to know what I can do to show her that I’m just as fun as S is without trying to make it seem like I’m copying him.

I don’t wanna be fake but I also don’t wanna sit around waiting for when my personality kicks in. Also don’t wanna give too much info away because S has Reddit and I don’t need him seeing this and wondering what the hell is wrong with me. I just need some help.",08Oct2019,2

I met her sophomore year of high school, and even though we have bumps every so often, she's been the one I've told everything to since I met her. However we live two pretty different lives. She still works at her family business, whereas I've worked many different jobs and built a resume and had solid interviews and experience with working a job that is associated with large companies. She has never had that sort of experience and she lives at home to help with her family business. I've been to college, got my Associates Degree and Bachelors Degree, and she went to a technical college to get a 1 year degree. She is currently having a relationship issue where the guy said all these promises and that they're exclusive, and then he ghosted her, whereas I've been happily in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost 6 months now.
Disclaimer: I'm not saying my life is better or one side is better than the other, simply stating what the situations are. 
I know she has had to go through some hardships in her life, but sometimes she makes it seem like I've got it so easy. 

So recently she has come to me venting everything that I've indicated above as well as a bit more, and it seems like she doesn't know where to go. At 26 years old in the U.S., you cannot stay on your parents insurance, so she is worried about getting her own insurance as well since it is so ridiculously expensive. I want to be there for her, but sometimes it is hard when she won't listen to my issues since she will talk about hers nonstop.

33,"Little lengthy but the backstory is important. I had this coworker who was the most wholesome person ever and i fell for him.  Basically he always comes and stays with me when i close, he texts me all day, and we get along super well.  Last week i was getting asked by my other coworkers why we spend so much time together (im almost 18 hes 22) and they pushed it so far that they confronted him about it.  ""Hey you hang with her a lot, stay with her at night, you're going to a movie, and hoco with her, you cannot tell me you dont like her"" 

So according to them he said he does like me but doesnt want to hurt me because he might move. And he also messaged me and apologized for leading me on.  Now i wouldve ended it at that, but when we went to see a movie together he said ""ill pay for the next date"" and was showing all the body language signs that hes into me.  We were going to hangout tonight and he couldnt so he said hed come visit me at work tomorrow and i said ""you do realize this is where (coworker) gets his ideas right?"" And he just responds with a yeah. 

He told the boys hes not but he acts like he does like me.  I can understand he may have felt pressured by coworker but even then.  I dont know sorry this was long but i dont know how to approach this.  Ive never been in a relationship in my life and hes barely moving on from his ex.  I want to keep him in my life and all but should i try to pursue a relationship or nah? Im so lost and my friends obviously just encourage it and dont hear my reasoning against it.

35,"I tried asking AITA but couldn't. 

Hi, I have an old childhood friend I sometimes walk with to school and today was one of those days. We were going to the bus stop when we started phrasing some dank memes we had on our phones, and mine was ""when the emo kid hangs himself in the bathroom and the autistic kid thinks it's a pinyata.""

He laughed a little but said ""you really went there?"" I asked ""what?"" I knew we both had extreme senses of dark humor so i was taken aback. He said a friend of my boyfriend's who passed away two years ago from suicide's name and it struck me, I had no idea this childhood friend i was walking with knew that kid or was friends with him. I did not even know he knew the kid, although he mentioned to me once he had a friend who passed away but i did not ask any more questions.

I apologized and he said it's okay but i could tell he was hurt, he got quiet for the rest of the way. I was really regretful and it was awkward.

40," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",08Oct2019,0

Lately due to demands at work and my relationship with my boss deteriorating to the point that I am unable to talk to her without it getting confrontational has pushed me to break down almost daily. I am not sure what I am to do, I have tried not to take my work life home but I spoke to my parents about it recently and obviously broke down. 

I do not find my job to difficult, my issue is mainly my boss. She expects perfection and even though she knows what I am going through recently she keeps pushing. Things are brought up from the past that I can't change, too many times shes made a big deal about things that are considered small i.e asking why I checked mark something instead of circle like she asked. It always feels like I am not doing a good enough job, which has caused a lot of stress. No matter how hard I try to be perfect, she will find small things that are wrong. I have approached her and asked if she had an issue with me in which she denied and kept saying my quality of work is not up to par with what she was expecting.

I have tried to keep telling myself that its not a big deal that I am over reacting and it will get better. But its been a month now and its getting worse. I constantly dread going into work, scared to say anything for it to lead to an argument.   

There would be obviously a lot of reasons why I shouldn't quit, I wouldn't be able to receive any severance package, or collect EI while I am of. At the same time I can't keep going to work and leave feeling like crap.

When she’s just walking down the hallway, she’s talking to herself. Even when she’s sitting in her bed watching a movie or something, she’s talking to herself. There have been a few times where I’ve gone into the kitchen to make food and she’s sitting there working on homework or something and having a full blown conversation with herself. And most of the time when she talks to herself, it’s loud. Like, she does it in the normal tone of voice.  Normally people would be subtle about it, but not her. The past few weeks I’ve noticed that she talks to herself even if I’m asleep in my bed next to hers. I’ve woken up before my alarm a few times to her laying in her bed whispering to herself.  On the days that she has morning classes and I don’t, her alarm usually wakes me up too. But no problem, right? Wrong. I can hear her walking around, gathering her stuff and whispering to herself. And then I can’t go back to sleep until she’s gone. Honestly, it didn’t bother me until it started messing with my sleep.

Recently I got diagnosed with vertebro-basilar insufficiency or tl;dr: my brain isn't receiving enough oxygen because some artery in my back/neck got compressed too hard. I'm taking prescribed medicine and my nausea, headaches and muddy consciousness is kinda gone.

But today it got worse: flickering changed with patterns. Flickering first, red area on the center(with a small offset to the right) and then small white dots around. And then it started again. It remained the same 3-4 cycles. I got up  scared. Adrenaline pumped into my blood and everything disappeared. Now it's fine.. but..

I'm too afraid of losing my vision.

My doctor didn't said anything about flickering vision. I'll go through different examinations real soon and I'll find out exactly what's going on with me.

So, a bit of backstory.

She has a F8 sister, who she is very worried for. She doesn’t want to call CPS in fear that she will be taken away from her sister, and will have her stuff taken away.
She has a (M16) step-brother, who is her father’s son. She is worried he will try and cover for his father.

Any advice is appreciated, honestly. We want to get her out of that situation safely, but she has speech issues and there’s almost no way to contact CPS or 911 without being caught, considering she’s almost never left home alone.

63,"*This probably isn't a difficult situation to handle for emotionally smarter people, but I just currently feel completely drained and dont know what to do. I've been feeling detached from reality and hazy for the past 5 years because of this, here's the situation:* 

***Background****:*

* I'm at a new college for Computer Science and Engineering. It's not eazy breazy for me, I sometimes struggle to find motivation to do anything and sometimes often fail tests (i think all of this is normal for engineering majors) but despite day to day struggles at the end of the semester I'm a good student with mainly As and just a few Bs even in hard classes.

&amp;#x200B;

*  I literally do nothing outside of school cuz I'm too tired after studying which just makes me more depressed because I have no social life so it's just this cycle, which I need to get out of because in order to do anything in life or get a job or be happy I need to be a human being not just a school robot. 

&amp;#x200B;

* At this new college I've just started, I'm trying to slowly change to be more involved with real life and real people (not just studying all day) while maintaining my grades. This change is quite stressful already in this new environment for me but there's another stress that I need help combating---&gt; 

  
***The issue:***

My mom (asian btw) is hyper involved in my life, she has no job and commits 100% of her time and energy to making sure I don't drop out of college. If she was either 1) emotionally or practically supportive in helping me or 2) knowledgeable in engineering then I'd gladly accept her help.   
However she's verbally abusive in ways beyond what's described below, and knows NOTHING about science or basic scientific thinking:  


1. *main issue: she has a lot of baseless theories on how to study and how science works (again she has no science education past algebra) and so this is what i have to put up with:*  
\- every few minutes asks me what exactly I'm writing in my homework or to explain to her  what the lectures today were about. Because obviously she wouldn't understand the topics because she's not taking the class, she says it's because my logic is wrong and then it takes another multiple hours of arguments for me to say something in the exact phrasing that she wants it and with logic according to her scientific theories (which is just making my logic worse obviously because her scientific theory logic is 2 year old gibberish)   
\- while doing literally anything i get incessant comments on how I'm not ""using my brain"" and then i need to say something to let her know ""I'm using my brain"" which takes hours for me to say something that she can accept  
\- along the way of these hour long arguments is constant insults saying I have ""down syndrome"", I fail everything in life, etc (All of these consume all of my time and energy in the day)
2. *follows me physically to university classes and to office hours (not quietly, she very loudly nags me and causes scenes)* 
3. *does not allow me an inch of independence to make any decisions or do what i want to do (any time i try to explain this she keeps telling me how I'd fail all my classes if it wasn't for her.)*  
\-  I have to sleep in the same bed next to her  
\- do all my hw next to her with the screen facing her direction so she can see it  
\- if I'm out of her proximity or she doesn't know where i am she freaks out  
\- even smaller decisions, like what pencil case to use how i want to organize my class folders, what jacket i want to wear, i have to do it how she wants   


Partially why she's gotten this controlling is because I've lied to her a ton before, but I've lied to her a ton before because of how controlling she is, so it's just a cycle chain reaction that's getting worse and worse. All of this is draining, though she really thinks she's helping me but at the end of the day this is toxic for both of us, not working, I'm trying to improve, and I'm solidly certain that I'm going to be pushed into a mental breakdown again if this keeps up. Tuition is high and I dont' plan on wasting it, thus I need help navigating this situation. What would you do??   


 BTW We live in the same room, she pays for everything including school (I'm not allowed to get a job,)  so I can't just like physically go somewhere else idk. the only way i can handle this is escapism which just makes EVERYTHING worse

I'm scared of being made fun of because of my appearance (I'm 16 but looks like 12 with a baby face and mildly obese lol). I'm scared of not being able to start or involve in complete English conversations. I do consider myself to be somewhat fluent in English on Speaking and I guess Writing.. But not so much for listening as the whole time I spent studying English was with either American, Irish or even British teachers but not Aussies. I used to be very sociable and not shy or awkward as I used to participate in being an MC for school events. But now I get super anxious meeting new people. Meeting Australian students who look way older than me. (Again, my appearance).

When I first moved in, I knocked on the door to introduce myself. The guy was just like ""Um... okay? Hi."" He wasn't interested in having the roommate introduction and seemed irritated by me. I thought, ""Okay, he's just shy.

He is very jumpy. If I come home and open the door, he will jump out of his skin and yell ""OH SHIT.""

He will violate my social boundaries in weird ways. He will ask questions like ""Why are you wearing a jacket?"" I reply ""because I'm a little cold haha"" and he will say ""....um, okay?"" 

Just now, I hear a loud THUD. I kind of jump but assume it's my upstairs neighbors dropping something. I hear the same thud again. I go outside to ask my roommate if he hears the same thing. Turns out this guy is hurling a ball at my door to get my attention because ""I didn't want to knock"" and he offers me a suitcase he got from amazon.

81,"Ever since I started my job in August, I have known that it is my favorite job ever. I am the manager for a tutoring program that operates in a K-8 school. The job is fun yet challenging, and the students and tutors are really wonderful. I feel inspired every day and the job is well-suited to my capabilities. I don't feel stressed or overwhelmed, but there certainly is enough to do every day.

I set very clear boundaries between my work life and my home life. I won't work outside of my regular hours (7:45-5:45) or on weekends. I know how important it is to preserve work-life balance. I have hobbies (reading, drawing, listening to podcasts) that I do daily and I do fun activities on weekends.

However, I just can't get work off of my mind when I'm not working. No matter what I am doing, I feel like my brain is still in the work mode where I am actively ruminating on how to solve problems and make things better. I frequently have work-related dreams and nightmares, and often I wake up and hour or two early already thinking about something going on at work. Sometimes I even wake up with a solution in mind already about how to deal with something at work.

This is a mixed blessing, because I perform very well at work and it means that I care deeply about what I do. Unfortunately, this also means that I can have a hard time sleeping and being fully in the moment when I am enjoying life outside of work.

Long story short I got rejected 4 times and I failed my first attempt at my PPL. Not going to lie this has crushed my confidence quite a bit. 

So my situation is this. I can try to apply to some not as prestigious flight schools with an unknown chance of getting in or I can apply to an university and do a 3 year degree and then maybe continue my flight training as a side thing after university knowing that it will cost quite a bit more than it would now.

88," I made a post here a couple of days ago about some strange behavior my fiance was exhibiting  (check profile for that) 

Anywho, I took it upon myself to snoop, as I started getting nervous. I could only find surface-level stuff as my fiance keeps his laptop, phone and hard drive protected quite heavily with software. I went on his laptop when he left it unlocked when he went to have a bath (he spends up to 2 hours in the bath sometimes). I checked his history, nothing. So I started snooping through files I came across one, hidden within another one called, ""dead girls"", upon entering the file there weren't any real dead girls and just a bunch of screenshots from horror films. I thought maybe it was for some kind of project or something so I moved on and kept snooping. I went to his notes, they were all locked (you can password protect notes on mac) the titles were seemingly innocuous ""shopping list"" etc but why were they locked. I found a porn folder as well which seemed strange as it was just casually named porn, don't people usually hide those things, but it wasn't even porn just one 3 second video file of a girl saying ""witness protection"" laying on a bed in a sundress. that's when I heard the tub being drained.

that's it. Nothing bad or particularly worrisome. Do I not say anything if I tell him I was snooping he'll be furious, should i be worried, should I try and find out more.",08Oct2019,2

92,"I'm 16, a sophmore. I feel so weird coming out about this but I know I have to.

Lets start with home. My parents are divorced, and I know it wasn't my fault. My mother is a nice person, but she is so strict on me. She basically tells me I need to be a picture perfect child with straight a's and she does whatever it takes to shove that idea down my throat. She waves my dream college in front of my face and practically says I'll never get in if I don't meet her standards. I don't even know if I want to go there anymore, she uses it so often to pin me against the wall and hand pick my options for me.

I recently dropped out of my only AP class because of the stress my mother put me under, threatening to pull me out of my first year of band if I didn't ace 2 extremely difficult tests. Those threats don't end there, she continues to say she will take me out of band if I don't get at least all b's by midterms. I can do it, it just pisses me off that she feels the need to wave a carrot over my head to make me do something. Honestly this woman is sickening. I don't get good grades for myself anymore. I get them because it makes my mother happy.

My mental state doesn't help anything either. I have little to no self confidence and I almost feel myself losing my mind. As a matter of fact I encourage the loss of my sanity so I won't care about what anyone says about or to me. Anyways, I can't help but get these terrible thoughts of attacking or murdering people, and I often have thoughts that aren't mine. They say things such as, ""I don't want your pity"", or ""Why should I care about your shit"". I'm afraid of what I'm capable of. I'm scared of being around people because I believe I could seriously hurt them.

In band things aren't honestly that great either, but that's on me. My messages in the percussion gc were found by my best friends mother who now hates me because she knows I curse like a sailor and I make sex jokes.

I've tried looking for love to see if that would help, but to be honest I don't feel emotional attachment very thorughly. Especially with hoco where my date straight up ditched me. I'm also a terrible judge of character, so all the girls I've liked have been just as psychotic if not moreso than myself. I have actually had a girlfriend as shocking as that is, but I broke up with her because I began to get really bad mood swings and also because I never got to see her.

I wish I knew what to do. I can't get professional help because that would freak my mother out and I might end up in a mental institution, and I can't mention her shit to her because she raised me to be polite(a little bitchboy who is too afraid to speak up or fight back), and I can't tell my friends because they have their own shit to deal with.

tl;dr
My mother is a bitch who raised me to be a bitchboy and now I have low self confidance and serious mental issues and she likes to hold my dreams above my head to make me submit. I can't get a girlfriend because of my mental state which is also the reason I'm scared I might hurt people I'm around. I can't seek help or tell my mother about all this shit because I might end up in a mental institution.",08Oct2019,1

Ive asked for people to talk to in the past but it almost always ends with them stop replying (im not mad at them but it is a bummer that the conversation just ends because of me). The only emotion that i dont seem to lack is anger. I have other emotions but they are definitely very weak. Ive thought about therapy but i really dont have the money for that.

94,"Note: sorry if the formatting is off, I am posting this from the mobile app. 

[TL;DR: I posted to this subreddit yesterday about how my mom was trying to make me feel guilty about not telling my sister I was getting/got married, and now it has escalated to my dad getting involved and them trying to make me invite people to my baby shower.]

Yesterday I [29/F] made a post on here looking for advice on if I was in the wrong with not telling my sister [25/F] I got married. To quickly recap, my sister has been treating me poorly our entire lives and more or less manipulating not only me but our parents as well. Last week she was in town and blew me off in favor of partying/hooking up with friends, so I didn’t feel the need to let her know I was getting married. When asked if I’d let my sister know, I told my parents no, and neither of them argued with me about it. In fact, they seemed to be understanding without me saying why. But now my mom, through what seems to be her own guilt, is trying to get me to reach out to my “upset” sister, who supposedly has called both her and my dad crying about it, but hasn’t said a single word to me. 

Once again, today my phone was flooded with text from my mom begging me to call my sister. I promptly told her no, and that if she was so upset, she could call me. This moved to my mom then asking for me to send an invitation for my baby shower to her (my old) neighbor. To be polite, I told her I didn’t have any extra, we only printed enough for the people we wanted to invite. She then asked if she could just give the neighbor hers, followed by “she probably won’t come anyways.”
This sat wrong with me for many reasons, all of which I told her honestly: One, we only printed enough invites for the people we wanted to be there. Two, I personally felt it was a shitty move to give her printed invite, for her first grandchild, to the neighbor who was only going to throw it in the trash. Most people hang onto those sorts of things as keepsakes, and it was pretty fucked up that she was so willing to hand it off meaninglessly. And third, I was getting sick of telling her that my husband and I had sent specific invites and to please stop trying to guilt me into inviting people who have no right or reason to be at our baby shower. 
Her and I have been butting heads about this baby shower for months. I am hosting it out of my new house, and am adamant that only me and my hubby’s closest friends and family be there. She has tried to guilt me several times into inviting her sister and aunt, who are both some of the worst people I have ever met. I told her absolutely not. I haven’t seen or spoken to either in years, and I sure as shit don’t want those psychopaths to know where I live. Now she wants me to invite an old neighbor, whose daughter used to bully me, because “she is her friend.”

My mom is going through menopause, and her family has a history of instability to begin with, so I have been trying to be nice through all of this. But between begging me to call my sister and trying to guilt me into inviting unwanted people to my house, my patience is gone. 
Because what I’ve been saying is unto deaf ears, I text my dad asking him to please talk some sense into why all of this was a bad idea. Yet not only did he take her side, but he turned it around on me to make me seem like the villain. He then proceeded to scold me for not talking to my sister about me getting married and how “she is going through a rough time.” But what broke me is that he called me a user. 

Both of my parents think that I am being bratty and unreasonable. Normally I would just let them; I don’t like confrontation and am used to being the punching bag. 

But not this time. 

So I sent him my original post from last night, along with some more personal examples I didn’t want to share on the internet. I also explained more in detail what my mom has been asking and why I feel the way I do about it. When he responded, it was definitely an attempt to deescalate; he simply told me that he was going to let me go because I didn’t need the stress, and to remember that my sister loves me and that I need to talk to her. Knowing my dad, I think what I said really shocked him and he needs time to process himself. 

I’m not sure where to go from here. My mom is upset and doesn’t or won’t accept any of what I’m telling her. My dad said some nasty things supporting my mom and sister then when I stood up for myself he removed himself from the situation. And my sister, the “upset” one who started all of this, hasn’t said a word to me. 
I feel like I need some time away from my family, but with the baby shower in two weeks and since I only have about a month left in my pregnancy, I am worried distancing myself now will have negative consequences for my child. Should I just cave and let my mom invite her “friends” to my baby shower? Should I bite the bullet and call my sister just to tell her to go fuck herself? Or am I doing the right thing by holding my ground? I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place.",08Oct2019,1

One possible solution is to distance myself from him. But he’s such a great person to be around and even if I wanted to we’re almost always around each other because of school and extracurriculars.

Another solution, as proposed by a friend, is to just let him know and get rejected so that I can move on.

I don’t want to give up too much info but I work somewhere that handles high volumes of people/public that also serves food.

I have seen numerous hazards so far that I think are unacceptable. There’s constant leaks that cause small electrical fires throughout the building. These leakages definitely have heavy metal or rust or something in them and they drip directly where food is prepared as well as places people are directly exposed to. 

The building also has an extreme mold problem, also present in food service areas. 

My building also utilizes elevators that I don’t think we should be use. They always break down and stop and I’ve seen one elevator room get flooded and drained and used an hour or so later which is unnerving. So I don’t think they’re maintained probably

Once I get my braces, graduate, and hopefully get to be able to work, in that order, I'll be burnt out. I'm already trying so hard and I've had mental breaks a few times in the last 6 months alone. TL;DR: I can't get my shit together, my mom is going to force me to move out, I can graduate as soon as my braces are on in 2 weeks, and I can't get a job. Any r/advice?",08Oct2019,2
110,"So over the summer I had to drop one of my “friends” because he was starting to get really toxic. During drama practices, he would put me in chokeholds and I told him to stop and he never did. So i confronted him about it and he said he did it cause he was having problems at home and had all this built anger in him. Also, he kept on harassing me and my girlfriend at drama. One more thing is that he threatened to burn down my house after I didn’t invite him to a bonfire at my house(I only invited my group and he isn’t in the group). But now at school, he is trying to pretend that nothing happened. Should I confront him about it or leave it alone?",08Oct2019,3
111,"So, I don't want to relive it all but the tldr is that my dad was mentally and physically, but not sexually, abusive towards me and my brothers growing up. I was oldest and took the brunt up until the divorce. He then remarried a woman who is mean to her own grandkids.  I just had my first child and his first biological grandchild. He seems to assume he will get to watch her or be alone with her.  Which, no, he won't.  He's been implying that he's kind of jealous of my mom and grandma and stuff and tried to joke about making sure she doesn't ""almost die like you did"".  I didn't want to fight with him but like most the times I almost died were directly his doing and not some dumb accident. It angered me and I quickly but nicely ended the call. Just... I want to be straightforward. We've been in a truce situation for a few years and see each other infrequently but enough to be mediocrely involved.  I don't talk to my step siblings or anything and his wife is... Horrible.  My brother has been around them more and seen the shitty things she does to her own grandkids like call them names and say they are mentally deficient and that's not ok.

112,"First time it was after 12 years of living at my grandma’s house, we had to sell it and almost lost my pets in the process.

Second time my dad couldn’t afford rent and we were kicked out.

Now, I’m married and due to an entire mess with our lease that we thought was until Jan 2021 but turned out to be till Jan 2020, we have three months to find a house.

We have no savings, we used to be terrible with money and only now we are getting on track, paying our debt(just a credit card that we almost have paid off but it took a while to do so). Our landlord has decided to sell the house we were renting, completely out of the blue to the point his own son didn’t know. We thought we were going to be able to renew the lease.

The realtor wants to bring prospective buyers every week and the thought of complete strangers going through the house, looking at our things, the risk of them getting stolen is making me sick and anxious. 

I knew that when you rent a house you have to accept this is going to happen sooner or later, but this is our first month finally living on our own as my husband’s family used to live with us before. I didn’t even imagine it’d be this soon we’d have to look for a new place.

114,"TL;DR my friend and I got unreasonably sick after drinking a bottle of wine and eating at a fancy Italian restaurant. Trying to figure out what happened.


The other night my friend [f21] and I [f21] went to a fancy Italian restaurant. We each had a spiked seltzer or two as we got ready to go over in an hour or so. 
(Just for context my friend is vegan and I am gluten free, the restaurant is reasonably high end so its unlikely they would be unable to cater to our dietary restrictions. It’s also in lower Manhattan )

When we got there to wait for our table, we ordered a bottle of white wine at the bar to split. The waiter brought out glasses with ice in them and swirled them around to chill the glass before putting the wine in. We drank probably half the bottle of wine at the bar and then finished the rest at our table during dinner. 

When we left the bar we both realized we were pretty fucked up for only splitting a half a bottle of wine (we are not usually lightweights, so we were surprised). We were at the bar for approximately half an hour and finished the bottle and dinner at the table in approximately a half an hour. We were there for about an hour and a half in total. 

That night, about an hour or so after dinner when we got home I started to feel nauseous and got really sick and threw up a lot. I went to bed right after that because I continued to feel super nauseous, and when I woke up in the morning I threw up a few more times before feeling a bit better. 

When my friend woke up at 9am,  she threw up a lot (for context: she has only thrown up once before in her life, and rarely gets nauseous from alcohol) and continued to throw up on 3 separate occasions until 1 or 2pm. 

Just to reiterate, we regularly have wine nights where we can easily each finish a bottle and be just fine. I can regularly stomach hard drinks, and have drank much more than this night feeling perfectly fine. So this leads us to believe that there’s possibly something else that could have lead us to be so sick for so long. 


Does anyone have any ideas as to why this happened? Could the bottle of wine been bad? Is that possible? We ruled food poisoning out of it, because we got very different dishes and confirmed with the waiter that the dishes were safe.",08Oct2019,1

116,"Title says it all. I am in love with someone who has chosen heroine over everything else in her life. She has been very open about her addiction since day one and it's just something that she does in her alone time while laying in bed. We actually have a very functional relationship (we live separately) as we can still do couple things like go on adventires, connect emotionally, and have spontaneous acts of intimacy etc. Sometimes it baffles me that she is even addicted because of how normal she acts most of the time. 

Rehabs/in patient/out patient programs have not worked for her and she openly admits that she has given up trying to stop. She just doesn't want to stop using. Says it's the best thing she has ever felt and that nothing can ever top it. 

So this leave me wanting to move farther down the road in our relationship. I have no idea how to treat the situation as I know she is the only person who can make the change. Do I just accept it since it barely has an impact on the relationship? Do I give her an ultimatum that will more than likely result in her choosing the drug over me? I've never met someone who is so in tune with my thoughts and I will literally do anything to keep her in my life. I just dont want the drug to tear us apart. What should I do?

117,"Im probably going to receive a lot of hate but here I go.
I recently adopted a puppy since I’ve been wanting one for so many years. The only one stopping me was my mother, she didn’t want to. 

Last week, I took advantage that she was traveling to get one and train it before she came back. I knew it would be a lot of work, but that didn’t matter to me, I was willing to put that effort. 

Now the thing is I’ve been feeling guilty since I brought the pup because I feel like it deserves so much work and love and I don’t know if I could give it to her. I’m in an essential point where I’m trying to figure out what I should to with my life and taking care of my and my mother’s mental health and unfortunately I noticed that I won’t be able to do so and properly take care of the pup at the same time. Also, mention that no one in my family can help me with the pup and that I absolutely despise owners who leave their dogs alone for the whole day only to come back at night and see them for an hour or so. 

I don’t feel having the pup it the right thing to do but also it breaks my heart to think I can come back to a house where she isn’t around. 

So I need advice from pet owners, have you gone through the same feelings? Is it something normal the first weeks? I’m seriously considering giving the pup to a lovely family that has already told me is interested, will I regret it? Is it the right thing to do?",08Oct2019,1
118,"Okay, this is a long, complicated situation, but I'll try and make it as short as possible. 

Basically, right now I am a college drop out. I had gone through three semesters of college at two different schools. The past two semesters, I was at a small college outside of a major city. I was only there because I followed my then-girlfriend to that city and was expecting to transfer into her school. Life decided to fuck me over because she, out of nowhere, dumped me and I got rejected from that school. 

So it's the summertime, I have no idea if I should return to that, not very well known school, even though I got a 4.0 GPA, made friends, my teachers liked/respected me, etc. So I decided to take a semester off to figure everything out and not rush anything. I got a job as a paid intern at a post-production film company, which is really cool because that's along the lines of what I want to do in the future, though it's mainly intern stuff. 

Anyway, I don't know what to do now. Should I go back to that small college, even though its across the country from where I live? Or should I go to my state school, which is a decent, but very large university where I would have to readjust for the third time? Or I applied to McGill, but I've heard it's very hard for transfer students to get in. 

Oh, another, really big deal is, I have basically no money for college and have to take out loans because my brother used up our college fund. The small college I was going to is basically the same price as the in-state university I could go to. 

I'm feeling really fed up with transferring so many times. I just want to know where I'm going and get my life together. Any advice/help would be greatly appreciated.",08Oct2019,2
119,"I don't know what to do. I need advice. If I sound like an asshole, sorry but I'm really pissed off.

I'm in high school. I only have one friend and I eat with her, work with her, spend my time with her, you know. Let's call her A. Me and A are close friends and are usually ok. However, a lot of things about her bother me. She thinks she's better than me at everything, and even if she is, I don't care. I just don't want to be judged if I don't understand something in math class. I'll say like ""x thing was hard"" and she'll look at me as if I was stupid and say it was very easy.

 She thinks I absolutely need her. I'm shy and I always ask her to ask things for me, but that doesn't mean I can't live without her. I enjoy being alone. I don't need her. She thinks she's the best friend ever.

I'm struggling with a lot of things that I decide to keep inside. I can be feeling like total shit but I'll smile and try to make her laugh because I don't want her to feel like shit because of me. But then, when something small happens, she always manages to get a sad face. She acts sad for absolutely nothing and it pisses me off so much that she doesn't even make an effort to hide it. It could be a ""oh I got 86 in this exam"" and WOW HOW SAD. Like Jesus stop already. 

She didn't help me at all when I told her I self-harmed. I cut and in fact, only an ""okay"" from her would of been good. But instead, she told me that if I didn't stop cutting, she would tell my parents. Cuz yeah that solves everything. Now I have to cut somewhere else. 

Today I was looking at the news on my cellphone and I saw the news about Greta Thunberg's effigy hanging from a bridge. We could see a picture of the effigy  just hanging there, a rope to its neck. I showed it to A cuz I enjoy reading the news and she laughed and said it was me. I'm so disturbed. Like what I'm going to hang myself? It felt as if you're telling a drug addict he will be like a random dude who overdosed.

In fact I'm just so done with her most of the time and I just want advice. How can I make our relationship better? And if I'm the one who's wrong here, please say so.

Not only that but we were kids when we dated so I didn’t think anything of it.  We’re in our late twenties now so it’s been over 11-12 years.

The only problem is is that it’s expensive. I believe the tuition is about $17k to commute. My parents put up a fight about paying my community college tuition so I don’t know how they will agree to pay this. I understand that we don’t make too much. We are in that weird area that we enough to where I don’t get benefits like FASFA but can’t afford anything else more expensive than community college. 

I heard some news that this particular college I want to attend in two years might enact a policy where if you make under $50k a year, you can go there for free. My parents make about $70k a year so this wouldn’t apply to me. I was thinking about becoming an independent. I have no idea what this would entail and what I’d have to do to become this. I work a minimum wage job right now and I know I’ll make less than $50k a year if I was an independent.

I burned a whole through my retina from looking at the sun because of a horrible drug experience years ago, and even though I don’t notice the blur in my center vision, I have no idea what my vision will be like 10 years from now (the eye doctor said it will probably get worse as your eyes degenerate).

My jaw pops in and out because of a one time jaw exercise I tried that promised to give you a stronger jaw line. Sometimes I forget about it but sometimes it upsets me.

And most recently I overused my knee from constant cardio when I should have listened but down I have trouble straightening it and it pops and gets inflamed and might be a serious problem.

These are all regrets in my life, why did I stare at the sun? Why did I trust the jaw exercise? Why did I do strenuous cardio?

On one hand I’m grateful to God. All these functions still work and now I can praise God for giving me eye sight and allowing me to still fully see fine, that I can eat and speak with my jaw and still walk in my injured knee. I also realize that injures and damage are a part of this life, no one gets out unscathed.

I feel sad because I feel like someone 30 should not have a damaged knee or eye or anything, and that these issues usually seem to start at 60. But I feel grateful that the important that is to know and trust in Christ and if I’m so worried about making mistakes about my physical body how awful would it be to make the mistake of never knowing Christ.

The Bible says that flesh and blood can not enter into heaven, so maybe it doesn’t really matter too much what happens to this body on this earth?

How do I protect myself? Should I worry about my body? I eat out at Burger King and fast food places a lot and sometimes my heart feels old too and I probably have internal issues building up as well that I don’t know about.

I’m the one who always wants to see everyone and was even hurt last year when she told me I couldn’t spend Christmas morning with them, which has been a tradition of ours for years) once I pointed this out her tune changed and she did the “oh well, this is the only time we get to go with our kids. We can do Thanksgiving a different day”. The only problem is is that I work in fast food and unless its a Holiday DAY I’ll have a hard time getting off a specific day, let alone a weekend.

I lost count of how much she owed me so I checked through bank transactions where I took out money to give to her and it added up to £440 I asked her the other day how much she owes me and she told me £330 (she didn’t say this on purpose I’m sure she just lost count too). My savings are all I have to buy things I need (clothing etc..) but am I being selfish asking for it back? Does anyone have advice on how to earn extra money at my age? (my area has barely any jobs on offer and I’m lost for what to do to help out.) My birthday is also coming up in 11 days and I’m really nervous that my moms going to waste money on a present I really don’t need.... 

Any advice is appreciated..",08Oct2019,9
141,"(I never used Reddit on a cellphone, so I don’t know how the words will come out)I’m a high school senior that has never really made friends, the odd thing is that I always talk and try to get to know at least something about almost everyone I had class with(ever) but they never seemed to like me. I’m Hispanic\Latino, brown skin, heterosexual, average looking maybe five or six out of ten, average height, not very religious, I’m also very pro LGBT, and non Sexist. I’m an average student grades wise, mostly Cs. I'm not an introverted person, I talk to guys and girls the same, I'm not intimated by people either. Both of my parents are approaching their mid 50s(lived in the US since their teen years), I get along with them, we are very close, they deeply care about me and my younger sibling, they ask he what we learned in school, etc. My city along with the schools are diverse, there are students of many races, ethnicities, sexualities, etc.

Something about me is that I have multiple personalities, I’m an extroverted person but I can sometimes be shy, but that rarely happens, I can be nice, mean, happy, sad, etc.  I have Anxiety but  I’m hardly ever depressed. I was very short as a elementary and middle school up until the summer prior to my 8th grade year, I was even shorter then all the girls, I was the shortest or second shortest out of 30+ students in each class. I was only bullied by one kid, who bullied(mostly physically)me on two different occasions(once in elementary, and once in middle,6th)but they were both very short lived, our parents knew each other anyway. I bullied several kids(less than 6 but more than 2, both boys and one girl, of different races) it occurred in elementary school up until 6th grade, they were all short lived and it was mostly verbal. No that I think of it, I guess they did not want to beat up a short guy. I seriously regret my actions, I since then apologized. 

I had a group of friends in middle school, which actually liked me, it was a group of about 5 guys(and me), we spoke about sports(both footballs), WWE, and girls we liked, etc. I think one major part of our relationship was that some of the kids’ parents were from the countries that my parents are from, which there aren’t many people from those two Hispanic countries around my area)But four  of them went to different high schools, which was a bummer for me. I never tried to peruse a girl, Peer Pressure isn’t very strong around here(dating wise), but anyway I never really care about what people think. I did have one major crush which occurred earlier this year(February through June) it was a Hispanic girl, she was really nice to me, she was attractive, light complexion, amazingly beautiful brown hair, short, an wears glasses, funny, bright, and a little smarter  than me, we grew to like each other(as friends) but I failed to even make a move, I was doubtful since I knew other guys probably liked her, and she was single so I was guessing she wasn’t looking for a relationship. Now she has a boyfriend, which makes me regret not asking her on a date or anything like that. 

I dislike what is mainstream currently, I dislike modern Pop and Hip-hop, I still listen to classic 50s and 60s music, because of my mother, I also like anything 80s, 90s, 2000s, Nirvana, Gwen TLC, Green Day, Selena, Gwen Stefani, etc. The same applies for movies, I love Marlon Brando films. I never started an Instagram account until December of 2018, literally around Christmas time, and to this day I’ve never gotten a girls number, even my female cousins reject me. Something to add is that I have older step siblings(30s), but I haven’t talked to one of them in three years because she lives in a different state. 

I’m sorry if this is too long, I know it’s long but I wanted to put as much detail possible, thank you for reading. Just in case if everyone replies, I may not answer because It’s late, and I’m tired.  Thanks.",08Oct2019,3
142,"Hello. 


I’m sixteen. My parents may divorce soon. I’m not saying it’s 100% my fault, but I’m sure some of it falls on me.


We moved about three months ago. My father got a job opportunity and really wanted this move to go through. The rest of us went with it as we move frequently. I have a mother, two siblings and two cats.


The move was shaky but overall ok. About a week after, when my father went to work, things changed.


He would come home very cranky and be very unpleasant to be around. My siblings and I avoided him for the most part and just continued on for a while, as my fathers unpleasantness was not uncommon and was a staple of our childhood.


My father had always been a physical man. Into huge, physical contact, etc. I hate it, especially from him. He always demands hugs and high fives and gets irritated when I say I’m not interested. Then he hugs me anyway, and it’s suffocating and restricting. I’m a chaotic person in general but I like control over who touches me and who doesn’t, thanks. 


He has been doing this a lot recently. Recently he picked me up and pinned back my arms so I kicked him. He dropped me while my mom did nothing and simply told him he was being too loud. After he left I was shaky and beyond angry. His neglect had been a part of my childhood. He does not get to move us and think he suddenly deserves happiness when he has done nothing to deserve it.


It is common knowledge in my household that I am livid with him and have been for a while. Apparently it’s eating him up inside. I don’t care. I want him to hurt more if anything. 


My mother has grown tired of my father not helping himself. They have been to one marriage consuling session. It apparently did not go well. 


If the divorce that was proposed goes through, I will be relieved. I have lived in this uncomfortable and unsafe environment for a while. I want out.



If this doesn’t happen I plan on leaving. I don’t know where. I cannot stay here, it’s detrimental to my health and has caused a myriad of problems. I want to be happy. Is that ever too much to ask?",08Oct2019,1
143,"My bf (28/m) and I (26/F) have been seeing eachtother for over a year. 

Anyways, he's a real busy guy, especially when it comes to schooling. He is in the medical field, so I do understand him. He changes plans on me quite often actually and although sometimes it sucks, I compromise and understand. 

So a while ago, I hurt my back really bad and the pain came back even worse this time around...this weekend. I was unable to move and have been resting. We had planned to hangout sunday night but I told him if we can change it to monday night instead.

He was fine with this!! Today roles around and he says if he can just hangout today afternoon, than at night. I said if we can just stick to the original plan and hangout at night. He says he can't. So we decide to just see eachother this coming weekend.

He now text me that he's upset and annoyed with me because I couldn't hangout. The orignal plan was to hangout at night...so I don't see why he's mad at me. And I don't ever change plans...he does that, not me.

It just seems unfair that the one time i do something I get slack for it. What do i do??",08Oct2019,3
144,"So just to give some quick background, my mom and i lost our jobs within a week of each other about 7-8 months ago then her car engine essentially blew up on her and we have no money to fix it so i've been letting her use my car. I just turned 21 and she has worked at a nurse practitioner, midwife and more. She is a VERY VERY qualified medical worker but since she worked a different job for some years, her practitioner license expired and she's been trying to go to school to renew it and only has one semester left but she can't go back right now because then she'll have to quit her job which will  mean we can't pay rent or any bills. She is currently working at a place she fucking hates and they might actually fire her this thursday because they believe in almost nothing she stands for but shes got about 15+ years MORE experience than anyone working there. She has to go back to school in janruary otherwise she'll have to start paying back her student loans which will only make matters worse for us.

You were in a tunnel, black and white ( Spiral ) where you had to maneuver through obstacles.
The graphics were really defined.
It's similar to the game "" Tunnel Rush"" that I just found. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deercatgames.tunnelrush 
It also has an ""open area"" and an out of space feeling but it was far more polished.

148,"So I got into my first car accident today and both cars were totaled. I was going north in the right lane. The left lane had people in the intersection because it was backed up, but the right lane was still moving. Someone in the left lane left a bit of space available in the intersection in case someone needed to get through. A woman decided to turn left thinking it was open because one person left room. I was still driving because my lane was still moving and had enough room to get past the green light. The woman turned and didn't see me (the car leaving room was blocking me from her vision, I guess). And she hit me full speed in my right engine area. I didn't have enough time to react, stop or swerve.  

I am extremely shaken up. This was my first incident with the police ever. Luckily, two people got out and checked on me. They also called the cops for me. The lady didn't even apologize to me. I apologized to her because I genuinely felt bad, I mean we hit each other cars! 

The cops spoke to her first, so I got worried I wouldn't get believed. But the cop assured me it wasn't my fault because she failed to yield to oncoming traffic. So they gave her a ticket. They also give me her court date in cause I would like to come and give my side (I work 2 jobs and go to school, so I probably won't make it). I am in pain too. Both shins hurt a lot (I'm icing them), my skin got burned through my pants from the airbags and my neck hurts a lot. I have filed my claim already with insurance. 

I keep second guessing myself. Like what IF I did look away for a second and it really is my fault? I don't remember much to be honest, right now :( I've just been crying since I got home. 

How do I get over this feeling of guilt even though I am not at fault?",08Oct2019,1

152,"So I’ve been interested in women all my life and for the first time I’m dating a guy because it’s the first time I’ve ever felt genuinely loved by anyone, but there’s no way I’m actually attracted to him. It’s emotionally ripping me to shreds but he keeps saying stuff like I’m the only person who he feels actually cares for him. It’s a year and a half in and I don’t know what to do. He seems very dependent and is living with me at the moment because he was essentially disowned a few months ago. I’ve talked about my confusion multiple times but every time I just feel to guilty to leave and then I just feel selfish for staying.

To add more onto the fucked up cake I have really bad mental health issues so I don’t know if I’m just emotionally blank or if I’m actually just completely disinterested. At this point I kind of just want to curl up into a ball and disappear because I’m not even emotionally sound enough to handle myself let alone this.

153,"I don't know why my life ended up this way. I've always been the good girl. I kind of blocked the idea of getting sexual with guys because my ethnic parents don't believe in dating or relations before marriage. So it was never an option for me. And weirdly enough, I never really considered going behind their backs. I've always listened to my parents and have done what they said/expect of me. I went to parties, had guy friends, and never did anything sexual. Not even a kiss. Senior year I got a crush on my older guy friend, who initiated our friendship, and flirted with me all the time. But he turned into a fuck boy and would just lead me on (flirting with me, liking my tweets/photos, etc) while I would hear all about the girls he would hook up with from other people. So that kinda made me depressed. 

After graduating high school it hit me- all my friends were experienced/in and out of relationships and then there's me who threw out my entire teenage years being a fucking prude. I'm in college now and nothing has changed. and I tried. I blamed it on my parents upbringing of me for the way I turned out. But then recently I talked with some cousins at a family reunion. They were spilling secrets, my cousin who's only like 15 already has a secret boyfriend. Another younger one already has had hookups and experienced most things. My older one in college also has a bunch of guys chasing after her. I don't want to sound cocky, as I've always been insecure. But I've also come to the realization that I am pretty. I always try to look my best, I have a slim figure, long hair. I'm prettier than my cousins, in which they also mentioned it because they were shocked about my situation. I would think it was my personality, but I have no problem talking with guys and having guy friends. So what's wrong with me? I feel like such a dumbass for believing in my parents expectations. Such a loser for doing what is expected of me. it's why I am not happy. I wish I could go back. Be someone different other than a naive good girl. Especially since I had potential.

But now that I'm open to the idea of experiencing things, I have no options. The social scene at my college is pretty shitty which makes it hard to meet guys. They also just don't approach me. No matter how good I try to look, or how nice/social I try to be. People say I come off reserved even when I try so hard not to be. How do I change that? How do I give out more of a sexual/desirable vibe? I don't drink much which doesn't help when my friends and I go out. I envy girls who have guys chasing them or just one guy who is head over heels over them. Why don't I have that? Where did I go wrong. I am not perfect but I know I deserve a good guy. My life is so fucked already. I want things to change before I turn 20. I'm trying to be optimistic and believe in myself. But I haven't seen results and it has been a year since I decided to jump into the dating scene. I don't know what to do or if it's too late to be the person I want to be.

158,"About 2 months ago, I got a job at a huge art supply store in a big city. I’m pumped! It’s just retail, but because it’s in the city I’m getting paid over $5 more than Ive ever been paid at any other job, and I’m working with the other artists and around art supplies that I’m very excited to learn all about. I’m really loving the job, but the transportation is a huge problem.

Because it’s near impossible to find free parking in the city (and at that, parking at all), I have to take the bus. This is where the problem is. It takes anywhere from 1.5-2 hours to get to work, and more than one bus too. I really don’t mind being on the bus at all, don’t have to worry about gas or traffic, but it’s the dangers that scare me. I’m 19F, and that’s not the best person to be on the bus in a big city. People are scary. Homeless people on drugs are threatening. I always carry pepper spray with me, but there have definitely been some very scary moments.

Recently I was waiting at one of my stops in the middle of the city. Broad daylight, busy happening area. Wasn’t uncomfortable at all. Suddenly I glance and see a homeless guy kinda shuffling past. I barely make eye contact, and as I do, he puts out his arms like he’s gonna give me a “hug” and runs right at me. Right before he reaches me, he runs off laughing. Holy shit I was startled. As well as this, just now actually, one of my stops for coming home is in a somewhat sketchy area on the outskirts of town. Next to a highway entrance, closest business in eyesight is only a very rundown gas station. On the bus on the way to this stop, it’s dark out, only 2 other people on the bus. One of them is another sketchy lookin dude. I glance up from my phone and immediately notice this man is sitting across from me, staring directly at me, wide eyed. Right as I notice this, I look back down at my phone, and this dude slides into the seat directly behind me. My stomach absolutely dropped, it felt dreadful, it’s dark, my stop is in an almost always empty place, and out of all the days I could, today is the day I accidentally left my pepper spray at home. He starts kicking at my feet from under the chair, I have earphones in so I couldn’t tell if he was trying to talk to me at all or anything. I moved up to the front of the bus, got on the phone with a friend, and thank god he didn’t get off at my stop with me. I feel I may have gotten lucky. 

I’m very uneasy about the whole bus situation, but I don’t have any other way to get to and from work without spending more money than I’m earning. I’ve had 7 jobs in the last 3 years, 5 of the businesses closed, and the 6th I left because I had to move away. I am in no financial shape to move closer to my job. I wanted to get away with the fear of strangers with pepper spray and confidence, but it’s proving to be a lot more difficult than I anticipated. 

I am so sick and tired of losing job after job. I’ve worked in food service after retail job after food service, I’ve finally found one I’m actually really excited about being involved in and learning about, and now I have this roadblock. I want to man up and keep this job, but I don’t know if my safety is worth it. 
From an outsiders perspective, is it worth it? Should I just drop the job and get something close by that pays less and I likely won’t be interested in, but is much safer? I’m dreading that situation. I wanted this job so bad, and it’s everything I wanted it to be. But also I don’t wanna get assaulted. Ahhhhh!!!",08Oct2019,1

The problem is the last two times we've planned to do something over the weekend she's cancelled the day of because her friends wanted to do something else. I don't know anyone in her friend group and it's feeling like a big obstacle in getting to know her or hanging out. 

What do I do? She always sounds like she wants to do stuff when I bring it up but then never comes through. So is it weird if I keep trying?  Is it because I'm not as close with her as she is with her other friends, and if so, how do I change that without getting to do anything outside of class?

167,"Sorry for the psychotic rant. Please give me your advice. I'm going crazy. I have been for years but it's getting worse and worse (still totally conscious but my thoughts are becoming more ""erratic""). I'm extremely lonely and isolated, and I fear it will never end because I'm scared to meet new people. I have no sense of belonging or emotional connection. I don't trust anyone. I have no purpose in life, no skill to offer the world. I have no passion for anything. I have no joy to spread. If anything I only spread negativity because I only see the down sides of things. And all of these symptoms worsen the other symptoms. I'm a defeatist. I seem to focus on the negative aspects of things. I'm hateful, racist, and sexist. I have knee jerk reactions and judge different kinds of people, instead of learning about who they Are as individuals. I can't connect with people. I can't process my emotions or communicate them (I fear they will be used against me) I can barely hold a conversation with the 2 friends I have. Everytime I talk to them I feel like I'm struggling to make them not hate me. I'm profoundly socially awkward. I also can't get a job because of this. Which lowers my self esteem a lot. No girl will ever love me because I'm a jobless, effeminate coward who can't talk to anyone. I can't even look them in the eyes. I'm scared to go outside. I don't leave the house for days at a time. Most of my problems would have never happened if I just had a healthy social circle in my teens and early twenties. It's incredibly hard to make friends as an adult, and especially for me because I have no experience with it and I struggled to do it even when I was a child. I have imposter syndrome. If I start to like anything I don't show it or let others know because it isn't 'legitimate'. I've never felt I belonged in any subculture or anything. I'm also addicted to porn which Reddit seems to think isn't a real addiction but whatever.

I've made other accounts asking for advice over the years. Most people say I should get therapy. But I really could never do that. I am skeptical of how that would fix it but that's not the issue. I can't talk to strangers about little things like the weather. How am I supposed to open up about all these things that a normal adult should have already figured out? My speech is stunted from years of isolation. I stutter and take a long time to form sentences. Its humiliating. And im depressed which makes it hard to shower and get out of the house at all. I really can't do it. I'm a socially inept, neurotic weirdo. Maybe if I drank a lot I could get the courage to walk in there.

I would do anything to feel a sense of joy. I would do anything for love. But there's no hope. I'm over the curve. Everyone my age has had sex, multiple girlfriends, many friends and social experiences. They've gone to college, they've done courageous things. They've learned skills and hobbies. I have nothing. No education or job experience. I wasted my youth (I would join the military but I'm too retarded) I have no prospects of a girlfriend. I don't know anyone. Even if I found someone who I could convince to like me, it would be because I'm dishonest and only showing my good side. I would be hiding how pathetic I am only to be revealed later. And it wouldn't lead to love and even if it did I would be unable to love them back, because I literally don't know how.

Thanks for reading. I can't believe this beautiful gift of life was wasted on me, and now I seriously want to end it after 8 years of thinking about it. Don't worry. I will not do it any time soon. I know I can always do it so there is comfort in that.

173,"Not more than a couple of hours ago I asked her if I should try therapy for some social anxiety problems I've noticed are getting more and more unbearable. I got a ton of responses encouraging me to go for it, and see if it helped. However, I am barely 17, so I would have to go through my parents. My mom got upset at me, told me everyone goes through that, and that I can just tough it out. 

Important context: I've always been socially inept. I struggle hard with it. when I was 12 my mom actually took me to therapy because I had a really hard time making friends. I remember it helping, as now I actually have several close friends. However, I have been feeling terrible thanks to my social skills lately. An important thing to note is in my group of friends, I only feel comfortable talking about much more personal matters with like half of them. I have also tried talking to more people but will usually cut it short because I build-up pressure, and once more people join in I get a bit too scared to continue and tend to end it there. 

But here's the thing that I'm most scared of. I do not want to become an incel. I respect all people, but talking to girls is really an extremely painful thing to go through for me. I do not understand why, and I hate it. I really would like to have a couple of girl friends. A relationship sounds nice and would adore being in one, but honestly, that doesn't bother me as much as the severe reality that I am really fucking scared to do so. Now, yes, full disclosure, I'm very into a girl. Talking to her is one of the things id love doing most but again, it is really troubling for me. She is also quite popular, and again, talking in big groups gives me anxiety. Talking to her is really damn hard for me, but talking to new people and attempt to build relationships with them, especially girls is extremely difficult.

Upon telling my mom about my thoughts on going to therapy, she got upset. She told me every person has trouble speaking with people, that it is all because of some girl, that it's not for me, etc. I got rather annoyed, but in a way, I can see her point. I do not want to be a poser, so should I stop and listen to my mom, or keep pushing for it.",08Oct2019,1

175,"So I (24F) have been with my boyfriend (27M) for almost 6 years. Growing up, he never had an easy childhood at all. Being the oldest of four, he had to take on the role of a father figure. His father was mostly absent and definitely not father of the year. His mother is a special type of woman. By special, I mean difficult and can be very irrational. Don’t get me wrong, I love his mother as if she were my own and we have a GREAT relationship but she’s a handful and a half. 

So here’s the thing... she never was financially stable or responsible. She recently moved in with her parents due to her divorce and person problems and also her four kids....including my boyfriend. I have no problem with him living there, they welcome me over with open arms. I can tell the grandparents have had enough and kind of want their house back to just the two of them. I know his mother’s been looking at houses too but she CANNOT afford anything at the moment with her credit card bills, her credit score and the way she’s irresponsible with money. So her idea was that she would put the house under my boyfriend’s name and eventually put it back under her name once she’s able to get back on her feet. The houses she’s been looking at are almost 260k-300k.... so he would have to give her 1k every month for bills, basically half of his monthly income. He also isn’t in the best financial situation either. 

I know family comes first and I’ve been telling him to help her and try to support him but to also keep looking for something that’s within reason. So what I’m asking is, am I the asshole for being internally upset that she’s asked so much of him, disregards his feelings and doesn’t care about what he has to say whatsoever? 

He wants to save up for our future and he can’t do so if he’s paying half the bills for this house. I mean we would get the basement downstairs and that’s fine with me for a couple of years. But she mentioned to him that it’s “her house, so her rules”. She doesn’t even take into consideration how much he’s giving up with helping her out that much... she just makes him feel so guilty if he doesn’t help her out. Her other two sons are in college so they can’t do much until they finish school. 

She’s also been mentioning to me “when you guys are married....” insinuating that we’re going to get married, start our family and still be living downstairs. Last night, she got upset and started crying when she overheard him tell his cousin that he’s not going to stay there forever &amp; wants to eventually move out and have his own house when we have a family. It created this whole mess and we’re still trying to sort stuff out. He’s tried to talk to her but anything he says that she doesn’t like, she makes him feel so bad. 

I just wanna yell at her how selfish she’s being and be even grateful that he wants to help by doing this much. 

We’re gong to help her regardless, she is his mother and we always put family first. What should I say or do or even go about this? 

MANNNNY many many thanks for even reading this whole thing!!!!",08Oct2019,2
176,"I abused Xanax for 3 weeks and went through 90 pills taking around 5-6 a day and cut cold turkey 4 days ago. Are these symptoms common and can anyone relate? Here is a track of my symptoms and how the progressed.

Day 1: dizziness, blurred vision, constant high heart rate, blurred vision, heat and cold flashes, nausea, diarrhea, sensitive to light, shaking, insomnia and night mares.

Day 2: higher anxiety than day 1, sensitive to light, still shaky and muscle tremors, constant high heart rate, heat and cold flashes. Nausea and diarrhea went away. Insomnia again but no nightmares went into deeper sleep.

Day 3: heart rate went down a little from 105-91. Shaking went down by half and same with tremors, anxiety in and out not as constant as previous two days, brain fog, sensitive to light still, and started to notice teeth were very sensitive and difficulty swallowing at times, and last insomnia. 

Day 4: heart rate stayed same, shaking on and off not as constant, anxiety coming in waves here and there, heart rate down and up in waves, teeth sensitive, brain fog, feeling like I’m in a dream, difficultly focusing and remembering, difficulty swallng here and there and I don’t know about sleep since I haven’t yet tonight.

Are these common? It seems like I was getting better and then on day 3 I started to see some symptoms improve but other new symptoms pop up like teeth sensitive, more brain fog, and difficulty swallowing.

180,"So I've been working in the restaurant industry now for almost 6 years. No college education, no other skills although did some flooring for about a year in between, but other than that, I have no ""prior experience"" for most jobs that I'm even remotely interested in. 

I can't afford to get into a job that pays less than what I'm making now as a general manager, but it seems everything that pays close to what I make are all requesting bachelor's or associates degrees or even multiple years of experience.

I'm starting to feel a little deflated and hopeless to find anything that pays equivalent that I can switch into. I've applied at a local hospital for an electrician apprenticeship program. I believe it said starts at $16/hr (pretty much what I make equivalently on hourly rate) but looking back I can't find a $ amount for the listing and seems a bit high for a starting pay. 

Background story, I make roughly the same as a $16/hr 40 hr work week. I usually work 50+ hours a week most being open to close shifts and now the stress is getting to me as well as the hopelessness of a promotion (helped start out franchise but not moving as fast as I need) I'm already essentially paycheck to paycheck so can't really accept an offer that pays much less and don't want to stay in the restaurant industry. 

I'd like to get into a trade of some sort that I can make a good career out of. Would love it field, network security, software/hardware development, but I don't have the time for schooling right now as my job requires me to be available at basically any time. 

Need some advice or maybe just motivation that I'm not wasting my time..",08Oct2019,1

I have been exclusive with a new girlfriend for close to a month and only officially dating for a week now. With that being said, I like this girl a lot and want to put effort into the relationship early as I feel it's important. 

Now, my girlfriend married pretty early (we're both 24) and has since seperated from her husband because he was abusive and she has the photos and scars to prove it along with some repercussions he faced from what he did. She has dated another guy since seperating and has also tried to work things out with her husband only to find he never got clean from a bad history of drug abuse. 

When we started talking, she told me she had sent the divorce papers and seeing that she had dated before after being seperated, I assumed all things are final. She hit me with a stunner today. He once said he would sign, but now refuses. He has decided if he can't be with her nobody will. He has stalked her and her previous boyfriend, to the point of finding their families. He has a gun and makes threats with it. She got a restraining order against him, but her tore it up in her face.  How do I deal with this guy?

194,"So I've been someone that's just scrolled through and read for a while now but I made an account tonight to get some advice about something that just happened.

Let me just preface this by saying that it was 100% an accident.

 I have a female friend that I've always flirted with since college. High sexual tension, great communication in person. Let's call her H. H constantly switches phones and numbers and there was a time she used her bfs phone. Me being an idiot and a half, saved all the numbers under one contact cause to me there was no other reason for any other person to contact we from that number but her.

As you can guess I was wrong. 'She' messaged me tonight and we made our usual odd jokes about being the first serial killers in our country and went over some exaggerated call cards and stuff. Cool. 

Then things get sexual, 'H' starts making jokes about how her GF is 'wild'. She previously spoke to me about adding a female to the relationship she has with her bf of 7yrs, so that's what I assumed 'she' was speaking about. Conversation continues and develops to picture sending.

 I send one (top) and boom there's male genitals in my inbox. I freeze. What do I do? It was her bf the entire time and I didn't know but I still sent a topless pic to her bf which is horrible and I don't know what's gonna happen if I tell her.

197,"Hey, this might accidentally end up a rant and all, but I thought I'd ask about something that's really been on my nerves. (Sorry for mobile formating). Go to the TL;DR if it's too much.

So, I had this massive crush on a guy (let's name him A) for about a year and a half. He's one grade above me, and we'd been friends for about 2 years before feelings slapped me in the face. We went to different schools until my 8th grade year (mid high 8+9, Sr. High 10-12), and we would talk every day at lunch. I even bought him a bracelet from my vacation in Disneyland (important later on). Towards the end of the school year, I couldn't help myself and I pulled him aside one morning and confessed. A was confused and a bit surprised, but he was chill, so we're chill right?

Fast forward to about a month ago. School is starting and now A is at the sr. high. I'm a freshman still at the mid high this year, and I'm over him (I thought). Cue new crush in my biology class (let's call him Z for the fun of it). Z's cute, funny, smart, and we hit it off. We already had some mutual friends, so it didn't take much to become a bit closer. I instantly kinda started to have feelings for Z. 

Tonight was our choir's annual community burrito night (and A's birthday) which is between both the Sr. high and mid high choirs. I saw A there (I had hardly seen him all summer, I made things a little awkward) and he walked up and said hi. I was sitting with a group of other friends from my choir and he kept walking by us and waving at ME, which was odd. 

Anyways, the main event was making the 100ft long burrito. My friends and I walked up to the table with gloves on, and so did A. He walked up across from us. The trick to this huge burrito is that you can't have any holes in the assembly line when you fold it. My choir director noticed a hole next to A, and picked ME to fill the hole. I walked over and he just gave me a kind smile. We succeded in the burrito folding and... A gave me a hug?

My friends and I went back to their table with their food as A followed. I grabbed him a table so he could sit his family but he refused, saying he wanted to sit at our table. We had a great time, eating and cracking jokes, talking about our high school's production of Godspell (he's in crew) etc. I noticed something odd though. I saw he was still wearing the same bracelet I bought him from Disney and I joked about it. He says he wears it everyday because he thinks it's cool and it reminds him of a friend he doesn't see too often. We hugged goodbye, maybe a little too long of a hug, and he smiled as I walked away.

TL:DR 7th/8th grade. Had a crush on a friend, got friend zoned I think. 9th grade, crushing on a new guy. Sees old crush at an event and he seems a little too friendly. 

What am I supposed to do about that? Am I reading WAY too deep into things? Do I pursue either? I don't know how to even read my own feelings. I thought that distance killed it with A, and I was moving on and chilling with B. How do I know what path to take?",08Oct2019,1

I personally have issue, when I’ve been assaulted (5 times all by different perpetrators) with voicing my opinion and tend to shut down. I have an overwhelming fear of fighting it off... As of this last week after having a consensual 6 way, I fell asleep with two of my friends in bed with me. I woke up in the morning to one of them penetrating me and out of fear I didn’t say anything. This led to a manifestation of a panic attack and while I was hyperventilating, this person chose to continue to touch me leading to the attack worsening.

She has told me in the past that she wants to get to know me better before calling me her boyfriend, but I'm just not sure how much better we could know each other. She's one of my best friends.

211," So,  I own a house and I have extra rooms that I'm not using so I opted to  rent them out.  My one highest rule is: No drugs in the house.  Do not  bring them into the house and sure as hell don't USE them in the house.   Yes, I know that sounds redundant.  Whatever.

So,  for about the past month I've been off.  I'm familiar with the feeling.   As though I'm fucking high on pot.  I'll lose focus or feel extremely  tired early or get the munchies, etc.  I just confronted one of them and  she categorically denied it even pulling some sob story about her past  and if I kicked her out she'd be homeless and jobless, etc.

Why is it so hard for people to simply be honest?  Why is it so easy to follow the path of least resistance?

I'm  going to go to the doctor's soon or somewhere to see if they can test  me and see if I pop hot.  I have chronic fatigue syndrome and pot sends  it into overdrive.  I become a zombie.  It terrifies me I'll fall over  just walking to the kitchen for a glass of water because I've seriously  hurt myself in the past when I was around an ex that smoked constantly.   My health and wellbeing cannot afford to be around this shit.

Are  there any ways to definitively tell?  I'm exploring options now.  Not  that it's likely anybody will respond to this much less read it.

It's also sent my respiratory  fuck ups into overdrive as well.  I run an air purifier 24/7 and the  moment they moved in I've been having a super deep bronchial cough and  I've spit up blood a couple of times.  Going to see the doctor soon  about that too.

My speech has been  slurring and I've been stuttering lately.  Not once in my life have I  ever done this and it feels like my mouth is just...  tired or relaxed  when I try and talk.

i am early 30s, single, only have had 1 girlfriend (for a little over a year) and it was an LDR. I'm 2 semesters away from graduating with my engineering degree, currently have a decent job (can go on vacations thrice a year, minimum, flexible, etc.) but i still feel like a large component is missing. I still feel like i am missing out on life. I am mostly a home-body. Don't have many friends.

I’ve also already been written up for forgetting my shirt/not having one ready (I worked 5 days a week over the summer, when I first started, but I was only given two shirts for two different locations). 

I called in yesterday because I badly sprained my wrist on the job the evening prior. Today I texted my manger to apologize for the inconvenience and I offered to work overnight Monday (I don’t have class Tuesday) or Tuesday as I don’t have class until 6pm. Although I’ve always come in when called at the last minute and picked up the shifts of others, I just want to make it really clear I’m not avoiding doing work.  

So I get my schedule today. I’m scheduled 4:30pm - 9:00pm Sunday so I won’t be getting home until around 10:00pm due to the nature of the buses. I’m also scheduled at 2:30am Monday. Not Tuesday. I’m additionally wondering if it’s possible my manager might be having me work straight through. I’m able to infer I close at 9:00pm on Sunday because that’s when the location closes,  but I don’t actually know when my shift ends. Just that I work 20.5 hours.

My mom and I were very close up until my long-time boyfriend and I broke up. She was more obsessed with him than I was. I was even convinced she cared for his feelings and well-being more than she did mine. When we broke up it was all about *his* feelings or how *he* was heartbroken. Not about how I was literally so depressed towards the end of our relationship I was almost hospitalized because of my doctor fearing for my sanity. 

Flash forward nearly two years later and I am in the happiest, most stable, healthiest relationship of my life and she STILL brings up *him*. She has him on all of her social medias and snapchats him REGULARLY. Now this wouldn’t be a problem if she didn’t tell me about it every time, as if I care. She’s talked to my new, better, boyfriend a handful of times in the year + we’ve been together. Yet, she talks to my ex almost weekly.

I feel like our relationship has gone in a downward spiral ever since. It’s gotten to where I can barely spend time with her because all she ever does is stare at her phone or talk about my ex. This has gone on for months and now she is convinced I hate her or don’t love her. Of course I love her, she’s my mother. But I can only take so much of being dragged back into my old, terrible, depressed self. I don’t know what to do to mend this relationship and I’m tired of hurting her feelings.

225,"I really struggle to gain or maintain any level of confidence in myself or my abilities and it holds me back in all areas of life. People will say good things about me but it doesn't make a difference, even if I value their opinion. It's really frustrating to always fight against self-doubt, as well as thinking about how I could/should have done things differently if I didn't have this problem. And the problem is believing the doubt too, because the thoughts aren't drastically negative that they stand out as unreasonable, but are subtle and undermining, such as the idea that I don't know enough about something to be capable at it.  

A current and recurring problem is when it comes to work. I keep taking job types that I don't enjoy because I don't have the confidence to pursue what I really want to do, and I haven't been able to pursue it because I doubt my ability and always end up avoiding or blowing chances to pursue it.  

This has become a pressing issue for me because I recently started a new job (retail building supplies) where the owner is testing me out to see if I'll be a long term fit and talking about the opportunities the job could bring. The problem is that I don't really enjoy the job that much and struggle to see myself in it long term, even though that everyone there is telling me that I'm great at the job and it's a decent place to work at. I don't want to waste his time though and lead him on that I'm buying into things long term when I would rather be doing something else.  

I've thought about seeking help for my confidence problem from a therapist/counselor, but I'm not sure if that's something they deal with because most that I look up focus on depression or other deeper issues, and I feel like an idiot asking if they could help me. I know that's kind of stupid and I should just ask, but that's the self doubt holding me back again. Maybe that will be my next step.",08Oct2019,1

When we got home, my dad and I asked him again about the problem. Yet he still wouldn't answer. We got really concerned so we asked again and apparently he yelled at his classmates during the class. We asked how it all started and he said that he drew a penis on his book and the kid beside him saw the drawing. The other kid reacted with disgust and asked my brother, why he would draw such inappropriate thing. Then all the kids saw what he drew and reacted the same way. He got really embarrassed and humiliated so he yelled at them to stop then he cried. 

My dad wanted to know where he learned to draw that. Apparently, my brother saw me watching a YT video of guys playing ""guess the drawing"" and they were screwing around by drawing penises. Because of that, I feel responsible for this whole situation. 

I know that the whole situation is not really a big deal since it's quite normal for boys to draw silly things. And i know that it shouldn't  have escalated terribly with kids reacting horribly and my brother yelling in the class. 

But  my worry for him is the next coming class that he'll have. I'm afraid that kids won't stop teasing and annoying him about the drawing. 

What can I say to my brother so he wouldn't have to be embarrassed, humiliated, and prevent such thing to happen again?

228," Hello Folks,

I am 31 year old male. I was on anti-depressants for 2 years. I had anxiety and depression due to skin problems for several years. I took anti-depressants from 2016-18 then I stopped it bit abruptly( I used to take 2-3 tabs in a week), though I could not meet the doctor post this before stopping the meds(Its a mistake. I feel).

Now fast forward 1 year after quitting meds, I am having lot of problem with memory and cognitive abilities. I am a digital marketing professional, planning to learn data science. I took self-paced course and studied for 1 month. After some time, Now I don't remember a bit about what I have learned. This has caused me to loose motivation to learn new things. I have to repeat and revise things on a daily to remember, earlier I was not like this. This has put me worrying a lot.

How should I improve my memory and cognitive functions. Should I meet a psychiatry again? Please advice me, Thanks a lot folks. I look forward to hear from you.",08Oct2019,2

Today (Monday) I go to my car and notice my glove box opened, jacked thrown in back seat with items from pockets thrown on seat, middle cubby opened, and side door cubbys empty but items that stay there on my seats. Someone had gone through my car. I just purchased this car recently &amp; I don’t drive much. It’s used and the key fob doesn’t lock the doors so I have to manually lock them. I have to press the lock button twice to lock all the doors. 

To my horror I realized that I had left my (driver) door unlocked. Last week I got some fast food &amp; paid in cash &amp; received $2.50 in change. I put in in the side door cubby because I never pay with cash, not used to having it and I didn’t have a wallet or pockets (i had removed the jacket that was thrown in the back or I would have put it in there.)

I realized that the cash was missing, but everything else was there. I had 2 pairs of ear buds, a wireless phone charger, iPhone charger &amp; perfume. They literally left everything but took the $2.50. I went &amp; knocked on my new neighbors door to tell them (I had already texted my other neighbors) &amp; they said the exact same thing happened to them a few months ago, unlocked door, few dollars stolen but left items. My neighbor has ring but it didn’t pick them up. That leads me to believe that they were wearing all black. 

I just ordered ring and it’s arriving tomorrow. What else can I do? What do you think this is? A test? Are people casing houses?

I live in a neighborhood that is being Gentrified so every house is slowly becoming nice but there’s still a lot of “questionable people.” I’m also very close to a school so it could be a kid.

238,"I know this is a fairly common situation both online and IRL and there’s thousands of articles and other reddit posts and such online, but most of that advice seems to be aimed at young adults and people outside of my age bracket. I’m still in my early years of high school and completely oblivious when it comes to reading social situations and anything around people or friends. 

I came to the school last year and found a group of friends within the first month or so. We’re close; we talk a lot in lunch and before and during classes. They’ve referred to me as a best friend multiple times, but everything else they do suggests otherwise. We have a core groupchat with the entire 6 person friend group, and I thought we were fairly close as friends go. 

This morning my friend tried to show me some tik tok of a girl screaming about a guy being hot and respectful, and she had to scroll up through messages ( it was through text ) to find the video. I got a little confused because I didn’t remember her sending anything, and I mean ANYTHING, to the groupchat that night. I checked the name to see what chat it was and it was a completely different one with all of my friends except me. She showed me the tik tok and I kinda laughed and then she put her phone away. 

They’ve never really been the best of friends, but I know they’re not bad people. I’ve never really had a solid friendship before them ( bullying situation from 1-5th grade and a heavily toxic friendship from 5th to a couple years ago ) and they know about the friendships I had before, most notably one where a girl mostly used me for money and test answers and then left me every chance she got. They know I have issues concerning my worth and how that connects to my relationships with the people around me, so it’s not like they didn’t know it would impact me as much as it is. I partially feel like I’m overreacting, but I’ve had alarm bells going off in a distant sector of my mind for months about their behaviour and how worryingly reminiscent it is of the people I’ve been friends with before. 

I guess overall I’m not sure whether or not to say anything about it, or if I should just let it slide. I don’t want to be annoying or bitchy, and I don’t want to hurt them. At the same time, this dredges up a lot of hurt from the past that’s probably going to sting for the next few days.

In real life as well I even have to prove my age sometimes, like when the delivery man needed a signature.",08Oct2019,0
249,"Though I typically get along with the other females in my graduating class, one girl in particular always seems to avoid any contact with me, no eye contact, nothing! If we’re with the same group of people and we all hang out, the group will say our goodbyes to each other, hug, but she never says anything to me. Once I was walking with a friend and talking to them when she walked up. She only greeted the friend, took over the conversation, and completely ignored me for the rest of the walk to our destination. Another friend saw this and thought it was peculiar. I ran into her over the weekend and she and her friend completely ignored me. 

Do I bring it up to her or just chop it up to not everyone likes you and move on? We’ve been relatively around each other for years but have only talked a few times because we had to but other than that, she doesn’t acknowledge my existence. Within the community we’re in, generally people greet each other and chat regardless of if you’re close or not so her behavior is kind of strange to me.",08Oct2019,2
250,"I know this won't get a lot of recognition but for the few who look please help me out. My friends sometimes are unmotivated to play or do something because they seem depressed. I don't know why they are but I just really want to make sure they are okay since it tears me up just writing about this. 

I have helped a few people before with suicidal thoughts but that was entirely online since i never met them. These are my real life friends and I do not and will not have enough sheer power and courage to say it to their face. But I need help trying to make sure they aren't. While some friends unfortunately joke about it or use it too lightly, I do have friends that are generally awkward and not as easy-going as the rest since they genuinely seem sad. I am only in 7th grade, yes I know this was worded pretty badly, but I have had the fair share of depression too. But I eventually overcame it and am still using it as fuel to change.

I need help with whether or not I help my friends or let them find their own path. If I should help them, please tell any ways I can subtly make them happier and better.

253,"What is the best way to ensure your investments are not compromising your morals by funding companies that do not align with environmental/social values and responsibilities? Like-minded people, any advice or directions of stock groups (exchanges?) to look towards, aside from hiring a portfolio manager and explicitly saying what types of companies/activities we do not want to fund with our investments? 

When your biggest power in the world is where you place your money, it seems very irresponsible to not know what your $ is being used for, or worse yet, knowing it’s used for things you don’t agree with, but still choose to fund because they make big money. All this stock market/investment business is overwhelming, and even when you look into the stock groups(?) that claim to include only environmentally/socially responsible investments, it’s clear that they are hardly any better.

Now I’d say this is probably some perv just judging on the informality of this, the constant changes in referring to the writer as us versus I, and very unprofessional grammar (not to mention a whole company team not knowing how to spell “madam”)

I know I probably shouldn’t worry too much about this however, seeing that the profile is mostly blank and there was no advertising or any indication of this being a professional reddit it’s just a way for this person to get nudes. 

What worries me is looking at the profile you can see that the user is active is r/gaybros (I think that’s what it’s called) and seeing that I am a gay guy how got message by this user when my only posts mentioning my sexuality were about poor mental health this could be kind of fucked.

Or I’m just over thinking everything and this is just some horndog. I don’t know anything about sex toys so I would like to know if this person is trying to play themselves as a real company that they aren’t a part of or if whatever. I just would like to hear some opinions on this.",08Oct2019,1
255,"Background: 19 y.o CS major. My mental health hasn't been too hot these past couple years due to social isolation (and paranoia), bad anxiety, etc, and after doing an internship over the summer I don't want to end up behind a desk, slaving away my life. I just walked out of my first midterm, in a class that is supposed to be easy, knowing that I completely failed it. Super-duper failed it, actually. Thing is, last year I killed it academically (not socially/mentally). This semester has been a slow-motion car crash, with more social uncertainty and tougher classes getting the best of me. I want to go into public service, but I at this point I'm questioning if I have what it takes to fulfill my dreams...

My life plan is to graduate with a CS degree (for job security/money/knowledge), hopefully get into a Peace Corps position, then work in humanitarianism or go into startups, or even write novels (but that is not a sure way to make a living). Thing is, I have no motivation right now, no friends and three midterms over the next week-and-a-half.

I was thinking about taking the rest of this semester off, joining the Americorps (for 10 months) then coming back and finishing my degree. Or maybe just taking the semester off and applying to other colleges- maybe it's just that my college isn't the right fit? Or even drop a class (to the minimum full-time requirement). I’ve also considered the military for 4 years.

Please advise. Thank you.",08Oct2019,1
256,"I was formally diagnosed a year ago, but I’ve been feeling the delusion my whole life. I pick up on the tiniest things that my mind blows into a huge ordeal.

It’s beginning to affect my dating life and pretty much everything. How can I get a handle on this besides just “realize it’s a delusion”?",08Oct2019,1
257,"Okay, so there’s this guy who’s been my friend since middle school (we’re in our senior year of high school now) and for a really long time our friendship was super healthy and important to me. He was, for many years, the most important person in my life. However, about a year ago my feelings on our friendship changed.

 Another thing to note here before we continue is that I can’t confront the people I care about very well because I’m the type of person who will do anything to please the people I love, even if it means giving up my comfort/happiness. 

 So, my friend is an artist and he really likes this certain Kpop group (EXO) and often draws the members and posts them to EXO Amino. I think my friend is a super talented artist, so even though I fucking hate EXO and everything about them, I joined EXO Amino to look at my friend’s art. One day, however, when I was looking at his art I saw this post for one of his friends on the Amino and the post was so full of love and thought and meaning and I couldn’t help but wondering: what the fuck am I worth? 
 When I love someone, I like to tell them, but every time I’ve ever tried to express any love to my friend, he’d get super awkward. He’d maybe mumble out a “love you too” but mostly it was nothing. Never once have I felt like this friend has showed me a true act of love, so eventually I gave up. I explained his actions away for so long by saying he just wasn’t affectionate like that and people don’t need to say that they love someone to love them. After I found that post to his online friend though, I realised I was basically nothing.
  That one post tore me apart and I thought time and time again about saying something to my friend, but I never did. I was too scared to lose him. 

 So, another thing about me and my friend is that we both want to leave our hometown together, but it sort of feels like because he has me he thinks he doesn’t have to worry about anything for himself. I’ve been working two jobs to try and save up enough money to move (all the while going to school, mind you) and my friend has barely tried to find a job. I’ve tried to help him as much as I can, but literally it seems like he doesn’t care. It’s like he wants the job he wants, not any job. Unfortunately, as high school students we don’t have the luxury to work whatever job we want. I absolutely fucking hate one of my jobs, but I work and do my job with a fucking smile on my face because i have to. Also, over the summer my friend would get payed to mow his lawn, but instead of saving the majority of it and saving a few dollars for spending money, he’d just blow all of it on Kpop shit he wants. I’ve been sacrificing buying thing I want for three fucking years and he can’t even bother with to hold off for 8 months until we graduate high school. 
 I got my friend a job application for McDonald’s and he hasn’t filled it out even though he’s had it for more almost a week. I’m getting super annoyed with the situation. 

 The final thing I want to mention (even though there’s probably a lot more I could mention) is how my friend seems to be super annoyed with me lately. It seems like every fucking thing I do pisses him off and annoys him. For example, in English we are doing a massive research project and the topic I chose was the Vietnam protests and I was talking about Kent State and my friend just goes “you and Kent State lately.” And it’s just that he makes comments like that constantly. He doesn’t seem to want to hang out with me either because even though I didn’t work over the summer and I do have quite a few days off despite the fact I have two jobs, my friend has barely tried to hang out with me. Granted, I haven’t really tried to hang out with him either, but I know I haven’t wanted to hang out with him plus our relationship has usually been that he asks to hang out way more than I do because I’m super introverted and if people don’t ask me to do shit I usually don’t want to. 

I don’t know, it’s just starting to feel like some part of our friendship is broken beyond repair but we’ve been ignoring it because we’re sort of co-dependant. I want to fix it, but sometimes it doesn’t feel worth it. It’s honestly making me so depressed and I know I need to talk to him about it, and I plan on it, but I just don’t know if the conversation should be to end our friendship or to be to try and salvage it.",08Oct2019,1

260,"Hi, I’m a 16 m from Australia. Most kids at my school got a phone when they where like 14, however, my dad refused to get me one until I got a job, then I could take it to school and it could be mine, as long as I payed for data. So finally I got a job and my uncle gave me his old iPhone 6. 

When I got home I told my dad and he asked to see it, as I signed in he said “I want that passcode” and I just sort of said why/no. We just moved on and he said “your not taking it to school, you’ll just get distracted” to which I replied “then why’d I get it then” and he said idk, then he said he wants it at night. Finally I said “no, I am taking it to school, that’s 50% the reason I got it, you aren’t having the passcode, but you can ask for a look through every now and then. I’m not going to get it of you every morning plus it needs to charge.” He just said fine and walked off.

So about half an hour ago, our internet stopped working, I asked where it went and he said “i don’t know” I guessed it was so my phone didn’t have it, to which he said “yes, but you can have it if you agree to my terms”

I don’t know what to do, he refused to buy me a phone and made me go on my own venture to get it, but then still demands that he has control over it, and if I say no, I only rely on 18gb of data a month rather than wifi. I think the only reason he wants those rules is to stop me watching “ungodly” things, it’s just so frustrating, what do I do?",08Oct2019,0
261,"At first she stood out from other girls I’ve dated.

She wasn’t smothering at all. She still would initiate texting and all (which is when I would make plans), but it was significantly less than others.

She has a very great group of friends that all talk highly of her. (Her friends really are awesome, good hearted people)

I find out she takes meds for GAD.

We got closer and there was one outburst before we were official. We were staying together for the night and needed to go to the store. She didn’t want to go, so I said “No problem, see you in a bit!” She got upset and wanted to come. We get back and she initiates intimacy. Randomly she pushes me away and seems pretty upset. I ask what’s wrong and she said she just got out of the mood. She continued to get more and more upset and explained she was hurt that I just had to go to the store instead of stay with her. Then she was mad that I “made” her go because “she wasn’t just going to stay alone”. She was on her period so I thought “whatever, it’s just that time of the month”.

Well relatively soon after, we become official.

We’re having good times. Things between our families are good. She said she loves me first. She’s 22 and gave me her virginity.

One night I make mishandled a situation (no I’ll intent or bad attitude, just a mistake on my end). Her response was to just start turning around and either saying something mean or go silent. Night ended in her apologizing after I just gave up trying to fix it and shut up.

Well come a trip she takes with her family. I let her do her thing and she goes two days without contacting me at all so I reach out to check up on her. She comes back and complains that her friend was texting her sister instead of her on the trip. Apparently she was on her phone a lot. I ask her what’s up with the communication (since she said she expects talking on the phone at least once a day in a relationship) and she said that she keeps her walls up and that I should be the one reaching out while she’s out of town.

Another thing happened where she was stressed about something at home and asked for my input. Whenever I tried to say something she would very rudely cut me off and yell. She was taking her stress out on me. I tried like 6 times and then just gave up. Then she threw a fit about how I was “punishing her” by not going on with what I was trying to say. She said I should have faith in her that she would stop cutting me off even after 6 times despite me telling her to not cut me off or I would stop talking.

All seemed great but I found out she was sexting some guy she met right after she met me. This happened for about a month until she told him she didn’t want to be sending nudes anymore because she met someone (me) and wanted to respect it. Then they proceeded to just casually text while he was hitting on her. She just mildly flirted back until we became official then she cut back. He continued to text her but she would ignore it. I asked her if she had messaged him at all while we were official and she said no. Turns out that was a lie. It was only once though and she stopped because she felt bad. This stuff isn’t inherently wrong, but I didn’t think she was that type of girl so I asked why she did that and lied.

Her explanation was that she didn’t know how committed I was and didn’t want to commit herself. Also that he was her friends friend. She mentioned that with the text while we were official, it was because she didn’t want to be mean and felt bad (her friend said he was down and she should text him). She said she lied because she didn’t want to upset me or hurt me. She said she thought about texting him and felt it wasn’t right but did it anyways.

This didn’t register as a healthy way of handling things. Especially since she said she’s extremely loyal. But whatever, moved past it.

At this point things are starting to register as at least inconsistent with her. The outbursts are becoming more and more frequent. Her general attitude is “Yeah, I’ve got baggage. Take it or leave it” (her words).

Eventually she opens up more about the GAD and the way she handles things is in angry outbursts to the people close to her. She had a counselor but never mentioned the anger, name calling, etc. so the counselor said “It’s not you. They should not be upset at you for your anxiety” not knowing how she treats other people. BUT! She only treats people close to her like this. Never her friends or anyone else. So the only people that know she has this side of her are family, me, and her exes (who apparently all left her for this very reason).

Fast forward to a trip abroad. Ho. Lee. Sh**.

She lost her meds. Got some more eventually, but only after 5 days of not taking them. Now I had seen her without her meds before and it was bad, but just from a missed day. The first couple days on the trip were fine, but day 3 of this 16 day trip I saw a new side of her.

I had to learn how to walk on egg shells real quick.

Just and example of things that would trigger her: I would be navigating (she didn’t really understand the navigation) and sometimes would nod my head in a direction we need to go as I was looking at the map. That apparently really upset her so she would start being very mean and calling me names. I would tell her to be nice and that would just set her off more. She would tell me she doesn’t need me to say that to her because she knows she’s being mean. She needs me to comfort her. So ok, I try to comfort her and she pushes me away.

That’s pretty much how the whole trip went. That kinda stuff where I would basically have to just suck up to her to keep her from flipping out. I was in a foreign country with her, didn’t know the language at all, didn’t know anyone else there, so I found a peaceful balance with just kissing up to her.

The trip ended and we go back home.

Apparently since I’ve seen that side of her it’s ok for her to just let lose on me now.

If I try to take her home while she’s flipping out, she opens the door of the moving car. Things like that.

One night she was super happy and then flipped to super upset (how it always goes with her outbursts). She begins to say we won’t work out. I say “you’re right, it’s over”. Uh oh. She starts feeling out and yelling at me. She tells me to take it back and apologize while she has the car door open. Well I don’t want her to jump out so I do as she says.

I leave her when we get to her house. I leave her house and get a ton of angry calls telling me “F*** YOU. I HATE YOU.” and “YOU’RE NEVER GOING TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE LIKE ME. I’M THE GREATEST GIRL YOU’LL EVER MEET”.
Then she wants to meet up so I can “See what I’m missing out on”. (This is all the same night).

I said no. She said she was going to drive to my house and would crash her car on the way because she can’t drive while she’s freaking out.

Ok I meet up with her and she apologizes, then flips to telling me off a bit, then apologizes again. That cycle for a bit and eventually she says she’s pregnant. Ok what? I say get a test and she says she’ll only do it with me. Damn it, now we’re back together. But she got her period so it’s all good and she’s still her same old self.

Anyways, that’s the most of it.

263,"(Canadian grading system) 80-85 = A- // 85-95= A // 95+ = A+

A little background so those of you who read understand my situation better.

&amp;#x200B;

Grade 5-9 my GPA was less then 1.0

I was not graded at all. My final grades on my report card would be (I) - incomplete. This is due to missing a lot of school, not paying attention, being severely depressed. I would play games all day, watch movies &amp; be unproductive.

I recently got over my depression &amp; I am now repeating grade 9 as I got 0 credits last year. I consider this a fresh start.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been a month since school &amp; I have all applied courses (so my classes are easy). My counselor said if I get all 95%+ this year i will automatically get academic grade 10 classes next yea This is awesome!.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*(Math)\*\*

Difficult, I find the lectures abstruse to follow as I don't know the basics of what is being taught. I've gotten all 80%+ &amp; one C+ on my tests. I don't do my homework so this cuts my mark. I average around 85% on tests/quizzes. I learn the full chapter a night before a test. If I learn whats being taught 2 hours everyday I could easily get a 95%+ on test days but Instead I learn as much as I could in one night and Get A-'s. We start a new chapter tomorrow.

\*\*(French)\*\*

I don't do the homework &amp; I don't focus in class. Why? Because it is too much work. I don't understand French at all and being put into a grade 9 level french class is not so great. If I try i'm positive I would average around 90%. But to much work needed.

\*\*(Geography)\*\*

Maintaining a 87% grade so far. I do not study and I do not try.  If I do try i could easily maintain a 97%+. I just need to come home revise notes, study based on the topic etc.

\*\*(English)\*\*

Got sick missed 4 days, got left behind in book and completely gave up. Luckily we only had to write about 1 chapter so I got a B+ on that and now we begin a new book.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't try my very best &amp; I don't pay attention. I'm probably averaging around a C+ in french, A- in math, A in geography &amp; B+ in English. This is all without trying &amp; it's only been a month of school. I wan't to stop being lazy and put my full effort in studying &amp; getting good grades. I want to achieve 95%+ in all subjects.

&amp;#x200B;

I wan't to learn how to achieve 95% in all subjects. I come home and play video games, watch TV shows, Eat &amp; Sleep  &amp; before a test I stay up all night learning.

&amp;#x200B;

I need tie management, A schedule, guidance etc.

I am complete beginner, I don't know how to study, how to learn, how to get good grades &amp; how to manage my time. If i learn all this i'm positive I'll reach my goals.

I want to go into a test confident, active, well rested &amp; knowing i'm going to get a 20/20.

Not being unconfident, unsure, sleepy, lazy &amp; hoping to get at least a 16/20.

265,"Hi there, so just a bit of back story.

So I just got this job a few months ago and even got my friend a job here. long story short there's been a shift lead who's been harassing pretty much every girl. My friend went to the manager about it even though a group of us we're compiling a list of things to go to HR with. We all thought the manager would help her, that the manager ended up going out of her way to protect this employee because he's been with the company longer.

Needless to say I think I've lost all respect for my manager and pretty much every employee is talking about leaving. And it's nearly non-stop with this shift lead to, I'm pretty sure he has some sort of social disorder but that's still no excuse for his behavior and near grinding up of girls or like 20 when he's 40.

So yeah, I went to HR oh, and they're telling me not to tell any of my other employees that I went to HR, until their investigation is complete. (it is very likely though that other people went to HR and they are already looking into it) for the integrity of the investigation.

Should I actually keep this to myself? I'm still a bit untrusting from having my manager completely try to screw us over, and I don't want to lose the upper hand in the situation (us employees have been loosely coordinating this for a while)",08Oct2019,1

I feel like we wouldn’t be able to entertain outdoors anymore because of it. I really don’t want to hear my neighbor and his drunk friends pissing while I celebrate my daughter’s birthday or whatever we have going on. 

How do I approach my neighbor and ask him to put up a barrier/cover it? Or do I just alert the city and let them deal? Are there laws or something about nuisances? We live in an area that has super minimal HOA and they never have asked us or any neighbor to do anything to our homes fyi, so idk if they could help? I’m at a loss as to why anyone would even want that.",08Oct2019,2
272,"My ex and I (F, 19) broke up about 2 months ago. I have been pretty torn up about it until recently, and am now thinking of how we can still have a friendship. Since we've been apart, I made a bad decision and had fooled around with one of our mutual friends. I'm wondering if I should keep this to myself to protect him or if he deserves to know and can decide on our friendship after that.

275,"Hi all, new here. 

So here goes a long story- and I say this from a massive place of privilege, so please don’t tell me I’m lucky and to suck it up. I feel like I can’t speak to my friends or family about it as they did not grow up in this environment.

My husband and I are both in our early 30’s.

I didn’t come from a particularly good upbringing, my parents simply didn’t parent well, my in context of this, set unrealistic expectations and would not except anything less then perfect. I was not free to choose anything but university when leaving high school and was expected to excel at that. I worked full time and studied full time, nothing less was expected of me. I graduated with a Bachelor degree with honors and  worked hard in my chosen field for nearly 10 years. I had worked my way up into a manager role, with a company car and making over six figures a year. However after multiple run ins of bullying and a very stressful environment I was burnt out and miserable. I wasn’t sleeping and would work from the time my alarm went off in the morning to the time I went to bed. I have even had several miscarriages in the past 2 years, and although trying so hard, sadly am yet to have a living baby. I gave that career every ounce of my soul and got nothing in return. And below you will see why I felt I had to- 

During that time, I met my now husband, we’ve been together 7 years and married nearly 4 of those. He is from a very well off family. He had also made some very good/ lucky real estate investments with inheritance money when he was younger. I had no idea the extent of the wealth until after we were married. This did allow us to buy multiple proprieties worth a combined few million with very little debt. These properties give us good rental returns. 

My husband is high up in the company he works for making also well over six figures. 

We have savings over 6 figures. 

We also incredibly lucky enough to benefit from a trust. 

Now here’s the problem-

I felt incredibly guilty about all of this, you might say, “wow, suck it up princess, look how lucky you are”. But after finding out the extent of the wealth I felt like I needed to work harder and harder to prove I wasn’t a gold digger or something of the sorts. I was miserable.

Seeing how miserable I was my husband and his family encouraged me to quit work and go to technical college to learn the trade I always wanted to do. I had previously attempted to retrain in the same course while working in my last career, but part time and had failed to finish as I would prioritise work over everything else in my life. 

I quit my job 6 months ago and I have been at full time college since- I love what I am now learning and excited to see where it takes me. 

But the guilt still looms. 

Whenever I have tried to look at jobs, I have been encouraged to not work by my husband and his family and to focus fully on my studies because we don’t need my income and to my tendency to over commit and over work. 

And whist this may sound great, coming from my modest, middle class background this makes me feel SO guilty. My friends all snarl and my sister thinks I’m a lazy cow. No one on my side is aware of the full extent of the wealth as we choose to hide it. I am pretty sure my parents don’t have a clue about the properties we own.

I think the worst thing though is the eye brows raises and comments I get when filling in forms when I put “student” in the job section. Today really got to me, I was rudely asked today at an appointment if I was on welfare. I didn’t know what to say, I nearly cried to be honest. 

I know I never want to go back to my previous career, I hated it, but so much of my self worth and belonging was wrapped up in it, no matter how unhealthy it was. 

How can I move past the guilt, navigate my family and friends and focus on being fortunate and achieve my career dreams!? The guilt that none of this is my doing and just pure luck in who I married is eating me alive. 

Thank you for taking the time to read and not judge and respond.

276,Bit of backstory i’m a 24M just graduated college com sci degree. I have been wanting to get sterilized since 18 no doctor will do it. Anyway I always use condoms (for stds as well) and pull out anyway. This women 25F i has been seeing as a fwb also was using the nuva ring. We didn’t see each other for a while then one month ago she hit me up. We have sex I used a condom ( I store them correctly and pinch the tip and stuff) . When I got close to cumming still had the condom on she held me so I couldn’t pull out. The condom didn’t break but maybe some semen  got through. Well anyway she is pregnant now and she says she didn’t have sex with anyone else. She doesn’t want to abort and i’m going to get a paternity test. I never wanted kids my parents are religious and had 6 kids me being the eldest took care of them while they worked and it led to my current state of  not liking babies. I understand I have to pay child support if it is mine and just sign over parental custody. How do I do this and how is child support calculated I make around 50k. I wish her and this kid have good life but I don’t want to have kids. So yeah How do I sign over parental rights and pay child support since legally I have to and would want to.,08Oct2019,0
277,"my roommates think that i might seem unstable to drive two hours to ambush her and demand that she gives my things back( she legit lied to my face and stole half of my wardrobe no joke} and potentially embarrass her and cause a scene. Obviously she wont know that i am coming, so the surprise should shock her enough and im sure that if I sneak into her dorm (we are twins that go to different schools) i can get my stuff so when she gets back to her room and sees that my clothes are gone from her closet she will be upset and confused ( because all of the things she took are mine ) then i will send her an ambiguous text telling her that i decided to come and visit but had to leave  then send a picture of me with me clothes.

280,"I am in my early 20s (male) and got a pretty good job straight out of university, 1.5yrs ago. Thing is, I am now realizing that I have a lot of ""friends"" because I was so involved in university but I didn't maintain any meaningful connections after graduating. Sure I have a few really close uni friends that I hang out with often but I mostly hang out with my work friends and high school friends. Even then though, for some reason I feel a deep loneliness when it comes to friends or even romantic relationships. 

I feel like a weird introverted extrovert because I can be a social butterfly and everything but I usually avoid parties (and don't drink either) and I am also extremely oblivious in certain contexts. I think back to several occasions the most recent just being like 5 months ago where somebody may have shown interest in me romantically and I didn't even realize until now, and now that I have it seems like it was plain as day. Me showing a weird level of courage here, I asked the person if I was right about my hunch, and I WAS...they have now moved super far away though.

I am trying to find more things to get involved with to take up my time and kind of get me to feel happier as well as get past the 9-5 grind being such a big part of my day. I remember doing cool stuff and building new skills was great as a student. But I am finding it hard to really find anything interesting. Socially, to meet new people I don't know what to do. Meetups feel weird most of the time (lots of...interesting characters) and I don't party or drink, I'll go to the bar or pub with coworkers but that's about it, and I still feel weird there. 

I have only wanted to ask 1 person out recently and I was hesitant at first because they were my friend. When I did (because I didn't want to regret never asking) she said that she probably doesn't think that's the best idea because we work at the same firm. I brought it up pretty casually and we're still friends but nobody else has sparked my interest recently. Half joking here, but sometimes I feel like I am either oblivious when somebody is interested or rejected when I ask, I think I am going to die alone LOL. I have never been in a serious relationship before just because I never focused on that aspect of my life that much but now it's starting to stress me out. I kinda feel like I have a lot to give and I want to share my time in that romantic context with someone ya know. As well as I feel like I am losing the diversity of thought in my friend group that I had during uni, and I am also realizing that, that was pretty important to me.

I have a weird way of dealing with feeling lonely or depressed and I have talked to my therapist about it too. I really really try hard to see the positive in things and joke around and stuff but these feelings are weighing on me heavy and making me feel a little hopeless. The weirdest thing is, I feel like I don't struggle to make friends at all, I find people get close to me extremely easily and I will even usually be in charge of setting up hangouts and stuff in my social groups (friends, coworkers etc.) and yet I still feel like I am missing something and end up feeling lonely. I feel like there's some other factors here such as me feeling unfulfilled at work but I am making progress in changing those situations.

I guess I've been rambling for a bit and probably didn't even write a lot of what I meant to but my main questions are:

* As a young person who doesn't drink or party, what are the best places to meet people (as friends or otherwise)?
* What are the coolest meaningful ways to spend your time as an adult? I know this is open ended and I am doing some research to find what would be interesting to me but learning about what's out there would be awesome too.
* What am I doing wrong? 
* Would appreciate any other advice in general.

Also, I just want to apologize for the rambly nature of this post. I have been thinking about this a lot recently and it just came out in a just barely coherent wall of text.",08Oct2019,1

282,"Hey, thank you for taking your time and reading this.

I've moved to a new city recently, got on tinder one night and matched with this amazing woman. We hit it off and talk for a week until we meet up. It was very comfortable and natural, we got along so well and just talked, smoked, cuddled, and watched some of the office. 
She stays the next two nights, and the third night she goes to help her with friend and then came back and crashed over again.
Now a week later her sister is visiting and I feel something off that she's not into being in a relationship. She mentioned before that she always been in a relationship since coming here and haven't been single for long. Anyways her sister visits she barely talks to me this whole week, messages once a day or every few days. Then she texts me one night that we are moving too fast and she doesn't wanna be in a relationship. I ask her if she wants to stay as friends, and she agrees. While talking yesterday, I offer her to buy some weed and we can smoke. I got to meet her sister and drive both of them to a view point and we smoked, and had some really good conversations. Then I drove them back and dropped them home. 

I honestly really like her and I don't know what to do. We're both very attractive and got a long just way too well. I'm a very relationship kind of guy, very clingy and cute. Also I did say I love you way too soon to her. So that might've been red flags for her? Idk.
A lot of people think I'm douchy or scary just from my looks but I'm extremely friendly (I think cz I'm tall) so idk if she doesn't have trust for me yet?

283,"My gf and I (22) have been officially together for a little over a month. Things have been good overall and I’m not considering breaking up with her because of this but she has told me that she has basically a list of mental illnesses. Just the ones that I can remember her say she has is: depression (she has been officially diagnosed for), anxiety, bipolar, adhd, autism, retardation, along with others. I’m basically certain that she’s lying to me about some if not most of these  (especially the autism and retardation) and I don’t really know how to confront her about it and I don’t understand why she would lie about these things. 

I pretty much know she’s lying about having autism and retardation because she shows no symptoms and if she did have these, I’m pretty sure she wouldn’t be able to get a driver’s liscense. 

I feel like if I call her out on it she’s gonna say she was just kidding or something like that. The situations where she told me about these things were pretty serious so if she did say that, it would really annoy me and probably make me angry. For example, the first time she met my dad was when she decided to say to him that she has depression, anxiety, bipolar, and adhd. Another example: I was getting mad at my phone because it was running really slow so I called it autistic and then retarded out of frustration (yes I know I shouldn’t have said it). Her response to that was basically along the lines of “dont say those things.” To which I responded that she says stuff like that as well. Her reply was “it’s different for me because I actually have those.” 

I’m aware that this is potentially manipulation if she is lying, but I don’t want to just jump to that conclusion. Everything else in our relationship is good so I don’t understand why she would do this. My question is if it seems like she’s lying based on these situations, and if so how should I handle it/confront her in a civil way?",08Oct2019,1

I do have anxieties and take medication and have been feeling great the last few months! However, this has been a problem ever since I was young: I don't get joy from anything if I don't have junk food or anything involved.

Last week we decided to go out one on one for the first time and it was all going extremely well. We decided to go somewhere else to grab dinner so we hopped in her car since I had ubered.

Her car was a week old since she had to get a new one after her old one completely broke down. We hopped in and she began to drive out of the parking lot into a two way street. I was comfortable around her and like any other passenger I put all of my trust in her. She came to a stop and I was looking at her talking to me. We were supposed to take a left and she didn’t really look on both sides of the road so the car who was driving on the other lane hit us at approx. 50mph when we were going ~15mph.

my parents are divorced. my mom just had a fight with her boyfriend (it got physical it seems) and is sleeping on the couch, meaning mu sister cant get back inside without my mom catching her. its 2:47 am, my mom hasnt gone to sleep. my sisters phone is at 1%, thwres an outlet outside and ahe has a charger but the outlet isnt working.

i feel really bad that shes just sitting on our porch :( its not cold or anything, but its gotta really really suck.

theres a backdoor but its far too noisy

my mom has insomnia and i dont know if she’ll sleep soon. she took a benadryl a few minutes ago to try and get tired.

304,"I (23M) had an argument with my sister(21F) a few minutes ago. A few weeks we had a discussion about my hair pulling disorde. Basically i would rip off my hair, including my beard and body hair; run it against my face, stick it in my ear, put it against my lip and brush my eyelashes with it. When i was done with it i would just dump it on the floor. Thats where i get jealous that some other people that have this disorder just eat their own hair cause at least there would be less of a mess. 

So me and my sister were discussing a way to keep the room clean despite my hair pulling. This lead to the idea of me putting my hair in a bottle and then throwing it out at the end of the day. Thing is, i didn't throw it out. I kept it and collected it. It also wasn't just skin. It was also nails and scraps of skin that i bit off. I guess i was thinking that i could make a jerky or age it or whatever. Improve the texture so to speak. 

Well today my sister confronted me about this. She said it almost made her throw up and i think she was angry crying but I'm not too sure cause i couldn't see without glasses. She had me take these 2 bottles that i had and flush them down the toilet. I didn't.

I took two empty bottles in my pocket and the two gross bottles in my hand and went to the bathroom and pretended to flush them away. My sister believes me. She thinks i did it when instead i just hid them away. We are going to tell our mother about this cause it is something we need to discuss. 

I guess basically, i have no fucking idea what to do or how to handle this. Or even if i need to. Like i blamed my compulsion but at the end of the day, i just want to keep these gross ass bottles. It was hard to admit out loud and still kind of hard to write that i wanted to eat my own corn jerky. Main reason i posted here instead of the confession subreddit was just to see if anyone had advice.

I do go to a therapist but i didn't even mention this to them. I recognized that what i was doing was gross, but i guess i didn't see just how gross it was untill my sister compared it to the infamous cum jar. I guess i just needed to write this down, sort my thoughts and make sure to remember it for my next therapy session. I don't even know what else to type up but i feel like i should keep typing. 

I wish this was more cohesive but it just kind of dissolved to rambling. I cried after words, thinking about what im having my sister deal with. I don't want to upset her. Plus it hurts when she accuses me of not caring about others even though i do put on that act to justify my actions. 

Fuck. I really have to stop typing but i don't want and do want to and i don't know. So yeah, just looking for general advice and some basic venting / thinking.",08Oct2019,4

306,"Hi, everyone! I just wanted some advice on my current situation at home.

Basically, it SHOULD just be me, my mom and my dad. My brother moved out years ago to live with his wife. My aunt, however, has been staying with us for 8 years. She used to live with her own kids in their own apartment but when she quit her job and then started gambling away her money, she soon lost her apartment. Her kids (my cousins) are delinquents. Her daughter had dropped out of Middle school and had gotten into drugs and staying away from home for long periods of time and has two kids that she leaves with her mother while she gets the welfare (she lets them use the food stamps as well.) Her son's wife had divorced him because he wasn't working, was cheating on her and was also doing a bit of dope on the side. She soon kicked him out and he came to live with us, as well. Oh, and he brought along his side-bitch, too.
To be perfectly frank, the entire fucking family are obnoxious, inconsiderate pricks. None of them want to work, which isn't fair. I sometimes don't want to go to work because I don't trust my cousin. He's stolen from us before and I know he knows how to pick locks (yes, there's a lock on my bedroom door because of them) since his sister's BF had shown him how to. (His sister's BF is a giant thief, too. He almost stole from us recently, being able to pick his way through the lock on our garage door until my mom caught him and told him to get out before she calls the police.)

Another thing to keep in mind, my mother is an enabler. She is too fucking nice for her own good to these fucking leeches. I keep telling her that she needs to tell them to get a job or fuck right off. She doesn't want to do it, because she doesn't want to cause a rift within the family (despite everybody else except the Leech Family telling her the same thing.)

There's so much more I can tell you guys about just how shitty the Leech Family is, but this post is long already. I need your advice; what should I do?

My mom works hard (she basically wears the pants in the family, so neither I nor my dad have the authority to kick these fuckers out, and they wouldn't listen to us anyway) and I don't want to cause her any more stress. I have contemplated, however, giving up some of my own savings to buy my aunt a ticket out of here, but she doesn't want to leave. I can't very well drag her to airport, either. I figure if she leaves, her kids will go somewhere else, too. But I'm probably wrong about that. I have also thought about calling the cops on her kids and then calling ICE on her. But as anyone who has family members who are illegal immigrants knows, that's one of the scummiest things you can do to your own blood.

I'm at my wits' end. What should I do?
Just keep saving up enough money to move out? (If my cousin doesn't steal that money first, that is.)

Thank you for reading. ☺ I look forward to reading your responses.",08Oct2019,1
307,"I honestly don’t know where else to put this because I feel like a freak honestly.

310,"Second time posting because nobody replied the first time. I’ll make it shorter 


I have an online friend, we’ve been talking(primarily texting, almost never calling) on regular basis for 2 years now. We were really close at first but now we mainly have talks that usually turn into arguments about things we disagree on or talks about mundane things/empty small talk.
Sometimes I ask her to not talk about subjects that annoy me or make me feel uncomfortable or angry.

Recently she met a date online and was sending me many texts about how he’s perfect and how she feels like he’s an extension of her and how she can talk to him about anything. I’m happy for her but I was telling her to be careful since I know she can get easily attached and they’ve only known each other for a few days at that point. She reassured me that he feels the same about her but it made me realize that I’m probably a really shitty friend for not allowing her to communicate freely with me all this time since I ask her not to talk about certain subjects.

This past weekend we talked about this and I also opened up to her about being depressed and having thoughts of harming myself plus terrible family things.  These are thoughts that I’ve been having for the past months but I’m afraid that the timing that I opened up to her about these things might make it look like I’m distracting her from her boyfriend, which is not my intention. I’m happy that she’s happy but her sending all the boyfriend praising tests and making me realize how shit of a friend I am was kinda the breaking point of my bottled up emotional health which is why I opened up to her in the first place.

Our talking has been very minimal for the past few days. I feel guilty for opening up to her since she’s been telling me how happy she is before I opened up to her. I feel like at this point I’d just be dragging her down. We both enjoy each other as friends and care about each other and wouldn’t want to stop being friends and talking but all we’ve been doing lately is disagreeing on things, misunderstanding each other and saying empty topics to each other. I couldn’t imagine not talking to her though, we’ve gotten each other through though times. Personally I’m just at a low in my life right now though while she’s found someone who is like gold to her. she’s a good friend and one of my only friends and I can’t tell if not talking to her would be better or worse, because I know that she cares for me but our friendship is in ruins and she can’t even feel like she can clearly communicate with me and it’s my fault. I would feel selfish to keep talking to her",08Oct2019,1

314,"Four years ago I was diagnosed with OCD (I was 28) and learned that since I was a young teenager it started to happen. As things got worse and worse the people who were around me, teachers, parents, other kids never did anything I often just was told that I was crazy or weird. I had a dog and he was the only thing that kept me going, to look after him. I became so depressed when he passed that I had an episode which landed me in the hospital because my now husband called the emergency. He was the first person to ever care about me. I’m saying this because, probably because of my attachment to my childhood dog, I have many pets now that I have my own place. Right now I have two amazing dogs that we rescued from a shelter and three rats. Then bad things started to happen again. To keep it short because it is too painful to talk about, within a few months I lost two rats from old age, one from pneumonia, and just a few weeks ago I lost another one of my babies to a pituitary tumor. Of all my rats that I had this time last year, I have one with me. We are trying to find her a friend but tonight it all went wrong. Everyday, I’m asking myself are they happy, are they happy now still and I have to check them over and over asking my husband over and over. I have to keep adopting rats because I can’t just have one alone, they can’t be happy without a friend. I can’t leave the apartment without unplugging everything to try and stop a fire, this one is really bad. Sometimes if someone outside looks at me the wrong way I start freaking out that they are going to try and hurt my dogs when we are in a walk. Sometimes my dogs get really anxious when I’m getting ready to leave that I end up not going out at all even to my office. Now every time my rat makes a congested noise or eats funny I have a panic attack that they have pneumonia or a tumor. I had a job which require me to travel which I had to quit because I was having so much anxiety about leaving my pets (what happened if one passed or something horrible happened while I was away?). Now I just accepted another job because I was so excited about it when I got the offer, but I have to travel again for it. I’ve tried everything to help my OCD. Meds, which I’ve tried many different types, I’ve had therapy for 3 years every week doing CBT, but the OCD doesn’t stop. What else can I do? I’m so worried about everything, about bad thoughts that I it’s so hard to enjoy anything in my life, I can’t even choose what to eat or watch on the TV when my husband asks because I think what if I choose something that hurts my pets. And I’ve come to believe in my mind that my husband is invincible. Nothing will ever happen to him he will always be here.

I drank about 2-3 times a month before I started this job, but I would smoke weed before bed just about every night.

I'm not getting drunk every night, but I can't remember the last time I didn't consume alcohol in a 24 hour period.

I guess the advice I'm looking for is: should I start smoking again in pursuit of lessening my alcohol intake? From what I can tell, weed isn't as bad for your overall health alcohol is.

This causes open sores and blisters that force his claws off his paws then they grow back a while later. This is incredibly painful for him and has a very high risk of infection. Our vet has offered us two options for treatments. Pain medications and a life of infection meds or we can have him declawed.

My vet office banned declawing over 20 years ago and has not performed one since then as it is inhumane, but the fact that she offered it for Pokey makes me think it must be the right thing.

He used to exercise, study, and hang out with friends. After we started dating, all of that just disappeared. He stopped the exercise, he stopped studying, he stopped wanting to hang out with his friends. He always said that he needs nothing else in the world but me, and I find it sweet, but it’s concerning. He was such a happy guy while going to the gym, it was something he loved. He used to do weights, pull-ups, and run for hours. He almost failed his first semester in college because of this mentality. Now, I tell him to e-mail me assignments to print them out and he promises he will do it. Instead, he plays video games, forgets the assignments, and goes to sleep. When he calls me in the morning, he talks to me about how he was too tired to do it and that he’ll do it at work. I once offered to do it myself, and he shut that down and said “it’s my responsibility, don’t do it.” I like that he at least still wants to do it himself, but it’s not practical. Why play video games all night instead of taking 30 minutes to finish an easy writing assignment? As for hanging out with friends, I know it’s because most of them have moved on with their lives and found their calling (many of them left for the army), but he still finds no motivation to seek out more friends. He isn’t clingy, in fact, he just likes being alone most of the time now, and it bothers me because he’s isolating himself.

This all worries me because he went from super ambitious to incredibly unmotivated in the matter of months. He’s really smart, and I know he could be doing better, but he doesn’t show it anymore. Is it the comfort of our relationship that’s got him like this? He’s motivated in other areas of his life like cleaning his room, doing the dishes, walking his dog, taking his car to the mechanic, but the core areas of his life that require motivation have just dissipated.

He’s an incredibly lovely person, a real gentleman, and I want advice on how to help him. I have tried suggesting studying together, but all he wants to do is cuddle. I’ve tried suggesting we go to the gym together, but ultimately stops because he just wants to sleep. I’ve tried introducing him to many people, but he just doesn’t care anymore. And before you ask, no I don't baby him. I tell him how important these things are in life and he says he understands and that he’ll change, but he won’t act upon it.

We usually text to talk to each other, as that's the only way we can talk.  But it is always me who starts conversations and she always replies with one word or one sentence, hardly putting any effort in. It never used to be like this, we used to talk for hours on end only about a year ago. But now every conversation is cut short as she doesn't put any effort in. She has recently said that she doesn't like people as much who constantly talk to her, so I've given her space and stopped talking to her as much as I used to, but nothing's changed. I've tried talking to her but everytime we always end up in a bad mood and once we didn't talk to each other for a few weeks after. I recognised that was partly my fault so I apologised. We used to have so much fun talking to each other, but now I just feel sad as I know our friendship may never be what it was like. I know you might say ""well just end the friendship if you aren't happy"", but I don't want to end a friendship we've worked so hard to create and she isn't like the rest of my friends, she's never judged me and I can tell her anything, and recently she added me to her private story on snapchat only for her best friends so we are still friends. I've tried many things such as reminding her of what our friendship used to be like and asking if anything is wrong but nothing has changed. The last conversation we had I was telling her I'd been on holiday to a theme park and she just replied with nice so I decided to tell her what all the rides were like and she replied with nice. So if anyone has any suggestions about what I should do or what I should say to restore our friendship, I would greatly appreciate it. I understand that we may not be as bestest of friends when we first became friends but I would still like to call her my friend.",08Oct2019,1
334,"I have a mystery illness and have an appointment with my doctor this week 
I’m pretty sure it’s mosquito borne so I’m a little concerned. However I have a history of doctors kind of dismissing me. 
I was in the emergency room the other night for what they thought was too much alcohol but they said I was only rather drunk, nothing insane, and the other symptoms I presented at the emergency room will be relevant to telling my doctor, however I am worried he will just discount me because I was drunk and not listen to the symptoms I’ve explained. But something really is wrong. 
Does anyone know how to talk to doctors while projecting credibility? I’m a very sort of apologetic, traumatizes and constant joke-making  person and I think people like me okay, but absolutely never take me seriously. 
All suggestions welcome. Thanks so much.",08Oct2019,3

338," We were in 2 months of our relationship, and were in same college. In the beginning there were a lot of promises made and it felt like she's all whom I'll need in my life. 
As usual, in college she had few guys flirting her and later came to knew that the one, who used to call her at odd hours for the most silliest questions had a bad charecter, which she was well aware of. Whenever any of those guys called her, I eagerly asked her what they said apart from asking for notes and stuff (since we were in same department) just out of jealousy, to which she felt like I was getting overpossesive and didn't trust her. 
Again, whenever we had busy weekend schedules, I asked her if we could have some time alone without friends in the evening after the classes to which she agreed but never took the initiative after any class, I had to ask her whenever I felt, nothing was there from her side. Later came to know that she felt like I was trying to make her submissive and was trying to seperate from her friends( but we used to spend all day in class with our friends, it was only in the evening I asked her for some time together alone)

She eventually broke up with these excuses and whenever I tried to clarify she always said she had no feelings for me, we were destined to part, I'm unworthy, etc. and even after listening to all these I tried my best to make her convinced, ignoring my self respect but she didn't reply.

Some days later, I saw that ill charectered guy passing compliments on her insta pics to which she replied positively (on the contrary she forbade me to pass compliments on her insta pics earlier when we were in relationship). 

Thus it all came to an end.

339,"My wife and her family have many issues which they ask each other about. It is like listening to a complaints hotline on loudspeaker. Each of them bounce their dumb ideas off each other in a bid to out stupid the worst solution. I often wonder how they got to where they are if this was in their DNA. It is good they interact often but its never for a social reason.

Recently my step daughter 27, got a rescue dog, it is a rottweiler nearly 4 years old. Never interacted with other animals, was tied up in a backyard on a chain and given food scraps while sleeping in its own shit. They already have a 2 year old rottweiler and an 8 year old collie.

I warned them about getting this other dog, she will get jealous quickly about the other two, food aggression being the worst. Even patting one of the other dogs will mentally aggravate her. My suggestion was to ease this new dog into the new environment by slowly taking her from the previous life. They would have to keep her confined sometimes to achieve this. I know its mean, but it would avoid a bad situation. 

1 week later the collie was ripped open on her neck and back thigh. They took her to a nearby vet, which don't do anything unless you pay first. They took as much as her card had on it just so they would begin stitching up the wounds. Then the step daughter rings her mother asking for money. This vet wanted $4000 just to dress and stitch the wounds. Other surgeries would follow to keep the dog alive. I said, take her to the other vet which is only 5 minutes extra drive away. (because i know the owner) I could call them to see to your dog. But they already began so, can't say no yet.

No no no, don't listen to me. They keep the dog at this vet which asks for another $8000. But that price doesn't include Antibiotics, redressing, future visits and injections. The step daughter thought then about selling her car just to cover this cost which means she needed to borrow one of ours to get to and from work. So my wife says, we will pay it.

We also ended up with the dog to nurse her and keep her medication up. I noticed immediately that the stitches were about the quality of the 1800's hack jobs on a civil war battlefield before they send you home to amputate the leg. The infection was also spreading out from the wounds. I took it upon myself to take her to the other vet i mentioned which looked at it in disgust and checked everything. Cleaned the wounds too (the other vet didn't) Restitched the mess job, put a cone around her neck so she wouldn't chew them out. Then told me after that it would have only cost $700 if i had brought the dog in when it happened. They also changed the medication as the other one was assisting the infection to spread and not fighting it at all. Her natural immunity was actually keeping her alive.

So only 1 day later the collie was looking better and feeling better. Her wound was actually healing, changed to a lighter colour from a black with red around it. It only cost an extra $400 and this included extra visits, antibiotics, redressing bandages and blood tests. They don't even charge if a stitch gets pulled out by the dog.

The other rottweiler needed to go of course, but they were looking for another home for it. Meanwhile the 2 year old was threatened with those sharp teeth and late night weekend vet visit. So they took her to another relatives house which has no dogs. I heard about this and asked if they had children? and yes, they have a 6 year old girl and 10 year old boy. They love this dog... I just had to shudder. Told them this dog in order to live needs to have time spent with it to learn to socialize. Other than that, she should be put down because she is a risk to people and other animals because of her upbringing.

Next thing i heard (because there was an attempt to keep it from me) the dog is no longer alive. I don't know if she attacked one of those kids or someone else. But put down immediately was all i heard.

So do i bother giving advice if nobody listens to it?",08Oct2019,1

341,"I am textbook PTSD. I have had so many traumatic events in my life that I’ve lost count....and unfortunately, the hits just keep on coming. I definitely have PTSD but medications (aside from my anxiety relief that I use as needed) scare me, and I have never had consistent or proper treatment for it. There are a lot of things that I need, such as my dog, in some situations...and I learned that in order to fly with him, it is best if I can have an official diagnosis so that he can be qualified as an actual service animal. I am not getting into the debate about whether or not service animals for mental health disorders are real...I think my question is, as a person who works in healthcare, I know that seeing a PTSD diagnosis causes many people to pass judgment. It’s also considered a disability. I guess I’m wondering what kinds of negative things can arise from an official diagnosis- and also if I can get proper treatment for the disorder without an official diagnosis.

I just found out I am pregnant by my ex boyfriend whom I dated a few years ago. We recently reconnected and had sex, but we are not together and I don’t plan on being with him. I’m terrified of this new thing I’m being faced with.
My issue is my mom is very against abortion. As I am an adult I know it’s ultimately up to me, but I still live at home while I’m going to school, I’m on her insurance, she’s part of my life. I’m afraid to tell her I’m pregnant because I am considering abortion and I know she is very against this. I don’t want her to hate me or judge me, not having her support would be really hard. But I don’t think I could go behind her back and do it as well. I’d have a hard time keeping this from her.  She would want me to carry it full term and give it up for adoption which personally, would be much more difficult for me to handle than abortion, emotionally. 

I am not set on this, but it seems like the best option for my life right now.

344,"tl;dr: we we're told for three years we maybe could buy the flat we are currently renting. then we got an amazing offer from our landlord. we accepted. but now it seems the guy who owns the flat to the left AND the one to the right of us, will purchase ours, because he knows our landlord and said ""three in a row would be nice"".

&amp;#x200B;

me and my GF moved to our rental-flat almost three years ago. the flat was kind of a surprise to us, since it was in probably the best residential area in our town, had everything we where looking for and the rent was quite decent. when it was about sign the contract, the agent told us that our landlord used to live in that flat, but moved to another country, and wants us to know that maybe there is the option of buying the flat at some point (lease-purchase). awesome! 

after only a short time living here we felt like home and wanted to stay here forever. after about a year we asked our agent if we could already buy. Our Landlord let us know that she do not want to sell right now, but maybe in two years. Fast forward 2 years (today): we asked again (no more agent involved), had a skype call with our landlord, she wrote us an email (about 10 days ago) and told us she wanted to offer us the flat (no price until now), came to town, sad down on our table (5 days ago) and told us a price that was way cheaper than we ever dreamed (hosing market sky rocketed in past 15 years). we said yes!

At the start of our conversation 5 days ago she first told us there was someone else being interested in our flat. since she never mentioned this it was kind of a surprise (shock). its the guy owning both flats to the left and to the right of us. she called him a friend and that 5 years ago he asked her to tell him if she ever wanted to sell the flat, she should tell him, because ""three in a row would be nice"". therefore contacted him just one or two days before and if we please could let him in because he wanted to see the flat. 

again: we said yes, we wanted to buy and she told us she is very happy to hear that, but lets wait until her friend responds. on sunday 8pm the door bell rang and there was the guy and wanted to see the flat. he took a brief look in every room and when we told him we said accepted our landlords offer, he grinned and said ""thats up for discussion"" and then left. 

that was two days ago. we did not hear anything from our landlord since she is on a business trip in a foreign country about 6-timezone-hours away from us.

should we wait? should we contact her? should we tell her we need this flat because we want to start a family (she already knows that)? should we tell her to please not sell to a guy who is not in need of buying one? we are kind of panicking right know and haven't sleep the past two days...",08Oct2019,1
346,"My friend of a couple years (lets call him G) texts me and our mutual friend (K) multiple times every hour until one of us responds. He is in his early 30s and he told us that we're one of his very few friends, so it is understandable why he does that. Most of the time, it isn't about something urgent, it's just that he wants to have a casual chat about anything.

 However, our friend K receives more texts than I do since I rarely check my messages anyway and she has been very irritated with him. She has told him that she is going to be busy and wont respond as much as she used to (which isn't true, it has gotten way too much for her to handle). 

I really like G, he is a very friendly guy and I don't want him to get hurt by us, but I dont know how to get him not to depend on us as much as he does. He texts WAY more when he gets anxious and we both try to be there for him as much as possible but there are times that we simply cannot be there for a variety of reasons, and that's when my friend K gets extremely annoyed with him.

347,"This is going to need a bit of context. 

I was a secondary/high school teacher till September. I had a real tough time of it, my boss made me feel awful and did everything she could to try and get rid of me, this is despite my performance being above average.

I quickly got another job, this time working as a guitar teacher in primary/elementary schools, I go to different schools around my area and work with different classes there. I do really enjoy this job, the children are great, however I don't have many hours at the moment, whilst I'm ok for money, it would be nice to have more, there's a chance there may be more work down the line but nothing in sight at the moment. I also do a little gardening work on the side. So far, really enjoying my new jobs, they're much less work, a lot easier and still really satisfying.

Here's my conundrum. A job has come up starting in January for a lovely secondary/high school down the road from me, I've spoken to the head of music there and he seems pretty switched on. I've been offered a position as music teacher at the school. Should I take it?

Here's a list of pros and cons for both positions:

**New job**
*Pros*
* Great school, it performs very highly
* Close to where I live, short commute
* Pay is very good
* Fantastic job security
* I do love teaching older students, you get some really interesting music out of them and can really get to know them

*Cons*
* The job is full time, not ideal, I'd prefer only 4 days a week
* There is a risk that it might not be the right place for me and if I go for it, I won't have made a good impression on my current workplace and likely won't be able to get back in
* I found teaching very stressful before, I theorise this is because I've not found the right school, but maybe I'm just not a good fit for a teacher?
* Teaching older children can be difficult, behaviour issues can occur and that can be very draining
* Close to where I live! I will see students around my neighbourhood
*I've booked tickets to Glastonbury, I really want to go for the 50th anniversary and I have never been, if I take this job, it's unlikely I'll ever get to go till I retire!

**Current job**
*Pros*
* I know for fact I enjoy this job
* It pays a slightly better hourly rate than other job
* It's very flexible, I can work part time
* Teaching younger children is much easier in terms of behaviour and they are very sweet and kind

*Cons*
* Teaching younger children is fun, but they aren't as mature as older students and so you don't get to make really interesting music with them
* I only teach them for a short time a week which means I don't get to know them very well and part of what I like about teaching is getting to know my students
* I don't have enough hours at the moment, this could change, it's uncertain but I have enough income to see me through
* Whilst things are going great now, there's no guarantee that it'll be like this always

348,"M22 here, college student.

A couple weeks back I met a beautiful girl at a bar and we hit it off very well.. super well... truth be told I have a crush.. I’m infatuated, in a total delusion, head to heels over her. I dream about her and think about her when I close my eyes... i just want to hug her. I got so happy when I thought I saw her at the library today ... and sprung off my seat and walked up to her but, it wasn’t her... 

Problem is... i have a girlfriend (long distance).. 4 years and counting... and shit’s been kinda cold for a while (entirely my fault) :( 

I was never good with women, im a loner, depressed, self-mutilated, and a loser (albeit upholding a 3.5gpa at a really good university &lt;as demonstrated by the fancy use of albeit&gt;) ... plus I tend  to be super shy... so i dont know how to feel, act, or think with something like this. I feel like a 6th grader. 

Anyways, so back to the bar, there she is, smiling and giving all the signs.. “im not into monogamous relationships” she says... “ohh i’m a bad person” “oh no, youre not”fuck yes this conversation is smooth as fuck. this girl was dtf for sure, with anybody probably... im sure she’s not into me as much as im into her.. ugh my poor heart.. anyways, I kissed her and ran out of the bar but came back after 15 min hoping to start an affair... 

That’s when she turned me down. I was rude and embarrassed her in front of the whole bar. Plus im not sexy (im kinda cute, in shape but chubs, and smoker teeth).. i tried going in for a second kiss but she pressed against my chest and she pulled away this time... 

Anyways now im fucked. I found out when her office hours are so i’m thinking maybe I can meet her and apologize. Maybe that way I can stop fantasizing about her

But fuck! I know that’s so awkward and probably will make her really uncomfortable... 

How do I get over her? I need to get my head out of my heart/ass

354,"Hello hello, so basically one of my best friends that’s a girl was sexually assaulted by one of her friends (who is engaged) she thought was closest to her which really messed her up, the problem is that the guy that assaulted her is a very well liked manager at the place we work and she just got out of a relationship before the assault which is why he took advantage of her, because she has been fragile and suicidal. If it got out she would get blamed because he’s a very good manipulater and from the outside it would look like she was desperate and lead him into it. 

Only me, my cousin who is also extremely close to her, and my girlfriend know what really happened, but my girlfriend got too drunk and told one of our other work mates about a few little things about it which has made people at work start talking down on my friend which could easily be the thing that tips her over the edge. I admit my girlfriend was in the wrong but her finding out she messed up also might tip her over the edge. 

I am worried about my two people who I’m so close too, and I’ve been trying to figure out ways to fix this but the only thing I can think of is to tell the workmate my girlfriend spilled the beans too that the manipulative manager and my best friend didn’t get together because I went over to her house when she was there to vent because I cheated on my girlfriend and I didn’t know where else to turn too.

He asked me to send him a picture of me (From my fb pfp you can't clearly tell what I look like). I was very very insecure about my appearance, I look kinda average and I was scared that he would lose interest and I really enjoyed his company. So I sent him a heavily photoshopped picture of me that looks nothing like me. Things turned rather sexual than romantic (sexting, exchanging nudes), but I was fine with that. It might sound really stupid, but all the nudes I've sent him were actually mine. I also lied about not being a virgin and my height, another two things I am kinda insecure about. But I'd never lie about my personality or my life. I've been completely honest with him about everything else. I'm not a psycho who manipulates people and tells them stuff in order to like them. But now I feel like one. I've never done this and I don't know why I did it now. I felt really bad about catfishing him because he was very honest with me and he found me honest and he loved that. He always said he liked my character. He was always respectful towards me, didn't force me into anything, and overall outside the sexting we had a great communication and we talked all day. All this left me feeling so wrong that I broke off all the sexual stuff with him and told him I wasn't feeling it anymore. We remained friends, but then he admitted he missed me and I had to lie to him that I didn't miss him. I really didn't want to hurt him.

359,"So, I completely ruined things with one guy (early 30s) like just yesterday. And I know that in the grand scheme of things, it wouldn't matter and that I could just find another.

The problem though is that I don't think I'm able to think properly. I can't figure out if he ever even once liked me or not, and whether I projected the whole thing. I know that mixed signals are basically ultimately a 'no', and it pained me to realise that in-person was when he gave me a *lot* of attention, compliments, etc. But whenever I didn't see him, he'd just disappear, and then get surprised whenever I got upset over it the next time I saw him. He *literally* was the one who kept asking me to talk to him (over text for the times I didn't see him), and was the one who set up all our meetings. I ruined it by getting upset and telling him that he never cared about me and never will; blocked and then unblocked; and called multiple times until he told me that it'd be best I take some distance rn for myself lol

But enough about him, I realised that this is a general trend I've had with most guys I've been interested in. They get interested in my slightly-crazy, weird and careless self. And then whenever I notice they like me, or if they're simply nice to me, I get super attached. Like no restraints (except sex, luckily). And it becomes a cycle where if they ignore me, I go crazy and switch between loving and hating them. And if they shower me with attention, I see them as acting weird, 'below' me, or just smothering

The only times I feel stable is when a relationship is 6+ months, after I notice that he hasn't abandoned me after I act flaky af and somewhat mean

364,"So, for context I'm a student in the Netherlands and it's almost impossible to find housing. 

I found this great place walking distance from the university building and the owner's asking if I found another place. Obviously he's not gonna throw me out on the street, but he's asking and I'm feeling pressure. He stated from the beginning that this might be temporary, but nothing was set in stone, meaning I still had a chance to live there for the academic year. But as I said, he's suggested I start looking for somewhere else to live. The rental contract I have with this guy does state that I'm living there until July 2020.

So what do I do? The contract's gotta be legally binding, right?",08Oct2019,1
365,"First of all im sorry for how horrid my english is and if its long. Theres a tldr at the bottom

Essentialy up until a few years ago i was still living with my folks but the longer im away the more messed up im realizing i am. I was raised believing all women have to listen to everything and do everything a man says, that their role as a female is to clean, cook etc and that punishment is served if i dont follow those rules.

They implemented this the day i became a teen, like it was a flip of a switch. It was disorientating back then going between highschool and home as both had completely diffrent visions on the world.
The abuse really kicked off once i was about 14-15 and my mother started working nightshifts; my father refused to cook and would abuse and beat me into doing it; then critisizing every aspect of it cause it wasnt resturant quality. After a few weeks of this and my brother joining in on the abuse i told my mother to witch she told me to keep quiet and itll just stop. Shit advise i know.
So for the rest of highschool it was like this and i developed anxiety and depression, attempting to take my life witch didnt work out.
I just hid away and rarely spoke, hell i wasnt allowed at a friends house unless my parents were personal friends with the folks, so no real social life.
On the last year of highschool and i was 18 i got a decentish phone with just facebook after some family gathering where my cosin was confused as to why my younger bro had facebook and not me.

Fast forward half a year and i have an long distance relationship, witch i now realize was actually just the 2 of us confiding in one another and helping each other with our shitty lives, but i was new to this, what did i know lol.
My parents hated this, duh, wanted him gone etc. Eventually got to the point where they were monitering my phone before taking it away entirely.

I kinda just hid myself away from the world and just felt like a shell of myself, just took any abuse that came my way and stopped talking. But something in me snapped and i applied for a university 3 hrs away, got accepted and started halfway through the year, year after i graduated highschool.
Eventually moved into some cheep rental and never looked back.

But man after so long of being out here in this world its a scary place. It all kinda changed when i discovered the internet, man i musta spent ages on it just learning. But as i did i realized i had no idea how to survive in this world. My folks believed a school will teach all you will ever need to know about living in this world but in reality it has taught me nothing. Highschool was a complete waste of time.

Its been 5 years since i left and i just feel so lost and useless. I realise i have depression and anxiety still untreated but dont have money to seek help. Im so scared of people and getting abused from men i cant hold a job to save my life, im so damn scared and break out into panic attacks; hell i still dont know how to talk to people.
But dispite all that im just so damn pissed off that my folks will not acknowledge what theyve done and how much theyve hurt me. My father come to me asking me to deal with my lil sisters depression and help her when i cant even help myself; my mother doesnt even belive she has it.

I just dont understand how they can be so oblivious and uncaring to their own kid. Theyve been doing everything in their power to get me back there and dont understand or dont care why i refuse to return.
I just.. i dont know, wish theyd acknowledge the shit theyve done. Do parents usually act like nothing ever happened?
I really have no clue how to fit in in this world, how do you ajust or move on from somethin like this?
Im in Australia btw, idk of it helps

LDR: my parents raised me to act and live in an old era where women are basically slaves to men and are ment to be used. Now that im out im struggling to adapt with learning to talk, getting over abuse, and learning to live in this era not an old one.
Did anyone go threw something similar and if so, how did you adjust?",08Oct2019,2

367,"Starting university next year. I have a scholarship (approx. $4000 a year) for a university that I’ve recently changed my mind about attending, but the one I’ve just applied for that I think I prefer (I feel like I’m changing my mind every 5 seconds at this point) doesn’t have any scholarships still open that I’m eligible for (which I’m kinda mad about honestly, even the ones that are closed now were aimed towards a very specific kind of person doing a very specific type of course). I prefer the ‘new’ university as it has better facilities, opportunities and degree specifications that suit what I would like to learn about.


Actual tuition fees aren’t really a problem due to debt programs in my country, but I’m looking at about $10,000 - $12,000 a year for accommodation (at both universities), not including costs such as textbooks and food. I’m lucky enough that my parents are willing to cover my accommodation and other costs so that I am able to focus on schoolwork (I will likely look for a job throughout the year, though). 


I’m having a bit of a moral dilemma as the university I now prefer would require me to relocate to a new state (via plane, though driving may be possible) which can be expensive in itself and I wouldn’t have the added security of a scholarship (I wouldn’t say my family is struggling financially, but things can get pretty tight). Would I be selfish to attend this university though it would cost my family more? They say they are willing to pay if it’s what I really want but I feel so guilty.",08Oct2019,1
368,"So, I broke off a 4 year LTR with her 3 months ago. We were to get married but, long story short, at the moment I didn't feel like it would be possible for many external reasons that do not exists anymore.

We were a LDR, very successfully. I tell her I'm coming to her city to meet and see if things work out. We do and she still is unsure about everything, but part of her wants me to stay so we can go out and see if we click again.

We barely talk every now and then for the past 2 weeks, mostly relationship stuff and on and off life stuff. My birthday comes and she sends:

""Happy birthday! I hope you have a lovely day, celebrate it well. I’ll see you soon and we can celebrate 😘""

369,"So I’ll start at the beginning, I became friends with this girl 3 years ago when I supported her through the breakup of her 1st ever relationship. Over that time I’ve always been there to support her with her mental health (anxiety, work stress related) and have sat with her for countless hours comforting her and telling her it’s going to be fine. I almost never asked for help back, mostly because I never really need help from my friends and I’m good at dealing with my issues on my own.

Recently however I’ve been really really struggling mentally, this is linked to a number of things that’ve happened over the past year. It’s caused me to develop a problem with alcohol, in that if I’m drinking socially, I almost always take it too far and often become very emotional. I also developed very confused feelings for her which she confronted me about and I admitted, we both agreed to spend some time apart. One night I went clubbing with other friends, she happened to be in the same club, I remember purposely avoiding her and don’t remember speaking to her.

The next day I check my snapchat, and see I’ve been blocked, I then check all my other social media to find that she’s blocked me out of her life completely. She won’t even make eye contact if we’re in the same room. I feel like she’s leaned on me for support and offloaded all of her problems so much over the past 3 years then just ditched me like I never even mattered. I feel used and I don’t know what to do.",08Oct2019,2

372,"Hey folks. I need advice. I’m 23(M). 

3 years ago I was diagnosed with a condition (the year before I was diagnosed, I lost my sight partially, loss of some body controls and had a change in behaviour. Long story short, I was diagnosed with a condition. Forgive me for not disclosing it) 

Ever since, every 3 months, my dad accompanies me to go see the doctor (4-5 hour bus ride away) in my check ups. First few travels, I had fainting spells (never travelled in a bus before and my condition did not help), but ever since my doctor gave me meds. I never felt better (the meds helped decrease the effects of my condition. My eye sight came back, body control is back). Basically I was able to graduate and work. 2 months ago, before our trip, I told my folks if i could travel alone this time. They said no because they can’t risk it and something might happen to me and I will be in a city alone and no one by my side to assist should something happen. I said ok. The day of our travel comes and so far so good. My dad and I just get off the bus and start to head for the taxi bay until the heat and smoke triggers my asthma. I got rushed to the hospital and a few hours later, I was cleared. 

Now our next check up is coming soon, how I do convince my parents to let me travel alone? Considering our latest travel kinda ended up in “disaster”. I already gave them hints that I wanted to travel alone but they shot them down saying they can’t risk it for now.

379,"Background:

My fiance and I suddenly split up a week ago. Due to some things he was saying I was worried I would have to up and leave (for my emotional wellbeing). It's been a hard split but we're on great terms now. We're so open about what wasn't working I feel I made a bad choice in leaving him and we may try to work things out. Even if we don't work things out I may not leave until spring, as leaving in the next 3-5 weeks could put us both in a poor financial spot.

The day we split I verbally informed my manager, to be polite. The same day they put a job posting up and hired someone immediately. The next day when I came in they asked if I'd be willing to give up half my hours for her to train. Obviously I said hell no. It took them 2 months to hire me as they had no hours but immediately hired her and asked me to sacrifice half my hours. I haven't even given a formal notice!

I'm not sure how to handle this situation since I want to stay longer. Obviously I'll tell them I'm not leaving yet but what do I do if they throw this in my face? The job market is brutal out here, it's not like I can easily go find another job. Plus I like this job, the hours, the people, and the pay for my position is $3.25/hr mor than minimum wage, which is all you can really expect to get where I live.",08Oct2019,1
381,"This seems ridiculous to need advice about, but I do. I’m 31F and I have a chronic illness that basically makes it so I’m a lot less energetic than most. I work two jobs and I’m usually exhausted after my shifts. I’ve struggled to maintain and make friends because of my illness.

Anyway, I just started one of my two jobs a couple months ago and connected immediately with my coworker Ani (21F). Ani is a decade younger than me but we still have a lot in common. One thing we don’t have in common is stamina. I really want to keep her as a friend which I know means hanging out outside of work, which we have now done several times over the course of two months. Typically with my illness I would head straight home from work and basically rest for the entire evening. I had no social life so having another person around has been a big change.

Ani and I work about five minutes from where I live, whereas she lives twenty minutes away. She also lives with her mom still and I know she really enjoys spending time at my apartment (I live alone) so my apartment always ends up being the setting of our hang outs. Even if we were somewhere else though, it doesn’t really change the primary issue.

The issue is that while Ani is sweet and kind and fun, she also cannot seem leave my house when I ask, or even CLOSE to when I ask. I usually get too tired for company after around two hours of hanging out, and 99% of our hang outs are after I’ve already worked a full day. If I tell her before she comes over I only have an hour, she will stay at least two. I’ve had 31 years on this planet and I know all the ways to gently kick someone out of your house. I’ve been subtle, I’ve been straight up. I’ve even started telling her she needs to go AN ENTIRE HOUR before I actually want her to because I know it will take at least that long to get her out. She is so slow collecting her things and gets easily distracted and starts talking and everything just takes forever. I start to get anxious watching this happen. She knows all about my illness and how it affects me. I don’t think she’s being deliberately rude, I just think she’s kind of oblivious or can’t understand how someone might feel like I do. She could and would hang out into the wee hours. I simply can’t.

I don’t want to lose her as a friend but it’s getting to the point where I don’t want to hang out at all because I know it will end up being twice as long as I clearly state I want it.

It stood still for a second, then fell on the floor and started spasming while bleeding from the nose. I picked it up and rant out of my room yelling for my sister while in tears crying for what I did. She came out and saw it in my hands and she told that it's ok, I know you didn't mean to.

I can't stop crying over what I did. I didn't mean to kill it. I just wanted to get it so I could take it outside. I feel so much guilt for what I did. It was so small and I'm scared it was probably just a little baby mouse maybe.

388,"My upbringing wasn’t the best. It's not like my parents were extremely abusive or anything (My father would hit me, which I think was abuse, but at some point he stopped) but I grew up watching them fight / talk about money and family problems like frequently. My parents were/are never happy with each other. 

They supported us financially but didn’t teach us what love is. I never knew it was wrong till I turned 22. At the time, I got some chances to meet up with my friends’ parents or family members, and there, I was able to feel warmth between them, which I hardly ever find in my family.  The weird thing is that whenever my parents try to be close to me or care about me, I don't really appreciate that like at all. I even find it irritating sometimes, which I feel guilty.

389,"A bit of background first, I am 16M and she is 16F. We went to a school together and we were best friends but now our schools are 10 miles apart so we hardly see each other.

So we used to be best friends but now since we hardly see each other our friendship has started to fall apart. I've tried to arrange to meet up with her but every time she has an excuse why she cant, and she doesn't arrange to meet up. We usually text to talk to each other, as that's the only way we can talk.  But it is always me who starts conversations and she always replies with one word or one sentence, hardly putting any effort in. It never used to be like this, we used to talk for hours on end only about a year ago. But now every conversation is cut short as she doesn't put any effort in. She has recently said that she doesn't like people as much who constantly talk to her, so I've given her space and stopped talking to her as much as I used to, but nothing's changed. I've tried talking to her but everytime we always end up in a bad mood and once we didn't talk to each other for a few weeks after. I recognised that was partly my fault so I apologised. We used to have so much fun talking to each other, but now I just feel sad as I know our friendship may never be what it was like. I know you might say ""well just end the friendship if you aren't happy"", but I don't want to end a friendship we've worked so hard to create and she isn't like the rest of my friends, she's never judged me and I can tell her anything, and recently she added me to her private story on snapchat only for her best friends so we are still friends. I've tried many things such as reminding her of what our friendship used to be like and asking if anything is wrong but nothing has changed. The last conversation we had I was telling her I'd been on holiday to a theme park and she just replied with nice so I decided to tell her what all the rides were like and she replied with nice.

394,"So, leading up to August, I was looking for an apartment with a friend. We looked at this one place that looked decent. But then my friend decided that he couldn't live with me, and I felt desperate to find a place. The property manager loved me, and she told the landlord about my situation. 
The landlord lives in Oregon, and he has a totally bad reputation for not caring about his tenants. I didn't know this at the time. Anyways, he calls me and offers me one room, and says that I can find two roommates by the end of August (it is a three bedroom apartment). I think that this was a great idea and I sign the lease. 
Only a few days go by, I haven't even moved in, and the landlord calls me, saying that he found me a roommate. It was a 25 year old guy who claimed to be homeless. The landlord gives this guy my phone number, and while I'm at work they both blow my phone up. The guy was begging me, leaving me voicemails and texts, ""Please let me live with you, I have no other options.""
The landlord urges me to talk to him and meet him. I was working a lot because we were understaffed and things were hard. This goes on for a few days, both the landlord and this guy forcing an answer out of me. 
The landlord even said that if I didn't feel comfortable, he would move out. And actually, the agreement was that the landlord would finish renovating another place, and I would find two other roommates. I was anxious and back and forth. I was not comfortable but I couldn't leave this guy homeless. 
The landlord and the property manager could not give me a set time when the other building would be finished, they just kept saying in a month. 
Another problem of the place, there was a mountain of trash outside the apartment for two months. The property manager kept telling me she would get it taken care of but never did. Until, there was question about me staying. 
The landlord also offered me a job. Mid-August, he said that he would hire me to be a part time property manager. I agreed, but only if he'd let me out of the leas because it gave him too much power over me to be my boss and landlord. He agreed, over text. He asked me to find a replacement as well, which was fair. 
But turns out, it is really hard to find roommates for a 25 year old guy who has a dog. This guy would not help me at all. I ended up paying the rent for September because I couldn't find anyone. I moved out before September 1st, so that I could find somebody and start working. 
The landlord never gave any direction. Neither did the property manager. 
Mid September, the ceiling fell thru in one of the bedrooms. I noticed while I was showing the place to someone. The trash was still there. And going down to the basement felt like I was going to fall through the steps, and their wasn't a light. 
But now, there is a second person living there. There are two grown men living in the apartment, and I am a small 21 year old girl. I do not live there, I do not want to live there. I cannot afford rent because I had to find something else, and the landlord is threatening to put me in collections, and then sue me. I don't know what to do. Please help.
I made a mistake. I didn't think about the consequences, and I need help. I can barely afford food because I have so many other debts; school loans, medical bills, dues from my previous apartment (they did not require a security deposit, so my roommates and I owed at the end).

404,"Sorry for any mistakes, I'm typing this on my phone. 
My friends (15f) parents are throwing her out the home. They gave her a choice to choose one city out of three to live there without any of their support. She chose a city one hour away from us. My friends extended family also can't help because of the money issue. She's not old enough to get a real job so there's no money for her to even survive and has to wait about three months until she can go to profession school (you can go there when you're 16). Even then you need to pay to get in. 
Her parents get 50€ every month for my friend, but they aren't planning on giving them to her. So she has no savings, support or job.

I’m in the midst of being tested for celiac disease and have been sick for a while. But within the last week things really went to hell. 

I keep breaking out into gluten rashes, I had to leave work early yesterday because of this. They doubled my steroids and we’ll just see how it goes. 

I told my boss what’s going on last Friday and she said that was helpful and she understood what I was going through. 

I technically have a note to stay home today but I decided to go to work, I’m on my probation period. However I feel like complete ass. If anyone has had an allergic reaction or has CD, you know the feeling afterwards. Plus, steroids are posing their own set of issues.

410,"For context on this story, I was in a really bad spot last year and became an alcoholic. I was drinking three days a week and doing terribly in college (22F) btw. The group of friends live in the same apartment complex as me so I would always go to their place stupid drunk and they would have to take care of me. Of course, this led to problems since I was burdening them with my alcoholic problems. After much needed therapy and talking about it with my friends and working things out, things were looking up for me and I thought I was doing a lot better from last year.

Last Friday I went out with another group of friends (with two from the apartment friend group) out to drink. I made sure to watch myself this time and not drink to the point where I blacked out or threw up but was still pretty drunk. Things were going good and we all went out to sober up by getting ice cream. I didn’t want to go back to the apartment because while I was doing fine I was still pretty drunk and didn’t want them to worry too much about me. I wasn’t going to go home with them and was planning to stay at my auntie’s house for the night when the car situation changed and one of the apartment friends said they were taking me home. Me being drunk I freaked out and started to grow anxious until one of my other friends(23M), the one I was originally going with, said they got it and would take me. Apartment friend gets angry and drives home and I spent the rest of the night feeling guilty and crying. 

It took me a while to update cause I was crying in the car but eventually told them I was staying at my auntie’s place after my friend was updating the apartment on what was going on. Whole time apartment was saying to take me to them even though I said I didn’t want to and now moreso didn’t want to cause of what happened with one of them driving off angry. Eventually friends conceded and I stayed at auntie’s place, updated them when I was at auntie’s and updated them when I was back at my own apartment the day after.

I apologized in person and in message for worrying them and asking them if things were okay and they said it was fine. Only... I guess it wasn’t cause last night one of my friends pulled me aside and said that the apartment group is tense cause of what I did last night. They don’t believe I stayed at my auntie’s place and instead spent the night with the friend cause to them the story sounded really convoluted. So now they think I lied and are saying this is all a repeat of last year. I’ve talked about this to other people and they said that the apartment group is starting to sound like parents rather than friends and have been told to start treating them as such by having them fade out of my social life and stop getting personal with them. What should I do?

TLDR; had alcoholic problems last year, got better, went to drink with friends and instead stayed with auntie instead of friend’s place and now they’re saying its a repeat of my alcoholic problems from last year. What do?",08Oct2019,3
411," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",08Oct2019,0
412,"I live in a Block of flats. My neighbour has a rabbit. Probably her daughter wanted him and now nobody takes care about him. They left the rabbit on a hallway. He gets water but not so much food. But lives in a very little cage, where rabbit can hardly turn around. The cage is really messy, unclean and stink. He just lives in his own shit and piss in a veeeery little cage. And the biggest issue is that my neighbour does not let him out! Take him outside put him in a gras so He could run around for a while at least. 

Now, i want to do something about it and i find out these options. First, i could tell her that it got bad for the rabbit and she should start care. I could even ask her if i can find someone, who would like to take care about It. I could clean his cage and take him out. But again i risk she'll get upset, take the rabbit inside of her appartment and the caring about him will countinue. And the last option is just to take a rabbit from a hallway and take him to my place or find someone, who wants him. 

If i ask her first and she'll get upset or insulted, i couldn't take him because she would know it was me. So what would you do? Would you just talk to her and risk that she'll get upset and nothing will change? Or would steal it?",08Oct2019,1

414,"So, there is a long story to this. 
I never really had a ""this person is hot""-feeling, but I met a guy once and we became friends. After almost 3 years knowing him (I was 24) I thought ""hey, we're totally on the same wavelength, maybe this could be more?"" and we kind of started dating under the assumption, that it wouldn't be a physical relationship, because I wasn't interested in sex at all and he was okay with that.

We did get intimate later (I wanted to) and while I felt pretty underwhelmed by the act itself (it got better, but not by much), I really liked this feeling of affection and closeness it gave me. 
I never really felt sexually aroused, but I initiated sex often, because I wanted to feel close to him (which wasn't the best idea, because it always hurt in the beginning).
He is a really passive person though, and it hurt me a lot that he didn't initiate anything at all. I felt unwanted and worried about a lot of stupid things during that time so I broke up with him. 

We stayed friends though and I found out that shortly after our relationship ended, he started sleeping with several men. He said he did it because he was curious and he liked that better, since apparently it is much easier to satisfy a man. 
So I thought ""It is so easy for him to do that, why can't I have fun, too? Maybe I just need someone else to try it with? Maybe I'll really like it then?"" 

Basically, I got quite jealous over the fact that he got so easily aroused by other men and had so much fun, while I didn't.
I got so curious that I slept with a random couple (a woman and a man) and while it was kind of fun, it felt really empty? My body apparently did get aroused somehow since it didn't hurt, but in my head I didn't really feel aroused at all. Not even their gender seemed to make a difference to me.

It was kind of lame in hindsight. Although there are some things that seem interesting, I am not turned on by those thoughts or curious enough to find someone to try them with.

While my body doesn't seem to care about it at all, in my head I think ""I didn't try everything yet, so I cannot possibly know if it could feel good or not? I do want it to feel good. But every experience I've had regarding that was pretty disappointing...""

Should I just try it again? Hope that some day I find someone I am compatible with?

(I should also mention that I am on birth control because of PCO-syndrome, but my doctor said that this pill in particular shouldn't be responsible for low libido)

TL;DR: Body doesn't want while head kind of maybe wants sex, although every experience I've had with it kind of sucked and I'm unsure whether there is any merit in ""trying again"".",08Oct2019,1
415,"HI, so basically i have a friend group and within it i have feelings for one of the members. They recently told me that they had feelings for me, although they knew i was not ready to be in a relationship after my last one (i think) and doesn't know i have feelings for them too. Everything ended up fine and we are still close friends , but its kind of eating me up inside not to tell them how i feel. The issue is that i got out of an emotionally abusive relationship a few months ago and am really scared to enter anything new, worrying that it may be another bad relationship . My last relationship made me really scared and my anxiety kind of makes it hard to get through the early parts of relationship on top of that. Another issue is that they are part of my friend group, who i am very close with. I feel that if we entered a relationship it would ruin the dynamic in the group. So do I tell them how i feel? in person or through text as i would most likely say i have feelings for them too but cant enter anything due to my fears. I know this is probably dumb but i'm really uncertain right now. thank you so much for any advice that you may give :)",08Oct2019,1
416,"I'm absolutely sick and tired of all these fucking guys getting laid left and right and experiencing sex while I'm over here stuck with my Fleshlight. 

Every single time I make an attempt to flirt and talk to girls I get friendzoned or rejected.
 Every. Single. Time! 
I just don't understand how guys can get laid so damn easily.

My disorders however make it more difficult. 

One night stands and friends with benefits are unfathomable to me. How can girls have sex with guys without being in relationships with them JUST HOW?!?!?! I even hear and witnessed young women get their hearts broken, how and WHY do those guys do that?! And I also have seen and heard of young women being very promiscious and just the way they talk and act... I don't understand what the fuck I'm doing wrong, no woman is ever attracted to me. 
Every single time I see guys my age kissing girls I can only DREAM of being with, around my college it just makes me so goddamn envious and angry.
Unfortunately where I live prostitution Is illegal and I don't know where to buy prostitutes anyways. 

And on top of all of this I also have some fucking learning disabilities so I can't even learn how to flirt with women and talk to them and learn about ""game"" and all of this other bullshit.

417,"I am a 22 year old male.

I care too much whether people like me or not. I crave approval and acceptance from people. Like if a person looks at me and doesn't smile I assume it is a look of disapproval and that person is thinking negatively of me. I also get discouraged when I am with someone, and another person gives the person I am with all of their attention. It makes me jealous that they are acknowledging the person I am with and not me.

I am a people pleaser, and I wish I wasn't. I am trying to get to a point where I don't care if people like me or not and to stop seeking approval/acknowledgement from people.

I believe my people pleasing attitude dates back to when I was 13 and in 8th grade, I had a teacher that wasn't very fond of me. He would give all of his students attention and acknowledgement except for me. Prior to that year, I was always a teacher's pet and their favorite student. Teachers would always give special acknowledgement to me. This was really the first time that a teacher didn't think I was one of the best.

I always wanted his approval/acknowledgement and I never got it. I would get really jealous that all the other students were getting attention from him, and I wasn't getting that same attention. All I wanted was his approval.

From that point I started seeking approval from EVERYONE: To strangers, cashiers, store employees, waiters/waitresses, etc. I just remember my people-pleasing attitude starting around that point. I didn't really have this problem prior to 8th grade. I believe if it wasn't for my teacher not acknowledging me, I wouldn't have this problem today.

Now I am trying to get over it, but it's difficult. How can I stop seeking approval from people?",08Oct2019,1
418,"My [28F] cousin [29M], who is my adopted brother as my mom adopted him when he was 16, just told me he believes aliens are communicating with him. He has had a rough go at life and is a little lost. He can be really spacey and forgetful, but is always very kind and in a good mood. He has started taking acid somewhat regularly, especially at festivals, and says the alien communications only happen when he’s at a festival. Two days ago he was in a horrible car accident, he was a sleeping passenger when the driver crashed the car going 80mph, my cousin was ejected from the car and thankfully survived with minimal injuries. He told me about the alien after I reached out to him. I’m unsure what to do or day and could use advice.

This next part I don’t even want to include because it is highly personal, private and traumatic for me, not to mention sounds completely insane. My dad died in a car accident eleven years ago. Before he died, he had a sudden and severe psychotic breakdown where he too said aliens were trying to communicate with him. Shortly after he crashed his car and passed away. It was extremely traumatic for me as we were very close. I’m not a spiritual person at all but the last week, I’ve been getting “signs”, or at least very specific and strange instances and dreams kept occurring forcing me to think about him. I even reached out to my mom to tell her about it although I am a big non-believer, and she confided in me that the same was happening to her. Then exactly one week later, my cousin’s accident happens. 

My cousin and father were very close too. They were not biologically related so there isn’t a genetic link here or anything. This situation with my cousin is resurfacing a lot of really old trauma and feelings, almost to the point where I am struggling to function. I don’t know what to do or how to help my cousin.

419,"Well I'm 26 and not doing too good in life and don't have a car. I am currently stuck working in the food industry and it is slowly killing me inside. I have planned to play it safe and stay at these places since most jobs including walmart will only start me part time. I plan on moving and am kind of intimidated. For example I may get paid less than at walmart or shoprite, but at these places I get full time and overtime. I am scared that I will be stuck working 20-29 hours instead of my 37-42(There has been opportunities where I could have 40 hours if someone called out leaving me a chance at 47-49). I have also heard horror stories from previous walmart employees. I have heard you are very expendable as an employee. I also have no idea how their training is and my social skills are a solid 6/10. I also fear messing up because I have worked at a crappy dollar store and they gave me a tough time then let me go. I feel like I have been doing well at food because 50% of the job is cleaning and prep. I am very neat and a hard worker and also am very nice to customers and know how to treat people. I also have a strong urge to learn new things and am a perfectionist so even when I was doing horrible my first week I eventually became a great employee and am now somewhat valued. I am never late to work and will never call out no matter what so I am hoping walmart could value my work ethic. A big problem of mine is anxiety and fear of failure. I fear that I may not be able to perform well because I have had companies train me so poorly and then expect results without confusion. I do realize a lot of this stuff is due to poor management not a company though. So should I take a chance and try or just find other retail stores in hopes to get out of food.

420,"I (20F) have a friend (21F) with whom I share all classes in college. She's easily distracted and confused so she often turns to me when she has questions since I'm better at organisation and memory. Sometimes it's obvious she thinks I'm smarter than her, but I disagree. Whenever we study together, she brings up excellent questions that I would have never thought of and when we find an answer, it benefits both of us greatly. 

Basically, we both have strengths and weaknesses and we work great together. Which is why I'm not that worried about my studies, as long as we have each other. Even when I have to work independently, I try not to panic and try to use my skills and skills I learned from her to get best possible results. She, on the other hand, panics.

She panics even when we're working together. She's constantly worrying about something. Makes me wonder if that's why she has excellent questions - because everything has to be panicked about. Sometimes I point it out and try to calm her down, but she always shoots me down with ""you know me, I panic over everything hehe"". I understand we all feel nervous in tense situations, but she worries way too much.

What must have caused all this panic is the fact she went to a different college before this one for a few months. It didn't work out and she dropped out. She has mentioned feeling utterly lonely and depressed during that time, but she has never mentioned seeing a professional to deal with this trauma. She's obviously much happier with this college, but the damage is still there.

I started seeing a therapist for my ED recently and it has helped me tremendously. I am so much more confident and feeling better. I truly believe therapy would help my friend too.

But, since I don't know much about her past and what exactly she went through, would I be out of line to suggest she sees a therapist?

Another friend of mine had some papers and pens and she gave one to the girl who was crying and suggested she'd draw something with us so she could be distracted and relax a little, and told her she could speak to us anytime. She didn't draw but instead wrote a letter that she handed to me and told me to read if after lunch
You see, in normal circumstances I would have read it after a short while to check if something was going on,,, but I had a mild pseudoseizure shortly after. Fast forward some hours and I'm home and suddenly remember the letter. I read it, or a part of it because 1. The handwritting isn't easy to understand 2. She is french and her Spanish (my language) isn't really good. But the stuff I was able to read is really freaky. Like. I don't really know how to explain. But I know this could be a suicide letter 
I know this can seem stupid but I really don't know what to do. She's from another town and my parents won't pay attention or do much. I don't know anyone that can get to her or check. 
Please help.",08Oct2019,2

For two and half years out of college, I worked retail and constantly hated both the pay and the schedule. After that I worked my first m-f office job for a year somewhat using my degree and ended up hating that too. The job I had after that for the next two and a half years was a different industry and the first I actually was comfortable at and enjoyed. However, the pay wasn’t enough which caused me to land my current job. It’s the same kind of business, just slightly different in what I handle. I’m finally starting to be financially stable with this salary and just bought a house, but I’m miserable everyday and can’t stand this company. 

When I’ve left every job,  I’ve admittedly kind of just jumped at whatever new job came along first. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do actual job duty wise.  I desperately want to leave this job but don’t want to continue just jumping jobs every couple years.

**Scenario 1:**

Earlier today, I was picking at my jacket for about 5 minutes. When I turned, I saw this white line outline my jacket. I thought that it was a piece of string that got on it from the washer, you know, the usual. So I was picking at it you know? I could not get the string, and there was no sign of it when I took a closer look at my jacket. So I just go back to waiting for the bus. I look back, and the string is still there, so I try again, and failed.

**Scenario 2:**

I have noticed that the world is more...blue. Well naturally it is, but I can see it ""more"" then I use to be able to. Almost everything is blue, everything I look at has blue in it. I dont know how I am able to realize how blue the world is.

I'm personally on the boat where I think I'm still friends with them, but I know everyone else other then that group thinks I should be hating her with a burning passion for moving on so fast and for ending it the way it did. Now, I'm just horribly confused because I want to be there for my friends, but I can't help but wonder if everyone else is right in that I shouldn't be near the two?

We want to go see four nights of music this NYE, but I’m wondering if that’s a smart move. I know he will spend all his savings in order to go have fun, which will likely set him up for failure when he has to find his own place to live. I do not want him living with me (which he has done before), and I do not want to feel slightly responsible knowing I helped him spend all his savings.

More of a month or so of being selfish and doing things i now regret.

We’ve spoke and she said what she needed to say and i apologized, what more is there to do? 

I ended up blocking her on my social media because she was commenting on my pictures about how terrible of a person i am. I’ve been getting weird friend requests lately and I’ve been worried she’s been tagging me in things and that’s where the friends are coming from, but i figured she’s blocked, she can’t tag me.

452,"At 18 I went to a university. Did intro classes in my 1st year to get a 4 year psychology degree. 

After year 1 I decided it wasn't for me after getting a C average and not being interested in the material. Whole year wasted.

At 19 after summer I opted for college instead to get a 2 year business diploma. I really thought this would be the thing I'm gonna do with my life after wasting a whole year at uni. Turns out my midterms are coming up hot next week and I never studied once. I don't know what's wrong with me. One thing just led to another. Procrastination. Lack of diciplen.

If I kept on top of it from day 1 I would have been fine, ready to persue my business diploma. I'm smart enough to do it but I just don't apply myself. I'm lazy.

Now I feel like I'll fail midterms and want to start all over again. Part of me thinks I can clutch this first term and get a high gpa in the next 3 terms of my diploma.
Honestly, though, I ultimately feel indifferent about business. I really wish I was doing something I feel passionate about.

But starting over with something else would require me to start from the beginning at 20 years of age. It makes me feel like I wasted time and behind my peers with nothing to show for it - not even financially. I'm poor and only been working part time, even in the summer. School sucked up all my earnings and I'm racking up debt for no reason.

So I guess my question is what should I do from the perspective of someone more experienced? What should my next steps be? Has this happened to anyone else?

We all 4 used to be really good friends. We would hangout all the time, be in a group chat together, just do life with each other. Then when my buddy and her got engaged, she told my wife that she was going to make her the matron of honor and they talked about it nonstop for a long time. Fast forward 3 months and my best friends fiancé somehow decided that she didn’t want my wife to be the matron of honor. Of course, my wife me feelings were hurt which led to a very tense couple of weeks which then led to my wife just getting out of the bridal party all together and not being a bridesmaid at all. 

Fast forward to today and I try to go online to complete the RSVP for the wedding, and only my name showed up on the list, my wife was not on there.  I called my best friend to see what was going on and he said “they” decided that my wife wasn’t invited to the wedding, only I was.  I say “they” because my best friend would never have done this on his own. It was all his fiancés decision to not want my wife there because of their tension and he is just going along with it. 

He’s basically without saying it, putting me in the place to where I have to upset my wife by going to the wedding that she isn’t invited to or staying with my wife and upsetting him by not being the best man in his wedding.

We have the opportunity to spend the day together on that date. I am looking for ideas/thoughts on what I could do or not do on/around that day to make him feel as loved and supported as possible.

I know this is very personal and I have asked him if he knows what he would like to do/not do but I know he may not know either.

So I just thought I’d reach out and ask, what has a friend/partner/lover/whoever done, or you for a friend/partner/lover, that brought comfort on/around a painful day? Thinking maybe knowing him so well, something might jump out at me that would fit well for him.

477,"We first noticed in August that we were having issues logging into our netflix account. We learned this as we were heading out to go camping though so we kind of brushed it off as a problem to deal with later. We came back and realized that it wasn’t letting us log in because it said the email was invalid, even though we knew for a fact the email and password. We had to call Netflix and get them to give us our access back because, sure enough, we got hacked, and someone in Chile was using our Netflix. So we set up a new password, set it to a new email, and kicked al devices off of our account. 

Fast forward to mid September, I go to check whose been using our account just to be sure, and someone was using it in Pennsylvania. I changed the password YET AGAIN, kicked all devices off again, and hope the problem is solved. 

Apparently not, because I just went to check yesterday and sure enough, someone from Washington DC has been using our account. 

I don’t know what to do at this point or how to keep it from getting hacked. The account is shared with my household (parents, sibling, and I) as well as my cousin. There’s only four states that SHOULD be popping up on the list, and DC, Pennsylvania, and Chile sure as hell shouldn’t be popping up. The account is used in my house on our WiFi with an iPad, and through Comcast on our tv, on my sisters laptop when she’s at college via the college WiFi, and on my cousins laptop and tv.

488,"So this is a bit of a situation and I really really need some advice. So let me set the scene.

Met 2 friends in kindergarten and we were really close growing up. Us 3 and our friend group were super tight all the way thru high school. When I went away to college, naturally we drifted a little apart but still hung out everytime i came home.

Should be noted I'm not a phone guy. If you call me as a friend, theres a 90% I will ignore it and then text you back later. I just dont like to call on the phone unless I have to.

So I moved in to an apartment with my gf in november of 2018. It's a little under an hour away from where all my friends live. At the beggining if 2019 i started to get a very bad case of depression. The distance combined with the depression made me isolate myself from my friend group.

I went on a road trip out of town with them in February for a concert. After that, I think I've hung out with them literally 3 other times. The last time being way back in July. Not for their lack of trying. I've been told it's open for me to hangout any weekend and I've been explicitly invited many many times.

After seeing how often I decline, make up an excuse, or ignore their calls, i dont get invited anymore. But it's still always open for me. I've been such a shitty friend.

So the crux of the issue is the Halloween party this weekend. I was invited awhile ago and accepted. Problem is I am very nervous about it. I haven't seem them in ages and I don't know how to face the fact I've been so shitty to them. I.E. like not really talking or hanging out with them all year. I don't know what to say when they ask why I never answer my phone.

My plan was to hangout with them this last weekend so i was slowly introduced back, and they must've thought they same thing because they called me. But I ignored the calls again. God I dont know why but I get such severe anxiety when the phone rings that I just cant answer it.

So now I'm really really stressing about this party. I need advice and help hopefully from someone with experience with depression and isolation. Thank you

496,"TL;DR: I'm a white 27F and I'd like to get dreads, but 1) don't know where to get them done, and 2) am afraid of the backlash I might get for asking to have/having them done. 

I'm of the mindset that almost anyone can get dreads if they don't maintain (brush) their hair. I do respect that it's a hairstyle primarily worn by black people, and that dreads have been discouraged in professional settings, as have a lot of natural black hairstyles (which is a shame because they have awesome hair). I definitely feel like the assumption that dreads are dirty and gross is mostly attributed to white people having dreads, as it's more suitable for black hair types. 

All that to say, I don't believe other races having dreads is cultural appropriation. Many cultures have had a variety of hairstyles throughout history, so one race claiming a hairstyle is a little r/gatekeeping to me.

I do know, in fact, that it's a touchy subject and there are people who DO believe that a white person having dreads is appropriation.

Knowing that makes me afraid to get them done professionally.

I did dreads on myself maybe five years ago but took them out before they matured because I was afraid my (private) college would make me take then out, and I didn't want them in a state where that would be difficult to do.

I've wanted to do dreads again for some time now, but professionally because it's so difficult to do yourself. I've been growing my hair out and it's just limp and blah. It's just past my armpits and seems to stop growing at this point. I also have been growing out double/triple bleached hair, so my ends are damaged (even after a trim) and are ALWAYS getting tangled and knotted. They're split and frayed, but I'm not ready to cut all my hair off because I've been growing it out (from a pixie cut) for so long. I also have annoying cowlicks on the crown of my head.

So, I feel like dreads are a win-win: I won't have to worry about my lifeless, uncooperative, cowlicky hair always getting knotted AND I can keep the length. I've also debated buzzing off all my hair, but I'm not ready for that yet. SO when I am ready, I can just buzz off all my dreads! I feel like it's the perfect segue.

So, should I be worried? Should I not care what people think? Where could I get dreads done?

497," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

500,"Lately I’ve been questioning whether or not I actually want to continue with my masters and potential future career. I have a degree in clinical psychology, three years experience as an agency support worker and have recently started a masters in clinical psychology, with the hope of gaining acceptance onto the doctorate programme in the same field, or using the masters to find a good job in the field. 

I’ve always had some doubts in the back of my head as to whether or not I really saw myself taking up a role in this field, but usually boiled that down to being worried about failure, however now I’m really starting to question whether or not I want to do this. My degree was relatively interesting and some parts of it such as my dissertation did resonate with me quite a bit. My years as a support worker has honestly been pretty shit and the thought of going to work mostly just fills me with anxiety, there have been some rewarding moments but as a whole it hasn’t really been positive for me. I was able to spin positivity from it and gain the place onto a masters but I don’t know if I even want to spend a year doing it if I’m not going to want to work in this field afterwards.

I’ve always struggled a bit with depression so it’s hard for me to know whether I’m thinking all of these things because I truly believe them, or just because of bad thinking processes. Part of me believes I want to work with depressed and anxious people because they’re things I struggle with and feel like I need help with, but another part of me feels like I just don’t care. I feel like it’s been ingrained in us that we need to find successful jobs which earn a lot of money in order for us to be happy so I’m scared that if I do decide to drop out now that I won’t end up being successful or having enough money to provide for my family and pay for all the things we want to do. 

I also feel like my views might be skewed by the amount of time I’ve invested into it, ever since beginning my degree I was convinced I would end up in a job in this field and have told anyone who has asked of my plans. Now, because of all that time, I’m worried that people would think I’m a failure, or that I myself will end up regretting the choice and thinking I failed too. 

Right now I feel like my life is constantly on hold because ever since starting my degree it’s been ‘as soon as I get to X or I accomplish Y, then I’ll be able to start my life and be happy’ but that never seems to come and I don’t want to spend the next year doing a masters and postponing my life further if I’m never going to use the qualification. In support work I’ve been under-stimulated bored and often just felt like my personality doesn’t fit the environment, I think I could enjoy a role higher up where it feels like I’m actually doing something important, but even then I don’t know if I’d be truly happy doing it. 

I feel happiest when I’m outside in nature, chopping down trees and bushes, clearing land and digging holes amongst other things. I’m seriously debating leaving my masters and finding a job that would be closer to the things that really make me happy, but I know it would be significantly harder (if not impossible) to make the same money I could make in my current field. If anyone has read this whole thing then I appreciate you because it’s a bit of a rambling mess I just really don’t know how to feel right now and I would love some advice if anyone has any.",08Oct2019,1

This ""offer"" was made in a informal way they said ""So what would you think about $XXX per year?"". I basically said I thought is was fair as long as there was a guarantee for that number to grow in a few years. They said absolutely.

They then said they would talk with the owner and get back to me the following week.

506,"So, my dad is controlling. I outlined the specific issues we have in another post. He’s emotionally abusive towards my mom, and squashes all attempts my sister \[24\] and I make for freedom. Last night, he asked me to drive my sister to school at 6:00 AM. I said, of course. (My sister and I both have a genetic chronic illness that effects us in different ways. It's not safe for her to drive.) It was 8:00 PM and I was at a bar with my girlfriend. I’d only had one beer with dinner and wasn’t drinking anymore because I was driving and I didn’t want to be even slightly inebriated. He asked me what time I was planning on leaving. I told him 9:30. My girlfriend’s working tomorrow (today) and I’m not much of a night owl, so we weren’t planning on staying out past 10 anyway. I planned to just sleep over, since the bar was 5 minutes from her house. I’d set my alarm for 5:30 AM and go get my sister, no problem. My girlfriend lives &lt;10 minutes away. My dad got so mad. Commanded me to come home now. Started yelling about how selfish I was and how this, “shouldn’t even be a discussion.” I’d never wanted to come home less than I did then, but I didn’t want to cause trouble. So I just dropped my girlfriend at her house and came home.

Something needs to change. So, without any idea of what else to do, I wrote him a letter. I’m planning on emailing it to him later in the week. I just need advice as to what to say, what to do. Any changes I can make.

Thank you.

Hi Dad,

First of all, I love you. Secondly, I believe there’s a conversation we need to have that’s long overdue. Every time I try, we both get upset. So I think may be the best way to start the conversation.

I know my life isn’t turning out the way you expected. It’s not what I expected either. But life has obstacles, and to overcome those there are choices I need to make by myself. You have provided me with everything I’ve needed in life, and I am beyond grateful for that. But I know these things are conditional to my obedience towards you. There are aspects of this I understand. These are your and mom’s resources not mine. Your house, your rules. But the amount of control you want to assert over me is not something I can give.

Maybe you feel like things you ask of me should be given without question. I know you feel like some things are not up for discussion, but when all I want is a discussion I feel like a calm exchange of words is not unreasonable. This is not just about last night. This is about my entire adult life. But using last night as example, all I wanted to do was choose where I slept. I wish you would have trusted my judgement. I don’t feel that I’ve ever given you a reason to mistrust me.

I’m honestly at the point where I would rather set off on my own and start out with debt than stay in this situation. This is not me being dramatic. This is after several years of assessing my life, where I’ve been, and where I need to go. I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to leave you and Mom and \[sister\] and our pets, but existing like this is a cause of great unhappiness in my life.

I know you likely feel like I’m unprepared for the real world, and that’s true. But I’m learning. I’m smart and I’m strong. All I want to do is have the chance to try (and yes, likely have many, many failures along the way) on my own terms. And I want to do that without you resenting me. This fear is not just based off of my emotions, but from years of experience.

I’m afraid of you. Maybe you feel like children should be. But I’m not a child. I know that’s hard for you to remember sometimes. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been carefully editing my words, my emotions to please you. Or more accurately, not to upset you. I’m so tired. Not in an angry, I’m sick of this kind of way. Just exhausted and sad. I want to just enjoy your company. I want to make you proud. I want to not make you feel like every choice I make that doesn’t align with yours is an act of willful defiance.

Remember when \[Mom's sister\] was snippy with Grandma, and you angrily told me that \[sister\] and I are never allowed to speak to you that way? I don’t understood why you did that. I don’t know why you think \[sister\] and I would want to speak to you that way. And maybe I’m reading too much into this, but again this is based on the past 2 decades and not just this one instance, but I feel like you believe that \[sister\] and I should always be subservient to you. I respect you and I care about you, but I cannot live my adult life in total obedience to you. I don’t think that’s healthy for any of us.

That’s most of what I wanted to say. I just ask that you talk to me more, and listen in return. Just consider my point of view. And please be nicer to mom. I know she’s nearly as afraid of making you angry as Kiersten and I. She is your equal, and she deserves the same respect you do.

I know this is a lot to take in. If you need some space, I have a place I can stay for a few days and I can come by to take care of \[my pet\] and help \[sister\] out.

Love,

She moved in with him. She apparently worked at a bar, and the manager overlooked her age since she needed the money. Some domestic violence incidents involve her bf smashing her glasses, pushing her down the stairs, punching her and sexually assaulting her.  
We talked over email only—she used a tablet. After a year of messaging, her bf emails me through her account one day, cursing me out, telling me it was none of my business, etc. He said I’d never talk to her again. That’s when all the spam started flowing into my inbox, with HIS first name addressed.  
Scared, I blocked the account and moved all the spam to the junk box. Today I’m posting this because a couple more emails came through to my main. It’s been years.  
I’m not sure if the girl was actually someone trying to groom me. She never asked for any of my information. The conversation was always focused on her and what to do. However, she never gave me picture proof of her story either. Messaging other adults about her, I was told there was nothing I could do just knowing her city name and first name. She told me her daughters’ names once, but the email is long gone and I’ve forgotten them. Is there anything I can actually do at this point?",08Oct2019,1

509,"My sister lives in the neighborhood and my brother lives out of town. My sister doesn’t do anything for me because I’m 25 and living at home. (I plan on moving out by the Summer). She just bought a house and asked me if she could pay me to do demo for 3 hours. She didn’t tel me how much and she assumes that I’ll automatically say yes because I’m not working. 

I’m working on getting a job, but I’m distracted by the lack of respect I get from my family. I’ll be moving out soon enough and I already know that nobody is going to help me move anything when I move out.

How do I keep my composure in a family that’s constantly co dependent. When I’m trying to become entirely independent. (I’m starting to wonder if this is why my brother moved)",08Oct2019,1

512,"It's my birthday and my family was so so so so incredibly nice to me and got me a new FitBit watch that cost like \~$300. The thought honestly made me cry because I'm bad at accepting expensive gifts, I feel like I don't deserve it and I feel like the money, the watch itself, and their kindness is just wasted on me. I'm also angry at myself because I know I don't need it, I don't even exercise, I rarely leave the house and my phone can kind of do all that stuff anyway...  
Of course I acted happy to make them happy, but what should I do? They wasted money on me and I feel so bad and guilty. I love them so much and the watch is pretty but I feel like my sister would like it more. When I suggested sharing it they just insisted that it was mine.  


I know this is a really stupid problem to have but I feel so bad about it, I don't want to feel like I wasted their money or like the watches' existence... What should I do? I don't think they can get a refund because I don't think they have the receipt anymore.",08Oct2019,2
513,"Currently going to a large state school (20,000 students) in my sophomore year on the bachelor of nursing track. Don’t have many friends and not a fan of the large class sizes. Wife goes to small private college (2,000 students) 15 mins away from my school. We both live on campus at the private schools non trad student apartments. Both colleges have excellent nursing programs. I make money going to the large public (scholarships/financial aid) but would make more money per semester by going to the small private. So debt/money isn’t an issue going to either school. I would be closer (5 min walk) and have a smaller class size if I were to go to the private school. Do you think it would be a bad idea to transfer?",08Oct2019,1
514,"A few months ago, I relocated from Boston to South Korea after deciding to take a break from school. I study music, so I decided to try and meet some Korean musicians or at least people interested in music so that I could get a little situated. I came across a recently formed musician's club (with a focus on songwriting, which is a part of my major) filled with a few musicians working in the field, but mostly amateur hobby musicians (the club is currently at around 70-ish people). I grasped at an opportunity to become one of the organizers, mainly because I thought it would help me get to know the club members a lot better, which it has. I also naively thought that it would help me influence the direction the club would go in, but our chief is pretty stubborn and has very strong opinions on how to run a club.

Over the past three months I've become increasingly tired of the chief organizer. He's a great guy and I like him a lot, but there are a bunch of things about him that I've begun to notice that are exhausting to me as someone that works with him. This guy has a job in the IT field, but founded this club because he is also a hobby musician with a lot of passion. He has his own way of running things, and I respect that a lot, but his lack of knowledge in the field of music is really showing, and it's heavily impacting the way I usually run music-making/sharing sessions, for example. He's also the type of guy that is, depending on how you look at it, incredibly detailed and thorough, or just completely draining to work with. Even though he probably wouldn't admit it, he's a control freak that needs to know EVERYTHING that is going on within the club.

If I want to initiate a project, he needs to know all the details beforehand, even when he has nothing to do with it, and because of it, won't let anyone start anything if he has too much on his plate at that time because ""I just don't have the spare time to also think about your project right now, so let's do it in like two months"". Another fellow organizer suddenly became inactive a few weeks ago (I assume because he was tired of dealing with our chief organizer), and I'm the only one left, which puts all the burden on me. He's brought this up to me saying that I'm the only guy he really trusts to help him run the club, and that he really appreciates how much dedication and effort I put into running it. He's cited that I'm incredibly responsible and that I usually follow up with the suggestions I make, but this is beginning to feel like a curse and a facade to me and I am getting very, very tired of putting this much thought into something I thought would take a lot less of my time.

I know for a fact that me deciding to give up my position as an organizer would be a huge impact on him, and would likely affect our relationship outside of club related things. I've also ""dug my foot in"" quite deep and suggested a lot of new projects recently, but I'm regretting it now. If I suggest something that he might disagree with, 40% of the time we'll find a compromise, but the other 60% of the time he'll usually give me a hard time by asking me all the 'what ifs', and asking if I have a backup plan in case it doesn't work out, even when it's a brainstorming session. That isn't inherently bad, but I've had 10+ years of experience in writing music and I know for a fact that a lot of my methods work, which is why I usually don't have a back up plan. Because they work and that's how I've always done it. He's started learning how to write music like a year ago, at most.

I feel bad because I know that even after all I'm saying here, he still does like 60\~70% of the work and tries hard to make sure I'm not overburdened, but it's HIS club and even though I was the one that stepped up to become an organizer, I had no idea working with this person would be this mentally taxing. He's also good at inadvertently guilt tripping me into not quitting, especially when he compares me to a lot of other people that are ""all talk and no action"". He has no idea I have intentions of quitting, because like the idiot I am, every indication that I have given so far has been that I am going to remain in this club for a long, long time.

How do I tell him that I wish to step down without impacting our relationship and without looking like a total irresponsible jerk?",08Oct2019,1
516,"I got a job about 2 weeks ago at a Mathnasium, I never signed any documents because the owners were kind of overwhelmed after their director left.

518,"My friend asked me last year to be her MOH, and I excitedly accepted.  We’ve been friends for a long time and she has helped plan my baby shower, and was my MOH for my very small wedding, with minimal responsibility. I was happy to be able to return the favor, and honored because we don’t actually see each other as much as we used to, since I got married and began having children. 
Shortly after, she began making plans for her own bachelor/bachelorette destination excursion.  Just as a bit of a disclaimer, nobody in our friend group is making a ton of money, and generally in the lower middle class range.  Once I heard this, I began to panic a bit, as I’m a SAHM surviving on a part time income plus my husband’s income, and don’t even have the money to go on our own vacation. My children are both young, and I can’t imagine leaving them to attend a long weekend hotel party on the other side of the country like my friend was originally planning for. I expressed that I didn’t think I would be able to
attend, and was treated like a bit of a stick in the mud. 
Fast-forward a few months, and I fell pregnant again, and announced to my friend. I basically told her that I would do the best I could, but was definitely a bit overwhelmed that we were having another baby so soon (BC failed but we always wanted one more, so we took it in stride). At this point, her wedding plans had changed a few times (destination wedding, other various ideas, and finally settled on something local at a country club, but still bigger than we had all anticipated).
I just want to point out that my friend and I used to hang out and party a lot back in the day, and used to be really close; as we got older, I settled down, and she kept on partying and socializing. She is always on the go, has a full calendar of things to do, almost every day of the week, whereas my main focus is always my kids. So at this point, she has come to the realization that I won’t be able to keep up at all with her social calendar, and she winds up asking another friend of hers, whom she hasn’t really known well for more than a few years, and I hardly know at all, to be her “Maid of Honor”, and rationalizes it with, “well, because you’re married, you will be Matron of Honor”. Ok, whatever. It is what it is. I found this out after I realized that my friend had invited this other girl to go dress shopping with her (which I had try to ask my friend to do with me a few times, and it never worked out). So she coincidentally finds the dress, and then tells me later on that she is making this girl also MOH.  At this point, I just kind of want to be done with the stress of it, and ask her if it would be ok if I could just be a regular bridesmaid, and the other girl can just take the reigns of MOH. My friend is upset by this, and she tells me later that she cried about it, and asked if I would please stay on as her MOH, so to appease her and make her happy again, I told her that I would. 
Since this has all happened, I have no idea what my role in any of this is supposed to entail. The other girl has basically began making plans for the bridal shower which I mentioned months prior to her, with several of my own ideas. She completely dismissed them, and wants to do what she wants to do, but wants everyone else in the bridal party to contribute money toward throwing it. 
I am feeling a bit offended that the other girl is not even consulting me on anything, and it’s giving me hard feelings. I still want to be able to help out where I can, but I hardly know this other girl, and I don’t feel like I can be candid with her. She also gives me a vibe of being very eager to be my friend’s BFF, so it’s obvious she is trying to go above and beyond to assert her role as the BFF. 
I am preggo and overly emotional, I am sure, which is why I am not sure about how I’m supposed to feel right now. My friend has also made minimal effort to hang out with me in the past few months, which has really kind of hurt my feelings. I feel like the effort is all on my end, and I just can’t keep up with her in the way that our other friends do. 
Should I express how I’m feeling to my friend? I’m not sure where to go from here. Wedding is still not until middle of next year. I want to be a good friend and be helpful in any way that I can, but I am sick of spinning my wheels about how I should feel, and how much effort I should pour into this. Although my friend has always been there and made an effort for me over the years, I have always made it easy, and never expected much. This is not at all a situation that is minimal effort, and is turning out to be very big and costly (my baby shower was in-home, my bachelorette party was a paint and sip, and I had no bridal shower). 
Please go easy on the advice, I just want to do the right thing and stop having hard feelings.",08Oct2019,1
519,"I’m a recent college grad with a solid degree and thankfully no undergraduate debt due to some scholarships I earned and some supplementary help from my parents. 

I’m taking a gap year or two before I go to grad school (ideally law school) to make some money for myself and get experience in the workforce. I currently live at home which is fine, my parents more or less respect my space but there has been some adjusting when it comes to viewing me as an adult but still their son. Though the problems we’ve run into haven’t been big issues for me, I would love to have that feeling of independence that I had in college living on my own. A new location closer to work would be a huge upside but downsides are the expenses of living on your own with rent, utilities, food, etc. My house now is close-ish to the big metro area where I work, but I still have an hour and a half door-to-door commute. However my mom is a great cook and as long as I do some extra chores around the house I don’t have to feed myself. Plus I’ve been working for 4 months now and have sort of settled into a routine with finding time for going to the gym and studying for the LSAT. 

Recently a friend from college asked me if I wanted to find a place to move in with him and I’m so split on what to do. On one hand it would be freeing and so much fun, but on the other I wouldn’t want to screw myself into future debt through student loans and not having saved enough.

This boy in my year joined our friendship group a few months ago and since then he’s been hanging out with us all the time. Over the past few weeks, we have been talking to eachother a lot more and have become more comfortable in each others presence. We also make a lot of sexual ‘jokes’ (I say them in quotations as sometimes they seem half serious), to the point where he even said he wouldn’t mind doing ‘it’ with me.
He smiles at me and will give me side glances during conversations that I may not be involved in. He asks if I’m feeling okay when I look a bit down and is accepting of my medical issues. We are very open with eachother about most things and we get along well.

Hey, I was hoping somebody here could give me some relationship advice. Two weeks ago my gf broke up with me (we're both 18 if someone is curious and had a long distance relationship, at that point we had been together for almost two months) and her reasons for that were: we don't have much in common and she doesn't have a lot of free time because of school. We agreed on staying friends and texted once since that (just to tell each other how we were doing).

Yesterday she posted on her private ig videos of her singing a love/break up song (the lyrics said something like ""nobody loves you as much as I do"") and below that she wrote: another sleepless night because I miss you. I still love you.

Obviously I assume it's about me but she didn't text me anything regarding that videos and I don't know what to do.

I still really love her and want her back, but it was her who broke up with me due to my personality. I don't know whether to text her, ask her for another chance or just don't react at all. What would you do in my situation?

I appreciate every answer, thank you",08Oct2019,1

536,"This will be a little long because it is a somewhat complicated situation. I recently interviewed for a copywriting position at a marketing agency. The first interview went well, and one of the people I interviewed with knew my top reference personally. After the interview, my recruiter informed me that they were on the fence because they (specifically the Vice President) were a little concerned that I didn't have enough experience. I thought this was weird since they brought me in based on my resume and portfolio, but oh well. 

A second interview was scheduled; this time, with the Vice President. My recruiter told me that he just wanted to meet me and ask me questions about why I wanted to work at a growing company, what I thought I could add, etc. This is not what happened at all. The Vice President started by telling me he wasn't going to ask me any hard questions, and proceeded to ask about my personal interests. Some of the questions were

• What kind of places does your band play in?

• What genres of music do you listen to?

• What do you think of Eminem's lyrics?

• Were you involved in extracurricular activities in high school? (For perspective, I've been out of college for a year)

He then asked me if I did anything outside of music. I told him I had tried writing a short story recently but it was still too early to tell where it was going to. He asked the genre. I said horror. He asked for an overarching theme, and I hesitantly replied, ""Demons."" He made a face, and then proceeded to ask me a few more personal questions before asking me, ""How do you feel about prayer in the work place"". I said it wouldn't bother me, and he asked if I was sure. He asked several questions about if I was really truly sure that I was ok with it, and then finally changed the subject to the job. He asked me some very simple questions like ""Do you think you're a good writer"" and ""Why did your last internship not hire you"", before ending the interview.

The following week, my recruiter told me I had offended the VP with my demon answer and that he said I was clearly a bad fit, and that I didn't seem to care about learning anything new. My recruiter seemed concerned when I told her about the line of questioning, and promptly called the marketing company's HR. About halfway through the week, I was called back by the recruiter. She said she hadn't heard anything, but that the Senior Copywriter was surprised they weren't going to hire me stating to the VP, ""We're seriously not going to hire this guy because YOU don't like what he writes about in his spare time?"" After a few more days of silence, my recruiter called me this morning and told me that the marketing agency was still thinking they would need someone with more experience and that they just thought I might be too junior for the position. No further interviews were scheduled or anything, they just said that they'd be looking to fill a copywriter position sometime in November.

**1.** I'm frustrated because

I worked my ass for 3 weeks for NOTHING. 

we were performing  monologues in acting class, so I bought and read the whole play maybe 40 times to add depth, life, and understanding to my small monologue.

I marked up the script to identify where and when the progression so i could pinpoint exactly where my character was at for my monologue and I rehearsed till i drove myself crazy and I changed my physicality at work and home, stiff and deliberate, controlled, which is exhausting for me because the Character moves and speaks so differently from me but I knew it would help my performance and I hung white sheets on my wall and cleaned my whole apartment out so I could have that stale sterile empty longing feeling that the Character feels and I only watched sad and depressing things and read and listened to women talk about infidelity online and took all these online acting coaches and videos and deep dives and the Michael Cain Acting Class the Uta Hagen masterclass the real actual website masterclass and worked my script every which way and paid for an energy healer to help unblock what always felt stuck whenever I get up and perform all for fucking nothing I had a breakdown the day before and I had a breakdown the day of, I was having such a bad panic attack that I was vomiting and I almost didn't go to our final performance because I knew I would only embarrass myself but I went anyways and I just shut down and panicked and performed so pathetically I made a fucking fool of myself because I'm not even a little bit talented everyone clapped so awkwardly after you could hear the ""yikes"" in it and I cried all the way to the train station, on the train, on the next train, on the bus, and a little bit at Walmart so I looked and felt a mess and The only thing I want in the world is to be a performer it's the only thing I used to be good at but now I'm not even good at that so what's the fucking point in anything

\-then my other estranged sister I've heard nothing about in over 5 or 6 years just messaged me out of the blue to say she found out she's infertile and wants me to have a baby for her which is psychotic and I understand she's probably going crazy with grief but who the fuck messages someone who's basically a stranger and just says that.  (and this all happened in the same week that's a lot of WTF for someone easily overwhelmed like me)

**3.** My anxiety is the worst it's ever been I can't have physical contact with anyone without having a fucking meltdown so I can't get fucked can't pay for a cuddle buddy to even give me a hug.I never learned social skills because of my childhood neglect and not really having teenage years because I was just trying to not kill myself, so now I just don't know how to interact with other people. totally friendless. I never talk to anybody. ever. I don't know how.

**4.** I can't afford to go to the doctor I need a lot of medication and tests but I need money but to get that money I need to be mentally healthier but I can't get mentally healthier unless I'm on medication so i'm stuck in that circle

**5.** when I was young/a dancer I had a severe eating disorder and I would starve myself or vomit everything up to the point where my periods disappeared and my hair was falling out my nails where falling off and that's mostly better but the malnutrition and throwing up every day for FOUR AND A HALF YEARS means there's stomach acid constantly coming up in my mouth so now my teeth or completely fucked up and yellow and red gums and gross and I've already blown a lot of money trying to get them slowly fixed but i still need some procedures done to fix them more so they don't literally just fall out

and I make them worse because of my anxiety i grind them constantly I wake up every single day with a migraine both because I only have really fucked up nightmares and also because I grind my teeth all night long which also aids the fact that I'm always exhausted from never getting a real nights sleep

and that's money I just don't have 

**6.**  I thought I'd splurge and join acting classes because that's the only thing that makes me happy but I fucking suck at it and I'm paying for it with money I've saved up so now there's nothing in my savings and I get paid minimum wage so I'm basically left with nothing so I'm going to have to drop acting classes probably.

and

now,

now.

the biggest one of all. the one that has me basically delirious with panic.

**7.** my ghetto apartment complex, where the walls peel off themselves, rats in the ceiling, cockroach infested, neighbors stole my last two packages with expensive shit I need for my health (helps calm the acid and damage done by all the vomiting in my gut), they smoke crack on the shared balcony and trash the stair well and sometimes there'll just be somebody sleeping in the stairwell which has no lights so it could be a neighbor, a homeless guy,a dead body, you don't know. 

my complex is raising our rent from a total of **$1,048, to $1,169** and that's ONLY if we renew by Nov 1st, if we renew it after Nov 1st it'll get **raised even higher,** so we have just this month, to find a new place to live or a new roomie to replace mine that's leaving that's MARTA accessible because I don't have a car or a license and I can't afford any of that anyways.

and on top of it all

I am still fat and ugly with incurable acne. 

when I first moved away from home I was homeless but it didn't matter because I could just suck dick for money, I was suicidal and didn't care what happened to me as long as I could pursue my dream of acting. and I did that for awhile, but something just clicked in my brain one day two years ago and now if anyone touches me in an even remotely sexual manner I start panicking and crying. so if I don't find a place, or a roomie within the next few weeks (they only notified us Oct 4th) I have no idea what to do. it's just a lot happening all at once and I don't have anyone to get advice from.

554,"I posted this on another subreddit; I posted it here as well because I wanted to get a wide variety of answers. This is going to be a rambling rant; I apologize in advance for that.

Since I was a kid, I thought I wanted to go into teaching. 

I entered college for teaching high school level literature. I started my first pre-prac this semester and I absolutely hate it. The teacher is kind of an asshole and unprofessional, and the school itself is absolutely chaotic. I’m almost done, thank fuck. I can’t wait to finish it.

I did substitute teaching for middle school during my school breaks, and that was actually not too bad. The school was also chaotic and the students could be assholes, but it was for the middle school that I used to go to myself, and I think I might have a soft spot for the school because of that. Also the administration left me alone for the most part, so I could run the classroom for the day any way I felt like it.

I really enjoy literature, writing, and the analysis and discussions we have for the books in my courses. I also like the education courses themselves, just not the student teaching aspect. I also definitely want to do some kind of work where I’m helping others, I’m just not sure if teaching is for me. I tried talking to my advisor, but he honestly wasn’t much help with this.

I’m thinking of a few possible options for me:

1) Becoming a professor.
2) Working in a school, but not as a teacher. 
3) Doing some kind of editorial work.

Not only is it crazy, mean, and wildly inaccurate but see...I, her daughter, have been battling cancer for the last year and a half. I was diagnosed during my pregnancy.

561,"(TL;DR at the bottom)

I've been working on my confidence a lot as of late. I can speak to strangers and friends just fine now. It's no problem.

However, when it comes to my own family, I'm at a stand still. There's a long family history, but I'll try to keep it brief.

My  mother and I are incredibly different. She's very dogmatic and likes  all of the basic things because everyone else does. She doesn't really  think for herself as much as she subscribes to the most popular things.  Top 10 music, basic TV shows like The Voice, Reality TV, etc. Just all  of the popular consumerist stuff.

This  makes it sort of hard to relate with her. I'm very contemplative,  eclectic, and like to think for myself and form my own opinions on  things. So when I sit in the living room with her, we often disagree on  what to watch and there will always be an awkward silence after some small  talk. I want to converse with her of course, but I don't like to gossip  or talk about people or things at school and work. I like to talk about  ideas, events, possibility, philosophy.

Whenever  I talk about something I'm deeply into or passionate about, she'll just  smile and nod like ""Ah, I see."" But it never moves forward, there's no  exchange of ideas or opinions. Almost all of her conversations with not  just me, but my brother, and even her husband are all very brief and  easy to digest. I don't want to say artificial, but it sure as hell  feels like it sometimes. I want to be able to converse openly with her  as I do my friends. I'm at a loss of going about that. We have some  things in common, but it doesn't extend far. We both like certain comedy  shows and certain movies, but I don't want that to be our only bonding  point. Especially since she only likes easy-to-digest movies, like  Disney movies and superhero films. And while I like some of those too  (I'm admittedly a Marvel nerd), I prefer films that are intelligent and  subtle, often rated R. I don't mean to sound like a pompous ass, I'm  just saying it like it is.

My  stepdad is basically the same. Likes all of the basic stuff because  everyone else does; he's also a huge fan of football. There's a divide  because I'm not really a sports fan and he doesn't really know how to  relate with me either. He mainly goes to my brother for those things.  Small talk central with him too. He only graduated high school, and no  offense, but still has a frat/jock type of mentality. Which makes me  avoid him a lot.

This all results  in me either isolating myself in my room, or just leaving my house  altogether to hang with friends. I only come out to the living room  rarely, which only lasts an hour before I get bored and return to my  room. I don't like this though. I have friends that are incredibly close  with their families and I feel so envious. Being able to hold a *real*  conversation with my family just seems like a dream at this point. I  feel like an outsider when I'm with them. My biological father told me  that I just outgrew them, which I guess is true. But it would be nice if  we could converse more and do things together instead of me isolating  myself all the time. I just don't know how to go about it. I feel like  I'll attempt but then get hit with the small talk wall, where it's  impossible to budge from there.

I need some help guys. I have some fascinating conversations with my friends and I'd love to have those with my family as well.

TL;DR  My mom and step dad are very different from me in more ways than one  and I'd like to know how to get past the small talk and converse like a  normal family.",08Oct2019,1

Starting out with sorry but english is not a first language

To start off, my family is extremely religious. Like, it's been drilled into my siblings and my head about the importance of God and all that. Yet somehow, I ended being an atheist when I was still a tween. My parents do not know this and I've acted along the prayers and stuff for many years to hold up the act that I'm still a Muslim just so that I can still live with them(I was still studying with no personal source of income) 

That said, I have finished my education and holding a very stable, well paying full time job and have planned to move out some time next year and start a new chapter with my girlfriend.

 I have a plan and it's actually solid, except I don't know how to tell my parents I want to move out. The worst case would be telling them I'm an atheist. But the thing is, they're both two of the nicest people and as much as possible I don't want to hurt their feelings. I'm not so sure how to deal or cope with this. I know my siblings will be around to take care of them but I'm getting stressed over not knowing how badly they will react to it. Especially considering I'm very young to be moving out where I'm from (21). I am just really stressed out by the guilt of having to move out but I want to move out because I think its best to let them know the truth before it snowballs into a huge problem and makes it even harder to finally open up

Even with my girlfriend out of context, I do actually want to move out anyways due to other personal reasons

I have my own cat and my cat is vaccinated, fixed, and healthy. Her cat was rescued off the street (I actually rescued both of our cats), and she has never taken her cat to the vet. So I don't want to risk the cats being together at the expense of my cat (just in case). 

She lives decently far from me, and I have a busy schedule. I'm only able to spend a half-hour at her house every day. Here's the problem: her apartment continues to smell worse and worse the longer she's gone. I think it's a combination of it not being clean, the cat, and the lack of air movement (I can't open a window as the cat will jump out and we don't live somewhere with central air). From getting off the elevator on her floor, I can hear the cat screaming. It's also started destroying things. It's clearly very unhappy. And I don't like sitting in her apartment for more than a few minutes because of the dirt and the smell. She also didn't leave enough supplies and I've had to buy and carry giant bags of food and litter from the grocery store (a 30-min walk). 

She's not paying me for any of this. And I didn't realize how much of a commitment this would be. 

Do I tell her what's going on? Or see if we can come up with another solution? I don't want to continue watching the cat, but obviously I'm not going to leave it alone for another week. But her cat is basically by itself for 2.5 weeks... What should I do?",08Oct2019,0

575,"I’m a college student and have taken most of my generals. I find trying to decide on a major terrifying- I have more of a commitment issue with this than I ever did with deciding to get married, or so I like to joke (didn’t hesitate at all with saying yes). I’m envious of people who know what they want to do right off the bat, and I’m afraid of wasting time. I want to finish college as soon as possible. I tried an interior design class and I hated it (I’m just not the artsy type as much as I love watching HGTV), I like the idea of biology but when I took a class I passed with a C. I ace any English classes, and I’m enjoying my government class currently. It’s been a while since I’ve tried any math classes. I really have no idea what to do, and the college counselors couldn’t seem less interested. How do people make up their minds on a major? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",08Oct2019,1
576,"A bit of backstory, my ex is not a stable guy. For the first six months it was super honeymoon phase but then it turned really bad. The next 1.5 years were him constantly accusing me of cheating on him, manipulating him, and lying about my entire sexual history, none of which I'd done so I figured it was something we could work through (idk why lol). He was ultimately more of an interrogator than a boyfriend and would frequently twist my actual past into his worst nightmares, claim they were true, then break up with me shortly followed by begging for me back explaining how he understood he was wrong. One of these times he broke up with me I just said ok I'm entirely done and stopped replying all together. He dumped me and I was simply respecting it.

He went crazy ofc. Sent thousands of texts, left hundreds of voicemails until I was forced to change my number as blocking him still allowed voicemail thru. He sent 6 months worth of daily emails to my abandoned email cycling between the most vulgar and insulting shit to begging me to talk. He accused me of being in porn videos he'd found, something I've never done, but he convinced himself it was me banging people he'd been jealous of and went so far as to tell my mom and friends and send it to them. They all knew it wasn't me and were offended to have been sent it lol. He did this twice with different vids. 

Finally after 6 months of my spam box being filled to the brim with this shit I contacted his truly awesome and very Christian/all about acting with dignity and respect mother with a couple screenshots of vulgar things he'd then recently sent to my MOM about me ""going to college to study dick"" hahah. She was extremely apologetic and I made sure to be very polite and explain to me this in no way reflected her or her husband's parenting, I understood my ex had deeper issues that no parent could've foreseen. 

It was silence from him for like 7 months, I assume his mom confronted him and he was being monitored for a time and forced back into therapy. Then, about a month ago he started messaging me again, all sappy and weird and cryptic as usual. I responded once to say I don't want to talk, please respect that and move on. He continued with his tirades, saying ""we'll be together in a few years"" and the day I changed my Facebook header photo to one of me and my dog (a dog who's never been posted on my FB before) he sent a message asking me to come for a hike so ""I can meet your doggo."" He's blocked on FB so idk how he even saw that. 

Anyway today I received a box from Amazon and didnt order anything recently. It's a Carole King album, someone I've never listened to but the songs are deeply dramatic like my ex. I checked the gift app thing and sure enough it was him. This feels weird, like he's trying to buy his way into me talking to him while subtly saying ""I still know where you live."" My plan is to return it for a physical gift card routed to his house. What do you think? Sorry for the long read I just thought I was done with this and today he made a physical ripple in my life.",08Oct2019,1
577,"I am an over-thinker.

For as long as I can remember, this has been the case. As soon as simple daily occurrences cross my path, I default to always expecting or thinking the worst or the most negative thing possible. 

Absolute petty shit can happen and my mind blows it up like you can not imagine. It normally starts with this incredibly uncomfortable feeling in my stomach and I simply cannot get myself to a point, to take a step back, breath and not think the worst.

I expect the worst and as soon as something like this happens, I always feel the person is not being truthful. To be fair, in about 70% of cases it turned out I was right and they were, in fact, lying to me, some may call it their ""gutt feeling"" but the issue is, I don't want to be bothered by petty stuff anymore. 

A stupid example: I very dear friend of mine sent me a random screenshot of a chat we had a  while back. I noticed she hadn't saved my number and automatically I lost my proverbial shit internally. I confronted her about it and she said yeah her phone does that some times and it happens so often that she doesn't even bother saving everyone number over and over again anymore, so technically I was right and my number wasn't saved, but for very understanding reasons, the issue is, here I was, thinking all kinds of shit like, maybe she doesn't want to be friends anymore, am I not important to her, etc etc.

I don't know if the two go hand in hand, overthinking shit and being bothered by petty stuff that shouldn't even be stuff to worry about, but how do I stop?

Are there any exercises I can do in the heat of the moment to get myself to relax, or to shut my brain down for a moment and not blow everything out of proportion",08Oct2019,1
578,"I work 80% remotely; boss casually asked me to start coming in 3 days/week...  I realize I'm totally spoiled with my current work situation but I need some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't love my job. I get paid full time to do medical billing at home \~25 hours/week. I come in on average once a week to help out and cover for coworkers. It pays OK and I have pretty bad anxiety so sometimes I feel like this job is the only thing I can do. I've been doing this for almost 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday (while I was out of town/on PTO), my boss emailed me asking if I would come in twice per week to sit at our second front desk near where one of our doctors works to ""keep her company."" He only ""needs"" me there 9-12 Tuesdays and Thursdays but he's implied that he wants me to work there all day. This particular doctor is very needy; I realize that by sitting with her these two days, I would be taking on a whole bunch of extra paperwork for her and spending the entire workday listening to her complain about how the office is run. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do not want to do this.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I'd like to help the company out, but does it seem fair to ask me to essentially take on a second role without any increased compensation/promotion? We're a small company so there's no room for me to move up, but he might be able to at least offer me a better job title and a little raise/bonus. It seems ludicrous for me to say yes without asking for anything in return, but I don't know what would be fair to ask for in return for losing all of the freedom I currently have (usually I go stay with family in Florida for a couple weeks in January/go home for a full week at Christmas/house-sit for friends and family for a week at a time out of state etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

I always joked that if my boss asked me to come in any more than I currently am I'd quit and go back to school to pursue something I actually find interesting. I just feel so lost right now; I've been doing this job for a long time, I got this job straight out of college, and I finally got my life to the point where I wasn't anxious all the time because I have the flexibility to not feel constantly ""stuck.""

My coworker and trainer, 40s?M, just got diagnosed with bladder cancer and I would like to do something for him but don't want to overstep my bounds. He's been really friendly and nice to me and I'd like to return the favor. He loves video games, anime, and sushi a lot-- married with kids.

I want to eventually ask him about whether or not he'd be interested in psilocybin but, again, don't want to cross any lines although he does seem open to marijuana at least.

Idk, I've never dealt with cancer in my family so I feel like an asshole for having little to say. I'm also a kid compared to this guy and understand that my wisdom doesn't mean shit in that regard.

580,"Hey,

I dont really feel like I have any friends. All I ever do is talk with them in class but its just like we throw a few words at each other and stuff. Or I go home with one of my classmates and we talk but its always about school. 

Weve walked home together and there was another one of my classmates and that dude I regurally walk home invited the second guy to a club or whatevs but he didnt invite me. Noone ever does. 

Ive had this friend - a girl who I used to skype with till late night but eventually I kinda felt like I loved her and stuffbut it didnt really work out. That was like 2-3 years ago. We still talk every now and then but she wont even let me follow her on insta. idk.She is a great person and Id love to talk with her still but idk.

And when I invite someone to go somewhere and do stuff, they always say no.all I ever do is that I walk home from school learn some stupid shit and prepare for the next day and I sit at the PC for 7 hours straight meanwhile Ill try to invite someone somewhere every now and then but yeah, as I said, its always a no.

Recently I felt like its been getting better with the guy, Im going home with, mainly Ive seen improvement when I lead with value, such as when I send him some materials when he didnt go to school etc. He sometimes smiles ans starts convo now.

Last summer holidays, Ive lost 10kgs and cut my long ugly hair, so I dont look like a witch anymore, after that, I felt like I became a bit more outgoing. People not staring at me at the streets helped as well haha, tho it felt very new and different in the first moments.

581,"Hi all, over the weekend there was an unexpected death in my family that has shaken all of us, and I tried to go to classes on Monday but I couldn't focus and I didn't care about anything.

I emailed all of my professors letting them know that I'm gonna be absent on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, and that I'll be back on Thursday and Friday. I just need some time to myself to recuperate and mourn in peace instead of in class.

My physics professor said that she needs more documentation to excuse my absence bc the email was not enough.

What does she mean by that? What type of documentation am I supposed to provide?

I'm not gonna call up my grieving aunt and say ""hey my physics professor needs you to tell her that your oldest child passed over the weekend.""

It seems cruel and inappropriate that my professor would ask for documentation, but I get that some people would use a family member death as an excuse to get out of class (which is awful and should never be done).

582,"Through out my life, my mom brought me up to be maybe way too empathetic. She taught me that if someone is mean, disrespectful, awful, to me there is a reason behind it and we can’t expect people to treat us well all the time so we should just allow it.

As a result, I got in some pretty bad relationships and put up with a lot of bad friendships too. 

A year ago I had a guy lead me on for like 8 months and it was pretty clear he was using me but my mom told me that this was normal and sometimes people do things like that and that’s ok.

I rely on my mom’s advice because growing up she literally told me to her face that I’d be nothing without her and that she gave up her whole life to have me and my sister and that I should basically worship the ground she walks on. She drilled it into my head that she’s always right about things and without her I’d basically be nothing. She told me my dad doesn’t know how to parent and that she did all the work and he contributed nothing (which isn’t true) She’s like Mother Gothel from that movie Tangled. She even sings the song. 

I grew up believing I wasn’t that smart as she’d tell everyone that “oh it takes an entire village to raise Tabeer” (me) and that I’m not capable of making my own decisions and such. 

Now I have a personality where I let people walk all over me and am afraid to tell others how I truly feel. I’m starting to break free from my mom now that I’m older but she just screams, yells, calls me names, puts me down and throws things at me. 

I feel like I was robbed of so many things now because I could have grown up to learn self respect, standing up for myself, and not have been so attached to my mom. Had I been allowed to be more independent maybe.

Well it is her sister's childhood blanket, but still meaningful to her. The blanket had ducks all over it. It was in my room when I moved in and stayed in there until the end of me lease. Nearing the move out, she told me I should try and get rid of the furniture in my room as she didn't know if the new tenants would want it.


 The next couple days I made several trips to the thrift store and among the donated objects was the duck blanket. I assumed that her request to get rid of the furniture was also a way of her saying to clean up the room as much as possible. This was early August.


Fast forward to last night, I get a text from her asking if I still had the duck blanket because it's her sister's childhood blanket and she needed it back. My heart sank, and I knew I just had to be as honest as I could. I told her it was either in my closet, at my parents' house, or donated. She seemed immediately upset and kept asking why I would do such a thing, why I didn't ask her about it. The truth is that I didn't know, I didn't put in the effort to ask, and in my ignorance I did what I thought would be helpful, as she was also moving out and needed to get rid of stuff.


I asked my parents to check, nothing turned up. I asked someone I know to check the Goodwill to see if it might be there, I'm still waiting to hear back. Right now it's not looking good, and the blanket may be gone forever. I feel awful and guilty and all I can do is apologize.

597,"Hi all,

I'm a freshman in college living with one other girl in a shared room. From my perspective, everything was fine between us. We haven't spoken much as we're both pretty reserved, but the few interactions we've had have been nice. I've gone out of my way to be considerate towards her; I try not to make too much noise, I'm typically a night owl but I try to tuck it in early to avoid disturbing her, I never have guests, I shower twice a day and clean my room religiously. I even clean the sink and vacuum the room which wouldn't happen if it weren't for me. 

Last night, I got back to the room and as I was digging through my purse for my keys, I overheard her say on the phone, ""yeah, and I'm stuck with a terrible roommate"". I'm shocked, my feelings are hurt and I'm confused. I try my best to be a good roommate and pride myself on being a considerate person. The only things I can think of that could be a point of contention are:

1) I had my boyfriend in the room TWO times total. The first time, I was crying because something happened and he came over for about 30 minutes to console me. We were both fully clothed and lying side by side in my bed. Nothing sexual or even intimate. The second time, he surprised me and brought me a smoothie and stayed for maybe 15-20 minutes. I can understand if she would've wanted a heads up, but she's said nothing and hasn't given me any way to contact her about these kinds of things in advance. Since then, he hasn't been back; I visit him instead.

2) I've come into the room while she was sleeping a couple of times. I used to work late at the start of the semester so sometimes I would come back late. I was always as quiet as I can be, but putting the key in the door and showering just aren't quiet activities by default. Again, this hasn't happened in probably a month or so. I've been adamant about going to bed around the same time as her to avoid disturbance.

3) I have a ""bitchy resting face""; I always have and I'm pretty insecure about it. It's just my face, and even when I think I look nice, I still look mean. I don't look at her, so there's no way she could feel threatened by it. 

She has things I don't particularly care for either; she loves sloths which I am terrified of, and has sloth decorations all over the room. She uses her phone flashlight at night for everything which is pretty bright and a little obnoxious at times. She cracks her fingers and copies a lot of my mannerisms and even arranged her side of the room almost identically to mind; I've said nothing, because I understand that there's no such thing as a perfect roommate.

At this point, I'm uncomfortable being in my own room. I don't wanna be somewhere where I'm not wanted, especially when I'm doing my best and it's still not good enough. I could switch rooms but I don't feel like I should be the one to leave when I'm not the one with the issue and I haven't done anything unreasonable. I'm just angry and hurt and I don't know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",08Oct2019,1

607,"So, some context: I have been best friends with my best friend for about 7 years. We were two peas in a pod, and tried to do almost everything we could together. We met in college/university in our late teens/early twenties, and have been close friends ever since. Long story short, our friendship has been mostly long distance as I moved back home after school which is about 3 hours away from the city we met, and went to school together in. However, we always tried to make things work between our hectic busy schedules between texting, calls, and arranging visits. As much as I could, I tried to prioritize our friendship between hectic demands of full-time university and work. I would usually be the one to make the long, three hour drive to visit without ever making a complaint. I re-arranged trips with family, and work commitments to make our meetings work. For the most part, I always felt like the relationship effort was on the same page and largely reciprocal.

As most friendships, we have had our ups and downs. We have both made mistakes, and I've always tried to undo any wrong doings/change as much as I could anytime an issue was identified. A few years ago, she opened up about some personal anxiety issues and how certain things I have done upset her. For example, I was late one evening picking her up from a bus terminal (approx. 30 mins) in a big city which was approx. 45 mins - 1 hour from my own home town at the time. Initially, I was already in the city for a school placement and was hoping we could meet around the time I finished so I wouldn't have to make a separate commute to pick her up. She ended up booking her train last minute at a late time which meant I would have to go home, and come back later to pick her up. I had rushed to finish a homework assignment, and I underestimated traffic back to the city. When I picked her up she was upset, and had later revealed to me she had a panic attack (she had a fear of big cities at the time) when I said I was going to be a little late. She very much came across that this, and any time I had been late (i.e. meeting up for an entire weekend visit I would approximate 2 but may show up around 3:30) I was somehow deliberately being a bad friend. We talked things out, and I had explained I had no idea how any of this affected her as I am more laid back. We eventually buried the hatchet, but the whole confrontation weighed heavy on my heart. I was upset I hurt her, but I was also upset that somehow this qualified me as a ""bad friend"" which has led to some resentment. Over time, I tried to accommodate for any identified wrong doings... maybe even overcompensating as much as I could but never felt like anything I said was addressed or validated with the same care. For example, my friend never considered herself good at make-up or hair. On nights we would go out together, I would offer to help her get ready which eventually turned into my friend expecting me to do her hair/make-up every time we went out like she was stepping into a beauty salon. It eventually meant that getting ready was stressful as we usually had limited time. It meant I would spend twice as much time trying to get ready as opposed to getting ready together and having time to relax in between. She eventually became pretty demanding about how her make-up and hair was done. She would sit at my makeup counter helping herself to all of my expensive products. I tried to offer to help teach her to do it herself, but was usually met with resistance as she just ""couldn't do it"" without ever trying or letting me teach her. I would offer to help her pick up some of her own products, but didn't feel like it was worth spending the money on. However, she would continue to use my products whenever we went out together. I explained that this was stressful, and it felt like work but nothing was ever done about it. I don't know if this is the best example as it seems pretty petty, but it was just one of many time I felt like there was some double standards set in our friendship. 

So, about a year ago I encouraged my friend to make a move for her career. She was miserable in the university city we both lived in, and was having trouble finding a job that used her skills. I sent her job postings from all over including my current city which had lots of the kind of jobs she was looking for. She had never lived more than 1 hour from where she grew up so this was a big change for her. So, she ended up taking a job in a small city about 45 mins from the city I am living in at the time. While I was supportive, and encouraging for her to make a decision for her well-being and career - I was concerned the small city she was moving too might be a little dull and isolated compared to her previous living situation. She was moving completely alone - No boyfriend.  No friends. I would literally be the only person she would know within a 300 km radius. I expressed my concern that it would be hard to meet people in such a small city and I was constantly met with resistance. Eventually, I stepped back and I allowed her to do her own thing. Again, long story short -  she didn't really meet any friends in the area, and completely isolated herself in the small city. I was busy between full-time university studies, and my career so it was difficult to be around a lot to hang out and keep her company which she was aware/understanding of. When we did get together, we would usually meet at my place as I was located very close to  a large downtown core with things to do - restaurants, bars, baseball games, etc. She had expressed to me a couple times she was upset with how things were going - her career didn't pay very well, she was chronically single, and she had felt like she lost a lot of friends over time. I was in the completely same boat, but I felt like she didn't see it that way. During the times we went out together in my city she met a girl which became one of her close friends, and another time she met a guy which has turned out to be her now fiancé. 

Her and her fiancé met at a bar one night when we were out together. He was from out of the country with a couple of his friends. They hit it off instantly, and I played wing-man of the year to his two friends whom neither I was interested in.  After that night they exchanged numbers, but she never thought much of it as he was from the US while we live in Canada. Long story short, they kept in touch and started dating long distance. About 2-3 months after they made things official I had a feeling that things were escalating quickly. When I asked, they were talking about getting married. Initially, I met with a lot of resistance as this was moving very quickly. She complained I was not being supportive, but I was simply trying to offer a small voice of reason before making a very big life decision as ultimately this would mean she would be moving to the US. I said my piece, and I swallowed my tongue about the situation and tried to be supportive. I ultimately was happy if she was happy, and excited to eventually start planning for an engagement party, bachelorette, wedding, etc. The relationship continued to escalate, and I was started to feel left out in some ways. She would often prioritize seeing him most weekends of the month, and holidays that we would spend together now for them. The most hurtful was new years as we had spent most NYE's together - now she had plans with him, and while I would be happy to join she made it seem like it would be too much effort/trouble to try to as it was out of the country. I was going through a difficult time as she knew that NYE was a difficult time for me, and I had just broken things off with someone I was seeing at the time. I ended up working on NYE as most people do in my line of work - eventually this was the norm. However, I respected my challenging schedule and the fact there was some new special someone in her life now. 

After about 8 months of dating, they became engaged - and the plan was to move to the US together. I was supportive, but a little hesitant as such a big life change in a short period of time. I was excited to help plan all of the wedding things especially as I assumed I would be heavily involved as being likely in the bridal party. The wedding would need to be pushed forward as she wanted to gain permanent status in the US which required they would be married within three months when she arrived to the states. Initially, they had planned on having a small courthouse wedding to deal with living/permanent residence status situation - but her family was upset not to be a part of the wedding. So, she said they were going to have a small wedding in a restaurant. Naturally, as her best friend I assumed I would be included in a small bridal party but she then told me that she was not going to have any friends at the wedding. Obviously, as evidenced by this this post, I was really hurt by this information. She then went to discuss the venue, and the plans which I thought was definitely able to accommodate for a few friends. I found it hard to be engaged with wedding planning, and such as I was just so upset by the news. Later on, my friend had brought up the idea of planning a bachelorette party which she looked to me to which I kind of put my foot down - and expressed how I felt. I said I didn't really feel like I should be the one planning a bachelorette for a wedding I am not invited to. This brought up a needed conversation about how I felt not being invited to the wedding - I expressed how much it hurt me, and how I wanted to be a part of her big day even if there was no bridal party, etc. She explained that apparently her fiancé has ""too many"" best friends and the wedding size would get out of control. I asked if maybe you could limit each other to a couple friends which she seemed to take into consideration at the time. Months later, their relationship continued to progress as she planned to make the big move, and no changes were made to the guest list. When visiting, I spoke with one of her fiance's best friends who was around on the night we all met who was also hurt by not being invited to the wedding. He felt similarly to me that we were involved the night they met, and it was just plain hurtful not to be included in their wedding. Later, she told me that they were not planning on having bachelorette/bachelor parties which I was upset about as I didn't think it was her idea. Her fiancé never really liked when she would go out with her friends (i.e. ME) drinking so I figured it was more to avoid all that stuff. 

So, a few months ago my friend moved to the US. She quit her job, and left everything behind. So, I had arranged to visit her, but was offered a free trip to a tropical island to visit my other friend at the time. It was the only time I could get off work, and I figured she would understand. Based on the above, it was the first time I ever prioritized doing something else over seeing her. However, she was obviously butt hurt by the situation. Ultimately, she was supportive but I was a little put off by the whole thing. I knew she was lonely in her new city, as she couldn't work and didn't know anyone outside of her fiancé's friends and family but THIS WAS HER CHOICE. I was frustrated as I was simply doing the same thing she had been doing for months to me. She did invite me to be her witness at the informal court house wedding but it honestly felt like an attempt to pacify me. 

So, now that I have provided some context I have started to notice I am intentionally distancing myself from her... I have been focused on my new job, and I just haven't been putting any effort into arranging to meet up/keep in touch. I started to get upset seeing engagement posts, wedding countdown, etc. knowing I have 0 involvement in her big day. Her sister, and her fiancé's family has invited me to a few small events around the wedding but I don't feel like putting forth the effort, and involving myself into something I'm not actually involved in...? I know I would just be upset. She would send me snaps about the wedding planning, and etc. but I just don't want to talk about the wedding, and I don't know how else to tell her... So, I've just been avoiding contact as I know she is going to talk about it. I genuinely don't want to make this about me, but it just feels like the straw that has broken the camel's back...? I feel like my companionship has been replaced, and I feel like an insignificant part of her life. Is this fair? Should I be honest, and tell her how I feel? I feel like I would just ruin her big day if I started now as it is only less than a month away. I know she is struggling with adjusting to her new life especially without friends or family - but I don't know how to be a supportive/good friend without feeling like I'm setting myself on fire to keep her warm. I've always been generous, and a bit self depleting but I feel like I'm setting a boundary. Any advice? Any suggestions? Help.",08Oct2019,1

611,"I have a slightly unique living situation where my husband and I sleep in the second floor and my father in law lives on the first floor. Their job pays the rent of this house. Mother in law lives in another state because this job was too good for him to pass up. 

We got a puppy back in June. My husband is the one that chose him. He gets into the trash sometimes and chewed up father in law's sandals once, but he hasn't been too, too much of a nuisance to him. Our dog occasionally goes on barking sprees in the backyard, so he is annoying sometimes for sure. 

Father in law mentioned he wanted to get a puppy to be a companion to our dog and tire him out, and I was vocal and said I didn't like the idea but he still got one about 1.5 months ago. 

He poops and pees basically everyday in the living room and hallway. I'm a stay at home house wife 7 months pregnant and I've put my foot down and have recently been leaving the poop and pee on the floor for them to clean. I told my husband I didn't want another dog. 

Father in law over the summer has occasionally  brought me little ""gifts"" like watermelon, avocado, a fly trap which I haven't wanted to accept, but I have, because I feel that they allow him to ""pay"" for the inconvenience of poop and pee in our house. But he uses our paper towels and detergent and I am the one that handles the dishes, so I suppose we're about even. 

Mother in law threw me a baby shower and they bought at least $300 in gifts for the baby. 

This morning, his dog pooped in about four different areas.....

Please, I would love to hear advice on what I should do. My husband doesn't want to tell him to give his dog back. I'm tired of living in a house that smells like poop and pee, and worrying about trace amounts of feces being tracked around the house by the dogs.

612,"I’m using an old throwaway of mine but he frequents this sub so I might be getting myself into something here, but I’m at such a loss and I don’t want to talk to anyone in my life about this. 

The title kind of gives it away but here’s where I’m at.

We’ve been together for almost a year now and this happened right at the beginning of our relationship, at about a month in. He used to have this friend who had a FWB relationship with, who hit him up because she was coming back to the city and wanted to know if he would be down to fuck. She’d done this when we were first just starting to get to know each other and he declined, saying that he didn’t want to ruin anything with me. 

This time however, he in turn said that he couldn’t, but would ask me to bring her into the relationship. She said that she would be okay with it, and then he brought it to me. 

I’m just stuck on the fact that he asked her first. He offered it to her first. 

When he first brought it to me then I was so deeply hurt. I couldn’t believe that he’d done that. It was such a huge betrayal of trust for me, and I felt so broken. We’d only been together for a month and it felt like he was already bored of me. I’ve never felt so insecure. 

Fast forward to last night, and I start talking about my insecurity with the ideas of threesomes because of this previous issue... and we find out a heck of a lot more. 

She’s messaged him asking to see him since then, and he hasn’t told me. He showed me a conversation that they’d had earlier this summer and when I asked who she was he said she was “just a friend”. (He admitted to not wanting to tell me who she was because he was worried it would make me uncomfortable). And in August she said she was coming back to our city in the fall and wanted to see him and he said “okay, let me know.” (Still kept me in the dark about all of this). She’s also sent him pictures of her in a bikini with her head cropped out, literally just the bikini photo. I thought nothing of it when it first happened, but now that I’m putting it all together it makes me insanely uncomfortable. 

He says he’s made boundaries but from my end it doesn’t feel that way. I understand that they were friends before the FWB and they stayed friends afterwards, but just the sole fact that he offered to bring her into our relationship without consulting me first... is a huge thing for me. And he wants me to be comfortable with seeing her but in my eyes that’s gone now just because of what happened. 

I feel so disgusted with myself. I feel like a complete and utter joke. After it happened, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what this woman had that I didn’t that he clearly needed. I felt like I wasn’t good enough for him, and like I wasn’t enough for him in general. 

Reddit, how do I move forward in this? How do I work through this for myself? I want to regain that insecurity and self-respect but I’m not sure what steps to take right now, and I don’t know where to start. I’d been working through it for some time now but we’re back to square one and I’m at a loss of where to go from here. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting either... and I don’t know how to talk to him about this. I don’t want to keep bringing up the issue but at the same time I have this overwhelming need to talk about it with him. 

TLDR: Boyfriend invited old FWB into our relationship without talking to me first, and has since continued speaking with her even after mentioning that he doesn’t like who she has become as a person but feels the need to see her when she comes back to visit, alone, and expects me to be comfortable with it.",08Oct2019,1
613,"I (19m) live in the US. For five years I've had a long distance boyfriend (20m) in Norway who I've never met in real life. My family is very conservative, not even particularly religious or anything, but my dad has expressed his strong hatred for gay people on numerous occasions.

I'm trying to figure out if there's any way of visiting my boyfriend without my family finding out. My current plan would be to tell them I'm going on a camping trip with friends for a week (I have a couple people who would cover for me). Money isn't the issue so much, I don't have my own bank account but I have a couple thousand saved up in cash hidden in places where my family can't get it.

The issue is how could I even get there? I probably can't buy a plane ticket with cash, that sounds like something a terrorist would do to avoid leaving a paper trail. A boat is too expensive and takes way too long. Buses obviously don't go over water. It feels so frustrating to have the money for something but not be able to get it.

614,"First off thank you for the advice and I’ll try to keep it as short as possible ...

So I’m a software engineer at a reputable enterprise sized company when I was hired it was just me and another guy. I exaggerated on my resume and they thought they were getting a hotshot but at best I was mediocre and had some stumbling on my first 2 months on a project. 

Now I’m a beast I just needed daily practice and I can code like a motherfucker now whatever they throw at me i get it done. So I’ve been here almost a year and they brought in another software engineer and he’s doing great right off the back he’s a great guy and I wish him the best in everything. The problem is the coworker and boss I’ve been working with don’t show signs of being distant we still go to lunch and are inappropriate and shit we’re all dudes but I’ve noticed they started giving the new guy more work than me and sometimes when I’m not there they’ll invite him to an important meeting but not me. I am not a quiet guy I speak often and this new guy is quiet and analytical so maybe that’s why? They don’t want me interfering in affairs above me? I dunno. 

I doubt I’m getting fired but I have no idea what to do, my inside temper is raging but all I can do is sit here and smile pretend it’s all good. 

Internally this is motivation to start my own business to freelance again like I did in the past and break free of corporate America but that’s going to take a little time. 

What should I do? Should I sit here and just pretend everything is ok and on my free time pursue my own aspirations and even seek other opportunities? Or should I confront someone. I’m cool with these guys they’re cool with me but I can’t shake the feeling that they think I’m an idiot compared to the new guy.

Please feel free to ask me anything about this situation to get a better understanding .... thanks guy",08Oct2019,1

617,"This may seem very unimportant but lately this has been on my mind. I really really like a guy and I have so for almost a year. A while back he told me he liked me which made me happy but I was too shocked to think straight... and after a couple weeks I basically told him it’s better to stay as friends (he agreed and was very chill about it) 

The reason why I made that decision was because it got way too awkward with me knowing and I just go sooo excited that I told myself to “play it cool” and “shut up” basically ignoring him (my fault 100%)

Then I soon realised my mistake and told him I liked him and It was a misunderstanding... he said he needed time to think and got back to me 2 weeks later telling me that I was just a “phase” I just nodded my head and walked away.

Anyways it’s only been around 2 months and he has already moved on to two other girls and tried his shot with them. I know I definitely ruined my chance but it kinda hurts.. because I know I made a big mistake by being a giant cock and ignoring him. 

Every time we hang out it hurts kinda... he talks about new girls... he is a very nice guy and I know he doesn’t mean to hurt me (I don’t even think he acknowledges it hurts me) but I just can’t stop thinking about him.

618,"Hi there. Thanks for taking the time to read my post.

For context: I am 26 and Female.

I spent the last 2 years of my life in AmeriCorps. I worked in a rural community doing historic preservation, and just recently I was working with a community college to help veterans by creating a peer mentoring program. Prior to that, I was in Peace Corps in West Africa. 

For the past few years, I've been working my tail off in AmeriCorps, sticking out really bad situations, doing side retail jobs, and just generally having to be extremely creative just to survive. It finally happened to me about a month ago that I got hired for my first salaried position with the state.

I just started a few weeks ago and am deeply unfulfilled. I can feel myself becoming depressed. My position consists of basic data entry and responding to basic student inquiries. Everything is virtual, so I come into the office every day to maybe respond to around 30 e-mails, surf Reddit, check my phone, and then go home. 

I feel like I worked so hard, and I'm having a hard time saying to myself, ""This is it. This is what I wanted all along."" When I was in AmeriCorps and when I was finishing up my Bachelor's, I was just so concerned about surviving and couldn't wait for the day that I had ANY job with benefits and that offered a livable wage. 

My average income from AmeriCorps was 11k a year, and now that I'm making 40k a year, I feel like I can take care of myself -- but is life even worth it?

My immediate supervisor is about to retire after working here for 20 years. Everyone I work with is 35+ and I feel they stick with this position because they get ""OK"" retirement benefits. But when my supervisor said to me that she is pleased to have a career ""making her boss look good"", I just immediately started to feel so hopeless. I feel like I'm wasting my talent.

I really want something more out of life, but I know that living in poverty is not good for me, either. I feel I'm in between a rock and a hard place. 

Is there anything I could be doing to make this situation better? I use to look forward to the future, but right now all I feel is dread in front of me.",08Oct2019,1

I don’t have a car yet, so I get dropped off/picked up, we both live in the country just outside of where the bus routes are. Coming from personal experience of being in a psychiatric hospital, the kids have extreme behavioral issues. I talked to my grandma (an ER nurse) about some things that were bothering me about the children and their parents, one thing that came up about the kids is that the girl is very physically aggressive towards everyone but especially her brother. I told my grandma how it gives me anxiety that the little girl will do things like try to claw her brothers eye out or slam his head against something and every time I have barely made her stop to where he isn’t injured. Everyday he has bruises from her hitting, pinching, etc and I have either texted/called or talked to the parents about it in person each time. What my grandma brought up is if/when I have to call 911, will the parents stand by me or try to put it on me... I thought I made it clear that I didn’t want to be responsible for either of them getting hurt when they aren’t following any rules let alone safety. I do my best like we don’t go on walks because in the past she’s pushed her brother in the road. Basically what the mom said is she will take her toys if it continues... I have been watching videos to help me personally and having teaching lessons with their great grandma every Wednesday because she’s teacher, but she struggles with them and leaves after she spanks them every time.. I do not use any physical force as punishment because it’s not my place and they don’t listen to me anyway lol. Nothing has changed with the kids, but I am able to deal with my emotions better, which is great just not my main concern at this point. There’s plenty of more issues I could go on and on but I don’t know if I should continue at this point.. The kids have their sweet moments but I see there’s a lot of manipulation, lying and other things that make me so uncomfortable especially when I see it happening with the family members at home.

That's pretty much it honestly. I've been wanting to start music production for about a year now and CONSTANTLY approach it on/off, like everything else in my life.

I've read countless articles on ""starting small"" and working your way up in life, but when ever I think of finally doing something, my 160 steam games just start laughing.

625,"We live in a newer apartment with three floors, we live on the second floor. We share one bedroom wall with a neighbor, only about 3 feet of the wall. Then it’s a hallway and storage units, and our top and bottom neighbors. We moved in April first and every single night from about 8 pm- 4am we hear insanely loud bangs, like someone dropping bowling balls above us. 

When we moved in I asked repeatedly if we would hear the neighbors(I understand there is always noise, I meant to an extreme or late at night). They said they never had a noise complaint from my apartment. I had asked for a top floor apartment, and was told they didn’t have any. 

Anyway, I’ve reported the noise multiple times. Both with management and security. I’m not 100% which apartment it’s coming from but I assume it’s above us. Since I can hear it throughout the entire apartment, but mainly in our bedroom. It does sound like someone dropping weights, stomping across the apartment, and a big dog running around. When we first complained management said they had a big dog and said they told them to keep it quiet at night. But the noise never really stopped, so we kept calling/emailing. After a couple times they started being really rude and just annoyed. I asked them how I could prove it. According to management if they can’t hear the noise from the hallway outside their front door, they don’t consider it loud. They also said security can’t come into my apartment to hear the noise, and recordings I’ve made can’t be believed. 

I pay $2,000 a month for a one bedroom, I shouldn’t be kept up or woken up multiple times a night. We noticed that when we first would complain, the noise stops for a couple days. Now I think management just stopped caring and is ignoring us. 

I really want to move, because I’m 7.5 months pregnant and have a hard enough time sleeping. 
Plus I don’t want my newborn being woken up constantly. But our contract says we would have to pay the remaining months, upfront. While that’s possible for us, I’m also wanting to buy a house when we leave here and that would eat into our down payment. 

I don’t even want to break the lease, I just want to sleep. How can I just get them to stop making noise, so I can sleep. I’ve literally missed work because they kept me up till 4am and I have to be to work at 6am. How do I convince my landlord this is a real thing?",08Oct2019,4

627,"TLDR: I feel bad at work occasionally because I there are somethings that our business does that can sort of rip people off. How do I deal with this emotion that I more recently noticed? I don't want to work here forever but I do NEED this job for the time being to gain experience and build my resume. Does it make me a bad person?

&amp;#x200B;

LONG STORY: I work for a medium sized business as a Marketing Director. I run traditional and non-traditional marketing campaigns and strategies. I do not do sales and don't talk with customers. And I have been doing incredibly well. I have almost tripled monthly lead amounts, closing rates, and we kill competition every month.

As always in marketing I ALWAYS make sure to find the good things that our business does. And don't get me wrong, our business has done ALOT of great things. BUT there are sometimes when customers overpay for things that they might not need but are required for our business to operate. At first, i kinda discounted some of the criticism but it has grown and grown on me. Some people come to us because they have no choice and they are basically forced to pay 2x on something that they need. And half the people that come to us don't even know they are getting ripped off and they are so happy.

I feel a pit in my stomach and if I didn't need the job I would quit. But it pays incredibly INCREDIBLY well and I am beyond lucky to have landed this position and I want it on my resume. How do I deal with these emotions without compromising my own ethics and ability to preform.

If I compromise my ethics i'll feel like shit, but be able to continue onto better things.

But if I Compromise my ability to continue performing my job I'll lose my ability to grow into a career.

It feels caught between a rock and a hard place. And im basically thinking of just sticking it out and feeling like shit 200% of the time.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",08Oct2019,1

So my best friend has had bad eating habits for years, and this year it's gotten particularly bad, to the point where she can't eat without immediately feeling sick. She barely eats anything at all (some bread or a slice of pizza per day, or equivalent amounts of candy or other small foods), and has constant stress from going to school. She also passes out or falls asleep all the time and when she does go to sleep normally, it's at usually 3AM, and she wakes up at 6. She is also particularly picky about what she eats, and barely eats anything healthy as a result. 

It's now the second time I've talked to her about this seriously, and she still thinks she can handle this on her own, without getting anyone close to her involved. She refuses to talk to her dad (who she doesn't have a bad relationship with, kind of the opposite. She just doesn't want to worry him), and she says she's thinking about dropping in for counseling sessions at her school. 

The problem is, I live in a completely different country, and I can't do anything from here. I also wouldn't wanna tell her dad because I don't wanna intrude on her privacy.

I am a 24 y/o living with my ever supportive girlfriend (same age). I love her so much and I am 100% certain of what our future would be. But here's my problem: My dream is to LIVE and work in JAPAN but I am not financially capable of starting over there. I have a non-stable job currently meaning I can lose this job anytime. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until recently, an opportunity opened up for me - I was selected to become a full-time scholar to learn the language PLUS a high-paying, steady job IN JAPAN after I graduate. Unfortunately, my girlfriend already wants to have kids. She says she's ok with it but here's the catch: She wants to have kids while she's young (specifically age 25). I mean, I would love to have kids with her except that I am working full-time at night with this unsecure job and study full-time in the morning. I am worried I might not have enough time to help her go through the maternity (i.e. check-ups, etc). I suggested we do it after 3 years since they mentioned I can BRING my family there as soon as I pass my professional exam (can take it on the 3rd-5th year of the contract). She became very upset since she doesn't want to start having kids at the age of 28. She said that I should follow my dreams but I know how upset she is with how this might go. I don't want to lose her because of this, and I also don't want to lose the opportunity to follow my dreams.

636,"It's really depressing how I will never get to move up in society in terms of getting better education for GCSE and a-level because of money problems. 

Capitalism is great, but I think that the past 3 (or 8, counting my old school) years have been wasted at the school that I go to.
It's like owning a Lamborghini and only ever using it to go to Asda, if that makes sense. I feel as though I could do much more in school and stuff, but my time's been wasted in subjects such as computing and science where we're repeatedly learning the same things. And I'm not saying that in terms of revision. 

I have applied to the local grammar school to hopefully get a move, but I sincerely doubt that I will, as I will need to get two 'scholarships' out of 600 people each, and the students that already go to the school will be considered more. Plus, even if I do get these, I will still have to cough up £6,000 annually, which is why it's not really a scholarship. I really don't think I'll be able to succeed at my current school, or learn as much as I am capable of learning. Is there any way I could 'cheat the system' so to speak or find any way around this?

By the way, I have started doing online courses and stuff in python so that I could do coding if I need to, but the school isn't helping me that at all.

637,"Hi guys,

So earlier on this year I kicked the booze and have got myself into a relatively stable frame of mind. I'm trying to find work. The first avenue is to go back into bartending and managing, but I've also been offered a gig doing some labour work for an electrician.

The bar job would be great because I'm comfortable in that environment and know what I'm doing. It'd be like mentally coming home. Before bringing up my previous booze problem, know that it was due to a serious relationship that I fucked up that caused me to drink, it wasn't the booze or bar management lifestyle in itself. I just had access to it. 

The labour avenue would be hard but I'm 28 now and would love to learn new skills and be in a new environment, it'd be like mentally travelling.

I only plan to do this for a year or so before I can save enough money and go and pursue paths I'm more interested in.

When I was a kid, I thought that I'm an idiot and just not supposed to be successful (ADHD, Tourette, OCD and overall poor performance in school).

Because of that I never tried much in school and ended up in some poor Gastronomy High School because it was the only school that would accept me with my grades.

I continued doing nothing until I became more self aware and realized that the path I'm walking on will get me nowhere. From that point I've started taking things more seriously and believe it or not I've managed to go from D's and F's to straight A's.

**Since that moment I wanted to fix things and do something with myself. I thought that going to college (informatics) would be a great start since I know a (very little) bit about it, it's not far away, I would certainly get a good job with it and colleges are free in my country.

But the problem is that years of doing nothing and ending up in High School that didn't focus on Math and Physics that much, left me completely unprepared for such thing as college.

645,"For a few years, I've been feeling really off, and I thought it was environmental - I'd been in the same city all my life, I felt stuck, I had no motivation, and I thought that if I just changed things up and moved to California like I'd always dreamed of doing, things would fix themselves. So, earlier this summer, I sold everything I couldn't fit in my car and I drove to there to start a new life. I started working as an Uber driver and trying to figure out what exactly to do next. It didn't take long for me to figure out that my problems had nothing to do with where I was, and that in fact it was severe, crippling depression. That realization has sent me into a downward spiral. There are days at a time I can't get out of bed. I don't have the resources to get help right now, and the free services you can access as a low income person are only getting me so far. I've blown through the savings I pulled together to buy me time out here and I'm about two weeks away from living out of my car. My anxiety is through the roof, which is causing some other health issues like my IBS to flare up, which is JUST what you want when you're a rideshare driver. I can't find the motivation or interest to apply for any jobs, cause nothing excites me anymore. I'm stuck in this downward spiral and I'm afraid that my depression is ramping up to the point of being life threatening.

I know that the best thing to do would be to pack it up and go back east to my family, where I can live for free for a while and get the help I need. But I'm paralyzed by the shame of it all. The idea that just a few months after everyone gathered to send me off, to wish me well, to cheer me on as I tried this new adventure that I'd come crawling back, broken and even further behind than when I left. It's like...I'd almost rather be homeless and helpless here than have to see everyone from my old life again, run into people around town, have to tell everyone one by one by one what's going on with me. Your mental health struggles should be able to be kept within an intimate circle of trusted people, but if I were to go back home, I'd have literally hundreds of people wanting an explanation.

Have been on medications for the same in the past, but due to unusual side effects, I had to stop taking them, not that 6 months of them made me feel any better. Anyway, about a month ago I started seeking help from this therapist who calls himself a life coach/mentor/guide/therapist/healer. He has a under graduate degree in medicine and a degree in psychology. I've had about 5 sessions with him, all of which lasted more than an intended (standard time is 1 hour. Mine have taken as much as 2 hours 15 mins sometimes). The first three sessions went well considering how much anxiety the first session caused me, which I told him about, to which he didn't say much. Having said that, I was a lot calmer than before after those three. 
However, today I suffered a major panic attack in a public space with no one to turn around to. I texted him that to which he had an unusual response.. something on the lines of 'show your panic attack a middle finger'. In the past two weeks he's disregarded and hinted that I was 'labelling' myself as depressed.

654,"Hi all,  


I'm currently in a situation where I can't decide on what to do. Will give context first to make the situation more understandable - skip or read the TLDR if it's too long. 

**Context**  
In march 2018 the mother of my child, and now ex-partner, fell in love with a different man. Multiple months later, this ended our relationship after going into relation therapy and attempting to fix what was broken. I have a 4 y/o daughter who we now succesfully co-parent (50/50 time &amp; housing split + shared costs. No alimony). We are on good terms, can communicate well with each other and know each other well enough to understand when we need alone-time. The different man turned into a short relationship which has since then ended again. My ex-partner currently has no partner. Me neither and have no interest in getting back together.   


In may of this year, my ex-partner has left my house after i've acquired her part. As a temporary solution, she would live with her mother, look for a job (I was the only one working &amp; she procrastinated jobsearching after breaking up), to be eligible to get her own appartment after.  Then life happened.  


Shortly after moving into her mothers place, her mother was diagnosed with heart issues which would result into necessary surgery. Surgery happened and all went well, but the recovery didn't. After a week of recovery her heart eventually failed. She passed away three weeks ago.   


**TL;DR -** Ex-partner left me due to other man, moved out months l

**Current situation**

Due to what happened above, my ex-partner is now forced to move out of where she lives (with my child) within the next 2 weeks. She is not eligible to ""take over"" the house renting contract due to not officially being a renter before her mother passed away. The renting company doesn't budge. She currently has no job (but doing lots of applications + average of 2 job interviews a week at the moment), which means she has no way to rent an appartment (even tho she has 50k+ in her bank account due to me acquiring her part of our former house).   


My gut feeling tells me to offer her a temporary room in my house under strict conditions and a deadline to move out. This currently feels like the best choice I have as that way the situation will have the least impact on my child, while simultaniously giving my ex-partner some breathing room to think straight in a dire situation.   


My gut feeling however also tells me that this will be an energy drain for me, as I'll force myself in a non-optimal living environment.

Now I’m getting further into a “real” career and, for money and title reasons, I have been contemplating getting a master’s degree. 

I have absolutely zero interest in higher education whatsoever, but I’m naturally good at school in general and would only be getting it for the credential to put on my resume. I don’t even know what subject I’d pursue, and I keep being told that since I already have actual work experience under my belt, the subject and school don’t matter as much. It’s also worth adding here that I do not have any ideas whatsoever as to what direction I may want to take my career (stay on this track? Change? Eh, who knows.)

I’m currently a grant writer, researcher, and marketing coordinator(ish) for a college. Employee perks would allow me to pursue a higher degree here for $0, which is something not to be overlooked especially in the USA. However... there are ZERO requirements to get into this college. The ONLY requirement for any students are that they already earned the degree a step below the one for which they are currently applying. No GMAT/GRE/etc., no GPA reqs, nada. 

Considering I have no real interest in school anyway, one part of me is saying that a higher education I don’t have to work to get in for, that would cost $0, is a golden opportunity that has fallen into my lap from the heavens above. And another part of me, and this is where I’m torn, doesn’t really want to have my degree be from an institution as “unimpressive” (I’m sorry that sounds awful) as this one. 

I feel so guilty for even feeling this way, and I also feel dumb for entertaining the idea of killing myself to study for an admissions test and pay money to go to another school, considering how I feel about school overall. My reasoning is that aside from reputation, and even though I dislike academics, I don’t really want my degree from somewhere where I feel like I didn’t have to do all that much work for it. I’d like to feel some sense of pride like I climbed a mountain for it, even though mountain climbing for degrees disgusts and exhausts me. It’s a weird combo of feelings to reconcile. I also hate to be snobby yet that’s how half of me is feeling.

I am looking for advice here - should I just get a higher degree from where I work, or should I go with my gut and suck it up/study/pay for a different school? I do believe lots of people when they say that considering I have actual work experience the school doesn’t matter so much, and furthermore, almost no one would bother to look up the school if they don’t know it and they’d only see that I do have the degree at all.

660," Prolog: Recently, I had joined and had been talking to a discord group with some youngers users (15-16yrs old). I myself recently just turned 19, it had seemed that I was one of the oldest ones there (in the discord I mean). Still, I was able to interact with them and had started to become a real member of their community. Over the past few weeks, since I have been there, I had seen a big divide in the members of the group. On one side, there were members who were their just to enjoy themselves and have fun with the community, however, on the other side there were members who were a bit more on the meaner side. I myself was on the former side of things, as I just wanted to enjoy myself, talk to someone and play some games. However, due to my age and my positive personality, it had seemed that some of the members had come to consider me as someone that they could discuss their issues with. This type of thing I was fine with, however, I had recently stumbled upon a problem that I am currently unable to resolve. Only being 19 and with many years ahead of me, I had known that my knowledge was lacking and wisdom not yet has grown and so I had turned to you guys for some help.

The issue: So while discussing with one of the members (Female), she had told that she was currently being harassed online by one of the other members (Male). It had seemed that the one harassing her had found interest in her and had been giving her inappropriate names, and sending her unwanted messages (I don't believe at this current moment that any of them are pictures of his genitals). I found this highly inappropriate and was going to message him, to resolve this issue. However, before I could, another member (also Female), had messaged me saying that she wanted to talk with me. Deciding that talking with her at the current moment was more important I messaged her back saying that I could talk. She had then proceeded to tell me that she had a teenage crush on said harasser (the dude that was harassing one of the other members). At which I internally panicked. I had then asked her why she was interested in him and she replied that she had recently moved schools, and had made very few friends, one of which was the dude. She had told me that was lonely and that she had just wanted someone to hold and talk to, which I myself completely understand as I had suffered depression from being alone throughout my younger teenage years. She had said that she had liked his voice and found him interesting, but now I don't know what to do to solve this situation.

tldr; a female member of my discord group is being (sexually) harassed by a male member. However one of the other female members has a teenage crush on the said male member. What do I do?

Edit: I forgot to mention that the Female member that was struggling with being alone does not currently know that the Male member is sexually harassing someone.",08Oct2019,1
662," Next year im going to have to choose between 2 colleges and im really nervous about making the right choice , soo im here to ask for some advice .

First of all my grades are good (and qualify me to enter both) and it's the same major in both colleges , the only difference between the two is distance .

- the first collage is right beside my house : 15 minutes walking , 5 minutes by bus 

- the second is in another city and if i want to go there i can either rent a dorm room or go by train (1 hour ride)

Now some of you might think that the choice is easy , save money and go to the first one , and i would but i don't live in a good home , it's not abusive &amp; i love my parents , but we have our problems  (not stable) . I don't think this will be great for me in the long run because i plan on learning a hard major and i think i might already have psychological problems, i don't want them to worsen . But im not sure my parents will aprove of me living in a dorm on my own they are kinda protective (they are considerably progressive but we live in a bit of a sexist society soo they worry for my safety) also im not sure if they'd help me pay for it .

Sorry for the long rant but i thought maybe someone on here might help .",08Oct2019,3
663,"Last week my job was threatened by my two supervisors because of my attention to detail. The problem I had with this was that I was not making most of these mistakes, but I was being given the blame for all of them.

To give you an example of how severe the problem was, I service provider we use in China misread an email and I was blamed for ""making a typo"", then when I showed there was no typo I was blamed for ""not asking if he understood my email sometime later"".

Because I was concerned about these accusations, I kept a log of everything that I did and kept a file of evidence clearing my name. In response to this meeting I sent the document to HR to request a meeting to clear my name and stating that I am unable to work effectively because I am forced to spend half of my day defending myself against mistakes- sometimes in projects, I wasn't even aware existed, much less had any involvement in. Included my evidence and conversation logs as a supplement.

HR thanked me for the message, told me I was free to come by the next day and that she would schedule a meeting with my supervisors when they are back in the office on Monday. I told her that I appreciated the offer, but that I think we can just wait until Monday unless there is anything she would like to discuss. When Monday came around, I was let go immediately upon arrival. My boss cited her tipping point as being that ""I reached out to HR on company time and that something like that should have been on the weekend or after work"".

Here is where it gets weird:

1. They told me many of my concerned were valid but kept reiterating it wasn't a good fit
2. They offered me a generous severance package that includes months of pay when the company has no policy on this
3. I actually did send the message that evening ""on my own time"". Actually I sent it around 6:30p

One of the items that I found involved an investor report for a fund that we manage and an accusation that I was using bad numbers and making careless mistakes. The reality was that I had fixed the numbers and discovered that my supervisor was using the wrong figures and that the firm had been sending out inaccurate figures for the past several quarters with inconsistent figures- some net, some gross, some unadjusted for income, etc. A piece of me wonders if they let me go immediately because I had this evidence that they were screwing up and just offered me such a good severance +a good referral to make me go away...

TLDR- I was told the reason I was let go was cultural fit, and going to HR during work. I didn't go to HR during work hours and I wonder if its because I had a paper trail of mistakes the firm was making.",08Oct2019,1

666,"    I was on my way home (from boxing, by bicycle and I was exhausted) about to turn at a T-junction. I was riding on the road, both sides were empty for an immediate distance of 50-60m in all directions. Upon beginning to turn I spot this car moving quite fast, since I was already turning I continue to do so and in about 2-ish seconds, the car is also turning and I notice this just in time not to crash into it. The driver is PISSED, while I'm still in shock of almost being run over by someone clearly speeding (he didn't slow down at the turn) and proceeded to aggressively cuss at me and commanded me to get off the bicycle.
    I, still in shock just rolled onwards, staring at the car that began to slow down, ride behind me only an inch away from my back tire and then come up on my right side (we drive on the left side here so it felt like he was going to overtake me); he proceeded to force me off the road and onto the pavement. This was the neck of the T-junction, late at night and  I was trapped there with almost no people nearby (let alone people who saw what was going on) there was no way I could go back because he would run me over, forwards he would chase me and I couldn't go left or right anywhere. So I slowed down and got off. (Probably my first mistake) Then I froze in place as I realised that there were two guys in the car, both were larger and taller than me and their voices were REALLY intimidating. (Then again I was already feeling pretty fucking intimidated by their fucking car)
    The driver got out, he seemed just over 6 feet, got in my face, I tried to make myself heard by asking why he was doing this and what I had done wrong (at this point my hands were up to hopefully show I wasn't a threat, let alone trying to challenge him). The driver wasn't listening, proceeded to shout so loudly the next neighborhood would probably hear and smacked me in the face. The other guy began getting out and that's when my feet began to tremble due to all the adrenaline I was feeling. So I did the most logical thing that first came to mind by getting back on my bicycle and peddling at full gear till I could turn into a paved path that weaved through different streets so it would be hard for them to catch me in the car.
    Defending myself was out of the questions since I was clearly outsized, unready, outnumbered and exhausted. I managed to escape with only a painful smack, but I think I got very lucky. 

How do I avoid this thing from happening again and what do I do about the men who assaulted me?
(They may have been drunk, high or even just have really bad anger issues)

Do I report their license plate, check camera footage of nearby buildings?

A friend of mine says no since it's possible they were part of the local Mafia. Unlikely, but now I just feel more terrified. (My poor mama though is almost having a panic attack) 
Please HELP!

If anybody needs to know I'm a  relatively fit teenager and just under 6 feet. I can punch alright, maybe even kick to an effective degree, but my core is quite pathetic.

The crazy guys were around 20-ish and quite fit.

673,"Using a throwaway to maintain anonymity of everyone. I don't really have a source for advice and these sort of things so I'm turning here to vent.

To preface this potentially lengthy post, I'm 20(M) and have been dating my girlfriend, 20(F) for nearly 4 years. I've been happy with her and we have a future planned. I've had a good relationship with her family, aside from some toxic people in it (namely her father and older sister, but they're largely disliked by everyone else). There are 6 people living in her home altogether; I'm not one of them but I'm at the house 7 days a week for varying amounts of time. They often say that I basically live there.

Their family is also pretty impoverished. Their only steady income is the father's paycheck, which is less than $1500 a week and he constantly wastes it. He neglects bills, rent, and has nearly gotten them evicted from their rental home several times. Utilities have temporarily been shut off before as well. The mother is physically disabled and says her doctor told her not to work, but she often says she's able to and talks about going back to work (she's made no moves to do so yet). My girlfriend isn't employed either, but focuses on her college full-time.

I have an associate's degree and work full-time. Before the summer, they nearly had their utilities shutdown due to a massive overdue bill that they couldn't fully afford. The father completely neglected it and had no concern when the situation arose. Under the pressure of having my girlfriend and her family ripped from their home and forced to move out of state, I gave them a significant amount of money to pay off the bill, and then more so that they can buy their way into bankruptcy. Not long after, their only car broke down toward the start of summer, and I gave them money towards a new one as well (which they haven't been able to afford yet). I am now owed $2000, an amount that was originally $2300 a few months ago. In addition, I drive them to all of their errands and places they want/need to go. This has taken up most of the time I have outside of my work schedule.

On top of this, I frequently send my girlfriend money when she tells me she needs it: food for herself, food for her family, uber rides to school and elsewhere that I can't take her on while I'm at work, groceries for her family, etc. I once payed for a hotel room for her sister to stay in for a night following a bad family fight and never got the money back. On average, I'd say I spend anywhere from $60 to $100 weekly on my girlfriend and her family. I never receive any of this back, even when they say they'll pay it back. I'm not even counting the gas money I spend to give them rides daily. They pay me $100 every so often for the $2000 I'm owed, but this is out of the father's biweekly paycheck. Some weeks he doesn't get paid to give me the $100 because they can't afford groceries and rent, so I don't get it for another 2 weeks or more.

The money I spend especially problematic for me because of how much out of my weekly paycheck goes towards them. I have my own things to pay off, such as student loans and car with a number of issues. I've been trying for months to save money for my girlfriend and I to move in together, but I'm constantly having to take from my paycheck and my savings account to cover their costs on top of my own. Between this and the 2k I'm owed, I've barely been able to save for this move, and my savings account is still very low. I put in as much overtime as I physically can, but my job doesn't always offer it and I'm needed by the family in the evenings for rides and errands, so I can't always get much in.

I've been overwhelmed and exhausted with all this over the past several months, but I keep telling myself that I'm doing the right thing in helping out the person I love and her family. I'm beginning to reach a breaking point, though. My gf recently asked me for $200 to pay off a bill she racked up with a Victoria's Secret credit card. This baffled me quite a bit and I frankly don't feel obligated to give her any of it. Even after this, though, I still feel it my responsibility to continue doing what I'm doing because 6 people will be without their needs if I just shut it down. At the same time, I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I give her and them all of my time outside of work and I don't have time to do much else, but i don't really have a social life to begin with; I only ever leave the house for work and to support/spend time with her and her family.

So with all this put into account, am I the asshole for feeling as fed up as I am? Do I have any real reason to feel like I'm being taken advantage of?

Tl;dr: My gf and family rely on me for money and transportation, but I feel like I have too much to take on and I feel in part that I'm being taken advantage of. I'm owed money and give them nearly all of my time outside of work. At the same time, they do genuinely need my support because they're extremely poor. Am I wrong for feeling this way?",08Oct2019,1
674,"HC=Horrible Coworker 
LS=Lazy Subordinate 
LB=Lazy Boss

I work pretty successful small business in a busy metropolitan area. I am having a difficult time with the politics of a small company as most of my previous places of employment have all been at huge companies. The one that is wearing on my heavily is that it seams like the horrible people tend to get the most. 

Example #1: HC shares the same title as i do but the opposite shift. HC doesn't put in half of the effort i do, is constantly complained about by our subordinates, makes no effort to be efficient and even the owners complain about and can't stand. I'll admit, this HC has been with the company for about 4 or 5 years whereas I've only been with the company for 2 years. HC has a better shift (i get it she's been with the company longer) but when she put in her two weeks, Lb told me that im getting a raise and the better shift. HC changed her mind of the second to last day and everything was forgotten (when i brought it up LB i told my shift its busier and im more efficient.) I started out at a really good hourly rate (higher than HC) HC got a raise to match me when she found out by digging through personal documents that she wasn't supposed to be going through. HC's raise was my monthly income but salary (taking into account HC leaves early all the time it's a huge raise for her). We, up until this week, had a 1.5 hour overlap. This was, for what i was told, is so HC can catch up on another part of her job. Instead HC completes that job so when i get in she can just sit around and run out the clock. So, during that overlap, i would help out my subordinates with their tasks. Until she started complaining that ""i wasn't doing anything during the overlap time"" since i wasn't physically in the same area as she was and she couldn't just run out the door the second i came in (if i show up before my shift starts she will literally run out of the door forcing me to start early unexpectedly.) I brought it up to LB that i felt like the overlap was useless and offered to cut my hours and come in later. LB told me to send her home when i got on (we tried this before and HC freaked out and said im not her boss and can't send her home early). So LB said he would have HC come in an hour early and leave an hour early. Except HC still comes in at her normal time and leaves an hour to 1.5 hours early. So now she's doing less work and still gets paid the same. 

Example #2: LS was hired to be HC and my subordinate. He hates doing his job makes everyone's life miserable and it's essentially too much work for LB to put him in his place. Since he refuses to do the Job he was hired for, he's been given other tasks to do ""since we're paying him anyways"". These ""other tasks"" are most of the things that LB was responsible for and have basically put him in a position above me (even though he gets paid way less to do so) ok fine, if he wants to have more reasonably for less pay it's kind of good for the company. Except now our subordinates consider the hierarchy to be: owner, LB, LS, than HC/ myself. Which it's pretty annoying.  At one point LS threatened to quit and LB told me he would absorb his pay and basically start doing his old job again (which he still retained his pay for, so raise for him.) A week later LB told me that if LS quit that he would give me some of LS responsibilities and he would look at giving me a raise at the beginning of the upcoming year. I haven't recieved a raise since i started, LB said he brought it up to the owner previous to this conversation and that ""we're just not in the position to right now."" Cool, whatever i get it... until LS got a raise a week later. 

Example #3: our subordinates start getting pretty high ""guarantees"" which essentially is an amount of money that they get no matter what. The subordinates are commissioned based so they are in control of how much money they can make. This as you can imagine has made most of them pretty lazy, because they're getting paid the same regardless. They constantly break the rules and theirs m there's no consequences or repercussions even though im constantly reassured the would. 

I understand the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and I'm not the type to constantly state my grievances, but it feels like the horrible people get more or have to do less because they're horrible. I doubt know what I'm expecting by posting this but at least I'm getting it off my chest.",08Oct2019,1

680,"for some context i'm in a country where public college is free and english is my second language. basically i finished high school about a year ago and decided (or rather was pressured into) going straight to college. i've been interested in languages since i was around 6 when i started learning english so i picked a major involving english &amp; japanese.  
 
i attended college for about 5 months but i felt completely miserable after a month in or so to where i eventually broke down and stopped going, mostly due to mental health issues. i felt like the whole atmosphere of the place just started becoming negative after a while of going there and i couldn't take it anymore, i disliked the people going there and made exactly two friends throughout the entire 5 months.   

at a certain point i started going to the nearby children's playground every day to get drunk with cheap beer before classes just to be able to get through the day. this shit literally turned me into an alcoholic, i barely even drank before this. i absolutely hated all of the english classes, especially phonology and history which were hell. i mostly enjoyed the japanese classes probably because they were the only thing that was interesting to me, though they were a bit hard but with everything going on around me i just couldn't focus at all.     

fast forward 6 months of therapy later (which didn't help at all) as well as stopping the drinking habit and i started college again, this time in a completely different major (not to be too specific but something science/biology related) which i wasn't really too keen on but i thought it wouldn't be as bad and i could make it through somehow.   

well turns out i was wrong - honestly it's 10 times worse and i'm only a week and a half in so far. none of the courses are even vaguely interesting to me and at this point i just wanna blow my brains out and end it all. i have no idea what to do anymore. i had really good scores at the end of high school to where i could have gotten pretty much anywhere i wanted but it just all feels pointless to me because i'm not interested in any of it. 
 
 i still want to learn japanese but the english aspect along with the negative memories just turns me off so i haven't picked it up since. i was thinking of dropping out and just going to a language school where i can focus on one thing but i have no idea what i would do after.
 
i've been depressed for the past 6 years and nothing has helped, i had plenty of friends but i realized nobody really cares and at this point and i've just given up, if someone asks me how i'm doing i just put on a fake smile and act like everything is fine even though i'm always anxious and dying inside. i've been putting on an act to where sometimes i myself think i'm fine then go to bed at night to realize i have no future and i've fucked everything up a long time ago and cry myself to sleep. it's funny because everyone told me shit gets better in college but it's only gotten way worse since then.

work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’ and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Juts before this they asked how old I am and I said I’m 29 and they both recanted nicely saying ‘awwwwww are yer?!’ Meaning I look younger coz I do get told I do a lot. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.",08Oct2019,0

683,"So my area really has no weed right now, I come across my friend while I’m taking a walk at the park and he start chatting, I mention that I need some weed and he says he has a plug around here that has some weed. So I told him I’ll light up my last blunt while we go ride to meet the plug and he said ok. Long story short we smoke the blunt in the way to the plug and I get the 2 ounces, I tell him to stop at 7/11 so I can get some backwoods to smoke when I get home and he says “get me a plastic bag so I can get my cut” I hit the scooby doo face on him and said “HUHHH?” I told him i never agreed to give him any weed especially cause the area is dry right now 🤷‍♂️ 

 He starts bitching like a little girl talking about “oh it’s common courtesy dude” “you can break me off 2 grams” then he called me broke and that got me upset but I played it off. I tell him drop me off at my house and he says “take a cab N***A” whole time I’m a white male so I took offense And I couldn’t hold it in anymore 🤷‍♂️ rip the door back open and ask him “Fuck you say to me NIG-UH?” (trying to mock him I wasn’t trying to be racist) he instantly got mad and hopped out got in my face saying “call me a nigga now pussy” I tell him to sit the fuck down before I knock him out and he keeps walking around me in circles repeat it pussy” “I’m a what?” I tell him “we can square up right now and he says “no say it right now call me a n****a” 


After I don’t say it he waits back down in the car still talking shit so at this point I had it and I walked up to the window and said “wassup n***a you wanted me to say it so- the he unblocked his seatbelt so fast but I threw 3 fast ass punches caught him clean in the eye and mouth he didn’t know what hit him 😂 he looked confused and I tried to drag him out the drivers side window but he slipped out my grip pulled out a knife from the side of his car and stabbed me in the arm. He jumped out and chased me for 2 blocks saying he “he was gonna kill me and to stop running” why would I stop running if you have a knife dumbass?

686,"TL;DR - I feel depressed (sometimes suicidal) and lost and I don't know where to go from here. I have a ""promising future"" in a career that feels pointless and is stressful.  I have never had time to figure out what I want do -- I have always just done what is practical and lucrative.  Where do I go from here?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 26 right now. Since high school, I've done the responsible thing.  I took the hard, college prep classes (and did well), I went to the cheap state school (with mostly a full ride), I was pushed into getting a STEM degree (because of the job potential), I got a 6 figure job right out of college and have been advancing (I get high annual raises and was promoted).  I am profoundly unhappy and empty (at points somewhat suicidal). 

I'm the only one in my family that ended up doing the responsible thing -- everyone else (aside from dad, who has a different family now) is financially unstable (i.e. 10s of thousands in debt, unstable employment history, etc.).  Because of a lot of personal things, I'm not close to my family anymore -- most of our phone calls (except with my dad) involve them venting or being toxic.  I rarely feel like I'm given space for emotional support because ""I'm the one that has it together"" -- even though, on the inside, I sometimes feel like I'm about completely lose it. And I think this adds a lot of pressure to keep grinding away because I don't feel like I have a safety net.  

I've tried dating a number of times, but I've not had a lot of luck in that department (gay dating can be tough in your 20s).  

I have some friends in my current city, but I struggle a lot with letting my guard down and letting people get close. I have closer friends that live elsewhere and they have been tremendously helpful in some of my darker moments. Regardless, I am going to make real efforts at connecting with more people locally because I know it will probably help (even if it's hard).

I have done a good job of repressing most of this stuff, but it's recently exploded back into my awareness.. and I'm having a tough time.  I don't know how much longer I can keep going.  I had a complete nervous breakdown last weekend and could barely leave my apartment.  My job is overwhelming me and I don't feel like I even know what the point of any of this is.  I would love time to recuperate.. just some sort of break to get my life sorted and my priorities figured out.   Part of me wants to take some time off (I have a lot of money saved), but I don't even know what direction to go.  

Does anyone have advice?",08Oct2019,1
687,"I originally tried to post this on AITA, but content regarding sexual assault isn't allowed there

Last night my boyfriend (M23) and I (F20) went to dinner, and as we were walking back to our separate apartments (same building), our conversation turned to an email we had both received from our college police earlier that week, notifying students that a sexual assault had been reported in the library bathroom, with a description of the suspect. 

I had received a followup email about the incident earlier that day, saying police had not been able to identify the suspect through security film, and asked my boyfriend if he had also received one. He hadn’t checked his email, but began talking about how the library bathroom seems like an unlikely place for an assault to occur, and how false reports are a thing. 

I agree with him that it is an unusual location, and false reports do happen, but inform him that the vast majority of reports are not false. (From what I have found, information indicates that between 2 and 10 % of all reports are false, and that over half of all assaults are not reported at all)

He knows that I have been sexually assaulted multiple times, and attempted to file a report with our school, who strongly discouraged me from doing so. This is an extremely common response from our university, their priority is reputation, not victims. Another issue. 

Anyway, he seemingly ignores my statement that false reports are uncommon, and instead starts telling me a story about a girl from his high school who apparently didn’t want to take an exam so she faked being abducted and raped, and got 4 years in jail because of it. 

I say again, a false report is statistically not the most likely situation. At this point he is just talking over me to argue about how false reports are real, and how I never listen to him. We’re standing outside the ice-cream store at the bottom of our building, where we had planned on stopping so I could buy us desert after he paid for dinner. Instead, I walk into our building and go back to my place. I send him a text saying I’m sorry for walking away, but that I thought he was being argumentative and insensitive. I gave him some time to cool off, and try to call him the next morning. He ignores my calls and sends me a text saying I’m toxic and never listen to him, and that we should break up.",08Oct2019,3
688,"I'm a college student, and about three weeks ago I got a job at a hotel as a front desk attendant. I understand that working at a hotel can be stressful, but my night audit shift leading into sunday morning almost made me quit on the spot. The girl who was supposed to relieve me was a no call no show, and her number wasn't in the system. I called my manager, who ended up tracking down her number and waking her up. He called me back and told me she'd be calling soon to give me an estimate on how long she'd be getting in. She never calls. Finally, at 7:50, I call her at the number he gave me. I think I woke her up again. She tells me it'll be an hour before she gets in because ""she needs to shower and might have pink eye"". I ask ""are you fucking kidding me"" out of reflex. At this point I'm on a 9 hour shift. My girlfriend that I haven't seen in over a month is coming in from 3 hours away in half an hour. And this girl wants another hour to get ready, putting me at a ten hour shift, exhausted, and late to my date with my girlfriend. She gets mad and quits on the spot. I'm pretty sure she's the same person that left me waiting two hours over a week or two before because she ""had bronchitis"". I understand I probably didn't handle the situation the best. But to the issue at hand. I don't know if this kind of thing is normal at hotels. If it is, I don't think I can handle this stress of being surprised into staying late because of inconsiderate coworkers. I have experience as a meat cutter and at a grocery store and just want to know if people outside the situation think it might be a good idea for me to get back into one of those jobs as opposed to this one.

690,"I recently moved into a new house. My housemates are all lovely, but one of them is neglecting to recognise my boundaries a bit, and is quite needy.

I'm an introvert. By that, I don't mean that I don't like people, because I love people. However, I do need a considerable amount of time in my week to be alone. For me, the 'norm' after coming home tired from uni is chilling in my room.

I'd probably consider myself a fair bit more extorverted than most introverts, but my housemate is way, waaay too much for me.

If he's not going out somewhere, he wants to hang out, and he wants to hang out all evening. I wouldn't mind, but he makes me feel guilty and almost abnormal for saying 'no'. e.g. ""Oh, I hope you're going to be more sociable soon!"" the other day, when I said I wasn't feeling hanging out. Today he said ""ffs"" when I told him I was going to be home later than I originally said. Last night he woke me up at like 10.30PM by knocking on my closed door instead of messaging me to see if I was awake. 

I just now told him I had work to do, came up to my room, and he's messaging me asking what I'm doing after my work. AFTER I SHARED DINNER WITH HIM AND PLAYED ON THE WII. I feel like his idea of housemate is my idea of conjoined twin.

We also have to be 'on' all the time. We can't just hang out, it has to be high-energy and wacky. Recently we've been playing through a game together, and he won't just let me play it, he can't go 10 seconds without telling me how to play (backseat gaming as fellow epic gamers might say), or saying something loud and jokey that I'm supposed to run with.

The sense of obligation, both to hang out and be high energy, makes me feel like I'm giving up my personal boundaries, and it's definitely pushing me away. I'm not necessarily low-energy and solitary at all, I'm more in the middle, but it feels so all-or-nothing.

I'm not good at setting boundaries, always been a go with the flow, people pleaser kind of guy, so this is definitely my bad too. I do really like my housemate, as much as I'm complaining, and I don't think his behaviour is malevolent.

How do I say something like ""listen man, I probably won't want to spend my entire evening with you more than once a week"", without sounding mean? He very wrongly described himself as an introvert recently, so I don't feel like he 'gets' this aspect of my personality, as pretentious as that sounds. I don't want him to take it personally, and I also don't want him to take it as ""stop asking me to hang out, I don't want to be close friends.""

I want to establish a compromise, basically. How can I do that? Preferably in person, but I don't know how well I could articulate the finer points of this.",08Oct2019,2
691,"So, last summer I honestly can’t remember what was up with me. I don’t think it was anything extremely serious but I’m kinda scared it’ll happen again. Basically I went through some phase if I should even call it that. I was very happy during one day then extremely down (if that’s a good term for it) during another. And I don’t mean like just being sad or something, I mean like I just couldn’t stand the idea of being around other people or even around my family. During those days I thought about killing certain people that would touch a nerve or stuff like that but I know I would never act upon it. During the beginning of summer it was rare for that stuff to happen but as summer progressed it increasingly came to my mind more. Just negative thoughts in general as well. I don’t want to say it’s depression or anything like that since I doubt I have it. Anyways I went ahead and took psychedelics since I’m a regular with them. So I took them, and it was seriously freaky on this trip. Like I could see what was happening and everything but my mind was everywhere and just bad. I never had a trip like this before but I archived some posts during the trip but I couldn’t remember what they said so I went ahead and checked them and I was freaked out with what I was writing. One was “L oh L. By the time you see this. When we wake up, I won’t even understand it. Don’t mention it to me, act like it’s nothing. I hate those news. Good and bad. When I wake up I won’t be in this world. Hmmm thinking. Thinking is confusing on certain things. My vocabulary? Well I love you :). Don’t take it to heart. I hate seeing you. I hate you but love you at the same time. Jeez it’s something to read. You won’t understand it and I won’t either. But for now know it. You don’t and that’s fine. Goodnight for eternity. Good morning when I wake up, I hate the hours. Hours gone by huh? 2 hours till he’s up :) I hate him. I hate him with everything in me. I have an idea for this, ending. The end” I was really freaked out when I read it, there was a couple of other posts I made as well with captions similar to that.

693,"I'm 21 years old and have been providing or my 53 years old, unemployed and mentally abusive father for 2 years. I was raised by my grandma, meaning that he was basically not present in my life until I was forced to live with him when my grandma passed away and I was still underage.

We live in Hungary, which is an extremely poor and hard country to live in. We have $600 debt to the landlord of the house we live in right now. The rent is $300 monthly, and I've been paying it all alone while also paying for food and other expenses such as his cigarettes. He refuses to work, gives excuses, makes a mess, and regularly starts fights with me in which he says horrible things about me. I'm unable to pay rent and debt alone, meaning that we're getting evicted January 1st.

Through my only friend here in Hungary, I have the opportunity to move out and rent a room for an affordable price. There are no words to describe how much I want to be away from my father. However, I know that without me, he will die. Absolutely no doubt about it.

Obviously, the logical answer is for me to get the hell out of here, but I'm so god damn terrified of living with the thought that someone died because of me. I'm also terrified of him hurting me or breaking my belongings when I pack my stuff to move. I told him about the room today, and **he said that he doesn't want me to move out - no shit**.

I hate him, but **I don't want him to die because of my decision**. He won't be able to get a job because he has a bunch of unpaid crap, so the government would *apparently* ""block"" and take away his salary. However, I cannot take the mental abuse, and living in literal filth anymore. I refuse to clean up his mess, I'm not his wife, and I think the least he could've done is keep things tidy if he refuses to work and earn money.

I met him at his car nearby a store 10 PM that night, and afterwards, things just escalated. He proceeded to beg for sex because “he deserves it” and because of how long of a drive he had. I repeatedly told him no, and that we can just make out. He still continued to beg me and at this point, I just finally gave in. I I was scared and felt powerless, there was nobody else in sight.

696,"This is probably one of the most boring sorts of questions but i would really appreciate any sort of advice. I am a few days away from turning 20, and am in my final year of my bachelor's degree in Psychology. What I'm trying to focus on right now is what decision to make to decide how to proceed with my life. Some background about my life: I live in a poor under-developed country, where children, especially girls, usually keep on living with their parents until (notice it's not ""unless"") they get married. The country is so small that just renting a home apart to move out with the very low salaries and living costs is relatively unjustifiable. There are no ""unconventional"" jobs here, or any modes of decent public transportation apart from getting your own car. Living conditions are generally bad and parents and relatives are very domineering and generally controlling of the younger generations lives. Anyways, back to the topic at hand, I will graduate at the end of this year, most likely first in my year, and have a 4.0 GPA up until now. My options are either to go abroad to pursue a Clinical Psychology degree (if I can secure a scholarship), or again abroad to study to become Psychodynamic therapist, or stay in my country and, after getting my BA, throw everything aside and go to veterinary school (since there is an excellent almost free public university here with a vet program).  The thing is I really don't know what to do at all. As you can obviously, postponing the decision for a year is not really an option, because that would only be extending my imprisonment within my family for another year and keeping me dependent on them for longer, that is if they don't end up trying to pressure me into getting married (I understand these concept are difficult to understand for people who do not grow up in such environments, but please understand that "" you're your own person, no one can decide for you"" is very difficult for people who have been brought up and raised in a culture of guilt inducement and borderline emotional manipulation and great interdependence and control of parents over their children, so please try to keep that in mind). I don't really know what to do. Part of me just wants to find a job and try to settle down abroad to detach from this environment, another part feels too inadequate to study abroad and isn't even sure whether or not my major is for me, another just wants to be around animals and be a vet but doesn't want to have to stay here and have wasted 3 years of education, and another just wants to have a chance to live independently, have a low-income job and live sparely accordingly just to get to really experience life as it is instead of always being suffocated, but can't do this within my country.

For reference— the guy this whole thing is 19, I’m 17


Alright les go. So this guy, let’s call him Ben, and I are decent friends. We smoked and got really high. I went home and later on he texted me.  The convo was something along the lines of:

Him: do you actually have a crush on [coworker]? How much do you like him?

Me: idk I guess he’s more like a really good friend. Why?

Him: another question? Do you think I’m attractive?

Me: yea

Him: do you wanna lose your virginity?

Me: *shocked pikachu face* yea

Him: You’re attractive. I’m down if you are

Me: do you like me or do you just wanna fuck? You know what, I’ll talk to you tomorrow about this okay?

Him: 👍🏻

So the next day I confront him and he says he doesn’t remember it much but remembers what he said. I asked if he meant it and he said “idk. Did you want me to mean it?” To which I narrowed my eyes at him and was about to answer when we both got distracted. So I texted him when I was drunk and said “I think we should really talk about it.” And we did. I asked him if he liked me and kept evading the question so drunk me finally said “I like you, alright?” To which he again said “so you’re down then?” I’m confused bc the first time he said he actually liked me but idk if he was just really high or what?

Things that I used to find joy in, I don't. My favourite time of the year is normally when I go away for the week with family, it was a perfect holiday but I just didn't feel the same as last time. I also loved playing video games but now they dont hold my attention. My enthusiasm for everything has dropped a lot.

I wasn't sure if they really wanted me to come in for a drink or they just wanted to be kind. I declined, and then I wondered if I was being polite for declining and not being a burden or being rude for saying no.

My brother was having a few friends over for drinks and was telling me about it. Then he said: you can come too if you like.
I declined. I'm not sure if he thought: I'm talking about having friends over, maybe it's kind if I ask her to join as well or if he really liked me to be there. Is it polite or rude to decline an invitation like this?

I got pregnant my freshman year of college, got married, and am currently working towards my bachelors degree in accounting. My husband, son &amp; I are living with my parents for financial reasons. My mom is a housewife and she watches my son (I do pay her), and we contribute towards utilities &amp; groceries. My husband &amp; I both work full time and we pay for all of our own things (and my sons, obviously). Anyway, my parents would prefer for me to live with them forever. They say they are ready for me (whenever I am, which will be in probably 3 years) to take over all the bills on the home so my dad can retire &amp; they can move back to their home country. They would also still come back and visit very regularly. This means a few things for me. 

1. I will always have to keep a bedroom empty &amp; ready for my parents when they come and visit. This is only a concern because it’s a 3 bedroom house and if I decide to have more children we are out of space. I’m not concerned about having to take care of them, I am going to be the one mainly taking care of them once my dad retires anyway. My main concern in space.

2. I feel as though I will never have full privacy from my parents. And my home will forever be the home where all the siblings and grand kids gather. This also concerns me because I tend to get overwhelmed with too much social interaction and usually need to recharge. Also I am too controlling and mess/dirtiness that i can’t clean right away honestly drives me mad.

3. If my parents get ill and we as a family cannot pay for treatments I am expected to sell the house. I understand the logic but I don’t know where my family is expected to go if this were to happen. 

4. If I ever sell the house I am expected to share the profit amongst my siblings and parents. Even though I will be the one paying for all the renovations. This logic just makes me angry. I would understand sharing profit with my parents completely, but my siblings have nothing to do with it.

The house does need updates and I’m estimating it’ll be around $70k which is nowhere near a mortgage amount (which would probably be ~$300k). I don’t mind being responsible for my parents, but in a 1 story 3 bedroom home I feel as though the privacy is very limited.

I’m 20 years old and My whole adolescent life I’ve gotten a lot of attention from people for my looks.  Albeit not 24/7 but a good chunk of the time I go out, parties, malls, restaurants you name it.  But occasionally throughout those times I’d go through patches, like right now, where I feel invisible and don’t get the attention I had got before.  It was great for a month straight recently having girls eye me up and down, ask for my Snapchat, approach me at parties, staring at me at the gym etc.  But a couple weeks ago I got a huge zit on my nose and that same day at a family party my uncles were calling me a loser for being unemployed at the time.  This made me feel like shit and since then i haven’t been feeling great about myself and haven’t been getting the attention I was previously getting even though I look physically exactly the same, though my self esteem has taken a huge hit.  Is this recent lack of the attention I had been used to because my low self confidence or is it something with my looks?",08Oct2019,2
706,"Hey, this is pretty important. 

There is this close friend of mine from back in high school who moved to a different city 2 years ago after graduation to attend college there. We kept in close touch though and he regularly comes to visit.

He was a bit quiet and awkward, but a real fun person once you get to know him. However, while we were still in high school, there was one time he broke down and admitted to me that he felt that he might be suffering from depression. I tried to comfort him and suggested that he seeks out help, but I don't think he ever did that. In part I think it's because he tends to downplay his own issues a lot of the time or feels he doesn't ""deserve"" to feel that way. He literally even apologized to me for telling me about his feelings in the first place, but I told him that he shouldn't.

A while back, we were hanging out together with another close friend of ours, and he eventually we began talking about more serious stuff as these things go. Eventually, he admitted to having woken up in the hospital after a heavy night of drinking with a friend of his, and that he feels like he can't stop drinking once he starts, but neither of this didn't make him change his drinking habits. Based on what me and the other close friend gathered we're pretty sure that since then he went from occasionally drinking too much with friends to mostly just drinking alone in his apartment. Whenever he texts with us or posts in our group chat it's pretty obvious that is pretty drunk, and he doesn't really deny it either, but still downplays his drinking. It happens a few times a week.

Could he be an alcoholic? If so, what do you even do in a situation like that? I genuinely worry about him, but I'm not sure how to approach the whole thing.",08Oct2019,2

I’ve been really upset about our argument all day and was wondering if he posted about it on reddit, since he uses this platform constantly. I truly was hoping I could get better insight to our argument, but what I found instead is just completely fucking heartbreaking.

The details are vague in his post and I don’t want to share too much on it even though I’m writing this from an anonymous account. But to sum it up, his cousin, who is older than him, coerced him into doing something sexual that my boyfriend did not want to do when they were younger. This was my boyfriends first sexual experience. 

My bf and I have been almost inseparable since the day we met 3 years ago and are extremely close. We have told each other some of our deepest secrets before, but he has never even come close to mentioning something this to me.  We also live together and I will be seeing him in about an hour. 

My heart and mind have been racing ever since I read his post and I don’t know if I should bring this up to him or not. It feels very strange for me to now know this secret about him because he didn’t tell me himself, but it’s also not like I went and snooped through his diary. He put it out on reddit, under his username. for anyone to see. A part of me thinks I should bring it up, but I also don’t want to make him uncomfortable if I tell him I know. He said that he still has anxiety about what happened and he feels weird sexually sometimes.

714,"There's more to the story than the headline.
I'm F19 and I'm from Europe, so any questions that might arise from reading are due to our schoolsystem being completely different.

My major at uni has something to do with social economics. During your time at uni you need different internships and i chose a primary school to intern in. In the afternoon i work at the ""after school care"", basically where the kids whose parents' work full time come aftee school to do their homework and play when they're finished.

One girl in the after school care (ASC) i'll call Kelly.
She's 9 years old and kind of wants to be the ""teacher's pet"". She always needs a grown-ups attention and often rats out the other kids, so you can imagine she's not the most popular kid. Plus, Kelly is very territorial and always wants me or another worker at the ASC to focus on her and only her. She clearly tries to be everybody's favourite.

Now, mostly Kelly's actually quite nice once you learn how to deal with her needing attention 24/7. She has one friend who i'll call Sandy. Sandy's in the same class as Kelly and they're best friends. Sandy is more popular than Kelly and has more friends, one of whom is an overweight girl. Since Kelly is super territorial of her friends she can't handle Sandy having friends beside her.

Shortly before the ASC closed Sandy came to me and told me:""Kelly just told [insert overweight girl's name] she doesn't want to be friends with her because she's too fat to be her friend"".
I was shocked. Since Kelly is chubby herself in never thought she would attack others for their weight.

So i called Kelly over and confronted her. She told me:""But [overweight girl's name] called me fat in kinfergarten. My mom's here so bye"". And she was our the door. Btw, her mom really picked her up.

Now, i promised Sandy that i would confront Kelly tomorrow proberly. So here's my question:

Does anybody have any idea how to confront Kelly about calling the girls fat without implying that she's chubby herself?

For example, i feel like saying ""why would you call somebody fat when you don't like being called fat either?"", kind of implying Kelly is overweight herself.

718,"Am I obligated to be maid of honor for the woman who was my maid of honor?

Backstory- I was married earlier in the year and my childhood best friend begged to be my maid of honor. I was naïve and happily said yes not understanding how important that role actually is as far as organizing, communicating, etc. It was a very upscale wedding paid for mostly by my in-laws. I paid for my bridesmaids wedding dresses and jewelry and from what the other girls told me, I was in no way a difficult or demanding bride. 

My girlfriend completely dropped the ball as MOH. She didn’t plan anything, or gather money from the other bridesmaids for my bachelorette day, in fact, 2/4 bridesmaids footed the bill for everything  because my MOH and brother’s wife did not contribute...even to pay for their portion of the day! 
The bridesmaids who flaked were my best friend and a family member. The ones who stepped up were my new sister in law and a college girlfriend and were absolutely appalled by their behavior. 

The MOH did however, talk about how HER bachelorette party would be in Mexico and have all the bells and whistles and her wedding dress would be like mine and HER... well you get the picture. Her behavior was  pretty much comical to anyone involved. No wedding gift, no bridal shower gift, showed up late to my bridal shower and asked me to style her hair and makeup in the bathroom for her in the middle of the party. 

 I didn’t want any drama or hurt feelings so I never said anything. I have immense gratitude to the other girls for stepping up in her place. 

Well, now she’s anticipating her boyfriend is going to propose and she wants me to be her maid of honor. She says her wedding budget will be 1k. My husband said absolutely under no circumstances are we paying a penny towards her wedding planning and he thinks she exploited our long friendship to get some sort of spotlight she’s always sought after.

What is a way to excuse myself from being a part of her wedding? I want to say I’m sorry but I don’t have the time or resources to be the maid of honor I know you’ll need. My husband thinks I should grow a backbone and tell her how much she hurt me and call out for being a complete narcissist but I don’t think that would solve anything lol.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me.

She frequently throws around homophobic and racial slurs, probably because my family is full of people who throw these words around like candy.

Over the past few days Luigi has been doing some little petty things towards Bill and my Gf, when they asked around in class for gum, including asking Luigi, they would all say no, and then 10 seconds later Luigi would pull out a 30 pack of gum and give a piece to his friend, then looking at Bill and laughing while showing him the gum.  Little things like that have been going on but was not that crazy because this is just how people are in high school.  Yesterday Luigi was throwing papers at Bill and my Gf, and other trash.  Again this was let go but it was worse than the previous things that have happened.  Today though is when I decided something needs to be done, My gf came to me after class telling me about how they were stuffing trash in Bills backpack and throwing stuff at them, this pissed me off, but what pissed me off more was later seeing that Bills backpack was as full of ink and all his stuff was ruined, Bill then told me that they put exploded pens in his backpack. 

I don’t expect Bill to defend himself, he is the nicest most innocent kid in the world and even though he’s the same age as us he is like our little brother, a few other people have been told about this and are pissed that Luigi is messing with him.  Luigi and Bill don’t even know each other, they have no beef or anything.  Luigi cheated on my gf and they have not been on good terms since.

Me and him got really drunk at a house party the night before and we kissed multiple times throughout the night, I knew he wanted more because he kept on placing my hand down his pants. I felt uncomfortable I was just telling him I’m tired and I want to go to sleep. 

The next day I invited him and my other girl friend to stay over at mine. We got some more alcohol so we can get drunk again. The three of us were playing truth or dare. We were doing dares that involved me kissing him again giving him hickeys etc. my other friend had a boyfriend  at the time so she couldn’t do anything with him. 

I got super drunk to the point my vision was blurry, I felt sick and I decided to lay down on my bed and then he came on to the bed with me and started cuddling me. My other friend left the room cause she knew what was about to happen. He was giving me kisses and I just decided to kiss back just for fun. He started to undress me and undressing himself. My friend threw a condom at us and I was hoping that it will never come to this part. We were fully naked and my vision was so blurry that I don’t even remember how he looked like. I felt something going in and I didn’t give him permission.  He knew I was a virgin. I felt so pressured to do it so without mentioning this I just said “Wait, put on a condom”. It was my decision in the end but that happened 5 months ago and I still can’t forget about it. Felt pressured to do something I wasn’t ready for. I pretended like I was ok with it because I didn’t want anybody to feel bad for him.  I just want to know if it’s my fault for letting that happened and how do I forget about it ? I feel like I was used as a sex object. I regret that time to this day.",08Oct2019,1

741,"So lately I've been having trust issues with everyone. Thats wasn't a problem until I started having some serious trust issues with the ones closest to me. Like my closest friends, my girlfriend and my family. I don't have anyone in my life whom I could trust with my eyes closed. I guess I lost trust with my parents a long while ago when they told me one thing and did another and gave me false sense of hope and freedom but always did as they pleased and always showed me that they care about my opinion while completely ignoring it. I can live with it. My mother called me a failure and treated me like one for a long time and so did everyone else in my family. They always told me that I ain't worth a shit but whenever I accomplished something they told me(in front of others) that they had always believed in me. They still curse at me and my father still uses violence against me whenever he gets mad but that's alright. I don't live with them anymore. 

Now coming to my girlfriend. For all the time that I've known her(almost 7 years now), I always believed that she was the one for me. She's my first girlfriend and we're together since the end of 2015. But now I tell myself that we are together since 2018 because of some fucked up shit she pulled a couple of years ago behind my back. Now before I jump into the mud, I'd like to tell you that I love this girl like anything! I love her more than anyone in my life and I still do. I just don't trust her like I used to anymore. It hurts like hell to realize what she did. She tell me that it was a mistake and maybe it was but I can't get my head around the fact that she did it multiple time for like months and months. Is that how much time it takes to realize that you're not supposed to do this? We're in a long distance relationship and we've always been. Since the start of our relationship we've been apart from eachother but I never doubted her honesty and faithfulness. I Never asked for her social media accounts because I knew that she's not that type of girl. I hate the concept of cheating. And I think sexting someone jokingly counts as that. Another thing that hurts me more is that I FOUND OUT about it ACCIDENTALLY. Now I'm a bit on the conservative side. I don't like the concept of hook ups and one night stands. Not that type of guy. I'm not saying that it's wrong or anything but I don't like it and I would like my partner to feel the same way about it. And I think she does feel the same way and maybe she was stupid back then as she tells me but still... She broke my trust and trust is a fragile thing man.. she asked me for my Instagram account and I opened hers and we were fooling around till I found those texts from 1&amp;1/2 years ago.. I opened that dm and instantly knew something was up because even the last text was something about a weird sexual fantasy that guy told my girl back then and she (my girl) sent him a voicemail reciting all of that. And so o scroll up and up and found all the disgusting texts. I waited and tried forgetting about it but how TF can I? So I confronted her. Asked her politely to explain all of it and she started jumping on me telling me that it was all a joke and I should suck it up. That conversation didn't go well and at the end she apologized but I was still super pissed and sad. Then she started bringing up her past like she always do for some reason. Oh and btw.. she does have a pretty fucked up and dark past and I feel really sorry for her but that was the worst time to bring it up. And the funny thing is that she always does that. whenever there's a conflict between us.. she'd bring it up and then at the end it's always about her. I'm not denying that she has a bad past and that she went through some terrible shit but THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. I used to suppress my emotions when she did that but now it feels manipulative. Even she told me that it seem manipulative and I was like, ""yeah, no shit."" But then she did it again. And that's why now I don't trust her with my feelings. She used to tease with my insecurities in front of my friends on discord. Imagine if I started doing that? She teased me about me being called a failure by my mother infront of my friends. She also teased me about not having many female friends and being an introvert and being shy. now that I look back... maybe I should've had that. Now I kinda wanna be an asshole. She always teased me for being the ""nice guy"" and now I wanna be that asshole. But I can't because I hate that concept. And if I got mad for that sorta thing that she'd call me a snowflake. And that's just an example of a single incident that happened there. All the sexting that we used to do is ruined for me. All those love texts and fooling around is ruined for me. Sometimes I'm so angry at her that I just wanna go at her but I don't. I don't like shitting on someone. That'd be me being unreasonable and that won't solve things between us. I do wanna solve things. I want things to go back to normal if not better. But I just feel so resentful these days. These days I'm keeping my mind diverted from these things. I'm not thinking about it and keeping myself busy but this is a temporary solution.i want a permanent one. Not to say that I don't love her, because I do. Very much. But I just don't trust her with my feelings anymore. I don't even know if that makes sense. 

She's going through a lot too lately. I don't want anyone of you to shit on her because she's traumatized and she has her own problems that maybe I don't understand and she's suicidal and that's one of the reasons why I can't open up to her with how I truly feel and that's why I'm here with this stupid rant.

So my mother first got 200€ to help my other brother who is playing basketball and needs the money, so I of course let her have it, since she didn't have any. Around a week later, all my money had been gone and she told me that she will give them back and I'm now left only with the thought of getting that PC. Right now we barely have any money and can't afford anything extra. I don't know what to do, I never had the feeling I achieved something because I worked for it since the money were gone so quick.

747,"I'm a college student (M 20) and my gf who is a few years older came back to visit. Gorgeous girl, amazing connection we have, sex appeal through the roof. We drank and went out a ton, had a lot of sex too. I usually never get ""whiskey dick"" but this time I had. I would be hard and as soon as I would go in, I would start to lose it after a few minutes. It was weird because I could finish. Our sex is consistently great and I know I can perform well so I wasn't worried, neither was she. I supposed I had just drank too much.

Then on our first sober day, the same thing was happening. It was like I could only achieve 90% of a boner and once I was inside her orally or vaginally, I would be down around 70%. It didn't ruin the sex, we both still came, but I was starting to get worried. Maybe I still had alcohol in my system, idk, but I was starting to worry.

A week ago I had also given up porn. Was not a chronic user but I hear there are some very negative associations with it mentally so I stopped. I dont know if thats a factor. Yesterday I went to masturbate with porn to ""achieve"" a boner and same thing, like 85%. I tried again 20 mins ago without porn and still like 85%. No trouble finishing though.

Sometimes, not too often, I will begin to lose an erection if sex has been going on for a while, but ive never had trouble getting it up or losing it a few mins in. And its weird bc its still hard enough to use it well, but we both notice it. It isn't an issue of me being worried about my gf, bc I am not. And I take pleasure in the way I am able to perform sexually because I have only ever heard very good things from a variety of girls I've slept with, so perhaps this is even more so why I am getting tripped up about this.

Seeing my gf this Friday and hoping I am normal for now. My plan is to just not masturbate for a few days; I think I am psyching myself out. The only other similar event was in junior year of high school I randomly could just not get a boner and it fucked with my head bc it had never happened. I stopped watching porn and masturbating for a little and had sex a week later and was totally fine. But I remember that night trying to masturbate and could not get it up either.

Last part, which makes me even more confused. I am extremely active. Like swimming, running, lifting up to 4 hours a day. I don't necessarily get very stressed out either, although I do have two midterms tomorrow. I get enough sleep and eat healthy. Just concerned that I could not get a full boner these past two days either while trying to masturbate. Hopefully somebody can help. Thank you guys (:",08Oct2019,2
748,"Hey, this is pretty important. 

There is this close friend of mine from back in high school who moved to a different city 2 years ago after graduation to attend college there. We kept in close touch though and he regularly comes to visit.

He was a bit quiet and awkward, but a real fun person once you get to know him. However, while we were still in high school, there was one time he broke down and admitted to me that he felt that he might be suffering from depression. I tried to comfort him and suggested that he seeks out help, but I don't think he ever did that. In part I think it's because he tends to downplay his own issues a lot of the time. He literally even apologized to me for telling me about his issues in the first place, but I told him that he shouldn't.

A while back, we were hanging out together with another close friend of ours, and he eventually we began talking about more serious stuff as these things go. Eventually, he admitted to having woken up in the hospital after a heavy night of drinking with a friend of his, but this didn't make him change his drinking habits. Based on what me and the other close friend gathered we're pretty sure that since then he went from occasionally drinking too much with friends to mostly just drinking alone in his apartment. Whenever he texts with us or posts in our group chat it's pretty obvious that is very drunk, and he doesn't really deny it either, but still downplays his drinking. It's almost daily at this point.

Could he be an alcoholic? If so, what do you even do in a situation like that? I genuinely worry about him, but I'm not sure how to approach the whole thing.",08Oct2019,1

754,"Hey guys. I could use some insight. 

I’ve never been a family oriented person. My brother and I don’t get along. My parents and I have had issues but we’ve been doing better lately and I love them despite our rocky history. Only my maternal grandparents are still alive but my grandpa had  a stroke a little over a year ago. My whole life I’ve been eager to get out of the house and go to college in a different part of the country, partially for independence, partially to see a different part of the country/culture. 

Last fall, I went to a school in the midwest and it was great until I had to medically withdraw. But now I can’t go back for reasons that don’t matter here. 

So I picked another school I was accepted to, this time on the east coast. They have everything I want academically, the website lists all but 1 extracurricular I want, and I’d have internship opportunities I couldn’t get in where I live. 

Because of new medical issues, I applied to a school near home as a safety net. But now I’m wondering if I should seriously consider it. It has what I want academically. It has some, but not all, of the extracurriculars I want. It doesn’t have the internship opportunities. But it’s only an hour’s drive from home. 

I’ve been realizing that, if I get the job I want, I’ll be lucky if I get to see my family once a year. There’s no promise I can be home for holidays, weddings, funerals, anything. My college years are likely the last years I can consistently see my family. 

I’m hoping to get in the job I want through a highly competitive fellowship so I really need to make myself stand out while in college. I don’t know if the school close to home will help with that beyond getting good grades. 


So with all that information, what do you all think? Do I go to the school that feels pretty much perfect for me but is literally on the opposite side of the country, or do I settle for less so I can be closer to my family while I still can?",08Oct2019,2

My boyfriend was in an abusive relationship for 3 years and only left his partner in January. We met in June, and are very happy together. He is the greatest man I’ve ever met. Absolutely adorable, full of life, kind, hardworking, funny as hell, and he’s 100% my best friend. He is protective of me, knows about my painful past, and wants to build a future with me. 

I’ve noticed a few things since hearing about his past:

-He shuts down quickly when in a negative or stressful situation

-Apologizes quickly and repeatedly when I mention something that bothers me, no matter how politely I state it

-It takes him a really, really, long time to ask me a question because he stretches it out, as if preparing for a destructive reaction

-Overly grateful and appreciative when I do simple things for him, like make his bed or throw his laundry in with mine. 

-Assumes I’ll be upset about something before I even know about it

He has told me about his ex-girlfriend hitting him, accusing him of cheating, making a mess in his house, demanding money from him, insulting him, sleeping with his friends (big one), blaming him for every single mishap, stealing his things, refusing to talk, gaslighting him, to name a few....

How can I help him heal from this? He has expressed his joy and feelings of safety with me. He tells me how much he loves me and how I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to him. I make an effort every single day to make sure he knows that he is loved and respected.

I want to move to part time (25-30 hrs) for 2 reasons. 
One, my grandparents are in poor health and I'm not sure how much longer I will have them around. I really, really want more time to spend with my family. I have no time to do that working full time.
Two, I love the company and I'm good at my job but this is not going to be my career. I want to have time to be a part time student in the thing I'm passionate about and also to further my education. I feel stagnant right now and want to learn.

I don't want to look elsewhere for a job just yet until I finish school. I just got a raise for my high performance levels and it's unlikely I can make this money anywhere else for the time being.

769,"So, I had my first girlfriend for 3 months but she was very abusive and last month and a half was HELL. I do not care about her anymore at all. I broke up, my friends are all supporting me even though I don't want to say everything that happened because I don't want to paint her in a bad light.

I find another girl, like week later, she's really really nice to me, probably the only person I've ever had some genuine interesting intellectual conversations with, understands me and all, genuinely never felt better. We kissed and it's official.

So I was walking with her and couple of friends saw us. Joked to me about how I'm a Chad, jumping from one relationship to another, I tell them she's just a friend.

Later today ex hits me up and I make it clear we're not going back together, she rages and I, a lonely loser like always, seek validation and ask one of my friends for opinion. He mentions the new girl and says go for it but to look out ""NOT TO LOSE MY CREDIBILITY"". I say maybe I'll go for it ( we're already together ) and explain how the breakup really doesn't bother me and that I suffered when we were together and that I feel relieved now.

I'm genuinely not a bad guy, I'm regretting ever having the first gf, I was desperate for love, a hug, attention, having someone.

Still, I don't want to bad mouth my ex, but then I just seem like an asshole that left for another girl. Do I keep the current gf a secret? For how long? I'm genuinely lost I feel like I'm losing it and going crazy, I should've never even messaged my friend about it.

I went out to eat at a bar last night. Had like 4 drinks. Some dude bought me 2 more and was trying to get me drunk. But while I was there that same guy got very drunk and started to man handle me so I had to get up and walk around to avoid him. I was really about to just say fuck the hip recovery and beat his ass bc I knew he doesn’t have any formal combat training and I have a bit of experience w Muay Thai, which is heavy in the hips. 🙃 But after trying to avoid the situation a lil bit, (but at some times knowingly pissing him off bc he’s literally fucking w me and I’m disabled like wtf) he decked me straight in the face. Some people there tried to help a bit but really didn’t do shit tbh. Some Seattle people have 0 balls or integrity and it’s kinda sad. But yeah I got decked straight in the Jaw. Still sore. I instinctively kinda chased him out a bit and stood up straight and all cause I kinda felt I needed to let him know that even though I had hip surgery and was on crutches, I didn’t give a damn how bad it hurt if it meant that he would back off bc tbh no one else was really doing shit. After I was tryna chase him off a bit and someone else walked him out they kept us separated. Then they made him walk home. My hip was hurting like hell all night and still is this morning.

He had a friend there too that he ended up slapping before he even hit me lmao. Wtf. Then his friend literally told me “this isn’t the first time he beat me up” LOL WTF. These dudes where in their 30s and I felt like I was acting like their damn fathers. Shits sad.

Anyways. I was telling my mom about it all and she was saying I should press charges. Is there any point in that?

God damn that shit was so annoying that 1) I could l not really do anything. And 2) They literally let that happen.

They were saying that he goes there often and gets drunk but never gets that bad so they didn’t really think he was going to act like that. I guess that’s why they didn’t do anything really.

To explain a few situations, just a few hours ago my mom was nagging me and i used the excuse that i was tired (and i was/am) because in PE we did  2 hours of non-stop running round a basketball court and given that i woke up at 5 20AM that morning i was far too tired to do anything by the time i got home (5pm) an dmy mom was trying to say that its not so bad and i got pissed off so bad but -despite knowing what i wanted to say- i broke down completely and started having a loud tantrum into my pillow and i just cant talk about anything related to my feelings with anyone.

783,"I DEMAND ANSWERS  
I am the Power! I am the Civilian! And I use it to protest against lies and silence. With all of You, in unity.  
Leaders say democracy, I say dead man's order. They say People have the Power. I say they are trying to take it away.  Leaders say democracy, at the same time calling us stupid and doing whatever to keep their butts warm and high salaries rolling in - lying, manipulating, using and killing us however it suits them. THEM! Not us, the People!  
""I hope I have your vote on election day.""  
""And why exactly should I vote for you?""  
""Well because I am a hard worker. I take a stand!""  
""On what exactly?""  
""The issues of today.""  
""Which are?""  
""The things that concern you and your family. The most!""  
 \-from ""Frasier""  
""Wise men speak because they have something to say, fools because they have to say something.""  
  \-Plato  
They are clever, I'll give them that. They have trapped us behind voting and petitions. We can start a petition, but where does it usually go? ""We'll look into it.""  Pff! Politicians' statements usually contain zero information.  We can vote for one scumbag or another. Not what to do with this world. Not how to pursue the future. We have given our hope to them and they have manipulated us into believing that this is the best way. It is an old way. It is an OUTDATED way! I am tired of this fake illusionary hope, empty promises and outdated politics.  
There is one thing I am not tired of. I am not tired of believing that the Mass has the Power. That People have massive Power in global unity, like never seen before. A Power that has not been possible to use before the age of technology. But now we are here. In an age where it is possible to connect billions of People fast through the Internet.  And it's basically free.  
So my idea is to bring us all together. My goal is to get at least 1 billion people to join this group. Hopefully, soon I can say OUR goal. At first, reach everyone who uses Facebook. By lates statistics, there are 2.41 billion active monthly users worldwide as of June 2019. And we only need less than half. We'll be forever in history books for sure and probably break some Guinness records. So we'll have the Power to demand all the answers that People so far could only dream about.  
I hope you will help me to develop this group. Spend a few seconds to push ""Join Group"" and ""Share Post"". We will figure out together all the questions and follow up questions to their usual bullshit answers. And ways how we can heavily confront politicians to give us facts. We are not going to vote which ""leader"" should lead. We'll put up a poll to vote which answers should we demand. Not guided by news agencies or politicians. Guided by Us. The real Power. The People!  
First question: Why politicians never ask people if they want their country to go into war or not?  
Good luck Mr System.

She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

796,"I’m a cosmotology/hair dressing student. I’ve been attending for about a month and a half, before I got in a car wreck.

I could do 8 hour days in the salon like nothing. I wasn’t taking any breaks, barely my lunch break if I remembered, and I was really efficient.

Then, I got into a car accident. I was going across a bridge off an exit from the highway. Another vehicle was at a stop sign opposite from where I got off. I was already on the bridge at this point, they didn’t see me, and pulled out in front of me. I t-boned them, flipping their car, and totaling mine in the process. Initial injuries weren’t really obvious, everyone walked away from the wreck. 

Later that night I went to the ER as the pain started increasing, they gave me pain killers and muscle relaxers, but found no whiplash or any internal injuries. I could barely stand and/or turn my neck without pain. I had to wait a week to see a chiropractor, and they point out everything wrong. Slight pelvic tilt, overworked muscles, underworked muscles, etc etc. He specified in my upper back area that I had a lot of damage. 

I see the chiropractor regularly for about 3 weeks (I’m out of school for a month by now) and they give me a note to go back with 5 hour work restriction and breaks as needed. I return and work 4 days on this restriction, but I feel guilty as I’m getting behind on my program (it’s hour based, anything beyond the contracted term is subjected to out of pocket, etc). The next week, another instructor is under the impression that I’m okay to work 40 hours... so I attempt to do that. I had some external issues unrelated to school that saved me from trying to do a 40 hour week, but I let my doctor know. He adjusted my schedule to 4 hours of doll head requirements, and 4 hours of clientele work. That works fine in theory, until I’m having to wrap a perm during my designated 4 hours of doll head time (sitting posture).

As far as transportation goes, I have a “new” vehicle that requires me to make payments on, so I get a part time job. With the way my schedule is, I work 7 days a week. This job is not labor intensive, but does add onto any aches or pains I feel from school. 

Bottomline, I don’t feel like my school sees me as an individual, only as someone to clock in and out and make them money. They have danced around my multiple doctors notes, and I feel really weak to say no to their requests. I want to get up to par, but I don’t know how. This week I’ve had to cancel my doctors appointments and I called out of school today. I feel like with what I have going on now, I’m only falling behind in all aspects of my life - health especially.

My mother cosigned my school loan, so she doesn’t support me taking less hours or days off... says in the real world people are working 40 hour weeks, while ignoring the fact I’m trying to work more than that. 

My husband doesn’t help me around the house (he works 5a-1:30p, 5 days a week) when he’s out doing other things, and deflects my aches and pains to his. I make a statement, and suddenly he’s been hurting 10 years longer than I have. Exaggerated, but nonetheless what happens. I feel like we’re roommates. I feel alone.

Regardless, I think I should take a couple months off from school, work with my physical therapist, work out at the gym, and pull more (normal) shifts at my part time to at least earn more money for the time being. Should I do what I want, or is there value to sticking to what I’ve got going on now? Any input is appreciated. Thank you for your time!",08Oct2019,1
797,"I (23F) am slated to meet my partner’s (26F) parents for the first time next week. My partner is having an office wide celebration for a huge project they’ve been working on and have finally completed. My partner, one of the primary leaders of this project, has actually been working about 100+ miles out of our town on this for the past 3 months. The company has encouraged the project members to invite family and friends to celebrate. This is where things got tricky for my partner.

She invited me to drive up to attend and invited her parents as well. Her relationship with her parents is fantastic outside of the topic of her sexuality. She came out to them about 6 years ago, but they essentially swept it under the rug and asked her to avoid discussing it. She’s had a number of relationships in that time, but didn’t feel like they were worth the big leap of bringing a romantic partner to meet the ‘rents. 

She’s long-since met my entire family, but up until last week her parents had no clue that I even existed. 

Aside from the amount of pressure I imagine she’s experiencing, this has been a serious source of stress for me for several reasons:

- I’m now realizing she deems me worthy enough to meet her parents (oof, butterflies!)

-While I’ve met the parents of previous girlfriends before, none of them were homophobic

-Meeting them comes with a ‘dress code’ of sorts (Her mother doesn’t like leggings but that’s 90% of my bottoms, the other 10% being ripped booty shorts or unflattering business-formal work pants)

-How do I console my panicking partner about the meeting when I, myself, am internally freaking out? 

-She’ll be presenting or mingling with her associates during most of the event, how do I even interact with her parents?

-I’ve already been warned that any form of PDA won’t be happening, which I completely understand but desperately hope I won’t slip up.

I asked Chloe about it and apparently it's an ex boyfriend of hers from like 2 years ago who never accepted her leaving him. It's not that I'm scared to fight him at all but when I moved here I told myself I wouldn't make the same mistake I'd previously made. I basically became a pacifist.

801,"Lately over the past month or so my ex and I have been in contact, just to see how each other are doing. We've had a few phone calls that went like ""I miss you so much and being in your bed all day watching movies when it was cold"" even though she's been talking to a guy. I feel myself wanting to take her back, but I know she isn't trying to hint that she wants to be back together. The other day I decided to hang out with her to catch up with her in person ever since I broke up with her, and I asked her about any drama and made me feel uncomfortable hearing about all the guys she'd mention except for the guy she's talking to. I haven't been responding to any messages since I saw her the other day and she seems upset about it and I know if I completely stop talking to her she would be really upset but I don't know what's best for me. ):

802,"My (M18) girlfriend (F17) broke up with me last week on Thursday. We were together for 11 months so I'm pretty bummed out about it. 

Basically my story is we got together early in my senior year of high school, when she was a juinior, and we really got along and all of that. We originally planned to stay together after I left for college and she was doing senior year of hs. But I ended up deferring a semester for personal reasons so I was home and we were together in town and relationship. But now she just broke up with me and I'm stuck in this town alone because all of my other friends are in college and I'm pretty uncomfortable staying friends with her like she would like to.

So basically after all that (most likely uneccasry background) how much time would it be okay to look to start casually going on dates again? I'm not looking for any relationship but a small hookup here and date there would be something I'd definitely be interested in. Would it be wrong to say start like next week seeing what I can do?
As I said I'm super lonely here and am looking to fill my time before I leave in the winter for college.

805,"I've never done this. I'm not sure I will find help here ; maybe I just want to cry it out in a post.   
I am (24,F) a person of very few friendships. It never used to bother me, tho. I do not ever remember thinking about being lonely and lacking people who I feel I could lean on previously in my life. I've never been a popular kid and was even heavily bullied younger, but that never prevented me from meeting new people and forming solid bonds.   
The people that I meet are the wonders of my world. My friends, family, my boyfriend, they are everything to me and while I know a part of what I am saying is not healthy, they give a sense to my life and being present for them in the ugly and the beauty gives me a sense of purpose. Being there is, I guess, important to me. It might be for selfish reasons, since caring for them brings me happiness on its own.  


Why then, why am I so affected when some of the people I consider as best friends, people I've welcomed into my home, went through hell and back with them while they were stuck in an abusive relationship they could not escape. Why am I so upset when people can't be present for me the same way I am for them ? I just seem like I'm only reliable on when people need a shoulder to cry on, but as soon as the rain stops pouring on their end they vanish. And if I want anything back, I need to pull up my sleeve and go get them myself. Because they wont. I always have to be the one caring more, and it's slowly sucking the life out of me. My boyfriend tells me that I should either '' be better without them '' or '' stop being sad about it and take the initiative to re-engage. '' While I get what he means and feel logical, it still hurts not to be valued equally by your inner circle, and I don't know how to cope with this anymore?

806,"This has been eating me up from the inside for a year and I need an outside opinion that isn’t my sisters. 

It will also take a lot of background information, so sorry for the rather long post. 

I’m British, so I went to secondary school (year 7-11, I didn’t do sixth form) and from the Star I was friends with someone I had sort of know that we’ll call A. We became close and I was happy to have a proper friend, I didn’t have the best track record and that had left me with a few issues. 

Soon, A invited other people to our group. I didn’t mind but I quickly figured out I didn’t like big groups that much. There were (I’m pretty sure) 9 of us at the start, including myself. One dropped out of school and has no real ties to the story, though, so he won’t be mentioned past now. 

One of the girls that was never properly in the group had a sexually abusing ex that went to our school and that I never really saw, since he stayed a large distance from us. 

The first big bit of drama which really affected the group that I know of when E (for the girls ex) started dating B, the girls best friend and a member of the group. The girl got pissed, punched E, and I was the one to drag her away before she could finish her attacks. If I hadn’t, I’m pretty sure an ambulance would of been called, and that’s no exaggeration. Trust me. I also remember a couple in the group laughing in the background when E got attacked, though i didn’t understand why for years. 

The girl cut off ties with B but still talked to a few people in the group. After a while, I talked more with her since I did my best to be friends with everyone I could. I sent her a small rant, swearing once and not as an insult, saying me and a mutual friend we had were tired of being between her and B’s fight and that they needed to stop arguing and stop acting like five year olds (it was getting ridiculous). I know that was a terrible thing, looking back, and I shouldn’t of said anything. She sent a few pages back insulting me, saying I didn’t know what was happening so I should just shut up and then blocked me. 

When this was happening, I broke down in tears and it took a month or two to get a friend to make her talk to me so I could apologize. It took a while for her to even want to look at me after that. 

Suddenly, the group split in two. B, E, another girl, a guy and me on one side, the couple, the other guy and the girl from the beginning on the other (though not immediately). 

I was told the guy in the couple had overreacted at one of E’s jokes (E liked to think he was a class clown and was mildly autistic so didn’t always know when to stop) and tore the group apart. 

I stayed with that half, but I saw a few red flags (and I’m oblivious to most things). A and B were gossiping about C, the other girl in our smaller group. They were judging her for taking her first relationship too fast, when in fact her SO at the time was forcing her into some stuff. Instead of trying to help her, they gossiped about her behind her back and tried to get me involved- which I never did since I felt bad for C. 

When C was in her second relationship, she mysteriously left the group and I was never given a reason as to why. 

I used to, and still do, write stories on Wattpad. I shared this with A, since I trusted her, she created an account and supported me. However, she brought it up on her phone when the group was out eating and everyone but the one guy teased me for it. This only deepened my already existing trust issues, I permanently deleted that book and unpublished everything for a while, terrified of if it would be brought up again.

I’m sure I’m missing stuff, but that’s a vague outline of some of the stuff. 

After a while, I asked the other group about some stuff that had happened. 

Here’s where things started to make ‘sense’. 

I talked with the other group. It turns out, E and B were lying to me for years. The group didn’t split because of a joke gone wrong, E was harassing the girl in the couple, the guy got pissed when B did nothing to stop it, things went sideways, and the other half walked away. 

C was kicked out of the group by B, who had no right to, purely because B didn’t like who C was dating. B sent emotionally abusive texts, one I remember being “it’s been so hard being your friend for the last three years, you’re so difficult”. That was a tamer one and roughly what it said. 

A had been talking to the other group, relaying what she could to E and B to make rumors. I once helped one of the girls when they threw up in school because of their period. They tried to claim it was because she was pregnant. 

E and B were saying one of the guys was ‘hurting himself on purpose’, to put it lightly. Not true and if it was, how would that help? They were clearly doing it with malice. 

E was abusing B like he had to the girl before. Both families brushed it off when he assaulted her, she pushed anyone away that offered help and tried to ruin their lives. 

Shit like that went down, I left the group, E, B and A followed me for two days at school after I did. 

I found out more of the ‘truth’. The thing is, the other group isn’t that great either. They are quite toxic, since they al literally became friends because of their shared hatred for mutual ex-friends. The relationships aren’t healthy, they’ve teased me too. 

I started eating a lot from stress, it didn’t help exams were around that time. I put on a bit of weight, causing more issues which the group only worsened with a bit more teasing, and I really hate my body up until now. I still eat when I get stressed and it’s just a bad cycle, since the extra food makes me feel worse. 

I no longer believe anything either side has to say. I can’t trust their side and I struggle to trust most people now, even family members. 

On my Insta story I reposted a comic about my brain making me think of past mistakes, just something comedic. One of the guys sent it to the group chat, calling me out, saying I have no right to complain since my life is perfect, I don’t have it as bad as them (which is true) and basically told me to stop whining. After that to now, I don’t repost stuff like that anymore. 

I had a breakdown earlier this year (I should add most of this happened at the start of this year, close to a family members death) to my sister at night in the middle of it all. 

I’m trying to leave the other group. I’ve stopped talking to the group chat, I’m lying when they ask me to hang out, saying I’m really busy, and trying to move on. 

There are two things I feel like an ass for (not including the thing where I messaged the girl earlier, we had mostly worked through that). The guy in the first group that didn’t tease me when it came to my story has no idea what’s going on. I can message him, he hasn’t blocked me and we’ve stayed civil towards each other. If I were to, he’d ask E and B, they’d lie, and the other group are refusing to talk to him no matter what because they hate everyone in that group. 

Also, C. I don’t want her to go through another toxic group. She’s really sweet, caring and really deserves the best after the shit she’s been left with from B and her exes. 

There’s also the fact I’m not being honest with the group that I want to leave. I’m partly scared, since two of them have hunting guns, know where I live, and all have a history of violence (one has literally had the cops called on her twice for serious assault). And my sister told me being blunt will make it worse. I also don’t want to be blocked by them, because I do still care. 

Am an asshole for not helping my friends? Should I tell the group I want to leave instead of pretending I don’t? Should I try and tell that everyone’s lying to the guy, even though I don’t know the whole truth myself?

Doesn’t help that I have to see A soon since we’re both working for the same qualification and therefore need to discuss it with our ‘boss’. I’m going to be civil with her, I won’t start arguments, and if she tries to do anything I’ll ignore it. 

I really need to figure out what to do since I’m clueless.",08Oct2019,1

808,"Apologies for the length of this.

I'm (m) 30 and my wife of 7 years is 39. We have a 2 year old son who is the best thing in both our worlds. We've had ups and downs but have always been able to communicate through them until recently. 

I do almost 100% of cooking and cleaning in the evenings after work. The only chore she really has to do is laundry which I am finding I have to do more of myself to make sure me and my son have clothes to wear. Whenever I bring it up she starts on a rant about me not doing that much and that she does plenty. She even brings up my flaws and downfalls to family and friends to try and bring me down. She does look after our son and I respect that it is hard to get things done with a 2 year old around, but I managed to do a lot of chores and entertain him when I had him to myself in weekends.

We hardly talk. She spends 90% of time staring at her phone and there has been several occasions where I have tried to engage her but got zero response. In the evenings after our son is asleep she will usually take herself to bed and leave me to my own devices, most of the time she falls asleep with our son so I end up sleeping alone. And thus our sex life sucks.

With a big birthday coming up for her I am trying to do something nice and special with her. I offered her a few night spa break to which she replied ""we don't have the money and I don't know who I could go with"". Anything I try to tell her that I think is cause to be excited about I only get a stream of negativity and comments like I have not thought everything through. This makes me feel like I am fighting a losing battle.

Work. I'm very lucky that I have a good business that is doing well and growing. I get a lot of perks but I have been putting in the hours since I was 18 and continue to do so. She works 3 days a week for me but gets paid a good rate so she doesn't need to work a full 5 days and can look after our son. However I constantly get back chat and attitude from her as well as her sitting around on her phone in front of other employees. This is a problem as you can understand. 

I know I'm not perfect but I try and do everything I can to make sure she has everything looked after and our boy is happy. But I am starting to think maybe we would be better co parents before our relationship becomes toxic.

She is a bit older than me but the way she goes on about being tired or sick or aching she acts like someone twice her age. Whenever I suggest getting some if her issues looked at or taken care of there is always an excuse not to. Again making me feel like I am fighting a losing battle.

So I guess my question is this. Am I in a marriage that is doomed to fail? What more could I do to improve things? Am I the problem?

811,"I am a college student but not in the USA. Lets say where I am from college is pretty much like school. We have our section of about 50 people and we stay together through the whole degree. So we all have same clasess and hence most close friendships are made within the section/class.
Anyways in freshman year I had pretty good friends and a small group. In second year we all choose our major and hence I got separated from all my friends. Now I am a pretty friendly person but I am shy in initiating conversation/friendships. A lot of people already had close friendship groups when they came in second year. However the first day in second year somehow I got to talk to this girl (A). For context im also a girl. Anyway A is super serious quiet etc. But I think its okay we both will make a nice group of friends together.
However A turned out to be a total control freak weirdo. Turns out she talks constantly, tell stories im not interested in . She doesn't know how to make conversation that is not about studies, so naturally she repelled any potential friends we could make. A has super conservative controlling parents that I really want to kill. A saves seats for me for every lecture and lingers with me in every break so I end up spending all my breaks with her. When I would try to make friends or be part of a group she does uncomfortable things that I back off myself. 
Now here is the crazy thing I let this all continue for 2 years. I just hate spending time with her. As a result I have no social life and very few casual friends besides A. Basically I just always felt bad whenever I thought about leaving A because she has zero friends and no potential to make any. Also she confided her personal issue with ne which are the cause for her behaviour (her toxic parents). Although I don't blame her 100% I know I have been avoiding confrontation myself. 
Now we are in final year of bachelor's. I want advice about what I should do. Should I just let it be because im graduating in coming May anyway. Should I straight away tell her I don't want to spend any time with her, would I be a bad person to do this?

For example: On the test she mentions spill mix. We didn't talk about that at all and the textbook doesn't either. The websites she gave us were irrelevant and did not mention anything at all. If we searched it up ourselves not using HER resources she gets angry.

817,"I work at a professional firm with about 50 employees and 6 locations. When I was hired in 5 years ago - we were 2 locations and less than 15 people. Since then I have obtained my professional license, excelled at my area of work, and been promoted quite swiftly. I have a very good relationship with the owners. I have never felt that I couldn't call to discuss absolutely anything and have done so when necessary. I feel that there has been a very healthy mutual respect between myself and the owner(s). 

The manager of this office is retiring (Manager R) next week. We've known this since her merging 2.5 years ago. We hired employees to take her place in January. Since my field of specialty within this industry is not general I have had very little to do with her work and the day to day. Another manager in a separate location (Manager A) was assigned to transition the clients since it is her expertise is general. Meetings started in Feb/March. Manager A had/has leeway to do whatever was/is necessary. Manager A never followed through with any of the plans of action. She said it was because Manager R was pushing back. ...and to be fair - she did a little. She's old school, and our industry and documentation needs have changed quite a bit since Manager R began. However, Manager A said she could and would...at a certain point...you stop caring if someone doesn't like your necessary methods. You just do it. 

Meanwhile - during the past 9 months - Manager A has been essentially talking trash about multiple employees, other office locations,  and Manager R.  She speaks such a motherly, calm, and rational sounding voice that you actually *believe* her! I know this from first hand experience from my first year here...and then seeing the truth in my second and third years at other locations/out in the field. Now...It just is what it is. She's over 50. There's no changing her ways. I accepted how she is long ago. However...

This caused multiple employees to quit or move to other offices specifically citing Manager A's talking trash and creating a toxic atmosphere. Everyone acknowledges it is a multi-faceted situation - but one even said she would come back if we ever replaced Manager A. The owners (and obv. Manager A) are just sticking with blaming Manager R for everything. Manager A faces zero consequences for her involvement in the situation even after people, including myself, went to the owners about it. I suspect this is because Manager A is very inconvenient to replace - not because she's exceptional, but because of the volume of clients in that office she is in charge of.

Now, they're going to close my location. It sucks, but I'm on the road and can work from anywhere. I'll have a nice office in Manager A's location. I've accepted that fate. Especially with the knowledge that I'm also a manager in a different field - Manager A will have little, if any, authority over me, my schedule, my workload, etc. She actually didn't even have any say in which office I will have. 

I've known for over a month that they were going to close my location and move me to the nearest office 20 minutes away - but it has been unofficial. They have not told Manager R (who is trying to make sure her clients are prepared for her retirement). I just got the email today that the two owners, Manager A, and I will have a conference call on Friday to discuss ""moving on"". 

I'm usually involved in more than I expect to be involved in with the owners and other Managers in the firm. However, this time...I have nothing to add to the conversation. The entire situation has led me to lose what little respect I had for Manager A and a tremendous amount of respect for the primary owner. I think they are both cowards and unable to enforce the hard decisions until there are zero options left. I'm not saying it's pleasant or would have been graceful....but it has been a shit show for 9 months. 

He's going to ask me what I think. He always does. I am a shit liar...and honestly too angry about how far they have let this situation go. I feel that I am betraying Manager R by not telling her that they are closing the location. I know I can't say that ""I don't have anything positive to add to the discussion."" I also know that the tone of my voice will give me away since it's usually a pretty chipper, can-do attitude voice. 

How do I remain respectful, true to my feelings, yet diplomatic on this conversation. If I just find the right combination of words...I will mean it, and it will not be a lie. I also do not want to simply agree to things if I do not agree to them. Any suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Professional office, toxic atmosphere, lost respect for primary owner due to inability to resolve situations in a mature, professional manner. Said situations are resulting in a closure of an office. Retiring manager of closing office does not know this after making plans to satisfy clients going forward.

820,"If anyone has any tips on how to play this I'd love the hear them.

My work is very busy at the moment. However, we spend more time as a team talking about the work than doing it. Manager seems to only really delegate and focus on ""strategy"". Next most senior seems to make diagrams. I therefore end up doing a lot of the actual nitty gritty tasks and work that needs to get done, leaving me overwhelmed with all the work I identify needs to be done and doing it. I don't mind the tasks even though some are admin heavy, as someone needs to do them, but I would much rather if this were shared. In previous jobs I have also done ""strategy"" and I am more than competent enough to sit there and draw diagrams and discuss plans of action and create new and improved templates. 

Many problems we have first identified, then identified that they need solving, then discussed that they need solving. Weeks later, the problem remains because no one has actually *done* anything. 

Because strategy and delegating is associated with being more senior, I therefore also feel strangely like I am going backwards in my career by being the one doing so much nitty gritty work while other people look at me expectantly.

Add to this that I see a few teammates who are very relaxed and work very slowly. They seemingly are always busy with their work (which means turning their computer screens away, leaning back and being on their phones etc.)... so it's hard to imagine they're really overloaded. But apparently work can't be delegated to them because they're not competent enough to handle the work (even when it's admin!).

Please advise how I should play this. I have considered so far:

1. Working really slowly as well. The work will suffer, but perhaps I will be less stressed.
2. Dropping the ball continuously, which doesn't seem like a good idea.
3. Talk to my manager, which I have with no clear solution.

I love music but barely started playing guitar a year ago. I want to start a business but have no money or resources. Etc etc I feel like I’m doomed I don’t know what to do. I feel like I was put here to just carry out my life and then die,08Oct2019,0
822,"So there’s a pretty long and difficult to write out backstory behind my reason for this, but basically I have recently reconnected with my ex-step sister who I was very close with for many years until my mother divorced her SCUMBAG father, but that’s a whole other story. 

She and I have both matured a lot since we last saw each other for the better. While it’s been 6 years since we last saw each other, when we met again in person after her moving across the country closer to where I live, it felt like we had just seen each other recently and were laughing so hard we were crying. We have plans to visit each other again.

So that being said, I am getting married next spring and would truly like it for her to be there. Her brother (my ex-step brother) is not such a nice person and has done something in the past that is pretty unforgivable. While I haven’t talked to him really since the divorce, she is very close with her brother and thinks a lot of him and how far he’s come in the last several years.

Would I be an asshole to invite her and not her brother to my wedding? 

Part of me thinks it’s not my responsibility to put myself in his shoes and worry how I would feel in his place (him being the only sibling in our previously mixed family to not be invited). The other part of me thinks it might make it awkward by inviting her and not him. 

I guess I’d like to know if anyone else has been in a situation like this or if you have any advice to share! Thanks so much.

P.S. my mom would be okay with her coming as she still keeps in contact occasionally with my ex-step sister",08Oct2019,1
823,"My father grew up in poverty, with an emotionally abusive father. He (my father) seems to love wallowing in anything negative wether it be an ache/ pain or car braking down. I don’t know how to motivate him or take an initiative to fix an issue/ problem. He just says “I don’t care” and shrugs it off. It’s almost as if he doesn’t believe he deserves/needs anything of quality. I just want him happy, it’s effecting my mother’s happiness as well as mine.

826,"This is going to ve very long. I apologize in advance. 

I (20F) dated the same guy (now 23M) throughout all of middle school and high school and eventually got married to him right after graduation. Big mistake. Although our relationship worked in school, we hadn't had to face real life together yet and that completely destroyed us. We spent a year and a half trying to make it work. He never worked, he wouldn't pitch in on the income or even any household chores at all and when I tried to make him, he would scream at me, punch holes in the walls, and sometimes punch me so hard that bruises were left. There were countless holes in our apartment from him. I felt alone and hopeless, but I couldn't leave because I felt like I was stuck with him. I ended up moving with him to a city and becoming a stripper because that was the only way we were going to survive. All I asked was that he did the laundry, but he still couldn't even do that. It was like my own personal hell. 

It's worth mentioning that I've always struggled with severe anxiety, depression, and low self esteem. He made my depression and anxiety skyrocket. I thought about suicide all the time because I didn't see a way out. My self esteem was improving a lot though. Stripping as actually caused me to feel more empowered, helped me realize that I am attractive, and helped me lose weight (I was never fat, I had just gained an extra 30 pounds after high school). I even started working seriously toward my dream of being an actor. While my relationship was awful, I was growing into myself.

This guy (19M) kept coming into the club to see me. He would come every day that I worked and spend money only on me. His friends said that the first time he saw me he said I was his dream girl. This went on for months with me telling him I could only see him there, but eventually I fell for him and I went over to his house. We got drunk and slept together, but it was more than that. We had fun together. More fun than I had had in a very, very long time. I felt something for him I never felt for my husband. I wasn't sure what to do about it, but it helped me realize that there is happiness out there and I shouldn't settle. I know cheating is awful, but no one is perfect. I told my husband about it and told him I wanted a divorce. It broke his heart because, despite how awful he could be, he did love me. Plus, this meant he would have to go back to living with his parents. He was willing to forgive and forget the cheating, but I didn't want to be with him anymore.

I gave my then husband 2 weeks to move out and during that time this new guy offered to let me stay with him. I guess I noticed red flags early on because if how attached he was getting so fast. He doesn't drink normally, but at first he was so nervous around me that he had to be drunk to even talk to me. So, he would get drunk and tell me how in love he was, how he never wanted to lose me, and how he wanted to marry me. I fell for him fast too, though. He was amazing. He did so much for me, took me out on nice dates, and truly cared about me. I'd never had that before.

I ended up moving in permanently when it was only supposed to be for a few weeks because, well, we enjoyed being together so much. Things were almost perfect for the first little bit, but then he started becoming incredibly jealous and demanding. He made me quit my job, which is somewhat understandable, but he would also always taunt me over it and act like it was some horrible thing I did and I should be so ashamed of it. He also got angry over every single outfit i wore. I've never dressed like a slut, just a normal girl my age, but he had a problem with shorts, crop tops, tied up tshirts, short skirts, sleeveless shirts, and sometimes even just tight shirts. It made me feel so degraded. I tried to reason with him, but it pissed me off so badly. I also didn't have enough money for acting classes or time for acting because I was no longer stripping. He didn't want me to act anyway because he was too jealous of me having a love interest. Every day was a fight, mostly because he was so jealous. My self esteem was so low and I felt like I was completely losing myself and everything I stood for. 

I finally left after about 5 months. I packed up all of my stuff while he was at work, blocked him on everything, and went to my mom's house 4 hours away. He found a way to contact me anyway and sent me so many messages. Countless paragraphs apologizing. He was begging me to give him another chance, but I said no.

He ended up driving all the way to my mom's house and lining up presents for me in her driveway. He told me that he understood what he did wrong and explained that he only acted that way because he thought if he didn't I would think he didn't care the same way my ex husband didnt. He also admitted to having low self esteem and thinking that I was way out of his league and that scared him. He said I was the most important thing in his life and he knew how awful he had been, but he loved me so much. 

I explained that he would have to understand that I dress normally and not get upset over anything like that anymore. I also explained that I was going to start stripping again because it's the only way I can have enough money and time to pursue my acting dreams. He wasn't happy about the stripping, but he understood why. He even said we could start saving to move to LA like I've always wanted. 

That happened about 3 months ago and since then things have been..rocky. He doesn't get upset over outfits anymore and my job doesn't start a fight all the time, but sometimes with acting stuff he has to be reassured for a long time that fake kisses mean nothing. He says he has trouble trusting me because of the way I left him, but he says he's trying. He has lower self esteem than even I have, and I've realized that lately because he's been more open with me about it. He hates himself and is afraid I'll find someone better while acting.

My anxiety and depression are acting up really bad and that causes me to behave quite horribly. Sometimes I scream at him and it's hard for me to let things go because my brain keeps thinking of it over and over again. He doesn't understand anxiety or depression or how to be with someone who has it.

Besides that, we barely have time for each other anymore. He works 60 hours a week and lately has had to stay out of town in a hotel for it all week, I work all weekend, and sometimes I film through the week and weekend too. He gets mad when I have to film during the only time we have off together and that makes me very upset because I want him to.just be happy for me. We haven't spent much time together in about a month though, so I get it. He thinks I'm placing acting above him, but that isn't the case. I just really want this.

He says things he doesn't mean a lot. Like, earlier he got mad at me over being busy this weekend when hes home and I said that he was only over reacting because he's stressed from working so hard and I understand that and he replied with ""yeah, maybe you should try it sometime."" And the other day we were fighting and my depression just kind of got the best of me and I broke down crying and said I needed him and he said ""well too bad, need someone else."" And later that day I said I felt broken and he said that I shouldn't have been immature enough to get into a relationship if I'm broken. 

On the upside, when we do have time together it's usually amazing. He listens a lot more now and talks out problems more. He even told me yesterday how proud he is of me and how he loves that my acting career is going so well. He even apologized for all of the things he says that he doesn't mean, and apologizing is very hard for him. He has even given me a car. Last week he spent the only day he had off of work moving things out of my old apartment for me. And he's always driving me places if I don't feel like driving. He does everything for me.

I'm not sure what to do. I'm thinking maybe if instead of working every weekend I work every other weekend and then on the other two weeks I'll work through the week a little. It'll be less money, but at least we'll have time together and I just really want to fix this. Please help. I love him. 

Tldr: My relationship with my boyfriend has gotten so unhealthy and hostile and I just want to fix it.",08Oct2019,2
827,"Story time: After 7th grade, I switched to an online school, where I was able to work at my own pace, and I ended up getting to more advanced subjects quicker. However, it completely killed my social life. I went literal months at a time without having a real conversation. I don't even remember the last time I spoke to a girl I liked. This trend continued into high school, and now I'm in Junior year. I'm dual-enrolled at the local community college, and I'm taking the most advanced courses they're allowed to give me my first term.

The thing that's been driving me is the idea of excelling, and doing crazy complicated things with ease. I'm not trying to sound like a genius or anything- I'm not- I just like doing things that other people think they can't. I've peeked ahead at the stuff that the community college has in store, for math in particular, since the math book they had me purchase includes every math level that they offer, and it all looks simple. Pointless even. Even the most advanced courses. I've lost interest, and I'm starting to have regrets. I've realized that I was literally just there for the thrill of excelling. Additionally, I'm starting to flesh out my career plan, and it might not even involve college at all, but I'm not sure yet.

In total, if I went to the community college in dual-enrollment over the next 2 years, I'd get about $6,500 worth of college credit for free, since my high school is paying for it. However, I'm taking classes with people who are at least 6 years older than me. I can't relate to their lives at all, with their cars and their jobs and fiancés, and my social life is still stagnant. I'm starting to really miss being able to interact with people my age. I see my old middle-school classmates occasionally, and they always welcome me with open arms (literally), but only a couple times per year, and only for like 20 minutes each time. I've also come to discover that the friends I've made in middle school are really only good to talk to in passing. If I invite them over, we'll spend like 5 minutes catching up, and then spend the next few hours pretending we're having fun playing Smash Bros Ultimate.

In summary: College is feeling pointless, and I don't feel any real reason to be there. High school is looking sweet, but I'll miss out on $6,500 worth of free college credits, and I'll be set back a potential 1.5 years in college by the time I graduate.

I'm not stuck or anything: My parents have been very clear that my choice of school is mine to make. However, I have no idea what to do. Are the free college courses really so good that I shouldn't pass them up? I feel like this is a decision where I'll regret taking either option.",08Oct2019,12
828,"I want to be in a (homo) relationship with my best friend. 

I'm really close with him and his family. His mum and I have had wine together. His dad and I play video games all the time. His little brother, Josh, adores me. (In a ""he's only a child and I'm like his older cousin"" type way. He looks up to me). His sister, Izzy, and I are less close but, she tolerates me.

 I went to his family dinner and he held my hand. He treated me like an SO. He hugged me. He let me lean my head on him. We held hands under the table. It was all so amazing but, mixed signals. 

He and my family are less close, however.

I don't want to lose him. He sometimes it's flirty to me but I think he sees it as banter. If I confess he'll ""run for the hills"".

831,"Hey everyone! 

Been seriously struggling. My future wife and I want a small intimate wedding ceremony and have been pushing for this, but my parents have been real difficult. Kept asserting to the fact of “what are we going to tell the family” (I come from a very large family- 85 ppl just on my side) if we wanted to do the traditional wedding it would cost us a minimum of $70,000 that’s on a budget... Mind you, my parents wouldn’t be helping financially. They aren’t in a any position to help. In fact, I help them every month. 

Both my fiancé and I, think spending that kind of cash for one night is ludicrous. We decided instead of spending that kind of money, to save it and put it towards our future.  Finally finally my parents got on board. Specifically my mom. This has been the hardest thing. I’m just happy finally. 

For background, I come from a first gen immigrant family (Middle East) and these glam weddings are expected. 

My advice is to stand your ground no matter how hard and don’t succumb to pressure. You do what is right for you and your future. Don’t let “expectations” run the show. :)",08Oct2019,1
833,"I been working retail for 5 years in different stores as I always worked seasonal, this job that I have is permanent position. I been here for a year and hate how the store manager wants me to work.

He wants you to be really pushy with costumers. I generally go to the costumer, offer them help (explaining promotions, giving them ideas). If the costumer says ""they are fine after that or that they are just browing"" is a red flag to leave them alone, then I would come back later and ask them if they doing okay. That's it.

My manager wants me to keep being on them, even if they tell me they just browsing, if I dont do it he is like ""go help your costumer"", I tell him I already did, he also wants you to be talkative like ask them stuff to them, but I can tell sometimes costumer want to be left alone, but he insists to be on them.

You think he is right on that? This is legit the only store that i have to deal with this working there.

834,"I’m not sure when this started but I would guess about 3 years ago. I used to not be that conscious when it comes to dirt and germs, although there were times before when I would be really sensitive to some stuff and wouldn’t touch some things like when they’re wet or just smelt weird or some other reason, but didn’t act on it as much as I do now. Now I’m wary to touch some things but I still do, but then I’d feel a bit uneasy and would have to wash my hands. At night I would probably wash my hands 8-10x. I’d also start to think about how much germs some items might contain and also I really don’t like things that are frequently touched by other people. My mom and sister have started to notice and calling me out on the hand washing.

I don’t think it’s OCD, because I’m not that squeaky clean on my things and surroundings. But more on the things my hands come in contact with. And also I’m still able to function normally and do everything always. But how can I get past this? Is this just a phase and have anyone of you also had this?",08Oct2019,1
835,"I don’t know what my problem is lately. I think I am just stressed and burnt out and depressed. I don’t even know where to start. I worry by throwing all this out there I will just seem like a millennial brat or something. 

Relationship and living situation: Right now I live with my boyfriend renting a two family flat in a  midwestern US city. We have four cats and a dog that I adore. Our relationship is good in some ways however our issues in my eyes are that I don’t feel a spiritual deep connection or understanding with him like I would like to, he has a few addictions like porn and weed, sometimes I feel like I want him to be different than he feels he is like I don’t want him to dye his hair crazy colors or wear kilts or other different fashion, and he is mostly interested in television, celebrity actors, and games while I could care less; I spend my free time on going to yoga, doing chores, maybe watching a show, seeing my friend, hiking. He does run a lot and is struggling to find things to do in his free time. He can also be kind of lazy and messy and I take control of all the cleaning, bill paying, meal planning etc. He is a cook and went to school for it but doesn’t seem to really have a passion for it. I think I expect too much however as I feel I want a soul connection with a man but I don’t think I’ll actually find that.

Work: I work a bit more than full time in customer service in the automotive industry 8-5 weekdays, mainly I take about 30 calls a day and process orders etc. I have been here three years. Before this I worked in food service. They like me here and told me they consider me management material possibly and are gearing me in that direction. However I don’t really want the job, though I thought I might a while ago. Customer service is irritating and lately I have been so irritable at work. I hate answering calls with the same questions all the time. I hate working inside all day in some ways, I don’t care about the auto industry, my coworkers are usually pretty sweet but I just feel so irritable with everything about work. 

School: I am also going to school four hours per week doing an accelerated degree program in corporate communications. I’ll be done by summer 2020. I forgot why I even started this program. I had an associates in general transfer studies and felt I needed to finish my bachelors and picked a program that sounded interesting. I do like the material. However my managers think I’m best in customer service and think marketing is not right for me, since I am shy and quiet and not charismatic. I don’t know what I’m going to do with my degree. 

Thoughts lately. This cluster in school I am studying native Americans for my electives. I am one eighth Native American approximately, one sixteenth from my mother and maybe the same from my father, he is unsure but I intend to research. My mother owns reservation land in Wisconsin. I have become fascinated learning more about the culture and find it so beautiful. I am sad we ever destroyed their culture. I love their spiritual ways of living, connection with the earth, community and family values, everything. I am probably romanticizing it all but I’ve just been researching and am sad I wasn’t born in a time where that kind of organic life was something I could live. I am an infp personality type and feel deeply unfulfilled loving this rat race materialistic lonely depressing boxes in life. I don’t think it is a personal problem but a societal problem. I have been dreaming of a life where I could live away from the city, not work my life away in an office, live in nature, but I bet it would be lonely. Idk, I’ve had thoughts like this before about wanting to escape the regular society, just fantasizing and I probably sound like a teenager right now. 

Health: I recently lost 65 lbs. through calorie counting and have about 15 more to go until I’ll be done I think, however progress has stalled. I am 136 lbs and 5’7.5”. I want to lose more but can’t get my eating under control. I think I have a freaking eating disorder. I’ve become ocd about counting calories, weighing food, constantly on my fitness pal. I go over calories and binge on fast food and have gained about 3 pounds. I was going to try to assume a deficit today but went way overboard at Starbucks and Dairy Queen. I talked to my friend and she suggested intuitive eating. My life was revolved around calorie counting however lately I’ve been obsessing over how society sucks and gave me this eating disorder, self esteem and body image issues. I know I should not blame.

Family background: I grew up living with my dad as my parents were divorced before my birth. My mom grew up in poverty, only got a fifth grade education, and is severely ill with schizophrenia though treated today, she is still on disability. My dad was distant and not usually kind, could be abusive. My stepmom moved in when I was four and was very different from my mother. My mother is very Christian and has strong values and values religion and cleanliness. My stepmom and dad were atheists, stepmom would yell at us all the time, didn’t really care about a clean house, we lived in chaos with over a dozen pets usually. I have two step sisters who are very different from me, they are loud and tough and I am quiet and introspective. I grew up I guess emotionally neglected and have always struggled with emotional, mental, and social health. I’ve seen counselors before.

Obviously my mental and emotional health are not in a good place. I don’t know what to do. I hate my job, I wish life was different, I want to have a meaningful life and want to feel spiritually fulfilled, I feel trapped. Any advice?",08Oct2019,1
836,"I'll admit I don't think I handled it that well. It was when we were just talking after school (but still inside the school) with others around but not in the conversation. We walked a little because I needed to get something from my locker and he normally drives me home after school.

&amp;#x200B;

After we began walking I could tell he was beginning to tear up and I think he might've apologized and told me he had been feeling stressed out. I tried to empathize with him a little and when it was silent for quite a few moments I decided to change the subject, thinking he might've felt embarrassed (especially since we've only been dating for 3 months) and would rather change the subject. After he gave a very non-committal response I apologized for not really taking the situation well.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't remember the conversation perfectly, but after that I asked him a bit more about what was stressing him out and if he was okay. We just had a three day weekend (Friday off) and he got the weekend totally free, which is rather rare. He's very busy with school, marching band, and work and hardly has any free time to himself. He told me he really realized this over the weekend how tired he's been and there's other school related stuff that went on recently which has him stressed.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I handled it poorly because I realized with my attempt at empathizing I related how I've recently been through a similar thing (so maybe I talked about myself too much) and I don't like to say a bunch of false words so I didn't really comfort him as much as I feel like I should've (false isn't necessarily the right word, but I feel like perhaps I didn't try to console him, especially since some of the things were just minor things that can be solved quickly, they had just begun to pile up). I obviously tried to help but can't help but feel I was lacking. We did end the conversation with a hug, and I told him I wouldn't let him leave without one. Hugs are normal for us anyway, and if I remember correctly he told me thank you when we hugged. As he left I said ""It'll be okay,"" which I kinda cringe at with how generic and stupid it sounds.

&amp;#x200B;

So what I'm wondering is what should I do now? I don't think I'll mention it unless he does, he also isn't the type to never cry in front of others as far as I can tell, we've kinda talked about it before. Basically, is there anything I should do or just not mention it? I obviously want to be supportive, but it's possible that my help, especially if done wrong, would be unwelcome. We may be hanging out tomorrow as he has a free day but we kinda just go with the flow so it's possible that we won't. Usually we just hang out at my house. We enjoy hiking, though, but it's also getting a bit colder now. So any recommendations for what to do tomorrow if we hang out?",08Oct2019,1

840," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

So on Monday, my workload is heavy. But this monday, it wasn't so bad. I skipped cleaning the bathrooms today. I haven't mopped the hallway in a while because employees walk through it while I'm mopping. And the place is barely in use by guest unless it's someones wedding day or someone is having a big event.

But I could really use any good advice. I'm desperate. 

Story is,that person is my boyfriend. We went to high school together, started hanging out as friends,after we started college we started dating as well. 
We had a great 2.5 years together. One of those perfect relationships. A person I thought I'd stay forever with. 

Well,this summer things got tough cuz we were busy with work and everything,we barely saw each other (we live separately with our parents), there was tension n many bickering. But we tried. 
Problem was he never knew how to talk. I tried n I tried fixing it but we never reached a conclusion. 
I didn't know he was troubled by many things,let alone depression. He didn't realize what he was doing and he only saw the bad things. 

Fast forward to September,he suddenly breaks up with me. Saying he's really not well n he needs time off to himself. I was a complete mess. We talked and decided to go on a break.  Then talk after few days or a week to rethink that decision maybe. It's been a month n he's still not ready to talk. Instead of getting better or clearing his head out ,as he said... He became more and more depressed. He doesn't care about anything or anyone or himself. He lives cuz he has to. And he has no will or wish to b better. He plans on letting the depression eat him up entirely. Refuses help or anything. 

Now me,who is his only friend n a person that cares also refuses to give up on him. But I don't know what to do. 
All this time I hoped that maybe we'll go back together,but now seeing how the condition is so bad. I just wish he allows me to b there for him. 
So I desperately ask for help. In case some of u here dealt with depressed people. As I have no experience except my own depressed episodes in life.

862,"-Tldr before the end questions-

I think this is a scenario which almost everyone in my generation has been through: I am sitting in front of my computer a lot, my parents obviously don't like that too much; this always causes tension between me and them over and over again. 

For context: I (m/17) am in my last year of school. Around spring 2020 there are going to be some final exams about the last two school years that are extremely important for the final grades. Until then, there are tests/exams basically throughout the whole first half of the school year. Learning for these tests stresses me out immensely.
Besides school, I play the violin (and some other instruments), and I just participated in a pretty stressful project learning a difficult piece (Beethoven Violin Concerto for anyone who is into the subject).
3 years ago we moved to another city and I had to change schools. I am not good at making friends so for the last years I've been pretty alone, at max standing next to one or two other socially incompatible guys.
When I started gaming (already did before we moved), but mainly when I bought GTA around October last year I started to make contact with other people online. I frequently talk to them over discord and mess around in the online mode with them. For me, this is the closest I've ever been to having friends since we moved and I really like digitally being with them.
Right now, we've got 2 weeks of autumn break at school. I used the first week for the mentioned project (4 hrs practice with the teacher, 1h getting there, 1h getting back home, like 1 to 3h practice on my own; EVERY day of that week) and now, the second week, I'm doing my driver's license (4h of classes, 30min going there, 30min getting back; again every day of the week (except Sunday)). I use the rest of the time to get rid of all the stress I have going on and just flee into my digital world, mainly playing GTA. This can add up to like 10h a day or so.

You can see the problem: this is a lot of time, even I notice that. And my parents really have a problem with that, saying I should rather start preparing for the final exams and other tests coming up in two weeks. In theory a reasonable thing to do, but I just can't handle the stress. I want to use my break as a break, not as a period of learning even more. Also my parents don't accept the people I talk to through the internet as social contacts and don't seem to understand why I cannot make friends in real life, even though a psychiatrist told them that the reason for this is a mental condition I have that just makes you introverted and just not capable of starting a converstation/ joining in on one. The online world is a place for me to relax and to find happiness (also been through depression and suicidal thoughts, more about that soon), and my parents just won't understand that I really need a break. At this point I believe they don't care about my mental health and stability at all or at least forget about this while ""only wanting the best for your future and career"".
Because of my depression shortly after we moved and I lost all my social contacts I went to see a psychiatrist regularly who told me to take it easy if things are becoming really stressful unless I want to risk further psychological damages like getting a bournout very early in life or falling back into depression.
I should probably add: I am not really what you would call a bad student: my average is an 11.5/15 points (like an American ""B"", a 2 from 1 to 6). The job I want to do later doesn't require a minimum average, the career I would want to start if that doesn't work out has requirements for at least 3.0 (from 1 to 6) or 8/15 points, so this shouldn't be a problem at all...



-Tldr: I am in lots of stress right now, only playing games helps me to relax. My only sorta friends are online. So I spend a lot of time on my PC in my break from school. My patents won't stop pressuring me to quit gaming and to start learning even more instead, although a psychiatrist told us I needed these longer breaks.-



The disputes with my parents coming up almost every single day don't really help me at avoiding stressful situations...

So now some questions for you internet people:
I assume some of you have been in similar situations. How did you handle it?
Should I actually spend more of my time putting myself in more and more stress? My psychiatrist told me if I did this, I could risk having a burn out before the age of 20...
Is there any way I can convince my parents that I really need a break from all the stress? Even the psychiatrist already told them, but they won't listen.
If that doesn't work: How can I make myself some free space in my head to concentrate on learning?

Other tips of course also gladly appreciated

868,"This is a little convoluted so allow me to explain. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a teacher in college who was easily the best teacher I ever had. Long story short the headteacher fired him under the guise of not having enough money (although it was clearly due to internal divisions and stupid school politics. Terrible situation.)

He was an absolute gem so I, among very few others, launched a tireless and not to mention expensive campaign into keeping the jobs of himself and his peers. This ultimately failed but has left an important stain on the college. 

I have just discovered that he is ""in love with"" a girl who was only one year above me in the school. I am English, so college does not mean university and they share an 10-12 year gap. He informed me that ""you can't help who you love"" and knowing that I worked to hard especially to keep his job makes me feel totally distraught and quite frankly like 6 months of my life campaigning were totally useless. I feel almost as though I was fighting on the wrong side and that my efforts would have been worthless if I were successful in installing him back into his work, because ""one can't help it"" and he would have ended up like this no matter what. 

His manner of speech in explaining it to me was downright childish as those were his exact quotes and I'm so confused at him.  I want to confront him about how this has made me feel but I get the sense that I myself am being childish in thinking that my precious teacher would remain precious forever.  

Should I confront him? And how would I go about doing so?

I have a science teacher who tells us to copy off a textbook or just ""attempt to do it."" She gave us a test to do and a majority of the class failed it. (We needed an 80 to pass.) If we ask her for clarification or to explain something she lectures us on paying attention in class. Majority of the class is her making small talk to the ""social"" kids. (Basically sporty kids.) Keep in mind our school is prided on being an academic school and everyone gets 90s or higher in every subject.

For example: On the test she mentions spill mix. We didn't talk about that at all and the textbook doesn't either. The websites she gave us were irrelevant and did not mention anything at all. If we searched it up ourselves not using HER resources she gets angry.

However it’s been a month of school and I keep bombing assessments. I do all my homework and ask questions. My mark is currently at a 73 and I’m afraid that’ll it will drop even further because that has been the trend. I just got my mark for the latest test and I got 68!! That dropped my mark by 5% :((((. Does anyone have any advice to help me raise my mark by at least 10%? Should I go to the tutor? Rethink my post secondary choices? I’m stressing out because the effort I put into math is not being reflected in my grade and I need high math marks to get into uni!
Also for those who are in uni and are willing to share, what was your math mark?",08Oct2019,1
887,"Good afternoon all!


I just had a very odd question.
So I’m turning 20 years old this upcoming Saturday, and I’ve been struggling a little with things. I made a post before because apparently the struggle does not end lol. I’m followed by bad luck this past year. 
But I’ve been having an ongoing battle with my biological father, I’ve met him the first time I was 16 years old, lived with him for 3 months. It was horrible. His wife was making threats towards me and the living situation was just very unhealthy. Rats, mice, rooms you couldn’t go in. It was not very nice to love in.  Either way, he did have decent money though which is the odd thing. He also has multiple children and I know for a fact they actually sued him for child support, or rather the mother did and he paid everything. He has a business and everything but there is lots of under the table work performed. Either way, when I left there my suitcase was full and I couldn’t take my photo album which is honestly the only thing I have left from my past. Now I’ve asked him multiple times if he could send it but he never did. So for almost 4 years now I’ve been wanting to have it back but it’s hopeless, makes me sad but whatever. Now since I’ve been struggling and I’ve been trying to come up with multiple ways to catch up with paying everything I did think of how he was sued for child support but note that the other two children were both under 18. Now while I was in Germany I knew there were ways I could sue him but I was never able to pay for a lawyer. Is there a way to do it in the USA in Florida? And no he has never been in my life before, just chose to not be and I’ve been dealing with everything alone really, and things are just piling up and right when I caught up there’s something else that pops up unexpectedly. I’m just trying to be stable, I managed to land a decent job finally and I don’t actually ask for help this seems like a way to maybe help. Not even looking to land thousands and thousands or anything just looking to get by and pay those couple of things off. 
Please advise.
Thank you all.",08Oct2019,2
888,"I just turned 24. I’m a college drop out, I work dead end minimum wage jobs, and I’m not passionate about anything. People always tell me to do what I like and a career will follow. I don’t like anything. I don’t have hobbies or friends. I feel like I’ll never do or be anything good or worthwhile. People I went to high school with are starting careers or med school or interning for Trump. I talked myself out of art school a few days ago because I know I’ll never finish and I’m not talented at all. I’m doomed and I don’t want to be and I don’t know how to fix it.

889,"This is my throwaway account byw, and I probably should post in a relationship advice subreddit but the people there are more worried about calling you or your partner abusive then actually listen and help.

Ok, now that I got it out of my chest...

I have serious issues letting people in my life. Mainly my bf, I never talk about me problems and that's causing major issues... 
I've always heard stuff like""you're being to emotional"" or ""you're always talking about the same thing! Get over it""
So I thought ""i'll figure it out, I'll deal with it"" ... And that causes major stress.

I think I know where all of this comes from... But short answer is, I'm too stubborn and I really think I'm gonna die alone as I don't deserve anything good that happens in my life.

So, what do I do to actually get better at communicating my issues and be okay with it?
I'm a woman why do I have issues with just talking? I should come natural to me?! Lol",08Oct2019,3

892,"I've just been to a party of a friend and when I got home I realised something. For me going to parties or events always felt weird and I felt out of place and not integrated, although I like some of the persons I am surrounded with.
I figured out that whenever I'm to such an occasion I always quiet down and basically do nothing but exist and act along. 
Now, I have the deep need to be liked by everyone or rather be the coolest and most interesting person in the room that everybody wants to talk to or hang out with. My need for being the most likeable person literally brings me to quiet down and I'm not myself anymore. Don't get me wrong, I'm not the most confident person there is, it's just that I start struggling socializing even with people I know better just because I want to be integrated. Then I become sad and jealous when I realise that other people are having more conversations and fun with others than I'm having.

I just don't know how to handle this anymore, it makes me really sad and socialize even less since I would love to get some affection or attention that others frequently receive but I struggle to get.

About a month after this happened, I got some huge news that they helped me work towards, and I want them to know, even if they don't care. I want to leave on a good note, trying to help them remember me in a better light as I know I view them well.

894,"First of all i’m not from America so my writing can be extremely bad, so sorry about that and i hope you can make out what i’m saying! It all started when i was like 15 - 17. Just one day i woke up and started to fear for my health, i’m not afraid of dying, i’m afraid of being sick or helpless i guess. I get like categories of diffrent fear but all related to health. Like for a year i was afraid of blood cloths, and at 16 it is so rare, and the next year i was afraid of a heart attack but that year no fear about blood cloths anymore, then i find something new and stop fearing the other thing. And this has been going on since i was 15 and now i’m 19 turning 20 in februar.
My reason for posting is that now a beautiful girl got born in july and this problem isn’t only a problem for me. So the thing is that when she was born she had a fever. The labour went well but we hadn’t slept for 14-16 hours when she started having contractions so we where really tired once this Amazing life excperince took an end and we went to sleep with our baby girl. Once i woke up, she was gone and nobody woke me, they told my girlfriend that they where checking on her and that they wanted me to get good rest. That had a massive impact on me. So she i had a fever and wasn’t breathing well on her own and was coused by an infection of some kind. We had to spend a week at the hospital around other sick children and something snapped. All of sudden i had fear for bad germs. Everything went well, even to well she was given antibiotics and was doing just fine the next day, but blood test took 3-4 days so she had to stay on it until the doctors knew what was going on but we never got an answer for what it was, on day 7 we where told to go home and that she is perfectly healthy and going to do well and she is still doing well to this day, but i’m not. Seeing her in box with caples and somestuff i don’t know the name of that goes inside her nose to feed her with syringes and ofc a needle in arm, and one time the needle was moved from her arm to her vein in head ( that is normal due to there veins being small and difficult) that broke my heart and i never wanted to see my baby girl like that ever again. And from that day i’ve been putting blood sweat and tears into protecting her from bad things and germs are a major problem. I get anxiety going to the store due to maybe bringing something home that has bad germs on it and you can’t belive the fear by taking her with me. Sometimes i even wash stuff from the store, very rarely tho, only when i have bad days i guess. Rubbing alcohol is used to the extreme. I try to make it only about me, i try to hold it in when i see my girlfriend do something that i detect as danger. But sometimes i can’t and it is driving me and her mad and it is going to effect her growing up and me being a father and i really understand that. I know how stupid this is, i know my mind is playing tricks, but thats the thing thats what it does, you know it is ridiculous but you still fear it. I was on medication before she got born but they made me flat an careless and i wanted to experience this with my true feelings. I’m in big dept from taking loans do to me not giving a shit from the pills and oh god when i got of them i crashed from looking at my bank account. (That has been taken care off, just an exemple what these medication do to me). I talked to a doctor the other day she took some tests and told me i had problem but i’m not over the top and i am trying to go around taking meds and maybe that’s what’s wrong here. Ive been reading about stepping out the box and doing the things you fear, but that does nothing. As you know i got fear for germs and that includes food poisoning viruses like ecoli, and i work at fucking meat factory, i’m around meat all day everyday and still have slight fear for uncooked meat. I know the facts, i know my baby needs to be around germs, i know touching a doorknob is and washing your hands is a waste of time i know germs are every where and there is no way of getting by in life other than being around germs 24/7, but still i do things to minimize it. Sick people... can’t be around them. And no one sick is allowed around my baby if i get sick witch i haven’t since she was born but i really think that if i get sick i’m packing my bags and going to my mother and being there until i get better. Do you understand how much i try to protect them from getting sick and also by trying to not make my girlfriend do some stupid shit, also having a newborn and working everymorning at 6 am to 4. I’m so exhausted and i don’t know what to do. I don’t even know what i’m looking after by posting this on reddit, just feels right.

895,"Something is a miss. Recently I went through something bad that really damaged me mentally &amp; overtime is has really affected me, My emotions mainly. Over the course of 1 year mentally I am completely different.



It doesn’t bother me if anyone in my family dies, I don’t see the point in friendships


I don’t feel sadness, stress &amp; anxiety all I seem to feel is anger. I’m angry &amp; that’s the only emotion I can seem to call out. 



I don’t remember what guilt, sadness, empathy, anxiety &amp; love feels like. 


Right now I am feeling anger &amp; boredom. Nothing else it’s just blank.



I want to feel something. I try to feel by doing things that make people anxious such as approaching a attractive female, dancing in public, starting a fight with someone but nothing. It’s just lost.



I try to feel sadness by watching a sad movie, sad stories etc. But no nothing. 



I try to empathize with others but I am unable to understand them or relate.

896,"First things first, sorry if I am overreacting and this is like totally common.

I'm super afraid of socialising. Or just anything around other people. I get these weird jittery feelings in my stomach like I'm going to vomit, usually when I'm talking to people I don't really know or exams and stuff like that. It makes me really sick before going places so I'm pretty flaky for plans. I don't really know where I'm going with this, but it's making my life really hard to deal especially because I'm moving schools soon which I can't just avoid. I've kinda accepted that I was just shy or anti-social but other people who say they're anti-social seem to have no problems when they do talk to people. 

So anyways, I came here for a bit of closure I guess? I haven't told my friends anything about this. One of my friends has been suffering from anxiety as well and I don't want to seem as if I'm bandwagoning for attention or anything. I also feel that mine doesn't seem as bad as theirs, so it won't be taken that seriously in the end? I'm not really sure. But I don't want to jump to conclusions or self-diagnose because I feel like that would take away from the experiences of those who truly do have, you know, social anxiety, if i am overreacting.",08Oct2019,4

They are still my friend and mean everything to me. Regardless of disability, people are amazing and have so much to offer. It is the way they are. This is not me trying to gas myself up.

But they kept making this really, really, really, loud noise over and over for about over 10 minutes straight. I was trying to write an essay and I'm not going to lie it started to become a little bit distracting. I don't know why, I wasn't laughing at the person, just the noise, I felt so bad about it. I quietly laughed at myself and then I stopped and then a little bit later and then stopped. Anyway, I just feel really bad for not being mature enough and having enough self-control.",08Oct2019,1

This year, she left my school and recently I’ve been feeling a large amount of regret because I never actually got to know her. I guess I felt like I had enough time to build up the courage to do it. I have her Instagram, so if I wanted to, I could DM her. However, throughout my high school years I dealt with a lot of insecurity because of my looks.
