2,"About 4 years ago I was with a woman and I started to get a panic attack. I didn't realize at the time what it was. Ffw to a few months later I try to have sex with another woman. Same thing. Years pass. Now seeing skantely clad women or thinking about being in a sexual situation causes panic attacks. When I think about having sex with a person I also can't help but think of hurting them. Not in a kinky way but in a ""omg how do i hurt them bad enough that they leave me alone or die"" kind of way. What should I do?",27Apr2019,1
3,"For more context, my school does not allow shorts what so ever. This is a problem because we live in the south and wearing jeans in 75° weather is not appealing. My teacher told me and a friend that if we can come up with a good rule for shorts length and such then it will replace the no-shorts rule. We need help coming up with a reasonable rule for shorts.",27Apr2019,1
4,"Sorry in advance if this comes off as bitchy and whiny. I just need to vent. 

24 year old male turning 25 this week. After graduating college at 21, I settled down at this job my mom got for me in a pretty damn good healthcare company. I’ve been here ever since. I haven’t moved up at all because I have no drive. My drive for the past two years has been “pursuing music” even though I haven’t done shit with it. My other drive has been trying to cure a porn addiction (which I’ve made incredible strides) and just trying to stay away from substances as well. I hate being sober. My relationship went to shit when I realized I had bpd and was acting out on self destructive impulses. I got. Dui and got my license suspended. I’ve been carpooling with mom for about a year now and ubering to the rest of my places. I feel so pathetic to be honest and I don’t know how to move forward with anything. I feel like I’m always going to be stuck with the same shitty mindset. I don’t really have friends because after graduating college I kinda isolated myself. I’m 99.9 % I have borderline personality disorder since I’ve been visiting the #bpd sub frequently and can relate to almost every single post. I don’t know what I should do with myself. I feel like I can’t leave my job. I don’t want to apply to other jobs. I’m just stuck.",27Apr2019,1

8,"Im not an innocent child by any means. I've been seeing, doing, and intentionally watching things that many would consider ""adult"" since I was little. I've seen extreme violence, emotional and physical, and I've also seen things of a horror and sexual nature.

Being no stranger to mature content, I've always just watched things that I wanted to, regardless of their content.

Recently, I started to watch shows that had a horror/thriller vibe. As one of these shows, I watched Black Mirror. The first episode was amazing. It intrigued me and I was mature and exposed enough to understand and comprehend what I had seen. (It depicted the prime minister of Britain being forced to have intercourse with a pig or a princes of Britain would die.) I understood and easily comprehended all of the political, societal, and personal meaning a of the episode. After seeing the first one, I watched the second episode called ""fifteen million merits"". The episode depicts a world where everyone rides bikes to power s civilization of sorts. It is a slave like existence for anyone, and the only way out is to go on a kind of talent show. The story goes that a man goes along in this world, he has tons of merits (money) due to him inheriting his dead brother's money. He is a slave like all others though. But one day he meets a woman who he is romantically attracted to. He hears her singing and thinks that it is beutiful, and he strikes up conversation with her. He then says she should go onto ""hot shots"" (the talent show). She says she doesn't have the money so he offers to pau for it. It costs fifteen million merits to enter, he has 15 million and nine thousand. He pays for it and then start to develop a romantic relationship with her. she goes up on stage. She sings but the judges stop her midway, they say that her singing isn't good enough, but that she could lift up her shirt for another career option. (The entire civilization watches this and their thoughts are expressed openly). She is extremely opposed to this, but the entire crowd cheers for her to become a porn star and the judges guilt trip her into it. She begrudgingly agrees to do it, but she doesn't really want to. They then say how she has  innocence that the porn head could use. 

That night, the man who payed for her to go up hates himself for accidentily putting her into sexual slavery for the rest of her life. (Ads are randomly put up and the watcher is forced to see them, or pay). The man who payed for the woman to go up is forced to see a porn add, and when he tries to look away he is told to resume watching or painful sounds will play. He finally continues watching and he sees the woman he loved on screen. She looks so broken, and like she is still in shock. She is in some sort of rape role play and he is forced to see it. (I have a person I have been with for almost a year, and imagining them like this woman brings me to tears). The man then gets angry and starts beating the glass (they live in rooms where they are surrounded by computer screens) until a shard breaks off, he then puts the shard under his bed. He works hard for a long time to earn money, barely eating to save up. When he finally reached 15 million merits he goes onto hot shots. He does a small dance routine and suddenly pulls out a glass shard and points it to his neck. He says that if they try to stop him from speaking he will kill himself. He speaks about the meaninglessness of their lives and how the judges are awful and how they are all slaves. After speaking the truth, the judges say how he has the most powerful voice they have ever heard. He is then offered a talk show, where he can do the same as he just did over and over. He agrees. It ends with a scene where someone is watching the woman being fucked by someone as she sits their, even more broken, with her hair died an unnatural blond and makeup mixing with tears. The final scene is the man finishing a talk show like he once did for the purpose of pointing out the awful world. He then turns off the camera and looks out a window.

The woman was forcibly pushed into pornography and was emotionally broken in the process and the man became a part of the system he hated, doing nothing for the woman he loved.

this entire thing has disturbed me and I don't know what to do. I have so many thoughts in my head and I'm so confused. I don't know what to do or who to go. I feel lost and I know that nobody will see this, but I don't know where to go.",27Apr2019,2
9,"(This is a throw away account. I can't bring myself to tell anyone else. I'm actually terrified. But I also really need to talk about it because it's really bothering me. I feel if I don't say anything that I'll burst. And I have. I occasionally have mental breakdowns but I always have an excuse to tell the people I'm around so they don't know what's really going on.) 



So about a year ago in the fall, I started my first job at a grocery store. I didn't like it but I needed to start earning money. I made some friends and some enemies. I mostly got close with my supervisor. He was the ""boss boss"" but he was my supervisor. I found out we were the same age at the time so we started talking on snapchat and he would walk me to the bus stop after work. He was really nice (so I thought). We talked alot but I had no idea he was into me because I was focused on my boyfriend. So the day he told me he liked me, I told my boyfriend. My boyfriend was fine with it. He said as long as you don't cheat on me physically, I have no problem and trust you'll be faithful. So I told my supervisor that we could still talk but I made it clear that nothing would happen between each other. He said okay but he still wanted to hang out. So we did and I had fun. We had only hung out twice. The first time we went to the mall, I met his friends, they were pretty sketchy and mean but I didn't pay much attention to them. My supervisor would try to hug me and grab my ass. I won't lie, I liked the attention but I loved my boyfriend more and told him to keep his hands to himself. After that day, we just talked more, flirted here and there but nothing else. I let my boyfriend read my messages to him just to give ease if there was any worry and he was fine. He knew I liked him a bit but was fine with it because I didn't act on my feelings. So days go by and I decide to go to the mall to get something from the mall before I meet up with my boyfriend. My supervisor told me he was there with his friends so I was just supposed to get what I needed, say hi and leave the mall. I met up with him and he offered me something to eat so I said sure. I text my boyfriend where I was and as I pressed send, my supervisor grabbed my phone and turned it off. He kept it and was joking around with his friends saying he would give it back. We finished eating and I asked for my phone. He said walk around with me first and I will. So I did. We were at the mall for a couple of hours and I told him I needed to leave so I needed my phone back. He said no. Stay with me. I said no and he just wouldn't stop asking. So I told him fine, hoping he would give my phone back. He said let's go to my friend's house. I said whatever. I'll just text my boyfriend after telling him what happened. We take the bus to his friends house and apparently she lives a couple blocks near me. So I was okay with it. I had ended up staying there for hours. I was actually having fun. His friends were being nicer and making jokes. At the time, I was having problems with my mom and wanted to rebel, so when he asked me to stay passed curfew, I said, wth. I'll stay. It ends up being 1am and he finally gives me my phone back. I turn it on and there's a ton of messages from my boyfriend. I decide I should probably get home now because I'm gonna be in a lot of shit. My supervisor says whatever, I'll walk you. We say buy to his friends and leave. So between his friends house and mine, there's a shortcut I knew. Small trail leading to a park with lots of trees and bushes. So hard to see anything from a window if you lived near there since it's dark. He says let's chill at the park for 5mins and I'm like, I'm already in shit since it 2am, what's the harm in 5mins. So I sit on the little table in the sand and he stands in front of me. He starts touching me up and I keep my moving his hands away. I kept telling him stop and don't do that. I got the feeling that this is going the way it shouldn't and try to get off the table. He puches me down and says you're not going anywhere. I try to get up again and he holds me down on the table while covering my mouth. (now he's much taller then me and athletically built so I couldn't get him off of me) so I'm super scared now and frozen. I don't know what to do. He tells me not to scream when he moves his hand from my mouth and I'm frozen so I don't. At this point I'm silently crying bc I felt I couldn't run and I couldn't scream. Meanwhile he's pulling off my shorts. I felt paralyzed. I won't finish because I'm pretty sure you get it. Eventually he got off and left. I didn't hear what he said, I just layed there till he left and I ran home. Everyone was sleeping when I got home. I texted my boyfriend I was home. For the rest of the night, I just cried. The next day I was grounded of course. My mom was furious but I didn't say what happened bc I thought I deserved it for disobeying curfew. I didn't have much shifts with him after that. A week later, I found out he was fired and I haven't seen him since that night. 

I never told anyone. It's been about a year since it happened.

This is stupid. 
But I think I feel alone. And I don't know emotions too well. And its hard to explain. It feels like that feeling right before you start crying and the back of your throat gets dry and your body gets this weird rush of feelings up it. When I wake up I feel that. And when i go to school I feel that. When I come home I feel that. And when I sit in my room I just think ""im alone in this room and there won't be anyone else"", I get this weird just ""nothing something"" feeling. It's stupid and I feel stupid. 
But I watch people walk by me, they laugh and smile, they cry and get angry. But it seems so far away. Like a planet or a star. I'm always by myself and feeling are weird. But I want to know someone. Maybe I just think I want to know someone? I think its loneliness. But being alone shouldn't make me feel like this I think. But it is. knowing somebody would be a nice experience.

I got a text today asking what color she should get a new car in, so I immediately got up despite being sick to go drive downtown to help make sure she didn't do anything too crazy. Well, it was for nothing because she ignored all my advice and got a car for a higher payment than her current one which she can't afford anyway; and her new car I'm not quite sold on yet because it is based off the Ford Fiesta which is notoriously unreliable.

14,"So I live in a trailer park. Our neighbors across the street have a bunch of kids in their home. A woman (let's call her Sally) lives there with her 2 adult kids, their spouses, and their kids (Sally's grandkids). All of the kids are young and the ages range from 1 to 8. Sally's daughter is pregnant again too. I see the 3 oldest kids (around ages 4, 7, and 8) playing outside a lot alone in their front yard and it is not fenced. It's a pretty small yard and it's near a street that has a curve where people sometimes drive too fast. Also, the oldest is pretty physical with her brother and it hurts my heart to watch. Sometimes the 3 year old is outside all alone too. So my question is do I call Child Protective Services for lack of supervision or mind my own business? I am a preschool teacher and I am a mandated reporter but am I just being overprotective? Another thing is that my husband has called animal control on that house before because they left their small dog outside in the cold all day and they knew it was him even though it was anonomous so they'll know who called child protective services too.

15,"My last remaining grandparent, whom I live with, is getting very forgetful. It's getting to the point that she'll ask me a question at dinner, and then ask me that same question again \~3 hours later with genuinely no recollection of asking beforehand. And I always find myself being annoyed by it, and responding on instinct with ""you already asked me at dinner, and I said \[answer\]"" or ""\[answer\], like I said at dinner"" (with an annoyed tone, too, most of the time). She's also started acting like a child again; if we ask her something she doesn't like, or give her advice she doesn't agree with, she'll throw a temper tantrum and snap at us. Which she never used to do.

My father, another household member, has MS. His memory is also mediocre at best, and he's also gotten that child-like mentality. He'll say the most hurtful and dumb things during arguments, and he's done some pretty bad things over the years (such as cheating on my mom when their relationship was rocky, instead of speaking to her like a mature adult. And I still haven't forgiven him for that, but that's a whole other thing I guess) because his decision making and cognitive skills are declining rapidly. Mom says that it never used to be that way (which I don't remember because he was diagnosed shortly after I was born. I barely remember the healthy him and he's only gotten worse as time goes on).

I get so angry at, and annoyed with, the both of them. It's a knee-jerk reaction. It's so hard not to take things they say personally, or not get annoyed at having to repeat the same things over and over and over because they can't remember. I have a short fuse myself and so when we get in arguments I get heated pretty fast.

I know I have to work on this, and I genuinely want to. The only problem is that I don't know where to start.

I know it's not their fault that things are the way they are, and I'm sure they'd change it in a heartbeat if they could. I know I need to get better at being more patient. I know I need to become more willing to work with their issues, and less angry and annoyed when confronted with them.

How can I do this? How can I set aside my emotions more so that I can focus on the logic of the situation? Sitting here now, it seems like a no-brainer, but when I'm in the situation it's so hard to remember that I need to calm down.

17,"Hi, guys. Sorry this is long, I dunno how to make it shorter.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** I really like a cool girl I go to school with. She's extremely oblivious and doesn't believe it's ever going to happen to her, ever. I'm worried about her not believing me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Details:**

So, I've had a crush on this girl since last year. We're both art students and had a drawing class. She picked up on stuff right away, so I kept asking her for help... and we became class friends but didn't see each other outside of it. At the end of the semester I figured I'd never see her again because we're in different departments, but we ended up in a printmaking class together this time around... now we have another class after, so we also get to hang out after class before our (separate) classes start.

So about her: She's smart, skilled, ambitious and just genuine about everything. She makes conversation out of anything you could want to talk about and gives the best advice and motivates everybody and Idk I've just never met anybody like her. I finally got her discord a few weeks ago cuz she wanted to send me a ""super neat article about bone marrow"" that she read. It was boring and I never would have clicked it, but I read it anyway because she made it cool, and then I was just like ""ohhhh.""

What's making it hard to do anything about it is that she's got no self esteem about herself as like, a person. I sort of knew last semester because she didn't turn anything in for a self-portrait assignment. Admittedly she's not conventionally attractive and told me a while ago about how the only time she'd gotten asked out was a guy doing it on a dare. She also apologizes like crazy about everything. She's pretty open and confident in other ways (her art, her music) so I'm not sure what's up.

Anyway after I realized I liked her, I started trying to compliment her on stuff besides her art, which she's always accepted fine, but she thought I was joking or was indifferent. I actually had lunch with her and one of her friends and when she left to get a coffee, her friend asked if I liked her. TLDR of that, her friend told me to be more direct if I and probably to reiterate that I wasn't gay. (I'm in the middle, so is she even, but most people at our school are gay including her friend.) I added him on discord too so I've talked to him about it a little. Apparently she told him once that she didn't believe anybody could get it up for her and that she jokes about being 'unfuckable' with her close friends so...

That was last week, so yesterday after class I stopped her from going to the food hall so it'd just be us. She wanted to sit at this one stairwell you can see the birds from so she could draw them. We just talk about art stuff for a while (we are both really into it so it's easy conversation.) We find out she's taking the same painting class as me next semester AND we're gonna be living on the same floor of our dorm, and it goes basically like this:

her: ""I would've been really sad if we didn't have anything together, print class is my favorite part of the week""

me: ""Same, and maybe we can hang out more often?""

her: ""Yeah! I'm pretty much always free anyway as long as you don't mind me drawing""

me: ""I always wanna see you so sounds good"" *(I know this is stupid but I was mad nervous)*

She totally froze up and was just like ""yeah, uh well whenever works!"" and I tried to ask her if she wanted to go see endgame this weekend but her friend came into the stairs to tell her she was late. She did message me about half an hour later saying she was already seeing it with her family but that 'a lot of good stuff was coming out' so I messaged her once we were out about Shazam and I think that's happening but she always tries to include other people so I feel like she might invite her friends.

I don't have much experience either, only one real relationship with a girl from high school. I've been 'friend-zoned' or whatever before and this doesn't feel like that, she just doesn't expect it to happen. I'm honestly convinced that guys must've been intimidated by her personality rather than not into her physically because a fair amount of guys *do* like what she looks like. She compliments my hair a *lot,* and said stuff like that I look cool. She gets really excited about my art which feels personal coming from her. I don't think she doesn't like me is what I'm saying.

&amp;#x200B;

**Anyway:** I really like her and I want to approach it right. Do I just send her a message being like ""I'm interested in you romantically"" now, after the end of the semester...? I feel like it'll give her less immediate pressure. She always freezes at stuff about 1/100th of that in person. It just leaves the potential of her thinking it's not real or not responding. I also think just sort of hitting on her will never work because she doesn't even consider the possibility.

Also, do I ask her out or just tell her? And should I really be like ""btw I'm not gay"" ? Please help. 

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Please don't tell me to not bother or anything, a bunch of my friends did. I'm very rarely attracted to people and I think I'm basically in love with her especially after writing all this out and I'm positive I'll regret not trying",27Apr2019,1

20,"For the backstory. I saw a contractor doing some work around the street that I live on and I needed the same work done to my house. 

So I took down his number and called him on a later day and asked if he could do the job for me. We came to an acceptable price and he took the job. He finished it and did it well. 

Now the interesting part is that my next door neighbor is a contractor as well and could do the same job. The guy that I hired asked me why did I not hire my neighbor? I told him the truth i.e. I hired him because I simply saw him do a job that I wanted done as well. My neighbor didn’t cross my mind at all at that time and there is nothing against him. 

Anyway, now I suspect that my neighbor may be upset and find it disrespectful that I didn’t approach him first. 

We’ve been cordial and peaceful with each other and I don’t want a misunderstanding like this to stop that because we have to live next to each other for a long while. 

How can I go about assuring my neighbor that I meant no disrespect to him? 

He hasn’t approached me about it but I can sense it’s on his mind. And I feel weird just going up to his house and starting to explain it all.

22,"I think I [25] may need to break up with my boyfriend [25] even though I really don’t want to. 

“Practical issues” are the reason why I’m considering this. The first is that he doesn’t have a driver’s license or a car. He’s afraid to drive and has no goals set in regards to when he will start practicing driving or putting aside money for a car. He lives far away from me and takes the train into my town whenever we hang out. I pick him up and I have to drive us all over, every time. I don’t like driving- I feel like a chauffeur. I can never have a casual drink when we go out or just relax since I always have to drive. He Ubers everywhere. I have tried to tell him that it’s throwing money away and long term a car is cheaper (If a car is cheaper is a case by case thing for each person. But he spends $40-50 to Uber to work every day.) He insists I’m wrong. 

The other issue is his job. We met in college, but his degree is not useful. It is in a subject he could never find a job and has no desire to find a job in. He works a sales job at the mall. The pay is not good, and provides him no benefits. However he really believes in what he sells and feels as though he’s helping people. I work as a server part time. I’ve encouraged him to try serving jobs (as his job currently does not give him the weekend hours he desires and serving offers plenty). Full time or part time. Serving is undoubtedly more money, but instead he took a second sales job. Which offers minimum wage like his other job. 

Aside from the job and the car, he’s really wonderful. He’s a great listener. We have interesting conversations. He’s respectful, kind and has more integrity than anyone I’ve ever met. He genuinely loves me and we rarely argue. (And if we do, its rationally and fairly talked through). I’ve never met someone who I’ve just vibed with like that. Not to be cheesy, but he just “gets” me. 


I’m not sure what to do. I’ve worked incredibly hard, and I’ll be graduating with my Masters in a few days. I’ll be hunting for jobs, and I need to move into a place of my own soon since my parents are retiring and moving far away. I want someone I can start my life with.... But it will be a very long time before he can afford to live away from home. I’ve put in a lot of work and sacrifice to be in the position I am in (graduating at the top 1% of my class, with a lot of scholarship money. dealing with intense mental illness. really grinding out shitty shifts as a waitress. a personal issue that resulted in a lawsuit which I won and put towards my education). 

Do I leave him and try to go it alone? Or do I blindly put my faith in this man? He’s got big dreams, but I don’t understand his vision. I know this sounds bad, but I am not okay with being the primary bread winner. I need someone as competitive in the job market as myself. He swears he will get there, but I just don’t know.....",27Apr2019,1
23,"At the time when me and my ex started dating I was 16 and he was 18. We met through my ex bf when he was bothering/harassing my ex and I told him to stop, at that time me and my ex bf’s relationship was falling apart and so I was insecure on top of that, I have anxiety which made things even worse to me. But when I told him to stop he automatically wanted to start a conversation and it quickly lead to him asking for nudes and begging for them and he was quite mean to me and yet I still continued to text him for I think about a year maybe more, but we got to know each other and after all that time talking he ended up getting feelings for me and I ended up getting feelings for him. We never met once before we started dating due to him going to some other state for some program. But when he came back from that program we made plans to meet at the mall and see a movie and I thought to bring a friend along. When we met for the first time I had an amazing time with him and so did he, he was super sweet and was so nice, but after the second or third time of going to the mall and seeing a movie he thought it was ok to just put his hand in my pants without asking and after a while he asked if it was ok and I said yes even though it easing ok to me because I was having an anxiety attack and when that happens I freeze up and say yes to anything and everything to prevent causing a scene. We were sexting and stuff at that time but I didn’t want to have sex or anything like that but we started getting sexually active even though I didn’t want to cuz he’d pressure me into it but as we got further into our relationship it got worse and when I say no to sex and stuff like that he’d say “we’ve done it before” or “if you love me you’d do it” and when I brought up not wanting to have sex no more due to getting in trouble with my mom he said “we can’t be together if we can’t have sex” we did get into lots of arguments and I tend to be moody a lot and I told him that I get stressed easily and that sometimes my anxiety makes me do or say irrational things, so when I got mad I’d say bye or leave me alone to calm down but if I stopped replying he’d flip out and start crying or say I’m hurting his feelings when all I needed was some space and alone time to clear my thoughts. He’d assume I’m ignoring him, I mean I was mad so I understand where he was coming from but no giving me space when I told him I needed it lead me to get even more mad and call him names, I never meant to but I did and I apologized for it. Most of the time when I would get mad was when he’d hide things from me and be secretive. I’m a understanding person and if he were to make a mistake or bad decision I wouldn’t get mad.  But due to my last relationship I wanted him to be honest with me and would always tell him that and he’d say the same to me only that he was never honest. He’d tell me he stopped smoking weed and doing drugs but then he’d do it behind my back he’d even cheat on me and when we get into an argument he’d admit that he’d cheated on me but when I bring it up to talk about it and talk things through he’d say he never cheated and that he was just being petty and would apologize. I couldn’t take the stress no more so I’d always want to leave him and when I tried to break up with him he’d start balling and freaking out and say the only way for him to ever break up with me was if I cheated. I was emotionally exhausted and felt trapped I loved him so much but I tried helping him with his problems tried working things out but it was hopeless cuz he’d always make up some lie or avoid talking about problems and he’d always cry all the time which didn’t bother me at all but it did when he’d do it whenever I wanted alone time or whenever I tried to leave him. My breaking point was during summer of last year I had a mental breakdown and I just wanted to end it all and I was not in the right state of mind cuz I was fighting with my mom cuz she found out me and him were having sex and the stuff we talked about got her upset. I got all my electronics taken away and he got super depressed and I did too cuz I cared about him and didn’t like seeing him unhappy, but just cuz I got all my stuff taken away and not being able to see him didn’t stop him from contacting me and he had a used to be friend come up to me that goes to my school and talk to him on her phone and we talked. Because the argument with my mom was so bad I went to live with my grandparents for a while and the next day after the huge argument when my mom found out I was having sex my bunny died idk if it was due to all the yelling and my mom taking the cage out of the room harshly and from getting scared or what but it made the situation worse and caused more stress and pain and with my bf being too clingy and not giving me space I cheated on him and then after that I invited him to my grandmas and snuck him in. By that time I had my MacBook to finish a online class so I could could contact him on Facebook so we could talk but he gave me his friends phone that the friend let him borrow for me to use to call him on and he found the texts of me and the person I cheated on him with and got super angry and left i started crying and he was crying when he left he texted me something I don’t remember but I told him that I’ll be erasing everything off the phone and giving it back to him along with his hoodie but he said no. Ig someone seen he was crying and screaming and offered him alcohol and told him that he shouldn’t leave me just cuz I cheated and said for him to go back to my grandparents house to apologize for how he acted so he called me and asked me if he could come back and I said no cuz I was scared but he convinced me to let him come back and we went back inside and talked and fell back asleep. Then I think the next day or the day after my mom somehow had access to my fb account and seen what had been going on and we talked about it and my mom and grandparents were disappointed in me and that made me sad. Cuz I hated fighting with my mom and upsetting everyone but after all that things kept going downhill and i still stayed with my ex cuz he kept convincing me to stay and kept convincing me to have sex with him but then nearing the end of summer I remember us breaking up and him asking to get back with me and that day I unfortunately was home alone and let him in and he convinced me to have sex with him even though I was hesitant and didn’t want to and then after that day he got with some other girl that was 15 and said that that girl made him open his eyes and realize our relationship was toxic and then went on t see a movie with her that me and him were planning on seeing and it completely crushed me and I got super depressed refused to eat anything for days and my mom has to convince me to eat and I was 103 pounds from not eating. Their relationship didn’t last long cuz the mom found out about it and filed a restraining order and so he came back to me I didn’t know wether or not I should be happy or upset but I got back with him and the mom of that one girl got a restraining order on him and that girl would still try to text him and when I’d say let me see he’d say he’d already deleted it like he was trying to hide something from me. Our relationship was still bad and I was getting fed up with him keeping things from me or kept doing the things I kept repeatedly telling him what was bothering me to the point where I just said do whatever you want. In October of last year he decided he wanted to come into the school to see me at lunch which I warned him was a bad idea and he said his friend did it before and even went into classes and the teacher were “chill with it” but my ex didn’t go to school which I was concerned because there were school shootings that happened that year and he could get into serious trouble, so I told him if he wanted to see me at school during lunch he’d have to check in with the front office he agreed turns out he didn’t Walked right into the school and was hiding out in the bathroom a girl that didn’t like him found out he was at school and told one of the teachers or someone that he had a gun so multiple police go to the bathroom he’s in and arrests him I had no idea at that time cuz I was in my 4th period and no phones are allowed but right when that class is over my friend started texting me like crazy saying that my bf got arrested and I was shocked and got really bad anxiety and after lunch in my 5th period ppl were talking about it saying he deserved it and I almost had a panic attack and almost started crying. I texted his phone saying I can’t date him no more and when he got out of jail he was mad at me but we ended up breaking up he ended up getting a new gf and I ended up getting a new bf around that same time once my ex found out I got a bf he automatically wanted me back and I told him I had a bf and that he had a gf I ended up breaking up with my bf cuz I didn’t want him getting involved or my ex trying to cause problems and I ended up falling for his lies again and got back with him but the thing is I told him that he’d have to break up with the one girl cuz it would be wrong for him to just cheat on her and that it was wrong and he said he did and that they just stopped talking come to find out he never left her and she ended up texting me asking me what happened to my ex and that he hasn’t been texting her and I was super upset and told her that he told me him and her broke up and wanted to get back with me and I text him upset saying that he lied to me and he got mad and idk if me or him started talking again or if we stopped for awhile but we ended up talking again after some time apart and he said he wanted to fix things and wanted me back and the day we met he said the reason why I did this was to get you back and I believed it and we were supposed to go to the fair that night after the movie but he had work and didn’t go the next day my other bunny dies that had a disability and I was a mess and I reach out to my ex for comfort he’s too busy to talk and then I think I got upset again and we got in an argument and stopped talking again but then he contacted me again wanting me back, then after a few days of us talking again he asks me for some money for rent the thing is. I don’t have a job he does but I believed it and gave him money the next day come to find out he’s at the mall and blocked me from seeing his Snapchat story so I use another account I had and looked at his story, he was dating some other girl posting pics with her he paid for her nails to get done which was was why he asked me for $30 I send him a text telling him I’m blocking him he calls me the next day asking for an explanation I told him he has a gf and that he lied to me and used my money to get her nails done he said that I was over reacting saying that she was a friend that wanted to hang out with him that offered to buy him food but he was posting pics and videos of him kissing her and her kissing him and him calling her his baby and he made me feel horrible cuz I thought I was in the wrong but I wasn’t and he blocked me on everything so we stoped talking I found out they get engaged but after a few months they broke up and he came to me saying they broke up and that he didn’t wanna talk about it and I was finally getting back on my feet but he did it again with the I want you back thing and asked me for nudes and after pressuring me into that he’d start ignoring me and that triggered my anxiety and I’d ask him to not open my texts unless that he could respond back and I knew he was busy but I wouldn’t understand why he’d be checking his phone or opening my texts if he was busy or posting on his story and I got upset with him and then he gets mad saying I fucked up and that our relationship was never going to work and saying that I was emotionally abusive and that I didn’t change and that I’m immature then starts saying that he’s making a lot of money and was thinking about getting a nice apartment for when I was 18 to move in with him and that he was gonna try to fix things with my mom and apologize and I was crying saying sorry and then I find out that he was back with his ex fiancé cuz he blocked me on Instagram and so did she and I looked on Facebook and he was hanging out with her posting pics. He was never really busy whenever I asked him when we could hang out and he used me for even more money cuz I lent him more money big mistake on my part, but I don’t  know how I was emotionally abusive ik I may have texted him a lot and got upset a lot but I have anxiety and I’m afraid of getting left alone so I do sometimes tend to be clingy or overthink especially when someone ignores my texts I automatically think they hate me or that they decided I’m not good enough. All ik is that I did change how I react I stoped getting mad, ignoring him, and calling him names and Ik I’ve made mistakes too but I put effort and tried fixing things and stopping my bad behaviors and I’m still working on not spamming people and my anxiety, but the thing is nothing was ever good enough. When I brought up things that happened in the past that still needed to be resolved and that I still needed answers as to what happened he’d say I’m being emotionally abusive and then he’d bring up the time that I cheated on him but I only did it once and I had a mental breakdown which is no excuse I know, but I took responsibility for my actions and apologized what I did. He never once said sorry to me when he cheated on me throughout our relationship even when I showed him proof he’d deny it, he even sent me a video of him at my friends house on her bed showing my friend wearing his shirt with no underwear or pants on and then her flicking him off. I just really need some advice and to know if I was really emotionally abusive to him and if so, I’d like some advice as to how I can change the way I act so it doesn’t happen again.",27Apr2019,1

26,"Just to start off, I'm in New York. In about a year and a half, I'm going to be going to college in Florida, and was hoping to rent a house off campus with two friends of mine.

We've been looking at various rentals in the area for the last couple of days, and we all agree it's something we can afford to do. The only issue is, we aren't really sure when to start going through with this kind of thing.

We start in September but we wanna move in around April of 2020 just to settle in and all that. I've looked online and heard that you should look 4 to 6 weeks in advance. However, that was for moving locally, and we aren't sure how that differs from moving a couple thousand miles.

What is the process for scheduling house tours when I'm across the country, and don't have a job immediately lined up. Will that limit the amount of houses we can rent? We have enough money saved up for at least half a year of rent, and we will be looking for jobs while we are down there before school starts. Right now my main worry is that no renters will take that seriously, and wouldn't want to rent to us.  
  

Should we fly down for a week, and then schedule tours while we're there? Should we still fly down for a week but contact the real estate agents beforehand?

How much time would be in between touring the house, then signing a contract, then actually moving in?

Quick P.S: I know that this may seem all jumbled, and that's because it probably is. I can assure you we're all serious about this, and willing to plan and put in the effort it'll take. I don't want the messy nature of the post to make it seem like we aren't serious.",27Apr2019,1

BTW before this break up, I thought I was just bi so I told my bf told when we were first dating. Now I just still cannot stop thinking about girls 24/7. I love our sex and find him very attractive, but I only really get turned on (especially when alone) by girls. I am just worried about feeling this way because I just don’t know and don’t want to hurt him, but I am also worried I will never get to really see if I like girls 100%. Idk any other guy but him doesn’t do it for me. I only get off by myself to girls, never men. I just have crushes all the time and it makes me feel guilty.

35,"I (F20) started working for my ex-driving instructor (M~55) with his independent event business a couple of years ago, and have been doing infrequent work for him ever since. I have known him since I was around 16. He’s always had an over-friendly attitude but I’ve always played along, especially due to the fact that I need extra cash for university. He’s been getting more and more inappropriate in his messages as time had gone on, though. Things like how he’s sending me a snog through the phone and if I’d be with him if he didn’t have a wife, things like that. I know I’m technically of age, but it all feels very uncomfortable. My mum has urged me to take up jobs but stopped when I explained why I was reluctant, and my dad has said that his behaviour is unacceptable. I always brush the messages off with a ‘haha’ or something, but he doesn’t seem to get the message. If it’s even relevant, I have a boyfriend and he knows this. I eventually decided to stop opening his messages, and now he keeps sending me messages around once a week asking if I’m still interested in working for the business. I quite enjoyed the work I was doing and have grown a bond with him in the past, but it feels like his behaviour has sort of broken that down, especially when it’s pretty clear I’m not reciprocating, and a lot of the work requires an overnight stay at a hotel which makes me feel iffy due to how he has behaved. I feel super guilty with every message he sends though, and I’m tempted to just grin and bear it to earn money and maintain a positive connection, but I just feel so uncomfortable with how he’s been acting.

Not only are they aggressive with each other but also everyone else. They're Making threats at people/kids or accuse them of something. This will happen at anytime day or night.

38,"Hi I don’t really know how to use reddit but I’ll try.

To understand this story your gonna need to know some background.My dad have been married to my mom for 13 years and 2 years ago got a divorce because of the way my dad treated my mom physically and emotionally and cheated on her on multiple occasions and has a child with one of the women he cheated on my mom with.Since then we moved out of our house and I moved into my grandmas with my mom and siblings.In the school I go to I need to be in the district and where I live with my grandma I have to drive to my bus stop everyday, and my family is known as a displaced family. I share a room with my mom and 2 siblings, it can get uncomfortable at times but that’s not the problem.My dad has moved in with his sister who lives two hours away so we didn’t see him much.A few months ago he got an apart near us to see us more(ps it was more bc of his work).Its would be a relief to go to his apartment sometimes to get away from the 7 people ole that live in 3 bedroom house.My dads apartment has 1 bedrooms and 2 large closets for random stuff and two big closets for clothes.My dad has recently left his apartment to go live with his new girlfriend who he’s known for about 2 months and he’s lease isn’t t up yet so he still pays it but lives 2 hours away again.We have seen him sometimes and go to that apartment to see him but he’s stoped going there and it’s completely vacant.My mom and grandma are trying to sell her house to be able to get a bigger one.My dads lease is up in September and with everyone living at my grandmas it’s a big mess.My mom got the idea to just live at my dads apartment.We would all have space and be able to clean my grandmas house and get it up to sell in the summer.My mom asked my dad about about it and he said he’ll think about it but made it clear he was gonna say yes.The next day we called again to ask about it and he said no,we all knew this was because he went home to his girlfriend and he convinced him to say no.My mom asked why and he said “I’ll be paying for you to live” he was going on about him paying my moms rent.(Somethingto know is that my mom helped him find the apartment, put him through collage,found him a job and has basically paid for his living).My mom already told him she would pay the electric and the cable(wich he was already paying for so he wouldn’t pay as much)and my mom couldn’t pay the rent because she’s saving up for a house.Another reason why we don’t want to live at my grandmas anymore is because my aunt moved back and let’s just say she’s crazy and inconsiderate example-kicks wholes In walls after they where done, so we weren’t that happy to find out another person would be staying there.Me and my siblings tried to tell my dad this but he didn’t care.Ive never met my dads girlfriend and I don’t want to because she’s now the reason I’m living the way I am.Another thing is the apartment is in the district so my mom wouldn’t have to take off work to take us to the bus stop, and it’s next to where my friends live , so I would have a fun summer and be able to walk to there house.I think my dad should let us stay there because he’s paying for it anyways and where his kids living in not a great place.I don’t know what to think and need some advice.Either your opinions on the situation or something to say to my dad,I would appreciate it.",27Apr2019,1

Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

I have no idea where this new interest in church started. But I am a atheist and I had no interest in going. I worry that if I tell him no he would be offended about the idea. I have seen some ex coming out of atheism stories that have ended badly between the atheist and their families. I worry that something bad might happen if I were to tell him I don't want to go.

I was even more uncomfortable and didn't know what to do so I just pretended I didn't listen. He then talked to another teacher that was standing next to him and repeated: ""Hey, a dream come true!"".
I know I should have said something to him right there, but I haven't been having the best relationship with one of my bosses (one of the two principals-- Elementary and Middle School Principal) over there and didn't want to make it a big deal. But right now, I'm home and I hate myself for it because it felt gross and disrespectful since I never gave him any indication he could joke around with me.
Should I try talking to me other boss (who likes me--High School Principal) about it? I don't want to come off like I'm problematic but I was really uncomfortable at that moment.
Any advice will help a lot.

TLDR; A male teacher said some inappropriate things about me during a workshop and I wonder if I should shut up or tell me bosses about it.",27Apr2019,1
47,"Hello everybody.

For about a year or so, I've known my good friend- I'll just call her M. We really clicked when we first met, as both of us draw art, like the same bands, and like the same kind anime. 

However, she is extremely depressed and talks very openly about it. She talks to me all the time about how she thinks she's useless, worthless and ugly. She talks to me about wanting to kill herself and she cuts herself. She shows me the cuts on her wrist, and also shows other people it as well.

 M has a lot of anxiety and does have a therapist and sees the counselor at school, but I don't think she's gotten any better,

 I've talked to her a lot about her depression and suicidal thoughts and I've tried to be as supportive as possible. I hug her, calm her down when she gets anxious, etc. But no matter how much I try to help, her suicidal behavior hasn't really changed. 

I want to help her as much as possible. Recently, she was admitted to the hospital because of a suicide attempt.  I don't want her to kill herself or cut herself again. I don't know what to do. I'm really concerned about her.",27Apr2019,1
48,"TW rape, statutory rape, abuse 

Back story: My ex is the sort of abuser where he seems incredibly charismatic and stable to all around him until he’s in private, so he gets away with a lot. His MO seemed to be finding teenage girls and gaslighting the shit out of them until they were ‘crazy’, then playing the victim and turning everybody against them. He’s incredibly vindictive; the sort of guy who would pour months of effort and thousands of dollars into vengeance over anyone of any business that slighted him. 

When we broke up, he ‘won’ all of our friends and totally destroyed my public image. To the point where he even accused me of raping a mutual friend of ours (I’m still very close to this friend, we had an ongoing consensual sexual relationship, ex accused me of this because ‘there is no way he would have wanted to have sex with you so it must have been rape’). The injustice of all of this, on top of the years of abuse, mean that 3 years later I still think about him every day.

When I met him I had just turned 18, and he was 26. This obviously introduced a fucked up power dynamic and meant that I didn’t have the life experience to be able to see what he was doing.

His girlfriend before me was his then girlfriends little sister; she was 14 and he was 21. They started a sexual relationship (again, she was 14) after he met her in her family home while he was spending time with her sister. He told me so many stories about how she was crazy, so insecure, etc. Which is unsurprising because he also told me about how he would do things like tell her her tits were saggy for a teenager when they were fighting. I assume he did all the same gaslighty shit with her that he did with me.

He also told me about how once when she told him she was going to go to the police about their relationship, he kidnapped her. He told her he was going to drive her home, but instead drove her out into the middle of nowhere and took her phone, saying he would give it back and drive her home when she understood that going to the police would ruin his life and promised not to do it. 

I haven’t outed him about this because he will retaliate, and he will retaliate HARD. I can’t take that, I’m still so broken. So I just have to sit with this.

Advice:
Anyway, lately I’ve been thinking about sending her a message. I don’t know her, but maybe the shared trauma and having someone to just validate what happened for both of us will help? I think it would help me to have someone just say ‘I get it, I believe you’ because not many other people did. I would hope the same would apply to her.  But is this a bad idea? Is it selfish? How would you feel in that situation?",27Apr2019,1
49,"I’m going to keep this as linear as possible because I probably said this on another sub before, I’m not sure.
     Basically my whole life I was raised in an African African (raised in US first gen American), and it was full of pressure on top of constant arguments with my parents since I was in elementary school. 
     I transferred schools a lot from districts to legit my parents sending me to Africa to basically “straighten” my attitude and show me my “culture”.  My parents of course have tunnel vision and only see things the way they want it to be; these constant area changes in my pre-adolescences age has stunted me. 
     I’m back in the US and anxiety hit me like a truck. I felt a social disconnect from my life for that first year back in US (sophomore year). I still was the same but everyone in my school know each other, mingle, sex partying and whatever. While I’m struggling to have a weekend to myself to just play my PS4. Of course Fortnite isn’t going to help me with the REAL WORLD. And my parents hardly care (or strictly rebuke) about me making friends or finding my first gf.
     Let me get straight to my grades, Unlike my twin sister i don’t get straight As. But I do Average A B with usually recurring 87-91 range in my grades. For any first generation American or foreign student, grades are so important to the parents. SATs are rolling in and my father blatantly says he has no faith in me getting a “good score”.  he forgot my 11th grade PSAT score and mistaken it for my 10th grade FRESH OUTTA AFRIKA scores where I got average-joe scores.
     To be honest, I had dreams that I feel like are too far in the sky for me to reach. Parents want another doctor in the family because money and status is all that matters. I honestly don’t have an interest in school, along with activities like Basketball and Prom like how I used too. For FaCks sake I haven’t even had a promising relationship with a girl, or a sustainable friend in my entire life.  Only God knows if  I’m planning on cutting my past life away once I’m out for “college”. 
Every conversation in my house about my future is toxic. And if I voice my opinion they shame me or slap me, or even scold me in front of relatives. They tell me I do poorly and my esteem starts to sink. 
      Lol....I can go onto different tangents of my life. If I had the time of not being forced to study or clean I might write a book about it.",27Apr2019,1
50,"My younger brother had an ear infection that prevented him from hearing well till he was around 12y. This lead him to not develop at the same pace as kids his age and caused teachers and consequently other kids to pretty much cast him away for most of his school life. Due to lack of socialization and the troubles he faced at school, he developed low self-esteem and anxiety issues. Last year it got so bad that he started showing signs of depression and OCD behavior, so my parents decided to switch him to homeschooling. He's doing much better now but it makes it harder for him to meet/be around other kids. He wants to connect with other people but has a hard time expressing himself and really doesn't know how to maintain a tipical conversation with other teens. He also gets anxious when speaking with somebody for the first couple of times. How can I help him?",27Apr2019,2
51,"So my mom has recently just been a little out of it. It's not very noticeable but I do feel a tiny bit of disconnect from her. 

Well I walked into the kitchen and saw her standing there with her hands on her face looking a little bit depressed. I asked her what was up and she told me that she was having anxiety. I asked her what about and she told me death. At first I just assumed that she was just talking about death in the far future so I told her ""yeah it can be pretty nerve wracking. Why the sudden thoughts about death?"" Then she responded ""I just don't want to die in the next 3 to 4 years. I want to at least live old enough to see all my kids graduate highschool.""

 I have no idea what to think about this. I don't know if she has some kind of illness that she is hiding from us or if she was just thinking really hard. I think I remember her saying many years ago that she either had diabetes or was close to having it but I have never seen her take any treatment for it so I can't say for sure.

53,"To start off, I find this incredibly tough to type out and there are a few things I have to clafify:

1. I'm male

2. I'm 19

3. I have anxiety and a bunch of other disorders (which will be relevant)

I met this girl and there was some sexual tension which I didn't really enjoy at first. We ended up talking about doing the stuff but I was reluctant to aggree to sex and I always said ""I don't know"" and non conclusive answers. I was absolutely clear about no condom stuff though. It was a hard NO.

She kept forcing herself onto me while I didn't have a condom and my penis came in contact with her vagina. She also made me cum when I was uncomfortable and vunerable and couldn't say no anymore because of my anxiety. Now I'm worried she might have had semen on her hands and touched her vagina afterwards which might make her pregnant. I've had someone try and threaten me with this before and I'm panicking so much I can't sleep for days already.

55,"My father has recently been online more and more, it started with a girl he met on youtube and over the course of months he began to think our extended family was creating some kind of ploy to get between him and her. He recently started talking with a newer girl who is apparently a friend of the previous girl, he's been talking with her on the phone and they seem to be fine, I have never talked with either girl myself.  


However he's been making 'jokes' about the Russian government watching him and there being conspiracies against him since the beginning, I told him very clearly that I don't think anything like it is happening and that he was just being paranoid. Skip to today and he told me he 'accidentally found a room on youtube listing names and actions' including a billionaire, and when he backed out a pop up alert told him not to click anything. In addition he was laid off and the girl he was talking to on the phone apparently had a back injury in the past that 'word for word' matched his own back injury, also her birthday was the day right after he had his injury.  


He thinks a government either Russian or our own is working with google to 'silence him' because he found that list of names and somehow the girl he's been talking to is some sort of agent.  


I have trouble listing it all because he tends to ramble a little and it's hard to follow.  


I am seriously worried about his mental health and I have tried to talk sense into him but he refuses to listen to me, I thinks I am naive and 'too young' to understand why some shadowy organization is out to get him. I don't know what to do or who I can turn to for advice, he clearly will not listen to me and I am scared that I'm going to lose the father I once knew to this strange creeping paranoia.

56,"So I (22f) love/care/blahblahblah for my boyfriend (22m) very much (we have been together for 7 years) but he has horrible manners. This is not a dealbreaker for me in anyway and when we are at home I dont care how he acts, but in public he can be a bit embarrassing and I dont know how to address this without upsetting him.

TL;dr: He acts like a child and gets upset when I suggest a more adult way of acting in public.

1st. His table manners are shit. He stuffs food in his mouth, talks with his mouth full, uses his fork to pick up an entire piece of food to take a bite then he puts the food back down and removes the fork with his fingers and then uses his fork to pick up another piece of food (he wont use a knife to simply cut his food into bite sized peices until I suggest it), he will grab 5 fries at once, dip them in his sauce and take one bite and put the 5 bitten fries back on his plate and go onto another piece of food, he will double dip, spit food back out onto his plate if there is a bone or fat or something (instead of removing it privately with a napkin), he puts things on his fork with his fingers if he cant get the food to stay on by stabbing it, he eats so fast, he slurps, he takes huge bites of his food and it falls back out of his mouth, and he almost always gets food in his beard or on his clothes.
I have tried mentioning a manners class or tried to show him the proper way to cut and eat food and use a knife and a napkin and to finish a piece of food and not put a bitten piece of food back on his plate (!!!) But, he says ""This is what I'm comfortable doing and fuck what other people think."" I care about what other people think!! And my family and friends all notice his eating behavior and give me a side eye or make a comment in passing.

2nd. He says the worst things out in public. For example,  after a movie as people were leaving he loudly announced ""do you have to pee? I do."" I know people 20 feet away heard him. He is also the jerk who complains when other people talk or use their phone during movies but HE TALKS LOUDLY AND CHECKS HIS PHONE during movies too!!! He also never silences his phone!!! He also thinks it's okay to bring up personal stuff like ""what do you think about how the Pope said whatever the other day"" or ""what do you think your mom meant when she said this"" or ""what's your opinion on immigration right now"" and wants my detailed personal opinion while we may be on-line for something and are surrounded by people that are totally eavesdropping. I dont feel comfortable talking about my personal opinions when idk who could be listening and he gets very offended about this. I've had to tell him it's my social anxiety (which I dont have, I just dont like looking like a fool when I'm out). The worst was when he had an hour conversation with a friend about ""the horrors of Male circumcision"" while we were walking around NYC!!! I legit stayed 20 feet back from them as I did not want to be associated with them. When having conversations with people he tends to make very bad jokes (the kind where you blatantly lie and laugh and say ""kidding"") or he he will very obviously BS his way through a conversation with people from experienced backgrounds. For example, instead of asking about their work he will generalize what they do (example, ""oh you teach preschoolers? You have to make sure those kids pay attention. My experience with kids are..."" and talk about whatever HE knows even though he is talking to a professional). He also will bring up superheros (we are comic book fans) into conversations when it's not appropriate. Like someone was dealing with a personal issue, he said ""like like Ironman and Captain America's disagreement"". He didn't even know if this person had even seen the movies!! It was so left field for them that they just laughed awkwardly and changed the subject. Or he randomly told a car guy ""Mazda cars are my favorite cuz their Logo reminds me of Batman's mask"". Is that really the reason? Later he told me he said that cuz he was ""trying to be funny"" and he ""likes to weird people out"" but I think he was backpedaling.

I have no clue how to handle this. He is already sensitive that ""people think he talks weird"" cuz I have had 2 people ask me why he says such odd stuff and I've asked him why and he gets mad and says ""that's just how I talk"". I dont know what to do at all here.

3rd. He wont match my pace when we are walking (to the point that he will literally run ahead and then get mad that I ""didnt keep up""), he will jump over furniture or railings like he is in a parkour video (think the Office episode with Micheal and Dwight), he's never opened a car door for me, helped me with my chair, or offered to carry heavy bags for me (which I actually can do all by myself but it's still impolite not to even offer when we are on a date or some place nice) and he will get mad at me if I get tired and dont keep my energy dialed up to 100% all day long. He has even asked me to apologize to him cuz I was only giving him one word answers when we had been awake for 20 hours. 

I haven't said anything about this to him but I would at least like try to find a way to tell him I'd like to be walked WITH and treated politely. I always take his bags from him and get the door for him and he doesn't reciprocate. That's more of the issue than ""being treated like a lady"" cuz I just want us to both be mannerly to each other. Also, he does this running/parkour business even when we are with our friends who are in their 30s and then all kinda stop and ask ""what is he doing??"" He looks like a 6 year old. 

Lastly, he takes his shoes off in the movie theater. I think it is SO GROSS and it makes me feel enraged inside that he can be so classless. 

Please help me. Despite these things, there is nothing else that he does that bothers me. I've even resigned myself that i will accept it all if he will never change but if anyone has any advice on how to at least help me feel less embarrassed about his behaviors or how to help me word things to not offend him (he's hot headed) please comment and help me. I dont know what to do anymore.

Thank you!!",27Apr2019,2
57,"My job in retail (job 1) is pretty cool because I work at a candy store. But lately they’ve been cancelling my shifts and giving me less and less hours. I’m working over the summer to save money for tuition and rent so I need as many hours as I can get. At the start of my employment they said I’d be part time with as many hours as they can give me; 25h a week guaranteed. This week coming I have only 13h scheduled...

I also got a second job (job 2) in a field that runs in my family which is marine services. Think harbour cruises and tall ships and not navy and it’s higher paying by a dollar. I talked to job 2 and they said they could give me a pretty fixed schedule to work with my other schedule, so I emailed job 1 with my availability changes and they’re not willing to schedule around job 2’s schedule even though it would be fixed. 

When I emailed my manager they said (paraphrased) “if my schedule comes out first, you will follow that one and are responsible to find covering for shifts.” Basically the equivalent to good luck, have fun. 

I just started there about a month ago too and I’m thinking of quitting since it’s also a new company expansion (first of its brand out where I live) and they can’t seem to get our ducks in a row. I’m thinking of giving my resume to a company we have family ties to as a replacement to this job since I’ve been thinking of quitting.

My mom has worked as a cafeteria manager at a school for 18 years.  In the few years she has had some problems with her boss/employees and has taken leaves of up to a week due to medical reasons (mostly mental health related).  She had sick leave for this.  Earlier this year, there was an early retirement incentive that she took, but was then convinced by her boss to take back.  Other than these leaves, my mom has had good attendance, punctual, good job performance, ect.   In the last week, one of my mom's employees got very upset with her and met with my mom's boss to complain.  That employee quit.  My mom's boss tried to talk to my mom and my mom got very upset and had an emotionally charged conversation with her.   In this conversation, my mom blamed some of her prescription medicines for her behavior.  She was then told she would need a medical release to return back to work.  She got that Tuesday but was then told she was on administrative leave until a meeting with her boss.  The meeting was this morning with her boss and HR.  My mom is telling me she doesn't remember much about this meeting but she no longer has a job.  She said the word, ""fired"" did not happen.

73,"I’m in high school and I’ve had a low self esteem for as long as I can remember. Middle school was the peak of it all and I took to self harm. I was chubby and quiet and wasn’t friends with the popular girls. I quit sports because I was never good at them. Anyway, I’m in my 3rd year of high school and I’ve slept with several guys over the past couple months. It would go like this... they would hmu, we’d exchange nudes and then hookup. It felt so great to finally get some attention towards my body after I had lost so much weight. I actually felt wanted for once but after a while I would become attached to these guys. I just wanted attention so I would try and pursue a relationship. They never wanted one, so they’d pretty much ghost me. This has happened with about 4 guys (in the past couple months) of hooking up, me wanting something more, and them ignoring me. All i want is to feel some self worth. I have absolutely no confidence in myself and I’m almost an adult. Honestly, I think I’m mentally ill but I’m scared of confronting it.

75,"So I (21 F) want to sleep with my professor (42 M) really bad. I’ve had the hots for him since the beginning of the semester, and just recently (less than a week ago) I met with him for office hours. The reason for meeting with him was to talk about grad school and a paper that’s due in a couple weeks. But I mainly just wanted to meet with him because he’s attractive as hell. He’s also a professor for my major, which makes me find him even more attractive.
Our class is early in the morning, so I’m probably the only girl who actually does her make up and tries to look good for class (because I do try lol). I know I stand out because I’m a platinum blonde with an athletic body which decent sized breasts, and I make sure to wear low cuts to his class. I’m not conceited but I know I have nice big eyes (that I get a lot of compliments about) and I know I’m attractive with a decently nice body. I’m pretty confident as far as my looks go. I try to give him the seductive eyes in class and look cute and I think he notices.
When we met, I’m not going to lie I was very nervous and it probably showed because I couldn’t even look at him when I was talking. We talked for over an hour, even getting pretty off-topic at times. He was wearing a short-sleeve shirt and has a full-sleeve tattoo, so he was literally looking hot as hellll. I was fantasizing about sleeping with him the entire time, I was so turned on lol. I definitely got the vibe that we were both being a bit flirty with each other throughout the meeting, definitely by his gestures and facial expressions. When I finally got up to leave (which I didn’t want to lmao) he got up and opened the door for me, and we both smiled in a flirty way at each other. I left pretty satisfied. 
I emailed him that night to thank him for meeting with me and told him I really enjoy his class, and I got a much longer response than expected. A few emails back and fourth the past few days, and he’s using the 😊 emoji in a lot of his messages. I’ve tried to read his emails pretending they came from a female professor of mine, and cams to the conclusion that a female wouldn’t talk to me that way, or any professor that wasn’t trying to give some kind of message off.
I already arranged to meet with him again on a few days, and we’ve still been emailing about that as well. I even got risky and send the 😜 emoji at the end of my last email lmao. To be fair, at the last email he sent to me he said “Good seeing you in class today 😊” so at the end of my email I said “Always good to see you. 😜” 
So yeah getting back to where I started, I want to sleep with him lol. He’s not married, if y’all are wondering. Should I make a move on him at the office hours in a few days? He’s a part-time professor so he doesn’t have his own office, he just uses a past-time office that’s used by others as well (I’m not sure how many). No one came in the other day, so I’m not sure how frequent that may occur. Other than that, would it be dumb for me to make a move on him? Christ it would be so hot. And I think that he definitely would.",27Apr2019,2

78,"2 weeks ago, I decided to quit my job due to the fact that I was missing 35 hours combined off of 2 different pays. I didn’t end up giving notice to them that I was leaving since I asked about my money and they pretty much told me I’m stupid. 

Fast forward to today, I was supposed to receive my final pay and didn’t get a single cent deposited into my bank account so I figured enough is enough and decided to message them asking why I wasn’t paid and that needed my money because I have literally no food and was getting groceries today. 
My boss ended up giving me a call and completely tore a strip off of me telling me that if I wanted my money I was to come into the store and sign a waiver saying that she could completely slander my name and tell my landlord and future employers about myself.
(I’m an 18 year old small girl, very shy and quiet and cause absolutely no problems for anybody because I hate conflict. I’m also pregnant) 
Since I don’t do well with conflicts I decided to bring my dad along with me to be a witness to everything happening and to be there for me saying absolutely not to signing that waiver, and honestly I was actually afraid she might get physical and hit me. But while we were there she screamed at me some more and said that she is pregnant herself and if she loses her pregnancy that it’s my fault. Wtf? She also looked my dad in the face and told him that she’s sorry for him for having me? Another wtf? 
I ended up leaving there with $40 as a payment for my final shift, in my opinion it was better than nothing since I could get some food, but now I’m out 35 hours of my life working for free and feeling awful about everything she said.
Is there ANYTHING I can do about the way I was treated? I’m honestly not even worried about the money at this point. 
Tl;dr My ex boss treated me like absolute garbage for asking for my money owed which wasn’t on my pay, told me that if she has a miscarriage that it’s my fault, and she told my dad that she’s sorry he’s had me. Not sure how to deal with this.",27Apr2019,1

So I’m a dog lover. I had an Alaskan malamute for a while and loved him with all my heart. He had some aggression issues and even bit me once over some food. That never caused any problems for me. He’s not around anymore but either way I know I’m a large dog guy and I want another one at some point in my life. 

About two months ago I was at a ranch retreat with my friends. We all took some magic mushrooms and were having a great time. Right in the middle of the peak of the trip I realized I forgot something inside the ranch house. I was intoxicated so I didn’t really think to go slow into the house, so I burst in the door and scared the large dog there (unsure of the breed, northern-Esque) the dog was scared and looked at me for a brief moment, detected I was worried too and lashed out at me. I knew what to do, backed away slowly and went and got someone the dog knew. When I went back to grab the item from the house, the owner had to hold the dogs collar back as she was trying to bite at me. 

It’s my fault, I should’ve thought more and I don’t blame the dog at all. Since then though I’ve been super hesitant and nervous around large dogs. Which sucks because they can sense it and makes them hesitant of me, which creates a vicious circle. 

What can I do to start being comfortable around big dogs again without my first reaction being worry?

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, 

So a little backstory, I'm 21, living alone in Montreal. I go to school here, dual citizen and all that, and I have a younger brother, 17. I used to work at a Behavioural Health Centre during a summer job with my father, who met a woman there who he started an affair with. Now, my father has always been a staunch libertarian, family loving, strict as balls father. We used to butt heads in my youth, but at the end of the day, I loved him and we maintained a relationship. I was always told as a kid that I was inferior to him and he doesn't have to do anything for me, and that I should be very lucky. I had grown up believing my father as a sort of savior, because I had left a year of sexual/emotional abuse and neglect in the care of my paranoid schizophrenic mother. He remarried my stepmother, who was the classic example of ""being too similar to me that we butt heads."" We weren't very touchy people, so I rarely hugged her, I had bad PTSD and everything from age 6-10 and she had extreme OCD growing up so that relationship was strained from the start and never really recovered. But I consider her the greatest woman on the face of the earth, and I'd take a bullet for her, despite her not being blood. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm in college, and on the rare visit, I hear banter from my mum about ""my father having an affair"" because he'd be home late, or not answering his phone. I pushed them aside, because he's always been a workaholic and I was used to it. It got a little weird when I was visiting for Thanksgiving 2018, and he came late on the day I came home with a shirt inside out. I did think it was odd, but I didn't question it. Fast forward to like January, and my mom wakes me up before my alarm clock saying that my ""father's a lying shit and is sleeping with a whore etc etc"" Everything was true, and it was with the vile woman at the Hospital. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, because of my strained relationship with both mothers, and lack of a unified sort of family structure due to both of them in Middle and High school being overbearingly strict and rule oriented, and myself having ASD and recurring PTSD, I was lost. I have an instinct to protect my stepmother at all costs, and our relationship between Jan and now has been closer than it ever has. We'd close our calls with I love you, something she'd only do to her birth son, my older stepbrother, who I've always been intimidated by. She tells me how awful my father is and everything. Alongside this, I had a very toxic relationship with a woman who was so stubborn she got my newly licensed brother and I into a car accident because she didnt want her friend to drive her, or basically guilting me that she'd be homeless with her cat because her dorm was kicking her out, so she made me have her stay with me and my parents. She also had a fidelity issue, and she was a pathological liar, I would catch her sending nudes to random people, getting high and drunk and fucking around on tinder and just fucking me up even further. I ended it with her after 3 years a few weeks ago.

&amp;#x200B;

So tonight, my father was going to help me with applying to a new school, and I needed to pay $100 for the admissions, but I have $2.30 to my name, and it either goes to small groceries like pasta, eggs, bread, ground pork, my rent, my metro card, electricity/internet or my cat's food. But he bailed on me the second week in a row, I ask my brother where he is because he's not answering, my mom isn't either. I eventually hear from her, he's fucking with that whore again. So, I lose it and I text him about how he's destroying all of us. To which he replies that he doesn't answer to me and to grow up, and that I have no family, which is what they both said. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to go insane. I have to wait 6-8 months for therapy because I have no money, i'm wayyyy past the deadline to apply because of him, he has pushed everyone around us in our family so far apart that everyone's too pissed to talk to me, where I haven't done anything. And I need all of this to stop, but my father believes it's not my business and my mother's blackpilled saying there's no point. I apologize for the length, but do I have the right to maintain this family unit for everyone's expense? Am I wrong for trying to meddle in and try and get my family to stop killing each other? I've had a slight relapse of PTSD from my ex, and I often throw fits of rage and have uncontrollable thoughts of shit. I am legit going insane",27Apr2019,1
89,"I recently begun a job with a financial institution and they have a drug free policy, they don't accommodate medical marijuana cards.
I spoke with director of HR who was very understanding.
Because they have so many laws regulating against it because of the type of work they do and the need for workers compensation it's technically in the conference that they can test pre-employment, reasonable suspicion and random.

When speaking to me she made it very clear that she can't control what I do outside of the work place in y own time, if it's something she could accommodate she would but legally she can't, she made it very clear that if I ever appeared under the influence at my job that would considered reasonable suspicion and the report would be made and I would most likely be sent for a drug test.
But she also did state that while the random drug test information is in the contract it's there just in case they are ever told to enforce it by the company who basically insures them.

by all accounts it really seems that if I were not to be in a workplace accident and under the influence at work at any point time or give somebody reason to believe that I am- that is very unlikely I would ever be drug tested.
However it just like anyone else I am subject to the consequences of a positive drug test so I was just curious of what everyone's opinion would be if I were to do that on my own time and never at work.",27Apr2019,2

93,"TLDR on title.

**Background:**

I've been actively applying for work, and at the same time jobless for almost a year now after being laid off due to cash-flow issues.

The positions I apply for, well let me just say because of my years in my profession, they're looking for a specific fit. I've tried independently looking, and also seeking help from recruiters. And I do get to land interviews, and I have reached until the on-sites. The overall feedback I get is that I was one of the top applicants, but they moved forward with someone with the skills that closely fit what they're looking for, and I get that a lot.

**The situation:**

I applied for this company (we'll call it *COMP*) on January this year through a recruiter (we'll call it *RECRUITER*). The interview went well: I was able to answer their thought-provoking questions, impress their assistant VP, and speak with their president all in the same day. The recruiter called me up the next day and said that *COMP* loved me, and that they were going to give me an offer that week. The week ended, and *RECRUITER* called and said they'll have one ""early next week"". Then that week was over, and nothing.

4 months later, I'm still waiting. I've been calling them every other week for an update.

*RECRUITER* was consistent with their updates. They've told me on a couple of occasions that *COMP* was waiting for a client to go on-board so that they can give me an offer.

Last month, *RECRUITER* said that *COMP* has not forgotten about me, and will look into giving me an offer later that week. But I'm kind of used to them not fulfilling that.

However, this whole month though, it's been quick brush-offs like ""I'll give them a call and I'll get back to you ASAP."" Then they never call back..

**So here goes..**

Please understand that I haven't halted looking for work; I'm still looking. But in this whole year of searching, *COMP* is the closest company to actually taking me, and I don't want to miss that opportunity! If it's about getting that client, I'm willing to wait!

This is what I'm pondering right now: If I sent an email to *COMP* just to express my continued interest on working with them, would it be a breach of trust/communication with *RECRUITER*?

I have the hiring manager's @gmail address through LinkedIn.

I’m seeking advice for the current situation or predicament I’m currently in. To give you some background on me, a month after I tuned sixteen, I had a freak accident and suffered a minor TBI(Traumatic Brain Injury)/Severe Concussion. Due to the injury, I ended up getting a few conditions that resulted in me doing a month long stint in a hospital, seven lumbar punctures, and physical therapy due to muscle atrophy, and the ungodly amount of medicine I’m on.

101,"To shorten the post, let's just say the friendship I'm stuck on ended around 2 years ago. We knew each other for over 10  years, and while it wasn't a particularly great friendship as far as us being a good thing for each other, we had crazy good chemistry/communication. We got each other. However, they treated me badly, I treated them badly at times in return. It was meant to end for the greater good of us both. 

The only problem I'm having moving forward is.. I can't or won't connect with anyone else the same way. I've had the chance to get to know plenty of good people since then, but it only ever amounts to small talk and then going our separate ways. The potential new friend goes back to what I assume is their close personal friends, and I go back to the... memory that I once had that too. I've also considered that maybe I reached the age where it's just way harder? ( I'm almost 34 )

It's tiring to put so much energy into thinking about someone who is long gone, and I do it almost every day. Anyway, ultimately I'm hoping someone has some advice on how to shake the past off a bit, and learn to look forward to meeting new people again?",27Apr2019,1
102,"Neeeeeding advice.... I'm (23 F) extremely ""stuck in a rut"" as they would say. I feel stuck in a routine and I am needing major change. Working, cleaning the house, going to the gym, and doing other small, random things. It's the same thing every single day. I've always loved to travel and thats my major passion, however life makes that hard to enjoy. I would like to ideally move to another state to explore and get out of this rut, but I have a boyfriend of four years that wants to stay in our home state and I have a family (parents and siblings) that lives here, including my growing four year old sister. I don't want to miss out on her growing up and I also love my boyfriend entirely. I know deep down that I would regret it if I didn't explore more with traveling and just jumped into having a family of my own with my boyfriend. How do I manage getting the ""best of both worlds"" so to say? How do I get out of this rut? I'm open to all suggestions and advice.",27Apr2019,1
104,"Hello guys, and thanks in advance for paying attention to this post. So my situation is something that is keeping me up at night, by the time I’m writing this it’s 4 a.m. and I’m desperate. So here goes. I’m a 19 year old guy, living in a pretty bad country in Europe. Money is scarce, it’s hard to get by, the mentality that people push is just non sense, and there’s a lot to handle especially in this age where i’m not considered an adult but I’m not considered a teenager either. High schoolers have really toxic perceptions of life and are just all around depressing to hang out with, so it was hard for me to make friends as I had gotten bullied in elementary school, got beaten by several guys several times as a kid and sometimes even have had stuff stolen from me. Money, accessories or stuff like that. As hard as it was, I managed to make some real best friends in my first year of high school and I had the literal best year of my life in the second year of high school. These guys hold a dear spot to me, as it was hard to find genuine good guys to keep friendships with. Little context, one of them is a drummer,18 years old, studies music, last year of his high school. The other two best friends I met in first year were friends from my elementary school and they were even back then close to me but I was just too shut off from the world. I’m a really clear and cut to the case guy, I never mean harm for my friends and I always say stuff to their face, I’m frank, I’m truthful and I’d put everything in my power on the line to help them get better, so shortly put, I’m a guy who doesn’t really match with a lot of people but when I do, I hold them dear to my heart. The weirdest thing about me is that I’m an extrovert, I enjoy a big number of people to hang out with, gets me in a good mood a lot easier, and I love being social and having conversations as long as there’s a point or there’s a vibe to it, so I don’t say boring stuff just to keep the convo going so i can fill the room with words, but i’ve been told that am funny and witty, because I always make remarks about my best friends (the only people who I hang out nowadays in my life) when silence prevails. Sometimes I call the manliest guy in my circle apple peach, silly I know, for no reason, just so I can get a laugh out of him. I also make compliments on a whim, especially when there’s ice to break, and I’m smooth on it. I said a lot but i feel like this will provide the necessary context. Anyway, throughout third year of high school (the last year) a lot of stuff happened and they changed my life for the worse, but I’m still sorta positive about life. Dealt with depressive thoughts and anxious phases, but not medically checked so i can only say that by what I’ve read online and what I’ve felt. So in third year we had three new “additions” to this best friend group (note:they also consider this circle their closest, it’s not one sided). One of them was a guy who seemed cool at first, but once you’d get to know him, he was full of ego and negativity about others, and at one point of my life i’ve been extremely arrogant (luckily haven’t tried “crushing” anyone with that but I thought of myself really highly and to my surprise, when I did that, things worked out for me so i kept doing it until i felt i was detached and unhappy emotionally and spiritually)
The other friends in my group are mostly introverts and they’re not confrontational nor direct, however I call out bullshit quick, which resulted in me having fights with him every time a debate was brought up. We’d argue a lot, and objectively speaking he wasn’t very smart, I cannot recall an instance I lost a debate to him. However he kept encouraging my other friends to go against me in a subtle way and would interpret my frank and direct remarks as offenses to express my dominance (note I never compare others to myself, especially in this circle). This went on for a while behind my back, the older friends told me, i confronted him and the guy said he would leave the group, never admitted his mistakes but literally said “if you believe I’m so toxic than I’m out”. I was hurt because I really trusted him, I just thought of him as a guy who life hadn’t beaten up yet and had a childish headstrong nature, instead he was a schemer to feed his own ego. I was hurt, and the other friends stood by me. Now another addition to this group (came 2 months after the first guy I mentioned but was fully present during the events),I’ll call him J, became a close friend. In the course of one year together we’ve grown extremely close, been going to lengths for each other etc. He’s been through stuff, his father lives abroad because of work and he was clearly neglected as a child and a teen. He was extremely quiet but I can make good people open up and we had a good friendship. However, he’s really ignorant, unrealistic and naive. And I really don’t mind in day to day life but when it comes to debates, he feels like he can put his foot down and he’s right when it couldn’t be further from the truth. So J is also an introvert, a good hearted kid, almost 18, extremely shy, no girlfriend in his 18 years of life, works on saturdays, doesn’t have a lot of money, has a knack for math but lacks motivation, effort and brains to go through with anything really. And since I’m confiding this info and talking realistically, he’s a scaredy cat. We once got stopped walking in a bad neighborhood, there were literally 20 guys posted up, seemed 16-18 y.o., they called him to go over to them while we (four friends) were walking, not even looking at them. They were pretty rude when they called him, he froze, his tongue was tied. Me and the other two guys walked a few steps not realizing they called him, and I turned around (I’m hyper-vigilant to aggressive cues, a study showed that it comes from violent bullying, so I can pick things up in the air, sometimes I and my friends call myself a prophet for calling out stuff that have no proof). One of the guys was doing a “tough guy” walk towards J, so I walked back, put my back in front of J, face off with the tough guy and looked him dead in the eye, no words. There were 19 guys behind him but I have no sign of fear, and he told me he wasn’t calling me, I told him that he could tell me anything he wanted to tell J. I also raised my voice and was “mean mugging” the hell out of the guy (note: I’m 6’2, have fought over 50 times in these sorta scenarios, have lost a lot of those fights but I got a lot of experience, pretty confident in my power, and I also worked out about a year in my life in the gym but i have an athletic build. 6’2 is pretty tall where I live, not giant, but obviously quite taller than the average. So I had enough arsenal to scare them off). The tough guy’s friends intervened and separated us, but when we walked away he came close to me with a rock in his hand and asked me if I was a tough guy. I answered that I was very tough. We took five steps, staring off, then got separated again, he was a pussy and there was no way he would hit me. The reason they stopped us was because they want to know if J was the brother of a girl called Jo (that’s how he calls his sister in everyday life, not her full name) and he denied that. His sister is 15 and the guy who stopped us was in the same class as her. He didn’t even stand up for his sister and for all I know I could’ve been stabbed that day, still considered the option. Now I didn’t push him further, I knew J was scared but I thought he would outgrow it. Now he starts acting slick with us close friends which is cool, but doesn’t do it in everyday life with others. So I had a debate with him. We are gonna go to the cinema to watch endgame with my girlfriend and her friends, and there this buy one get one free deal.  You have to have a coupon. Anyway, he said that he has a coupon and that another friend who would buy the ticket would get him the free one by using the coupon. My first friend (the one I got close to in first year of highschool, imma call him E) told him that they both would have to pay half the ticket. J didn’t understand why he needed to pay, he wasn’t complaining, he genuinely didn’t get why. I facepalmed, E laughed, and the other friend (the guy who studies music, calling him M) just laughed as well. E took his time explaining it slowly and with logic why he had to pay half, and he didn’t understand it even though E explained it three times. I cut this whole thing off and said well you know whAt, we need to send you back to your intellect level in elementary school, of course, mockingly but jokingly, no ill intent. He laughed and called me and E dumbasses, and I told him seriously that he was the dumbass, literally. I also told him that he’s really ignorant, and to that I continued by saying that he didn’t have good social skills because of that, lacking awareness and knowledge. He laughed. I told him it was no laughing matter cause I literally pointed out all the problems he doesn’t try to fix and he just laughs to himself. It’s a form of mockery to yourself” i continued. He said yeah right. I’m not one to close stuff prematurely, so of course I continued. I told him that I’m gonna give him some books, better read them, use his brain for once and probably become a grown human being. And I said this in a really hitting tone to rial up his sense of pride so that I could push him to do something with himself. He replied:” yeah, I know how much you’ve read, and where are you now?” 
He laughed (not to provoke me he just thought of it as a big joke), and M, E and me went silent. Here’s how my story is. High school where I live is unnecessarily hard, we still had the ex soviet education system when I was in high school, so a lot of demand and hard to get a grade since I was in the capital city’s school that held the highest results in main subjects like literature, english, math etc. Plus the system required that students choose two advanced subjects on top of the 13 subjects we already had. So one of my picks was advanced literature, I loved literature, my mom’s a literature teacher, she gave ne dante’s inferno and I read it since I was 11 (barely comprehended and really made me have trouble in real life, not a smart choice from my mom) but it was the sorta sink or swim for me and I swam. I also loved books, and advanced literature required from 4-7 books to read a year, sometimes even 10 but a big margin were neglected by teachers so not the whole ten books had to be read, but the main ones were a must. Meanwhile we covered approximately 12 books and fragments in literature as it was, and at my 2nd year I read around 20 books a year. I really enjoy them, and I’m a fast reader, plus a lot of my baggage comes from books. However you cannot get money being a writer here, won’t work, and I always loved movies and I thought of them as visual literature. I wanted to go to America to study film, but my parents were super against it, they wanted me in my home country and said I was too young and immature, plus going on the other side of the ocean is practically losing a son to them. However it became like a dream of mine that I realized I had recently found. So i went into a legitimate institution representing colleges in america, we talked about my grades, the degree i wanted etc. by their standards, I had a partial scholarship to study film in Orlando (btw my average grade if highschool is probably a B or B+, somewhere there. All food and accommodation included, I also had the opportunity to stay three years after college in US to get a job and a job contract, probably a green card after that as well. I did all these negotiations without my parents knowing, so when i told them, all hell broke loose. They called it outrageous, childish, and immature. They said every college in america is mediocre. They would never send me there etc. so I said that’s my dream and I want to. They said forget dreams, think about studying in Germany, colleges are free there. And pick a real job. It hurt me. I also didn’t get enough money compared to my peers, and everytime i got money and we’d have a fight (about whatever the topic where I was against thwm) they’d say we put a roof on your head, food on your mouth, and make your every single wish come true, and you dare speak like that. Going on to call me crazy, a piece of shit, telling me that with my thoughts I would never become a worthy person. So long story short, I haven’t asked them for money in over a year, and I’ve struggled with meals as well because of that, didn’t go to prom because that money would get used against me, and all in all my life fell apart. Now my dad’s an engineer in an important company, head engineer in fact, mom is a teacher who finished top of her class, and they had the money to pay for my college, they just didn’t want to let me leave because of their immature behavior. ( i know how much the college costed, wasn’t all that expensive because food and accommodation were included, and I know how much my parents earn. They just didn’t want to, and I would have paid em back once I had the money. I didn’t go through with college here, it is shit and you still need connections to get a job after you get a degree. I know that my parents wouldn’t help me on that but even if they were forced to or did for public image’s sake, that would be used against me till they died. So Right now I’m doing youtube, so far so good, not too much just enough not to ask for money. When they found out that I wouldn’t go to college, my mom forced my dad and pushed him to talk to me and “get my head straight”.  My dad was all serious and aggressive, we never were close, he used to beat me till I became a teen, he told me that he’d kick my ignorant ass out if I didn’t pick a college. He said I didn’t make a good enough effort and that my life would be a waste. Because of being somewhat detached I hadn’t cried in 4/5 years, I told him that if I had no place in his house than so be it. I went to my room and cried, so much that my whole body was shivering. Couldn’t even explain to my girlfriend properly, just told her by text that I’m getting kicked out and continued crying. Got ready to hit the streets and while crying I was making a plan in my head. I wasn’t gonna show up on anybody’s door that was a certain. My mom came, saw me crying and said don’t worry,do what you want with your life. A bit too late tho. I didn’t end up moving out, hadn’t asked my parents for money by the last five months of school, had saved every penny I could since eleven because I knew this day would come.  Now all of my closest friends know alll of this in detail,yet J told me that and the “PTSD” kicked in me, I was stunned but I reacted in a moment and said “I’m headed to your mom’s p*ssy “ in an aggressive tone. This phrase can be taken as a joke and I didn’t wanna cut him deep, but I was dead serious when I said this non serious “joke”. A few weeks earlier he did the same with the savings topic, he never saves any money onthe side and I criticized him, he told me “you saved, where did that get you?”  I retaliated by saying that he was immature and that daddy was not gonna give him money forever. I also told him that he’ll never be a man if he continues like this (by not having a sense of foresight and independence). He cried the last time, he went to the bathroom of the cafe this time and cried, then left without even looking at us. Now, with all this verbal diarrhea said, I know we fought and last time I apologized and he didn’t bother. I sorta feel like a bully, but I never meant harm. And to think that a best friend would stab your most sensitive spot,(btw I still am not on my feet financially, I can barely get through while also paying for my husky’s medical stuff every three months, it’s hard and I save every penny I can. ) 
I do not wanna talk to him until he truthfully apologizes, but at the same time he’s a good guy and he’s a lost cause if he doesn’t have us best friends close, as he has no other friends and his family force him to work but don’t bother on really helping him. What’s the right thing to do here, should I take care of my resentment and “PTSD” (calling my situation this for the purpose of summary) or do I swallow my pride and dignity, be the one to reach out first and help him in hopes that he will one day understand and appreciate?
I love helping people but I hate it when I get stepped on. Please help me and sorry for wasting your time with all of this.",27Apr2019,1
105,"So in order to fully understand the situation, I'm going to give some background. I am currently thirteen years of age, living at home with my brother, (22) Mom (47) and Dad (50). My brother was physically abused and yelled at a lot by my parents quite a bit as a young child up until he became 18. As a result, he now has a toxic personality, quick and ferocious temper much like my father, and is a huge brat as well as egotistical, traits he acquired from my mom. Since he graduated (barely) from high school, he has dropped out of college after 2 years, has gone through various jobs and been fired from all of them, or left on his own accord. These jobs include Dairy Queen, American Eagle, Amazon, Taco Bell, and Chipotle. In the months between these jobs and in his free-time, he is always, and I mean ALWAYS on his computer and phone in his bedroom, watching videos, talking to random people on discord, surfing the internet, etc. Occasionally he comes down to play piano, but I will address that issue later. Otherwise, he will sleep, come down to eat for a few minutes, but then immediately go back upstairs. A few months back, he got ANOTHER job at Costco. My parents are, not surprisingly, unhappy with how his life is going, seeing as they're Asian parents and had high expectations of him growing up. (They've given up since then because of the numerous amounts of hitting, screaming, and fighting they have gone through.) Now, they just let him do whatever he wants, and if they even try to push him a little bit to do something, he will scream in their face to shut up, go away, or flat out say no to their requests. Often, he will get angry like my father very fast as I mentioned before, and it makes the whole house tense, unhappy, and leaving me usually unable to focus on homework/studying. This has inflated to be a huge issue recently as I have become extremely busy with school, swimming, theory class, violin lessons, badminton, and overall life in general. Because I have a limited amount of time once I get home, it doesn't help if everyone at my house is arguing  or fighting. Next, there is my father. He grew up in China on a farmland where his parents were also physically and verbally abusive, with his father dying when he was just 21. He is a hard worker and currently an engineer who makes over 100,000 K a year and has provided us financially. (Which I am grateful for) However, this is defeated by the fact that he has a terrible temper, used to scream his head off at my brother, argued and yelled at my mom every single day, and has made life miserable for me through his methods of raising me. At just 6 years old I was introduced to League of Legends by my brother, (Yes I know not the best game to play at 6) and I became pretty addicted. My dad hated this game as he saw it as a virus to my future and thought I would end up like my brother as a result. Right now, it may sound like my father isn't a terrible guy. He seems to have good intentions but maybe just has a quick fuse and might not know how to parent super well. Honestly, I would agree. He isn't a bad person, its just a horrible situation with him being the main attraction. But back to the main story. Over the years, the situation has escalated to the point where he and my mom made an appointment with teachers and social workers to talk about it. My mom also regularly threatens to call the cops on me when she gets angry (which is often) and actually did call the cops, but that was for taking her phone (dumb yeah I know) but also for ""hitting"" her because I wouldn't let her turn off the router. Additionally, they have gotten the help of their close friends, people in church to try and sit down to talk to me about how my parents know what they're doing and the same argument of ""They're your parents and you are their child, you have to listen to them."" You would probably agree with these people, seeing as I'm the young and stupid child, and shove me off as some edgy teenager who wants pity and attention. I agree to some extent as I'm only 13 and I probably will look back at this moment 10 years later and have different opinions, but these people don't see and hear what I see and hear. Every single day it's just fighting, almost always over petty things like how tired my mom is and how shes doing all the work in the house. This argument can then escalate to my mom cursing at my dad, my dad getting physical and throwing and smashing things again, but then things cooling down until the next day, where the cycle repeats itself. Finally on to my mother. She is almost the root of all arguments, probably 90%. She usually will cuss and swear at my dad for something small or insignificant, to which my dad gets pissed and yells back. Additionally, not only does she use inappropriate language shamelessly and commonly every day, she will frequently direct them at anyone she is is angry at, even if it means telling her own child that they are useless and to go kill themselves. To add on, she is also extremely fake. In public, she acts as if she's an angel but at home she's a good for nothing, immature, lazy brat who causes nothing but problems. Although I do have to say a few things with my parents have mellowed out a bit and they no longer fight every day but instead have slightly more civil conversations. Whoo, that was long, (at least for me, took like 40 minutes to write). If you're still here I just want to thank you for making it this far regardless of if you take my side or not. Sorry for the tangent. But back to the story per usual. Right now, I have only just made this post despite having a toxic home situation for nearly 9 years for one reason. My brother. Now, he used to not be so bad. He always took my side against arguments with parents like a sibling vs parents type of thing. However, recently things have gone haywire. A couple of days ago, he was playing piano when I got back from swimming so around 9:00, something he could have done while I'm at school from 7:00 in the morning until 3:00 in the afternoon, or while I'm at swimming for 3-4 hours. (Instead he stays up all night to watch videos on his computer and talk to people on discord, causing me to be unable to sleep while HE has work the next day at 3:00 pm so he can afford to mess up his sleep schedule.) When I got home though, I was already annoyed because I had a bad practice and got yelled at by my coach. On top of this, I had a ton of homework and a test to study for the following day. So, I told him to stop playing, as I had to concentrate. He didn't stop. I ask again, a bit more demanding this time, saying that I have to study. This time, he stops. Unfortunately, he goes to grab a snack that I had bought. Now, this may not seem like to a big deal, but it was to me. This was food I had bought a couple days prior when I went grocery shopping with my mom, something that I hate doing, but I needed food. However, I was also angry because he always complained about there never being food at home when he comes from work. He yells at my mom for not making anything and goes out to buy some food at 10:00 P.M. On the other had, if my mom does make food, my brother always hates it and says it disgusting, which I find to be extremely rude, disrespectful, and repulsive behavior, especially from a 22 yr old young adult. He then goes out to buy food at 10:00 despite there being food at home. This almost always leaves wasted food that is either thrown away, has to be finished by my mom, who has already eaten dinner, or put in the fridge, never to be taken out again. Because of these things, I was mad that my brother had the audacity to take something that I personally took time out of my day to get. So, I went to the garage and got something from the freezer he had bought. For some reason, this is the thing that makes him snap. He puts his feet on the back my chair. I unsuccessfully try to pry them off. He then slams his foot against my chair after a few times, and goes on to get angry and say that he hates all of us, (me, my mom, and my dad) and that he will kill us someday. He then singles me out, and says that I am a spoiled brat. Out of all people, he's the one to say that. Then, in the most immature and arrogant tone, he says, ""Don't ever tell me to stop playing piano ever again."" A couple days later, today, he comes home from work while I'm half surfing Youtube and half doing homework. He comes over, stands over me, and starts to shove me off my chair forcefully. Then, he grabs my neck and squeezes it until it actually starts hurting. I start to get angry, cry, and try to push him off me, but he's 22 while I'm not even 14 yet, so I can't do much to stop him. He pauses, but like the arrogant failure he is, he calls me disrespectful, ungrateful, then immediately goes back to his room. I honestly don't know what to do at this point. My mom is on my brother's side seeing as she's scared of him, and my dad is too worn out from years of fighting to intervene. So now, I have a brother who constantly belittles me and bullies me while my parents turn a blind eye.",27Apr2019,2
106,"I have a lot of unresolved pain and guilt after a short friends with benefits relationship. I'm very scared of telling my therapist this (who is a lot older than me). For some reason, I'm scared she will judge me for having a sexual relationship if I were to tell her what happened. To add on, I'm in a rather Conservative country where sexual fun is generally frowned upon. I don't want to tell any of my friends what happened as well because I'm not that close to many of them, and the people I am close are going through their own struggles as well.

109,"Tl;dr: I live in a toxic environment but have guilt leaving due to the fact all my family members are disabled and I’m the “backbone” of the family

My mother is physically disabled, my sister was born premature and has a mental disability due to that (minor, to the naked eye she just seems very socially awkward) and they are very toxic to be around. Every day they’re fighting, even over the most irrelevant things. Whenever I come home from work I’m immediately greeted by negativity. My mom jumps at the opportunity to complain to me. I also have been forcefully assigned the “man of the household” role that has me as the one they go to to complain about eachother. I don’t want to do this anymore. Just tonight my mom stormed out, was sending me vaguely suicidal texts, and right when I notified the police she walked in. I’m happy she’s safe but she’s done this before and I’m so tired of this. I’m put in this father-like position for my own mother.

In 2016 I was given the opportunity to live in California with my grandmother, which I did, and moved back early 2017 because I missed my mom. The offer to go back is still there and it becomes more and more tempting every day.

However, my mother is getting older and has an early stage of cancer. I’m worried that if I leave her health will decline quickly and she’ll be left with my mentally abusive sister (yes she’s disabled but she’s a very mean person). I want my mother to be happy but I can’t give that to her. But if I leave I know she’ll be depressed.

What do you guys think? Am I a bad son for not roughing it out for my mother who, albeit toxic, has done everything in her power for my happiness? Or am I justified in feeling the need to remove myself from a toxic home?

Thank you for any advice",27Apr2019,1
111,"Hey! I’m an avid deep web user, and my friend- with no coding or deep web experience- just asked me for deep web links.

112,"I am a 20 year old guy and i have been wearing women underwear for a while and beeen keeping it lowkey. i never wanted anyone to find out from my friend circle or family. if people from a different town or country knew i didnt care. So i went to vacation to FRANCE which is a country popular for nude beaches. and a lot of men wear thong underwear there so i felt comfortable to do it there especially since i was alone on vacation in a country with no one i know. So i wore a thong for a week at the beach during my vacation and I tanned alot. HOWEVER, towards the end of my vacation i realized i had a HUGE AND NOTICEABLE panty tan line on my butt. So basically you can see the tan line of the shape of a thong above my butt. similar to the tan lines girls get from tanning in thong bikinis. So when i came back to home i forgot about the tan line and how it can be a dead give away that i wear thongs and one day i was coming out the shower and was a bit careless and didnt wrap a towel around my butt and my mom accidently walked in the bathroom to get something and saw my bare butt. BUT NOT JUST THAT SHE SAW THE OBVIOUS TAN LINE ON MY BUTT FROM WEARING THONG UNDERWEAR!!! so now she called me out on it and said why do u wear women panties and i just said it was my bathing suit and she now just simply thinks i have been lying and have alwasy been wearing women underwear. fml",27Apr2019,0

119,"TL;DR have exhausted what feels like all my options for a healthy life and don’t know what to do.

So—I have this job.

I’d say it’s slowly killing me but it’s not really very slow, more just that the only reason I’m still alive is sheer defiance which is quickly running out as it takes more and more out of me. It’s a mediocre job, the pay is pretty good but my supervisor acts exactly like my extremely abusive mother, so any time I fuck up, I start reliving my abuse in the middle of the workplace. This means I’m having PTSD meltdowns about once a week. Fairly recently I spent my entire morning thinking about committing suicide over my lunch break. I don’t really want to die, I just feel so hopeless about being in this situation that it’s hard for me to know what else to do.

I obviously need to leave, but I still need to pay rent. I’ve had trouble holding other jobs (my last two jobs entailed also getting screamed at for making mistakes, and standing for 8 hours a day when I have chronic joint pain) and my resume mostly consists of jobs that I quit because I couldn’t continue doing them that my mother forced me into—hard labor and fast food and the like. 

I have 11 months left on my lease before I have something else set up that will mean I don’t have to worry about any of this—the problem is that I definitely cannot last 11 more months at this job.

Things I’ve tried:

\&gt;Medication. I’m currently on medication that isn’t making me more suicidal, and I feel like I have more energy than I did when I started it, and my anxiety has gone down, but my suicidal ideation hasn’t gone down because it’s entirely situational and tied to my PTSD.

\&gt;Therapy. I saw a therapist who listened to my whole story and then started insisting that I spend money to go to community college in addition to my job with money and energy that I don’t have… to become an electrician. (I don’t know why she thought I’d be interested in this.) At the moment I don’t have the money to go back to therapy, and it’s hard to find therapists in my area that are available, let alone that are any good.

\&gt;Going on disability for PTSD. I was turned down, and it wouldn’t make enough money to cover my rent and necessities besides—even with SSI.

\&gt;Asking friends for help. Most of the responses I get are “I’m so sorry,” which just make me more upset, but I do have one friend who is insisting that I break my lease and come live with her. Breaking my lease would severely upset my current roommate, as it’d fuck him over, and it would ruin my ability to rent in the future, making me completely codependent on others, which I’m not comfortable with.

\&gt;Looking into other jobs. I don’t qualify for much, because my resume is pretty shit because I’ve only had shit jobs. I get regularly approached by Whirlpool and Geico on Indeed, but since I can’t stand for eight or more hours a day and I’ll start having breakdowns if I’m screamed at on the daily, these obviously aren’t helpful. I did finish college and get a bachelor’s degree, but it’s in a field that’s effectively useless without grad school, which brings me to my next point…

\&gt;Grad school. I looked into it, but I long missed the deadline for even this fall, and it’ll be irrelevant after that point. I’d also need it to be fully paid for or at least have a job built into it, as my family will abuse me severely for taking out any kind of loans (they paid for my college out of pocket with the implication that I’m financially indebted to them because of it; they never got me to sign anything saying I owe them for it so I don’t plan to because they’ve ruined my life and I intend to get as far away from them as I can as soon as possible, but while I’m still here I can’t cut off contact completely and my mother monitors my bank activity and demands life updates via phone call every weekend).

\&gt;Hospitalization. I was hospitalized back in 2012 for suicidal ideation against my will and the mental health system is terrible in my state. Being hospitalized would saddle me with a huge bill without helping me; as such, it would make my situation worse.

Any advice is helpful. I don’t want to do anything drastic but I genuinely can’t think of any other options and I want to see if anyone else can think of anything.",27Apr2019,1

121,"No TL;DR, I personally feel like this whole story should be read so I can get adequate advice.

&amp;#x200B;

So this started nearly a year ago. This was a relationship where we met online and was long distance. We met in a video game and started out as friends as they were in relationship at the time. That didn't work out and soon enough I was the next relationship. For 4 months. I was desperate, I got with them because I didn't want to be alone anymore but eventually I did fall in love with them

&amp;#x200B;

This was my first relationship, I know dumb of me to do online and long distance. There is no excuse for what I did but I didn't know anything. We never left the honeymoon phase. We would always talk about the future, marriage, kids, and what not, in the first 4 months. It was a rushed relationship, they did it because they felt it as right and about 24 hours after it began ""I love you"" came out. Big red flag I know that now.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet I was restrictive. I started a lot of the fights and arguments. I got mad over the littlest things. If they would post something with a heart emoji I would get upset. I knowingly tore them away from their friends for sometime. Recently I dedicated a week for us to isolate ourselves to each other. She talked to one of our mutual friends and I said ""You weren't serious, you aren't dedicated."" So I extended it for another week. This is where we are now. They took a trip to see their best friend who recently joined the Military. This friend has been in their life since birth. I have been for a year.

&amp;#x200B;

The one thing I feared from this visit came true. They caught feelings for their best friend after they stated ""I couldn't be a military S/O."" It was hard to let go but I obviously had to. After my begging and denial, the one thing I knew that would happen did. I lost them to the one person I knew I would. The points came up that they had thought about this for the day and it's what they wanted. That I put them an eggshells as the littlest things would always set me off. This was all true, but I was trying to fix it, countless times I nearly left but they kept fighting for me. Eventually they stopped fighting and it was too late for me to correct it.

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely had feelings for them. I did and still do but now I just don't know. I knew that this was never go to work, I just feel broken. I feel betrayed and that promises were broken. I both despite them and love them still. I hope they'll comeback but I know they won't and it'll probably be for the best. I know that this will all be forgotten but now it's just pain

&amp;#x200B;

This happened about an hour ago and I just feel lost. How do I come to terms with this? How do I can I quickly recover from this? How do I take what I have learned from my countless mistakes and apply them to better myself for the next time? I just need advice on how to move on.

125,"I am antisocial woman and I feel targeted at work. I am quiet and very kept to myself, so it was surprising and hurtful to hear what these girls have said about me. 

One thing though, I can’t go to HR because that’s where these girls went. These girls told my supervisors that they do not like doing the work that I leave (because I’m a part timer, I am allowed to leave my work for my coworkers to finish just like full time workers are allowed to leave their work for the next shift.) I work with government documents, so what is started must be finished whether that is my coworkers on my shift or the next shift taking over. HR, for some very odd reason, had my supervisors request to move me into a new department. I feel like I can’t argue my side because HR already went ahead and tried to pick a peaceful solution, even if I’m the one being affected.

All of this happened with my knowing. A nice coworker came up to me before I left and told me everything because he felt that I didn’t know about it to which he was right. I feel like I’m being treated as a problem child when I’m just doing my job. I try very hard to finish my box, but once my shift is over, it’s over.

This is the first time I had an actual conversation with him sitting down since I just kind of say hey and introduce stuff about me while walking to class. 

I noticed immediately he was kind of attracted to me, because he kept lowering his voice and kept exaggerating how he loved my laptop wallpaper which was the anime The Ancient Magus' Bride since he saw it. He was surprised on how short I was since he was really huge and how ""young"" I looked apparently, and etc.  I talked to him in club since he was pretty much the only other person who didnt always sit near someone, and I was fairly new in school, first week. Just immigrated. He seemed like a nice geek and all albeit with the signs of a reclusive person who does not use chat anymore. I had to ask him what he uses and he told me he could probably dl messenger or discord again...""If you want to..."" just to chat me.  I dont chat that much either. But I still kept messenger and discord to talk to my oldest friends and that one gaming community that was super cool.

Given the hypotheticals by the judge, using my condition as a factor, the VE came to the conclusion that I was unable to perform those jobs as well.

i live in the south so it gets hot and humid around april and continues til september, so i generally have more pajama shorts than i do pajama pants. i also wear american eagle boxers as shorts and pair them with a baggy tee for sleeping as it provides ultimate comfort for me in the hot months.

amanda (my bf's dad's gf) is really insecure according to my bf and fought with my bf's dad cause she feels like my clothes for pajamas are inappropriate to wear around the house, but i only stay in me and my bfs room or use the bathroom or go to the kitchen to get food. the house is weirdly setup (https://imgur.com/a/24FfCi9) so me and my bfs room is really supposed to be the dining room, i think. the only time i see my bfs dad is when he comes in the kitchen to cook. i rarely am ever in the living room, so we hardly ever see each other.

these are my thoughts: 

1. i pay rent and utilities to live here and its just as much my house as it is my bfs or his dads, so why not? no one had issues prior to this and even when i would sleep over before i moved in this was my pajama of choice

2. the boxers and baggy shirt are not revealing at all, i'm 5'9"" so i'm tall so the main thing i'm revealing when i wear shorts is just leg

3. amanda doesnt even live here!

147,"I will try to keep this as short as possible.  A little background.  I used to have a substance addiction problem, although I was able to become sober for  college.  I did really well and was accepted into a PhD program.  Unfortunately, during the start of the program my wife filed for divorce, my father passed away, I relapsed and went into a deep depression.  

I left my graduate program and my life spiraled out of control.  I lost everything and was homeless for a few weeks.  I slowly was able to work on my problems and get clean over the next couple of years.  I then rebuilt a life with my now fiancee, and I am working in a decent job that pays 50k a year.  

The problem is, I have ambitions to do so much more.  Given that I left my graduate program in disgrace given my inability to function properly because of my issues, I am fairly certain I will never get into another graduate program, especially a PhD program.  Is there any way for me to advance my education beyond my B.S. given my history?  Or am I relegated to forever working at the level I am at now with little chance for advancement?  

Intellectually, I know I am capable of so much more, but I feel I have no options due to my history.  Should I just accept my fate and be happy I at least have a decent job?",27Apr2019,1
148,"I'd like to pursue some educational goal, but I'm not sure exactly what to do and I'm looking for suggestions.  Some background: I'm in my mid 30s, and currently have an MBA and MS from well respected top-tier US research universities. I have a great and steady job. Senior management, but not quite C-suite. I'd like to get there eventually, but it probably won't happen with my current company.  My MS is in a STEM field and my job is as well.  I am also occasionally invited to lecture at a smaller university in my specific subject matter, and really enjoy my time doing this and would be interested in further expanding my role here.  I have three goals in mind, but I really don't know their priorities.  One is personal sense of achievement, second is a feather in the cap for future promotion opportunities/job hopping, and third is to expand my teaching options. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have some disposable income, but I wouldn't like to drastically change my lifestyle to pursue something, and I'm not looking to take on major student loan debt. I did pursue my previous graduate education while working full time, so I'm used to working and going to school.  

&amp;#x200B;

I believe I've narrowed things down to three possibilities.  Prior to going into the specifics I do want to mention that although I prefer an in-person learning format I think I'd have to pursue a distance learning format due to professional and personal commitments. 

&amp;#x200B;

First is a PhD/Doctorate.  I truly enjoy learning and feel like this could push me more than anything I've previously done. In addition this is the natural progression I'd need to expand any teaching opportunities at the university level.  I see three major downsides though.  First is this is time.  I'll likely be in my 40s prior to finishing, and I'm not sure I have the time to devote to this. Second is the availability. There are some online PhD programs from reputable universities, but not many. I would insist on going somewhere with at least a nonprofit mission, and online PhDs from nonprofit schools are still a bit rare.  Last is cost.  While many PhD programs are funded I don't think any online ones are, and looking at costs pushes them way above what I think I want to bear. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second is a third Master's degree. Again I like to learn and think this is a good level of achievement.  There are also loads of online master's programs out there. Some from very reputable schools. They also seem to have manageable time frames of one to two year commitments.  I do feel like this could devalue my current degrees though if I choose the wrong school (i.e. sacrifice perceived quality for time/cost) - but I also think it could just be fun to pursue a less expensive degree from a lesser known school.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally is a graduate certificate or a micromasters/nanodegree. These seem most tailored to a continuing educational goal.  I could also put forth the money to pursue one from a top name university.  However, I'm not quite sure how a micromaster/nanodegree/graduate certificate are actually viewed by others.  In my current role I see loads of résumés and to be honest I've never seen any of these listed as an achievement. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts or ideas?  If anyone has personal experiences with online doctorates from nonprofit schools I'd be interested in them.  Same with anyone who has pursued graduate certs/micromasters/nanodegrees.  If there's any further clarification I can provide to aid in advice let me know.",27Apr2019,1

150,"There is a tldr at the bottom for those that don't wish to give serious advice but understand the situation

&amp;#x200B;

I have several siblings in varying ages. The oldest of which (18-20) has always been the most supported and has had the most smooth experience growing up. However what this has caused is my sister is now used to everyone doing everything for her (mostly my parents but also including my much younger siblings.) 

&amp;#x200B;

My sister has a casual job which is very good considering her age and experience. Her boyfriend, who apparently has family issues, moved into the family house a while ago (less than a year ago) after staying here every few nights also has a well paying job and is a similar age. Now whilst rent can be expensive, in my area is not as bad as other regions. They both pay rent to my mother although it is no where near what actual rent would cost and often miss paying it or paying the full amount.

&amp;#x200B;

Now firstly let me just say I don't have that much of a problem with them staying here but more the way they go about it. I'm going to list stuff in dot points since I don't want to make this post even more convoluted:

\- they have so much stuff: their stuff is left everywhere throughout the house and it can't fit in their room even though it is the size of a master. Even though my mother has told them to clear it out they still haven't since my mother tends to straight up avoid conflict as she thinks it makes stuff worse when it's shown time and time again that her just 'letting it be' only makes the situation worse as time goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

\- They are both lazy but my sister is even more so. Now if she was working all the time I could excuse some things to a certain extent however it has really gone too far. Often plates, food items and just general mess are left by them for other to clean up. We have a dishwasher but for some reason putting things in an empty dishwasher is an extreme effort even after the 'massive' amount it takes to move it from where they were seated to the sink.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Rent. The rent is supposed to be money as well as helping around the house regularly. As in the above point we clearly see that it is not happening. If anything my sister does the opposite. My mum excuses it saying ""she works hard"" etc but in reality my sister will spend her several days off going out at night and spending the entire day in bed on her phone.

&amp;#x200B;

\- There are more specific things that I don't want to go into but are mostly her just outright ignoring whatever my mother has said.

&amp;#x200B;

So if they can afford to get their own place and my mother even thinks they should probably move out, why haven't they? Well, despite all the money they both make they are terrible with finances which wouldn't be my problem but it impacts me as well as the entire family. They waste their money on expensive wants which often sit around gathering dust whilst also racking up bills. Before my sister became an adult my parents had the financial stability to get themselves a new car (it was definitely needed as the old one was very old) as well as pay for things for a house and.. a car for my sister. Now my mother who has a good job is struggling financially and the situation is only worsening.

&amp;#x200B;

My other siblings are only young but they are good with their chores and I work hard myself around the house but often my mother likes to bring down the foam hammer on the collective group when in reality it is only an individual who is causing issues. Whilst it doesn't physically do anything to how I live it since my mother won't make any conflict, it is quite disheartening to be blamed for something I cannot control. I have tried to bring this up with my mother but she is mostly ignorant to the fact. She works very hard to give us a good life and I don't put the blame on her but I wish she would actually listen to the evidence that she is constantly being taken advantage of.

&amp;#x200B;

After all this I am pretty emotionally wrecked irl and within this post and so I can't really remember where I was going with it. I don't really no any possible options as I am too young to move out, couldn't afford to for very long either even if it was viable (i have a job but it isn't great and is a struggle for me at the best of times), I have tried several times to bring this up to my mother to no avail and my siblings won't move out since they wasted all their money and are considering a more permanent solution to living in the house which is beneficial to only them and yet my mother is still on board. I've considered suicide in the past and other extremities but I won't act on them. I have received support via doctors and such so please don't give me mental health advice if it doesn't affect the current situation.

&amp;#x200B;

This post probably sounds like I'm whinging, jealous or something else but I just ask for what you guys think could help the situation. In reality I have 0 power over anything that happens and I understand that but since it been almost traumatic for basically everyone involved I'm hoping that maybe you guys can help.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: My sister and her bf walk all over my mother and everyone else in the family home and are having what appears to be a lasting impact on the family. my mother thinks the situation is non-existent and is digging her own grave.

She slept on my head every chance she could, sat in my lap while I worked at my computer during the day, and was my ""bathroom buddy"" - always visiting when I went to the bathroom or showered. She was always there with me, and now I feel genuinely lost without her. She was talkative and so full of life, but now it's so quiet and lonely.

The garbage consist of ripped up chicken nugget boxes and half used sweet and sour &amp; bbq sauce packets, the whole mess sticks to the side of my car and windshield. Out of spite I go to the one who threw its car, and squirted a ketchup sauce pack on the windshield. I quickly drive off but not before they threw more sauce onto my car.

I turn my car around and see them waiting for me at the entrance hands full with god knows what. I speed up and zoom out the entrance making them jump out the way and they all bombard me with multiple sauce packets. I finally get away and go to the gas station for a car wash. Watching all around me to make sure they’re not around. At this point I didn’t want to take any chances so I leave the door open and car running so if I see them try to get me I hop into the car and drive off quickly. nothing happens. As I’m rolling into the car wash I hear “THERE HE IS” My heart DROPS. I’m inside the car wash and they have parked their car in front of the exit and are filming dancing and laughing. At this point I’m just trying to calm down enough to not run them over. I roll out of the car wash and they stand in the way and throw some soda and juice onto my car. BAM!

159,"So this girl and I stopped talking about 6 months ago. We had been talking for about 4 months. We are both currently in high school and I had a huge crush on her.

The Story:

I work in the back room of a grocery store. I manage everything coming in and out of the store that allows us to make money, including people. I'm considered a store manager on the payroll.
My area of the store, where I am stationed 80% of my day, is very close to the backstock area for the department this coworker is in.

I will call him Coworker.

After doing my job for a few hours, there was a lull in my workflow (most of my job is [ON] then [OFF] very quickly). I took the opportunity to have a little fun and joke around with a female coworker (FC).

I'm a technology person, so when she pulled out her phone to show me a picture of something, I was interested in the image quality. I took pictures of her standing in place with her phone and my phone to compare the images. We were at my station, where I spend 80% of my time when I'm on the clock.

Queue Coworker. He is a middle-aged African-American male. I am a 21 year old Anglo-Saxon male.

He wonders what we are doing, and looks at the pictures we are comparing. He looks FC and says ""Don't let him keep that on his phone! He will make it his wallpaper!""

I start laughing, because I thought it was funny. He was joking. If he wasn't, that would explain a LOT of the events that follow.

While I'm laughing, an old habit of mine kicked in (because I was in ""goof off"" mode during my break) and I said between laughs, ""That's racist, bro!"" It's a non-sequitur statement I make when something benign is happening. Intended to be a joke.

Coworker, who was walking away, turns around and asks me to repeat myself.

I immediately knew I made a mistake. I will go on record and admit that saying this was highly unprofessional, as it is generally a sensitive and controversial topic.

I informatively repeat what I said, and I begin to apologize if I offended him, because it was far from my intention to mean that he was actually being racist, and that I wasn't being serious.

I am interrupted before I can utter the words ""I'm sorry."" He proceeds to raise his voice and accuse me of being racist and says I would only say that if I was a ""big racist"", of placing a label on him, of putting his work and family at risk, tells me how utterly wrong it is to use that word (as if it is one of the absolute WORST things to ever say), and threatens to go to the HR department and get me fired. He was NOT interested in giving me advice. He was throwing a tantrum.

That took place over about ten minutes of my time, when I intended to continue working. I still had quite a bit to do before my day was over, but I had to endure his ten minutes of hypocrisy. I have seen him do the same things he accused me of doing many, many times.

Every single time I attempted to defuse the situation, he shut me up and proceeded to tell ME how I was thinking, and what kind of person I am, as if he actually knew me well enough to say that and as if he knew what he was talking about.

This really irritated me, because he would not let me actually explain myself to him and apologize, and he continued throwing accusations left and right. In my opinion, this speaks VOLUMES for his character, and shows how ignorant or deceptive he is. This is fuck-up #1.

While he was in my personal space, in my area, where I am required by my job to spend 80% of my day, he accused ME of harrassing him while I was FORCED to sit there and listen to him gaslight me. Every time I attempted to apologize and explain myself (which was maybe 3 times during his 10-minute tantrum and once more at the end of my shift) he accused me of harrassing him. What he proceeded to do was come BACK INTO my personal space and aggressively TELL me what I WAS THINKING nearly 4 times, without allowing rebuttal, which is fuck up #2.

During one of his intrusions of my personal space, he told me that FC (Female Coworker) was appalled, ashamed, and embarrased to be aquainted with me. This is fuck up #3.

While he forced me to listen to him, without being able to say a single word to defend myself, he informed me that he would, from now on, call me ""Child Molestor"" and ""Faggot"" to compensate for the fact that ""I called him a racist"", and defame me and spread rumors about the kind of person I am. This is fuck-up #4.

I will now explain numbers #1 - #4. Feel free to review the contexts with the corresponding numbers.

1. I said one thing by mistake, and he blew up and began behaving in an extremely unprofessional fashion. He derived slander and conjecture from three words I said. He continuously tried to rope me into a corner where I would have to admit that I called him a racist, proving all of his accusations to be true. Every time I was about to defuse and debunk his cancerous idea, he would shut me down. He was forcing me to answer him *in the specific way he wanted me to,* and repeatedly interrupted and spoke over me when he did not get what he wanted.

Every time he did that, I responded by asking ""This isn't a real conversation, is it? It's too one-sided, right?""

Most people probably fall into his trap, but I can see it miles away. I didn't want to give him what he wanted, because...

~drumroll~

He was gaslighting me.

 He did not stop asking me why I called him racist, when *I* was apparently racist, and refused to allow me to explain that, in fact, I did not call anyone racist. This 45 year old man begain whining and complaining like a small child, in the face of a person half his age.

""You aren't giving me what I want! *GET MORE ANGRY!*""

I did not become emotional during the situation. While I was irritated, I remained calm and composed. I am FULLY aware that this is a good way to make stupid decisions, and I was very cautiously controlling myself.

2. He was gaslighting by telling me I was harrassing him. I have noticed COUNTLESS times that people who do this will accuse you of doing things that they are doing, even as they do them. In reality, HE WAS REPEATEDLY HARRASSING ME. He came into my space, where I remained stationary throughout this entire altercation, and harassed me repeatedly, accusing me of digging in to the situation and stirring shit.

I only wanted to apologize and explain that he had the wrong idea.

3. When he began having his temper tantrum, I started recording everything with my audio recording app. This is legal where I live. He told me FC was appalled and no longer wanted to associate with me. He was trying to shame me. When I went and asked her if this was true, she told me she never said that, and that she wasn't offended by my behavior in the slightest. She went as far as to say that she couldn't comprehend why he got so upset about it, as she understood it wasn't a serious comment, and most likely wouldn't illicit a reaction like Coworker's even if it was to be taken seriously, as it is a completely unfounded statement. *If you read to the end, I will explain why I believe he was acting this way.*

Later, when I was reporting his absurd behavior to the higher-ups in order to prevent him from accusing me of things that will make me lose my job, he barged in to the office and swore I was making up lies, and that he would have NEVER reacted the way he did if we were messing around. I hadn't even begun to explain myself.

He went on record saying that he wouldn't have gotten that upset if he was messing around, *even though he was messing around with me when he started to gaslight me.*

This means two things: He is a massive liar (supported by my experience with FC), or he *genuinely thought I was going to make my phone's wallpaper a picture of her face, and decided to play it like it was a joke.* He has repeatedly done what I highlighted in bold, as he will say offensive things to me, and only me, then act like he isn't being serious. This is why I believe he is actually racist against me. He treats me like the kind of person who will go and shoot up a school. I am one of the few white employees at this establishment, and the only white employee under the age of 30. I believe he is taking advantage of his idea that I am ignorant because of my age, and knows that I refuse to take him seriously when he throws slanderous accusations and conjecture  my way. So I have basically allowed him to get away with crap like that until now.

4. I almost think this one speaks for itself. I wonder which one makes more sense - getting fired for accusing someone of racism (if that is to be believed), or getting fired for defaming someone by calling them a faggot and a child molester? And he claims it was his right to do that if I was going to call him racist. I messed up a little here, because I informed him that he would look very stupid if he went around saying those things.

Additionally, I was thinking, ""no, dude. It's not right for you to say any of this. It was wrong of me to think it was appropriate to mention racism at all, because people like you are sensitive to it. Unfortunately, you will not allow me to apologize and clear things up, so you must be looking for reasons to hate me, and hold on to your own childish ideas.""


*Since you have the full context, and have read to the end, I will explain my theory.*

Not less than two weeks ago, Coworker had an altercation with a long-time department manager at this store. In fact, this department head helped OPEN the store.

This man was highly respectable, very confident, and very competent. I did not know him very well (who really knows who they work with, right?), but I never got the impression that he would be unreasonable and racist during my year or two of knowing him. Let's be honest; anyone who is prejudiced for no reason is, by definition, *unreasonable*, and this man was not unreasonable.


Immediately after this altercation with Coworker, Department Manager was fired ""for being racist"" after his decade+ of contribution to this establishment. Coincidentally, this man was also Anglo-Saxon.

It is my beleif that Department Manager fell victim to Coworker's gaslighting, lies, and provocation.

I was repeatedly accused of attempting to ""create my own story"" and ""putting a false spin"" on the situation before I had even begun explaining myself to the head manager. He then told his own twisted version of the story, about how I was expecting my Female Coworker to ""play along with me when I called him racist"", and how he doesn't understand why I'm in here reporting him becase I was the one who was harrassing him and calling him racist.

I believe he is acting this way, IN ENTIRETY, because he is extremely racist towards white people and is, in fact, a very close-minded individual. I realized after this incident that I am sick and tired of his idiocy.

Never before in my life have I felt genuinely harrassed. I normally brush things like that off as annoying, and I think that harrassment is a fancy word for ""this person is irritating.""

I didn't even realize what harrassment was supposed to be, and how it can be problematic, until today.

I am infuriated by his entitlement and his deception. He says many offensive things, and he gets away with it by acting like he's just messing around. But when I say something potentially offensive while I'm messing around? It's almost as if he's thinking ""Someone took the bait! I've got him now!""

This is the kind of person who will rope you into a corner by asking you questions that require yes/no answers, but only to find the specific few answers that support his point of view, while refusing to listen to aditional information that will change his mind.


How can I document this, so I have a case against him at work? I will only take action against him if he becomes unreasonable like this again. I have no intention of stirring shit up when there aren't any problems.

I have no experience with this. *ANY* advice is welcome.

I could've sworn this was against one of their policies, but I got an email saying that the account was not in violation of anything. And it's not just that one account either.

Small mole on my arm looks abnormal? Even though it’s looked like that forever? I will spend the next two hours researching melanoma. I will think about how terrible it is that me and my fiancé will never get to get married because I’ll be dead in the next year. I’ll lose sleep over it. 

When a medical bill comes in the mail, I immediately assume that we’re going to end up homeless. I have to spend hours writing out our budget multiple times to ensure that we can pay it (we’ve never actually been short on rent). 

If I miss work once, even if I have 0 attendance points and I’m legitimately sick, I hate myself. I’m lazy, I’m abandoning my coworkers, and my supervisor hates me. 

I think everyone hates me, even if there is no legitimate reason for them to hate me. Even if they do something so little, like them phrasing something a certain way. I always think I’m the “odd one out” in any group activity. 

Last week I got so upset with my fiancé because he spilled something in my planner and I couldn’t just keep it there. I had to rewrite the whole page and rewrite it again when one of my words looked wonky. It has to look perfect or else I will think about it all day.

175,"Throwaway account because I have friends on main. Anyways me and this girl have been in the same class since grade 7 we are in grade 12 now. We added each other on Snapchat when we had a group project or something years ago and last year we started snapping back and forth. Basically just small talk and photos of nothing.  And she gave some hints she liked me last year but then after a while it wasn’t going anywhere and we stopped talking all summer. 

  She’s in my fitness class (basically just working out for a hour and a half) this year and I kinda developed a crush on her, I’m pretty fit and am kinda a show off in class with pull-ups and bench press and all that.  I was hoping she would notice but I’m not sure if she does. I asked to start up a streak again and we went back to the same bs small talk and shit. 

  We haven’t talked a ton in person but sometimes I’ll make a joke with her and she laughs but we don’t talk a ton. This week she hasn’t been snapping much even though she’s usually on her snap quite a bit. Like she wouldn’t open for a day almost when we were just sending nothing pics but when I tried starting up a couple convos about mutual interests and she seemed interested and would snap back right away.

  Any advice on how to move forward? I am always shy when I first meet a girl but idk why I can’t just go and talk to her normally. I have dated a couple girls before and I’m pretty loose and outgoing once I get going but I can’t seem to get over my nerves this time.",27Apr2019,1

177,"TL;DR My mom and stepdad are divorcing; he’s trying to take everything from her. 


My mom married my stepdad when I was four and he came to live with us (my mom, older sister, and I). It’s important to know that our house has always been in my mother’s name only. 

She’s been married to “Glen” for 17 years now. He’s cheated on her multiple times without her knowledge (until recently), he never paid any bills (except his car/phone)  or helped with housework. He just drank his disgusting, homemade beer and smoked his meat. 

My mother isn’t an angel but she has a gentle heart and loves easily. It took her too long to kick Glen out. They’ve been separated just under a year and a half. 

Recently my mom had been making her way towards divorcing him: meeting with a great lawyer, talking with other women in similar situations, got the house personally appraised and she even applied for a loan to fix some parts of the house that are falling apart. 

Not even a week later, a sheriff comes to our door with a summons from Glen, saying my mother owed him permanent alimony because when she “kicked him out” he was “dependent on her.” 

Let me explain the truth. Glen is a travel nurse. He takes contracts where he wants in the country and travels there to work (at a higher than normal pay rate). 

When mom asked him to move out of her home, he was in between contracts, living in our house and doing absolutely nothing. Granted, he was waiting for my mother to join him on his next contract. 

My mother, luckily, came to her senses and realized she couldn’t live with the man let alone in smaller travel spaces. We both stayed with friends for 3 weeks while Glen got his stuff out. Half of it was still there when we got back and mom told him he was welcome to come get it if he contacted her beforehand. 

There are a million other things I could tell you about him that would make you cringe. But with this summons, he’s ruined my mom’s chances for a loan at the moment. She’s terrified about being able to afford thousands of dollars in legal bills. Every time I see her, she’s on the verge of tears. It’s breaking my heart. I know it’s a reach but if anyone has any advice at all, it’s tremendously appreciated.",27Apr2019,1

I have bad blood with these people already.  And all of my in laws think this was me.  It wasn't, which is great, but I am not sure how I can prove it wasn't me. 

I've considered getting the phone number from HR or talking to them to verify to my BIL that it wasn't me because of my voice or something.  BUT, he was fired so they might not be helpful or understand the strain this is putting on family ties.

I've been at my current job for 4 years now and I wouldn't consider anyone I work with a friend. Just coworkers. I only work about 16-20 hrs a week.

I'm a woman about to turn 36, I've had two five-year relationships but one was long-distance and the other was good but just didn't progress. I've been single for 11 months, my last relationship was just two months, and I rarely get to meet men let alone date with potential to find a real partner. I don't believe in marriage but I do want a long-term monogamous relationship, I'd like a child but that seems unlikely to happen. 

It just strikes me that everyone my age seems to be married with children, or have at least been married - even if it doesn't work out, they've still found love enough that someone has wanted to commit to them or have kids with them.

I feel there must be something fundamentally wrong with me that I've not found that, I worry about what it says about me that no one wants me that way.

184,"Hey guys. I’ve posted this on a couple of relationship focused subs, as I’m really looking for as many perspectives as I can get to heal. I would really appreciate any honesty around what the guy I’m talking about was actually thinking and what the fuck happened, because I’m really struggling as I had no closure.

Around the beginning of March, I (27F) met a guy on Tinder (27M). Knowing this app pretty well, I had absolutely 0 expectations around what would happen or what I wanted. We met, and couldn’t keep away from each other after that. 

I noticed from the beginning that he was intent on moving very slow. Based on my experiences with Tinder, this whole experience was definitely unusual for me. He took me on proper dates. Our first kiss wasn’t until the third date, and he told me, right around the fifth date when things got a bit hot and heavy, that he felt like he “wanted to take things slow” with me because he “likes me” and “doesn’t want to mess up.” He also said I was “exactly his type”. 

It was really hard for me to hold out getting intimate with him because the sexual tension was really extreme. We didn’t have sex until probably the third week, and when we did, it was amazing. 

But often, after the first time, when I wanted to initiate, he’d pull back as though he was trying not to, and eventually give in. Confused, I asked him if we could keep being more intimate like that, and he said he didn’t want it to be the only we do, because he didn’t want us to be a “transient thing” and again, wanted us to “take things slow.” He also said he didn’t sleep with people often, unless he was really sure about them, and that he really liked me. He told me so many times, that he had real feelings for me. 

At that point, I asked him if he was looking for something casual or a relationship, and he basically got defensive and asked if I was giving him an ultimatum. I said I wasnt, that I liked him too, but just wanted to be on the same page. He wouldn’t give me a straight answer, only that he wanted to “take things slow” and that he was the “slow burn type”, and that he really liked me, and that I was different.

I assumed, after this conversation, that he wanted a relationship. I decided to let my guard down, and I started to develop feelings. His birthday rolled around, and I got him a little birthday cake and invited him over for dinner that week. 

After that, things got really weird.

He went away for the weekend, and when he returned, invited me to his birthday party, introduced me to his friends and family. The night of his birthday, when we were alone in his room and cuddling, he told me out of the blue, as I was about to fall asleep in his arms, that he “didn’t want a relationship.” I got upset. He said he had feelings for me, but that we were “moving too fast” and he “still wanted to see me sometimes” but “needed things to be less intense.”

After that night, he got cold. He didn’t text me that following week, and I asked to see him to talk. When we met up, he was extremely distant, didn’t want to hug or kiss, or anything. He said he didn’t want anything with anyone right now, felt we were going “too fast”. I asked him if he had feelings for me, and he said yes.

Two weeks went by, and he didn’t text me. I sent him a “how are you?” text, and he never replied. I was so hurt. We went from texting everyday and seeing each other every week, to him ghosting me.

I tried going out with my friends to get my mind off of him, and ended up drunk calling him two weeks later. I asked him to just honestly tell me if he was over whatever we had. He replied with “friends would be great, I just was afraid we were moving too fast.” 

Obviously confused by this reply, I asked if we could catch up, and he replied “I don’t think that’s a good idea.” I asked him why not, and that I just wanted to see him. He replied - “I need you to respect my wishes here. I don’t want to pursue anything right now.” 

I didn’t respond, and I am hurting so much. I am going no contact, but the pain of no answers, the confused memories, and wondering what I could have  done to have made him stay, is killing me. 

So, guys, I guess what I’m wondering is: what actually happened here? If he didn’t want a relationship, and he didn’t want to just have sex, and he didn’t want to be friends, what the hell did he actually want? Why did he even bother telling me he has feelings for me and that he didn’t want it to be “transient”? Why did he pull away and ghost me? Just literally, WHY?

Thank you to anyone who answers this. I really would appreciate any honesty but please be kind. I’m just so hurt.",27Apr2019,1

187,"Hi guys,

Apologies for long post and for it being on mobile. Posting on a new account because I’m worried about this being linked to me, for reasons that might become obvious below. I’m really nervous about posting this. 


I’m really worried about my sister, whom I love very much, and am at my wits end about how to help her and to make a difference in her life. 

My sister is 27, currently unemployed, and is morbidly obese to the point where she has real difficulty getting around and taking care of herself (she’s 5’4 and upwards of 450lbs). It should be said here that I HATE fatphobia in all forms and am strongly body positive, but my sister’s been told that she’s on the verge of diabetes by a doctor, her weight is literally immobilising her at this point and she’s really struggling to lose any of it even though she says she wants to. It’s a major factor in her daily life. She has serious personal hygiene and self - care issues mostly because of the impedance of her weight and her depression. She also has BED, really bad anxiety, PTSD and is on the autism spectrum (symptoms are those of what used to be called Asperger’s) She lives in the UK, and while some of our family live close to her and see her in person regularly my mum and I aren’t currently able to (we both live and work elsewhere for the moment and can’t currently relocate back to the UK, although we get back as much as we can.) 

Her symptoms of everything seem to have become much worse in the last few years - since she was 24 or so. She was able to live alone and manage her space and her money quite well before this. She is perfectly capable (or previously was) of looking after herself - she is reasonably socially competent and good in workplaces (just a little awkward around groups and new people, but so am I), and the only intellectual impediment to her working life is that she  has an unusual form of dyslexia where she reads extremely fast and fluently but can’t spell or do much maths. Things only got bad (and even then gradually) about three years ago, after she dropped out of her third attempt at a university course and began working in a couple of different retail jobs and living alone.

She is really adamant about wanting to live alone and be independent, but is so self-isolating that myself and the rest of my family worry about her all the time. She has almost no friends, and the people she does see only seem to enable and indulge her binge cravings and  bring over alcohol and other stuff she knows she shouldn’t be around when she’s depressed and anxious. She’s always had trouble making and keeping friends, but it hasn’t really seemed like a life-altering problem for her before.

She’s been doing better recently, but before every time we visited her there would be tears and anger as we cleaned up a very unlivable apartment - she hoards wrappers and cans and things to an unsafe degree, and doesn’t wash herself or her possessions very much. She’s stayed with family members before, when she’s been feeling really depressed, but has made those spaces very dirty and smelly too, and in general has such a bad attitude about sharing space with anyone else that the situation can’t remain tenable. She has a very bad temper, especially when she’s not feeling good. We (me and my partner, and my mum, who lives in another city in the same country) have repeatedly offered for her to come and live with us, and she flat out refuses to do so. She’s an adult and we can’t make her, but she won’t even entertain the idea. 

Recently she’s unemployed because her weight is keeping her from moving about efficiently, and because her anxiety about being out in the world is so bad that she’s often scared to take the bus into town (people can be really horrible to her in public).  She’s taking antidepressants and something for anxiety, but the mental healthcare system in the UK doesn’t seem to be doing very much for her re. helping her find her feet, despite best attempts by my mum and family to get her into a routine. She has a therapist, but not much seems to be happening or changing, as the cycle of depression and binging seems to be pretty unbroken. Her therapist seems good, but it seems clear that she needs more at the moment. 

She finds it very hard to take advice or help from either my mum or myself - I am also not neurotypical (BP2, GAD, PTSD) and have also suffered from a severe eating disorder, but in her mind, I’ll never understand anything she’s going through, especially as my ED was restrictive. We have PTSD for many of the same reasons (very abusive father), but because it’s affected us both differently we often find it really hard to relate to one another. I try and be as gentle as I can with her, but we get on much better when we’re apart (this also makes me really sad.) We talk on the phone at least two or three times a week and message every day, and she talks to my mum almost every day when she’s feeling up to it.

All this to say; things are a bit of a mess and I don’t know what I can do to help her these days. She rejects all help that I or the family offer (doesn’t want to move to a safer/nicer neighbourhood although we’d pay for it, doesn’t want assisted living, doesn’t want to live with any family members, doesn’t want to work or not work, doesn’t feel ready to commit to stopping her disordered eating behaviours etc)  My mum has recently employed a cleaning lady to help with her apartment, which seems to be working a bit, although she hates having anyone else touch her things. I’ve already spoken to her therapist and doctors several times, helped her with her CV, told her what things she might want to talk about with a nutritionist and a GP, made her appointments etc...

What’s the best way forward? How can I help her?  Has anyone out there dealt with a similar situation with an adult in your life, and if so, what did you do? Is there a good program that I don’t know about, or a particular kind of approach or therapy that has worked? Any advice at all would be so appreciated, thank you so much.",27Apr2019,1

195,"I (17F) have made the decision to move to Washington, to live with my dad. I currently live in California with my mom. I was born and raised here, and the overwhelming majority of my family live around CA. No family in Washington with the exception of my dad, stepmom, step-siblings, and half-sister.

Since I was 4, I suffered from Selective Mutism--I can only talk to about a dozen of my family members, which says a lot because I have an enormous Asian family. I also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, though I'm not whether it came before or after I started suffering from selective mutism. Needless to say, these two things ruined my life. I have no social skills, am completely alienated at school, and my family members fail to understand my inability to speak. California is my home, and it breaks my heart to leave to go to some unknown place, but I can't bear these burdens any longer.

That is why I decided to move to Washington. Essentially, I'm shedding these problems and running away. I want to come back, of course, after college! The problem is that I suddenly got the idea that I shouldn't come back--or if I do, I should do it after breaking contact with ALL people I know (including family) and return without letting anyone know. That means I'd come back well into adulthood, at that age where most people would ideally settle down and have kids.

I just don't want to face my problems. It's all too-scary to deal with it all. I've lived with these problems all my life, and I'd like more than just a couple years' break in a faraway state--I'd like to escape. I can live well without them, given a few sacrifices (giving up my close relationships with a few of my relatives), and move on as if the ""girl who doesn't talk"" never existed.

It's so tempting. But I feel like it's so wrong. To run away. To give up.

What should I do?",27Apr2019,1
196,"So, to preface this, I'll say that I work in a rather stressful position. I'm a pharmacy technician in a state that doesn't require national certification or registration. I very much enjoy this job, and I am currently studying for the PTCB exam so I can get certified. I take it very seriously, and want to learn everything I can. I like my co-workers, and I know this is where I want to be- at least for now.

My only issue is that I'm overly sensitive.

Several times, I've nearly broken down crying at work- most of them have been because a patient has been nasty, but lately, it's been because of my co-workers. I'm significantly younger than everyone else in the pharmacy- within a 10-20 year margin- and I'm starting to feel like they look down on me, either because of my age, or lack of experience. These are people who have been working in the field for over a decade. Twice, one of them has made me stop what I was doing to run some prescriptions through Medicare B, ""because I need to learn"".

Today, the pharmacist snapped at me because I almost let a patient leave without a counsel, which is a very big no-no. I know I made a mistake, and it's a learning experience- but in that moment, all I could think about was what a fuck-up I was. I swear, it's like the thoughts in my head turn against me. I no longer felt in control of my emotions. I felt like an idiot. I told the pharmacist that I needed to run to the restroom, where I sat and cried for the next ten minutes.

I hate crying about stupid things like that. I really do. I hate feeling this pathetic, like I'm just a miserable person who can't do anything right. I want so badly to get past this, but I'm not sure I know how. I want to work in pharmaceuticals. I'm terrified that one day, I'll break down in front of my co-workers, and they'll lose all respect for me. It's gotten to the point where some days I absolutely dread going to work.

I don't want to live like this. I could really, really use any advice I can get.",27Apr2019,1

199,"I want to hear your opinion about my situation.
6 months ago, I found out my (now ex) boyfriend was cheating on me. He was first guy I actually really love and It was one of the hardest thing in my life when I had to end the relationship even thought I was still in love. It was really hard to me to move on. My friends that knew the whole situation thought that it would be easier to forget him if I hookup with somebody else. And 2 months after breakup I did with one of friend Alex.  After that, we didn't have anything else becase that would just destroy our friendship. And from that definetly couldn't become anything sucessful. He's good friend, but he is not that kind of guy for serious relationship. So, later I started texting with some other boy, Dean. I already knew that he is that serius type of guy, very nice and I hear from before how his ex on the same way broke his heart and it was really hard time for him too. We work at the same place. We are talking but normal friend chat, but I know I had chance with him.
2 weeks ago, I went to club and get really drunk when Alex came in. I just kind of go to him and after 5minutes I kissed him. We had sex that night, he wanted to see me again but I'm not sure about that. I kind of feel something to him, but I don't want to feel even more because than It would be hard for me, like I said- not serious type of guy. 
And I can feel how other guy (Dean) try to talk with me even more. He is really nice attractive guy, but  I don't feel anything towards him. I love talking with him, I would love to go on drink with him and I would love to love him, but I don't love him. I really want to, but I'm scared to get too close and than found out that I don't like him because that would broke his heart. 
Oh, and after 6 months I still stalk my ex on social media, even thought I would never in my life have something with him again.

201,"The guy appears to be combative and not someone who would rather settle things peacefully judging by the way he talks. He lives two units down from me. There wasn't any tension before but tonight there were kids that were running in the second floor apartment hallway which was shaking up my apartment. I went out to my apartment to tell them they're not allowed to do that, and the guy chimes in saying that they're kids and they can do that. The guy sounded very combative, like he was offended that I was bothered by kids running in the hallway. I've already spoke to my apartment before and this is on ongoing issue with kids running in the hallway, which shakes my apartment. I just told him whatever and went back into my apartment.



I feel like this guy may try to start something with me. I'm not afraid of this guy and would definately defend my self if he started something with me. But I don't like the tension since im living two units away from him and i dont know if he might sucker punch me if I'm walking by.

I only these vibes based on his body language while I was talking to him. 

Should I find another time when I see him and try to make peace with him? Im apologizing because I did do anything wrong, so Ill probably be like, "" we have different opinions on the matter of kids running in the hallway, ultimately it's up to the apartment to handle this, we're neighbors, there's no bad blood between us right?"" is something I might say.

I'm only 2 year younger then her but she always was protecting me. I'm 19 now and she's twenty, i moved out of the house and am taking care of her mother in law. 

I dont have my drivers license YET and she's freaking because of it saying I need to get on it. What she doesn't get is I don't have time right now. 

 I was working 43 hours a week and starting yesterday it went to 54 hours working nightshift.  She hasnt had a job yet because she had kids and got married young not judging her, she's a great mom and would kill it in the workforce but I have had four jobs since I was 17.  

She got actual driving training by her dad teaching her all the mechanics and spending like a week with her, and she drove without a license for like 2 or three years before taking the drivers test. 

I however have been driving on deserted roads learning how to turn accelerate and slow down only doing this maybe once or twice month if I'm lucky. She says I should have got my license by now. 

I have been busy. 

She's always mothered me even when she had her own family and moved out of my moms, I told her that once she needed to parent her own kids and that I would be fine with out her mothering...she broke the laptop I was using. 

Besides the drivers license thing she has been telling me how to run my finances, ive been putting half my check in my savings account, shes been asking where the rest of my money has been going. 

I don't have to pay bills but I do pay for gas, sometimes groceries, and me and her mother in law going out to eat. 

She tells me all of it needs to be going into ky savings account. Its not like I want to buy anything or i shouls be buying some stupid stuff sometimes. Right? 

She does this with everything when i told her I wasn't going to college she kond of freaked and said I needed to learn a trade do this that and everything else.

204,"Okay, so to start, my therapist has told me I need to cut out a friend completely (this has been harder than I expected). We can call her Jane. I am an empath and I really have very few meaningful relationships, so when I find one and put time/effort into said relationships I tend to have a harder time letting them go, because it's hard to find people to connect to. Jane lives close by and we live in a small town. She constantly makes me feel used by only coming over to smoke weed (that she isn't allowed to do at her house) and then immediately leaves. Example: shows up at 11pm, leaves by 12:30am and usually leaves me questioning myself, my sanity or our relationship. This happens almost nightly. She randomly comes over, sometimes uninvited and berates all my friends. One time Jane told me she thought I had schizophrenia, and then left me alone by myself for three hours. She belittles me and everyone around her, it's a complete drag; On a positive note Jane is constantly giving gifts that she has paid for and accumulated through subscriptions (she has a total of 6 different ones) she just uses as gifts. They're all super expensive, she is extremely wealthy in my small town and she always makes sure you and everyone else in the room knows it, but acts like she isn't. She is constantly rude to me. We have on and off fights usually about me talking to other people. She will get super mad and tell me who I should and shouldn't spend my time with, but then when you criticize her or who she spends her time with she cuts you off. Blocks you completely on social media... So nothing usually gets resolved. Because you're too scared to get cut off. ( life is a lot harder when she is mad at you) so I guess what I'm asking is how can it be a clean break? She does really toxic things like tell people lies about you and talk straight mad shit about you to those who's opinions matter to you and then they get upset with you and it is super messy and toxic. I feel like I'm drowning in her web of negativity... She always wants to show you stuff but shits on everything you recommend / tell her you enjoy. But Jane didn't used to be like this, we've been friends for 8 years now. She used to be very nice to talk to. (Cognitively, Jane is one of the smartest people I know) we've had many deep talks and she's helped me through a lot in life. So she's not all bad, I'm not sure what changed.

At first I thought I could set up some worm bins at my place (dirt, worms, and organic materials for them to eat and break down), but I have a black thumb and no garden to put the dirt in. My parents and a few of their neighbors have gardens and might even be willing to put additional compost/worm bins in their yards, and there's a larger community garden a few miles away that I might be able to dump some compost at. 

But like I said, there's a /lot/ of waste. What if I need to get a designated dumpster? I'd have to run it up the food chain (ha) for sure, but that also begs the question of where i would put it. I'm located in Ohio and there's exactly one (1) compost pickup company with a mile long wait list.

210,"I live with a sibling (late 20's) and I am in my mid 20's. We live with an 8 year old dog, who we've had since he was 4 weeks old. This dog has been every where with us, and belongs primarily to my sibling although i help take care of him. 

&amp;#x200B;

The dog has a heart murmur, a non-lethal condition that can lead to heart failure and in worse cases death. It's been identified years ago, and is not getting better. However, he is not at heart failure stage yet. He has tons of energy, is excitable, and passionate about living. He doesn't seem to be suffering. 

&amp;#x200B;

My sibling is suffering mentally. \[They\] are deeply depressed and has a hard time managing it. \[They\] self-medicate with legal drugs, and me being largely sober has seen how this has affected their judgement. 

&amp;#x200B;

\[They\] made a decision yesterday to put the dog down. The reasoning is that an impending heart-attack in inescapable, and a very painful death that no dog should experience. I agree with this, and realize heart-related problems will eventually be the demise of this dog. But \[they\] have decided to put the dog down TOMORROW. It was decided this week, and is scheduled to be done in the morning. I can't live with knowing this decision is so quick and careless. I feel proper advice from a good vet should be taken into consideration, but \[they\] have already prepared for the death and are 100% set on it. No other close family member or friend can seem to sway \[their\] opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

 \[They\] think they are helping the dog out of misery, but I do not agree that the dog is in pain. I believe the dog has at least another year of normal life before the effects take hold. It seems \[their\] judgement is really intense and rash, and a projection of deeper internal struggles.

He has been sober for about a year ( but he just got out of jail in November 2019). He also told me that he hasn’t had a meaningful relationship ever in his life, and hasn’t been physical with anyone in  2 years. We hung out for the first time 3 weeks ago, and we slept together on the first date. He is a very insecure person and emotionally unstable. He doesn’t want the same things as me in terms of the future. Despite all of this I like his personality,  I find his awkwardness and shyness endearing, and I like how he’s playful. He’s trying to better himself he’s going back to school, and has a full time job.

Now my finals are one week away and I've fallen into this weird hole of everything I do being meaningless. You could say that I feel depressed and hopeless thinking about my future although I used to be optimistic and excited, it's so weird. I feel so lost and I have no outline whatsoever.

221,"My mother has been having problems with pain for the last few months. Every night, she complains so much about the pain and I have no idea what to do. At first, we visited the community clinic located in the town hospital to see if there were any problems but they couldn't find anything. They stated that they believed that the pain was mostly from her fatigue since she doesn't sleep too well. I initially believed it since it would make a lot of sense but then she started talking about pain covering her whole body. I just don't know what to say to that.

While I was in my college class, my mom and my dad went to the emergency room and when I got home, the report that I got was that she was diagnosed with musculoskeletal pain. They basically prescribed to her some pain medication and sent her home. No X-Ray. No test to see if her oxygen is alright (she has been breathing very poorly).

A few days went by and my mother says that her pain gotten worst. It just gets to the point where she can barely sleep. The medication doesn't help her at all and we tried all sorts of over the counter medication. She visits the community clinic every few days only to have them tell her that they can't do much. Every time we talk, she mentions her pain as a death sentence basically. She talks as if it will kill her and I don't know what to do other than to cry and hope for the best.

I just don't know how to respond to her when she complains about her pain. I try my best to comfort her because she does the same when I have periods of being in pain. However, I am at my limit right now because it's being a problem that's affecting daily life. I can't focus on school because I worry constantly about her. All I hear is her just talking about how much pain she is having. There is absolutely nothing else that I hear besides that. I'm just at a lost as to what to do. Every night, she goes into my room and tells me to bring her to the emergency room but it plays out all the same.

A few hours ago, my mom stated that she wanted to go to the emergency room and I quickly got ready. We live 30 minutes out of town so it's better if we detect it sooner. However, before I could even push the gas pedal, she states that she doesn't want to go to the emergency room because of the cost. Honestly, US has to be one of the most difficult places to go to the ER because it's just so much money. I'm also afraid that if we go to the ER, they won't do anything different than last time and just prescribe more medication that doesn't help her scenario while giving us a large bill. But I wanted to go to make sure. I always believe that we should put our health as priority but she has been refusing to go even though she keeps telling me to go. I don't know what she wants. I want to be a caring and loving daughter but it's hard when I don't have a concrete decision. I understand that she wants someone to listen to her but at the same time, I want to do something to help. I want to fix the problem instead of waiting until the problem magically goes away. The more she talks about it, the more I just want to rush to the ER even though that'd be a ton of money. It's been very odd for her to go into my room without letting me know lately. She just goes in and sits down, waits until I notice, then complain that she is in a lot of pain.

I have no clue what I should do and it's driving me mad. I want to help my mom as much as possible but I just cannot deal with her talking about her pain constantly and her attitude.

225,"I just finished a community college English class. The final essay (which was worth 25% of the grade) required 8 pages and bibliography with 10 sources. I used all of my vacation time to take 2 weeks off work to write this essay. I finished it right before I had to leave to go the final class of the semester. It was written in the most recent version of Microsoft Word. I saved it, then tried to exit Microsoft Word got a window telling me to save before I exit. Thought it was strange since I had already saved, but clicked save anyway. Word did not close after this so I tried again and got the same result. This went on several more times. For some reason I thought maybe saving it with a different name would help. It didn't. I literally could not close Word so I figured ""Well, I saved it like a million times so I'll just log off my laptop with Word open since I can't get out of Word."" When I got to class and opened the file, it was the most recent draft I had before the final. only 6 pages with no bibliography. A computer-savvy friend and I tried to find the lost final draft with no luck, and I was forced to turn in the 6 page rough draft as my final essay. I had 76% (C) in the class at the time of this incident.   


The class has been over for a little over a day but I highly doubt the prof has finished grading essays. I explained the situation and he said there was nothing he could do. He didn't seem very sympathetic, so I think maybe he thought I was lying, and because of that lied about not being able to give me any leniency. Is there any hope or am I completely fucked?

I went to internship excited every week and was passionate about doing group work with the students and providing therapy to children and their families. My supervisor and her colleagues, along with some counselors and administrators from the high school set up a MOCK interview for a school social worker position for myself and the other MSW intern. 

I completely bombed it. I got constructive feedback about bringing more of my personality in (I felt so robotic during the interview), asking more questions (I asked if there were any hesitations about my qualifications 🤦🏾‍♀️) and about community resources I’ve used in my work (which I completely blanked on). 

After the panel went around and gave me feedback, I felt my eyes start to water—I’m black so I don’t blush (thank the Lord) but if I could have I would have been beet red—and I could barely get out a thanks to them before I darted out of the room. I cried on my drive home—which has never happened to me after an interview before! 

My mom has complained that I need to develop more of a thick skin for years—and she’s 100% right. I realize especially as I ready myself for the job hunt and the inevitable rejection that often comes with it. I did not prepare myself for the interview or expect some of the questions that were asked, and I think the number of people in the room was intimidating. But still...

Ugh.

234,"Long post. Sorry. 

A few days ago I posted about a situation I was in where I borrowed my roommate/ex-bff’s things without asking her (with the full intent to return it to its rightful place), but her sudden arrival scared me and I pretended I had no involvement when she looked for her missing things. I planned to return it discreetly but felt there was no way I could hide it, so I returned it an hour later to a visible place in her room and planned to tell her then next time I saw her. I was wracked with stress and guilt the whole time, as I didn’t intend on taking her stuff to begin with, and honestly, if we had still been best friends it wouldn’t even have been an issue because we would freely let each other borrow our items before. 

She came back to her room after I had gone to class, so when I returned I gathered together the nerve to apologize in person and tell her what happened. I explained that I wanted to borrow her makeup, but she wasn’t there, and since every time I asked to borrow her makeup she would always let me, I thought it would be okay to borrow it this once without asking. However when she came back I was startled and realized how it would appear to her, and I didn’t want her to think I was stealing it so I was going to put it back. But she got worried thinking she lost it and I didn’t know how to say it upfront so I pretended to help her look and everything.  Then the guilt became too much so I returned it hoping to rectify the situation truthfully. I told her I understood if she was upset but I wanted to apologize sincerely and assure that it would never happen again (and it shouldn’t have happened to begin with). 

Everyone whose opinion I asked in real life about what to do regarding borrowing the makeup said it wasn’t even that big of a deal and if she was angry about it then she was being petty. They said it was a non-issue that i was unnecessarily stressing myself out for, and a normal person would not be too mad about it, considering the circumstances. However, I think it’s totally valid for her to be mad because I took something of hers without her permission, and I didn’t exactly lie but I also hid the truth until I gave the thing back. It was “missing” for only an hour and a half (the time it took between her coming back to our room, me hiding it and leaving for class while she looked for it, her leaving for class, then me coming back after class to return it). I was close to tears and really felt bad not just about the whole thing, but also because I knew she would tell others and ruin my image in their eyes. 

Part of the reason this situation was so stressful to me was because she used to be my high school best friend. We were so excited to spend the next 4 years together but something changed in her as soon as we moved in. As I mentioned in the last post (which many of you may not have seen), she became increasingly hostile and distant to me for no apparent reason. From what others have told me, she wanted to cut me off because she felt jealous or inferior and didn’t like being compared to me. She was suddenly tired of me and wanted to be free of my presence so she started cutting me out of her life. I didn’t know or understand so I spiraled into a worse depression that was fueled by my anxiety. She created a secret Instagram account and a Snapchat group where she would complain about me as her “bitch roommate” for things I didn’t know were even an issue. She said I could “catch her motherfucking hands” when my boyfriend slept over (even though I asked for her permission twice and she allowed it). I felt terrible all of last semester and most of this semester, and even though we “cleared things up” and were trying to be friends again this semester, she didn’t change much of her habits and just went from ignoring me to making polite conversation and occasionally forwarding funny tweets. Throughout all of this, I was still trying to be friendly and open; I did lots of things for her and let her use my stuff freely, and she let me borrow some things too. If we were still bffs, this makeup borrowing thing would not be an issue. 

Now, I’m not sure if what I did classified as theft (it probably does), but I’m not happy that I did it regardless. It was incredibly embarrassing and I never expected that type of behavior from myself, but felt proud that I at least confessed and took responsibility. I’m not trying to excuse my actions, just providing the story behind it. Unfortunately, I also haven’t learned my lesson. 

I know she still has her secret Instagram account where she complains about things. And she originally didn’t want any of her roommates to follow but now our other roommate (who is her best friend as well) is following. I know she posted because the post count went up, and seeing as how it was right after the whole makeup thing, I figured it was about me. While she was showering, she left her phone in her room. I was able to see her Instagram post, which was a screenshot of her text conversation with her other best friend back home, and the caption was “don’t you love when your roommate #steals from you? 🤪” 

I also saw the text conversation with that girl, where she first told the friend the whole event, about how she suspected me when she found the returned stuff, and then later confirmed it after I confessed. They were both saying some horribly cruel things, and I had considered them both my bffs in high school. I left her room after that, but I’m certain that she’s told other people. 

I know I’ve not only stolen from her but also now invaded her personal space and privacy, but I had to find out what she was saying. Now I’m in my own room, having an anxiety attack and shaking and crying. I figure I deserve this for what I did. It was stupid of me to take the makeup and even worse to look at her phone after everything that happened. I used to reason with myself earlier regarding how she treated me, saying that I hadn’t done anything wrong and the fact that she hated me without reason was just a testament to her bad attitude and influence and how I would be better without her. However, now she has a valid reason to hate me and I hate myself even more. It’s valid for her to be upset, and I guess it’s also ok to tell people, even though I would prefer she didn’t. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I’m so depressed and my hands won’t stop shaking. I feel like absolute garbage and wish I could undo all of this. I wish she would forgive me (I know I’m not entitled to it though. It’s her own choice). I never wanted us to end this way. I wanted to move out in 2 weeks on a good note and hope to maintain peaceful ground after everything that happened through the year, but I wrecked it all in a day. She hates me, people know about me and probably dislike me. 

Also, this probably means she will stop talking to me now. She sent me a few mass snaps (one snapchat sent out to many people as a generic message or update) after I told her, but hasn’t sent anything to me on Instagram, Twitter, or Snapchat for the last 24 hours. Should I keep acting like everything is normal and send her things? Or should I stop communicating as well? I’m not sure if I’m over-exaggerating how  angry she is with me, or if I’m overanalyzing her behavior. I know she is probably still mad, but do you think she’ll stop talking to me completely or go back to normal in a few days? 

God, I feel so horrible and guilty about all this. Could I please get an outsiders opinion on what they think about all this and what I should do? Thanks.",27Apr2019,0

236,"So while it sounds cut and dry, there are some caveats.

 My friend is not a bad dude and had a job up until recently he had to be let go due to back injuries. He cant work blue collar like hes been trained to his whole life so now he has to return to school to get his GED. Hes in the process right now. 

Hes also very easily stressed out as he isnt a planned father or husband. Hes trying his best but you can see anxiety all over him.

 He may be just using this bad as a form of stress reduction. Hes already told me that hes not trying to get famous he just wants to put music into the world.

  But there's a more conservative part of me that's saying ""Until you can take that test and get a job, you shouldn't split your focus on things like making music while your wife works.""

i and my girlfriend rented a Appartement with Garden. The contract and law in our land is very clear that we are the only renter and  have domestic authority. Now we had fights with our neighbors because more then one thinks they also have a right to use the Garden.

239,"Hi, I’m Regina and I don’t know who to talk to or who to even turn to about my predicament, so hopefully some kind strangers will lend me their wisdom...

So I have been having a tough time selecting what college I am going to attend in the fall ever since my top choice school, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, waitlisted me (they waitlisted me because of my SAT score). I never really thought of what I would have to do if that happened, as I thought I would always attend U of I, hence the catalyst of my predicament. The two schools I have been weighing between are the University of Illinois at Chicago and Saint Xavier University. I initially settled for UIC as it was close to downtown Chicago, and I would already have a roommate (it would be a close friend of mine who I already go to school with).  Plus, I liked the idea that I would be far from home (my home life isn’t perfect sometimes, and the idea of not living at home is appealing). I toured it, and liked it enough (it wasn’t my dream school, but it could do). But, I have been having my own problems with UIC, as well. When my FAFSA application was selected for verification, UIC would not stop bothering me for the necessary materials they needed to edit my Financial Aid Award. It has officially been over a month since I had sent the necessary materials and they have not even reviewed those said materials or given me a reason why as to why they have not reviewed them. I have called their Office of Financial Aid time and time again to speak to my admissions counselor and she is never in when I need her most. It has been very annoying trying to get answers from UIC and National Decision Day is T-4 days away, and I still don’t know how much I’m going to pay to attend that institution. Saint Xavier on the other hand is a private college that is minutes away from my house. I’ve weighed the pros and cons, and I liked the campus and the professors I would be working with enough (again, it wasn’t U of I, but it could do) and the Office of Financial Aid was easy to work with, as they sent me my revised financial aid award just days after I sent them the necessary materials they needed. The only things I didn’t like about it were that I would still be living with my parents and I wouldn’t get the college experience I wanted as I would have to commute. Since I have no car and I live in the lovely state of Illinois, where even in April it will still snow, commuting wouldn’t be easiest at times. Both of my parents work, and I didn’t like the idea of relying on somebody to take me anywhere. Like I mentioned previously, my home life isn’t perfect, and going away for college has been on the top of my list ever since I started high school. I had this discussion with my parents (specifically, my mom) about where I should go, and she wanted me to go to Saint Xavier, since I would have to pay almost nothing for attending (since room and board makes up a large portion of tuition) . At the time, I wanted to go to UIC because I liked the idea of getting the full college experience without having to answer to my parents still. My mom and I would argue over this, as she would bring up that I never received my revised financial aid award letter, and I would argue saying that if I attend SXU, it would be like high school all over again, and I would never really leave my house (like I do now), along with the fact that I had already promised my friend that I would try to convince my parents to see that UIC was the best option and let me go, so I could room with her. 

U of I emailed me twice now about wanting to stay on their waitlist, and I have replied yes both times. I’m still hanging on that bit of hope that they will accept me. After much convincing, my parents finally took me down to Champaign, Illinois for the first time ever to see the campus, and I was absolutely head over heels obsessed with it. I still hold onto that glimmer of hope that my dream college will accept me after May 1st. What stresses me out most is that if I go to UIC and my dream school accepts me, I’ll do awful by my friend who I decided to room with by leaving her, and wasting her time by promising her that I would room with her and then leave her. (It also doesn’t help that U of I rejected her). If I decline my dream school, it would kill me inside after having to wait since March 1st for the news. If I decline my dream school, I would have to room with my friend at UIC for my whole first year. If I go to SXU and U of I accepts me, I could easily accept their offer and be on my merry way to Champaign, Illinois no problem. If they decline me, I would have to apply as a transfer student as soon as possible, as I still like the idea of living away from home. 

Going back to SXU and UIC, at UIC I would have to pay about $15,000-$16,000 a year (that’s an approximate price without loans, and an estimate from my initial financial aid award letter pre-verification). At SXU, I would have to pay approximately $7,000-$8,000 (that’s an approximate amount without loans, referenced from my edited financial aid award letter).  I think either way, I wouldn’t be able to handle both schools for four years, and probably would have applied to U of I as a transfer student after my first year. 

I recently submitted my Intent to Enroll at UIC and put down my $50 non-refundable down payment for housing, and while I initially thought I would be relieved, I’m not; I feel more lost than I had ever felt before. I still have some time (albeit not a lot) to change my mind and put my $100 down payment to reserve the spot in my class at SXU. 

I have talked with some teachers that I trust and my parents and some of my friends, but I just don’t know. I feel like I just made a huge mistake sending my Intent to Enroll at UIC. This college stuff is all new to me as I am the oldest child in my family, and a first generation college student. My parents are immigrants from Mexico and they feel just as lost as I do as they never attended high school or college. Most of my family (except one person on my mom’s side of the family), either went to high school and never went to college or ended up not graduating, so I can’t turn to them for help. I think my feelings of hopelessness and despair mostly stem from being waitlisted by my dream school, and I know visiting it this past Thursday did not help matters. No matter where I go, I know I won’t truly be happy as it won’t be my dream school. 

So internet, I turn to you, and hope that you guys can take me seriously enough to help me. I know that you guys won’t be able to make my decision for me, but I just need some advice from a third party that isn’t someone I know personally.  I think if I ready something from you guys, it will be the catalyst that will lead me to making my decision. If you have questions, ask away, I’ll be here to answer. Thanks for listening.

244,"My graduation exams are coming closer and I was offered to participate in free lessons in the university I plan to go after highschool. They are supposed to prepare me for my final math exam.
The day before them, I told my parents I will go.
But I changed my mind during the night because I realized that it is a waste of time and that I would learn faster on my own because those are large group lessons and they don't take the time to explain something to an individual if he didn't understand it well because they have so much to cover in a little span of time. So I decided that I will study alone at home. 
The lessons were in the morning so my mom woke me up early and I told her that I don't want to go. She got mad at me and started telling me that I am unreliable and that I will never accomplish anything because of it.

She isnt exactly well off money wise and lives in America so medicinal and therapy have been pretty much always off the table. Her upbringing is probably the main cause and ive pretty much been her only permanent friend since we've met.

Ive been able to sympathise and comfort her for as long as shes needed it but with recent events ive been drawing blanks on what to say to help her

When we get into arguments he calls me fat. And then later when he says he was being sarcastic and he didn’t mean it. The ratio used to be that he’d call me fat and then say I was skinny 1:5 and now he calls me fat much more than he calls me skinny. 

He says he’s being sarcastic and I should know better, and my entire life I’ve thought I was skinny/healthy, and now I’m feeling like I have to lose weight. Then he tells me that I’m insecure and that I always thought I was fat when I really used to never even think about my weight because no one ever mentioned it.",27Apr2019,2

252,"I am not sure about this situation, it feels confusing to me. My friend asked me to draw a character for him based on a manga hero. I asked him which characters he liked in the manga and what he likes about them. I then conceived and drew and painted a character based on that. My work was intended as a gift, but I felt it was important that he know the character is still mine. I wasn't sure how to convey that I was giving it to him, but not really giving it to him. Anyway, now he has commissioned another artist to draw another version based on my character but with various changes of his own choosing. It is named the same, but with -alt affixed to the end. The commissioned artist has described it as his original character, my design. I am not happy about this but I am unable to articulate why.

256,"I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her, she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit.

258,"So, I'm in this friend group. I've been in this friend group since my senior year of highschool but I've met a few of them before we formed the group officially. We're all 21,except for one member I'll mention later,he's 19 I believe. We don't really have a leader per se, but we often joke around how the leader of our group is (names changed) Devon. Devon is the leader because he made a discord so we can all communicate (before that,he made a Skype group.) Everytime he gets into a voice call, everyone joins. He also picks the games on steam that we all play together. 

Now, Devon has a friend. He has a friend he met in highschool I believe, named Korbin. The thing about Korbin is that he always tries to pick fights with people. There are many days where Korbin is a chill relaxed nonsensical person. But there are also many days when Korbin will try to start something with someone, even if he calls them his friends. There have been many times that he has made comments about me especially when I've never done anything to him or don't know him personally on that level. He's made comments about my eyebrows, which I've mentioned being insecure as I have trichotillomania. He's made a rape joke and invalidated my past rape trauma with an ex when I told everyone in the group about it. And recently, this is what upset me.

We were in a voice call. Me, Korbin, and Devon. Suddenly, a 4th party member joins, named Issac. The moment Issac joined, Korbin asked him if he saw Avengers Endgame yet, and Issac said no, because he didn't care for the movie. I then said, I haven't watched endgame yet. I kid you not, seconds after I say that, I don't know if something isn't right with him, but he just blurts out the ending and explained it to Issac. I started raising my voice in shock and was all ""dude,what the heck? Did what I say go over your head; did you not hear me? I didnt watch it yet."" And he's all ""it's fine, it follows what the comics goes by."" I previously told Issac a week ago at a group hangout I don't read the comics and I had to restate it again. It wasn't until after me raising my voice did he stop laughing because he knew I was being serious.

After I left the voice call, Devon started panicking asking me what do i want him to do about it because he's tried talking to Korbin about his issues. The reason why I'm saying I doubt this is because this group tends to be a bit biased. They tend to treat people better and some have more leeway than others in situations like this. It also doesnt help that this isn't the first time Korbin has said something to make someone upset, and not just me.

A fellow group member who we met shortly after the creation of the group recently got a new girlfriend a month ish ago. This member told me that yesterday when the group was playing a video game with his girlfriend in the chat as well, (we were playing killing floor 2 ,) she didn't have enough money to buy a weapon and others in game can lend/buy? You weapons so she asked her boyfriend,the member if he can help her get one. Korbin then said ""oh you're his girlfriend?well that's obvious,since you're already spending all his money."" And this rubbed her the wrong way and she got upset at him according to the member.

Pretty much the majority of the people in the group who are friends with Korbin all say the same thing. We've talked with him, what else are we supposed to do? But I feel like either 
1)they were not stern enough with him 
2)it doesn't matter what they say,he just doesn't get it

Mind you he doesn't have any sort of mental disorders, no speech problems, no tourette's syndrome. Nothing as far as I know.

Later he confessed he smoked weed and took few amitriptilyn pills with the intention to kill himself. I talked to him but he says i can't help him.

265,"My 29yo brother moved back in with my mum about 9months ago after his girlfriend kicked him out. He was always really smart and got into uni for an engineering degree but kept failing his classes. He dropped out of uni a few years ago and has never been able to hold down a job. He just doesn’t show up, he makes up excuses and lies to his family about what happened but it’s pretty obvious he just doesn’t want to get out of bed. 

My mum has BPD and is pretty hard to live with, so brother now wants to move back in with me and my dad. He lived with my dad for about three months when girlfriend first kicked him out. During this time he lied about working, stole my parents alcohol and cigarettes and would disappear and return with no notice. He moved in with my mum after my dad refused to buy him cigarettes one night and wouldn’t reply to my dads calls and texts for about two months.  He continues this behaviour of stealing and lying and neither of my parents (or I) know how to deal with it.

266,"Bear with me, I'll try to summarize this without too much rambling. 7 years ago I adopted a ""senior"" cat whose age was unknown. At this point my current vet estimates he's about 18, but without knowing his history, it's all a guess. He has hyperthyroidism, chronic kidney disease, high anxiety, some kind of permanent infection or mass or something in his respiratory system causing extreme difficulty breathing and sneezing, and sometimes his nose bleeds from whatever is happening up there. He takes medication for the hyperthyroidism and the anxiety and currently we're on yet another antibiotic course trying to get a handle on his breathing.

Over the past few months he went from his normal weight of 12 pounds down to about 8.5 pounds. Over the last few weeks, he's started howling miserably all night every night. I have a 4 month old baby that just started sleeping through the night reliably and now with this yowling, none of us are sleeping again. I took him to the vet for more blood work to see if there was anything new that's reasonably managed, but there isn't. Her best recommendation is to check his blood pressure next and maybe try adding a medication for that.

At this point, I think he's miserable. I went to that appointment prepared to talk about euthanasia because it seems like he's dying and it didn't even seem to be on her radar. Now I'm sitting here, contemplating the further expenses of yet another test and more medication, and guiltily still thinking about euthanasia as an option. If the vet doesn't think it's time for that, how do I get over the guilt if I think it's time? I just can't imagine his quality of life is very good right now and when I'm elderly if I'm this medicated and miserable I know what my choice would be. He's been my fur baby for a little over 7 years and I can tell he's suffering, but he can still see/hear/drink/use the litter box. Technically he's physically able to eat but these days he just isn't. 

What do you think, Reddit? Should I put my cat to sleep?",27Apr2019,4
267,"Until I was 15, I had never had feelings for anyone (except small crushes). Then, I met a girl and had that “first love” type relationship. This prompted me to come out as a lesbian, which was one of the rougher points of my life. I was kicked out of my house and forced to move in with my high school girlfriend, lost friends, and there’s family that still doesn’t speak to me. 

As I have grown older, and been single the last 2 years, I have come to understand that maybe I jumped the gun a bit. I’m about 99% sure that if anything, I am bisexual/sexually fluid/whatever label you’d like to call it. So, yes definitely still like girls but also am into boys.

I’m currently dating this guy in secret, and feeling so guilty (?) about it. He doesn’t know the situation, and I’m unsure if he even knows I like girls or not.

My main issue with this is the backpedaling. How do I come out a second time to people who refused to believe me the first time? And I also feel like this confession would only prove some of them “right”, that liking girls was a phase (it wasn’t). 

Any advice is welcome. I’m sort of desperate here as I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this.

269,"We ordered an expensive couch from Taylor King and the reason to order it was for it’s advertised inside-depth of 27 inches. It costed us $2900, and when the couch arrived the seat depth measured only 24.5 inches. I called up the dealer I ordered through, and sent him the video of how the measurement was made, he checked the video while I was on the phone and said it measures about 24.5 and based on his advice, I returned the couch. The dealer said he will deal with the communication with Taylor king and let me know what they say. 

Few days later, the dealer sends me an email saying that Taylor King suspects that I did not push back the seat cushions completely to take the measurement and they asked him to measure the inner depth of the couch with the back cushion removed and also the inner depth of the couch with the seat cushion removed. As a reply to that email, I asked him that from the video I sent to him the day I returned the couch did he not think the cushion was fully pushed back, and he comfortably replied saying that he can’t assess, and everything now depends on the measurements Taylor king asked for. 

Few days passed and I get a reply from the dealer saying that Taylor King will not authorize the return and I will have to take the couch back by paying for shipping again. He also attached the pictures of the above mentioned measurements and claims Taylor king made the decision based on them. I called him over the phone and asked how can I cross check the measurements are correct and if they are advertised anywhere, and he replied that they are not advertised. What should I do?

276,"Hello! I am in the worst possible situation of my life right now. 

And that’s saying a lot. 

Let me explain: I’m USA born &amp; raised, and god, I took advantage of toilets. Easy flush, hardly got clogged except for those massive tear-your-butthole-is-that-blood-I-see poops, I miss them. 

Recently, a little over a month ago, I moved to an east asain country, and, y’know, they got smaller stuff. Smaller doorways, smaller chairs, smaller toilets... smaller pipes. 

I moved into a two bed one bath apartment, the roommates got the master bedroom, which had a door leading directly to the bathroom, sliding. It doesn’t lock. At night, when the windows are open, it literally shakes back and forth like a shirt hanging on a line. The second door to the bathroom is down the hall from my bedroom. Completely normal door. 

Anyways, my roomie is a bit of a hermit, doesn’t leave his room often. Whatever, that’s cool, I don’t mind him listening to my piss hit the toilet, but I tried to wait until he was out/ asleep to unleash the torrent of liquid fire from my anus. 

The first two weeks were fine, adjusting to the bacteria across the globe left my poop liquid enough for me to remain blissfully unaware of the havoc I was about to wreak. Week three, day 2: solid poop, hell yeah. 

Week three, day four: solid poop, oh no. Toilets clogged like hell, and horribly embarrassed I gotta ask the roomie for the plunger. It takes ten whole minutes to unstick that mfer. 

Week three, day seven: same thing. I know he can hear me plung the hell out of that little ceramic bowl, and after the final flush he actually comes out of his room, and tells me to try courtesy flushes. What am I, a deer??? I don’t poop little pellets to continuously flush, both times it’s happened were very normal one or two chunks poops to me and were just... normal sized, maybe a bit bigger. I’ve never had this issue before. I’m not about to explain my bowel movements to a guy I’ve known a month, so next time, I decide to go in a public restroom. 

I held my shit for about four days, went out to eat, perfectly fine and dandy, ‘oh, excuse me, going to the restroom’ you know, like you do. 

It. Doesn’t. Flush. Clogged again! I leave, way to embarrassed to tell an employee. Hoping the next person who goes thinks they clogged it, I dunno. The poop was out of sight just in the toilet, the water somehow clean, maybe a little yellow. I gtfo the restraint ASAP. 

This leads to now. I haven’t shit in a month, Reddit, and I can feel my butthole crying. It’s so mad at me. I’ve seen the ‘poopknife’ post, and I’ve considered it, but when I’m in the bathroom that damn sliding door swings everywhere, providing ZERO sound protection. Plus, I’ve found out he like, never sleeps, and has been going out less, so he’s ALWAYS THERE. Plus, since it’s a shared bathroom, how tf would I casually hide a poopknife in there? There’s no sink cabinets, only a metal rack for tp. 

I’m really considering just shitting in a napkin and throwing it away in the trash. That’s how desperate I am to poop.

This trend has been persistent through my whole life. I always found myself falling short of my academic goals, and over the span of middle school and high school I started to develop anxiety when dealing with concepts i didn't get right away.

The anxiety hasn't subsided leading into my first and second year of university. Whenever I try to study,  I find myself compulsively changing my focus onto things that aren't related to school, until the day of or before a major exam, where I try to cram as much as i can. I always fall short of my goals, and become self aware of the cycle I've trapped myself in.

But here's the catch, I have become so good at being content with whatever state my life is in that I only have moments of self awareness during times of extreme distress or exhaustion;  so more often than not, I wake up after a major failure, feel fine, and lose the self awareness I need to change. This is a huge problem for me, because I forget that I need to improve myself whenever times are not dire, which is more often than not when im trying to improve myself.

These last few years have been tough, and with my deteriorating mental health, I recently started talking to my doctor about medication. I came to the office, explained my issues, and she put me on well-butrin. For a while, things were looking up. The energy and focus from the medicine greatly improved my anxiety issues and productivity. It was going well until I started having relationship issues and sleep problems. I had two weeks of sleep deprivation because of these problems, which brought me to have suicidal thoughts. I was in no state to write exams, but because I didn't want to get kicked out of university on the chance that personal issues didn't permit deferrals, I lied to my doctor that the medication gave me insomnia so that I could get the note. My lie essentially blocked me from getting medication i needed.

After that ordeal, I brought her a psych report from grade 7 that said I had mild ADHD and problems with written expression. According to her, I should have been medicated for ADHD ever since that report. That revelation made me resent my parents for never exploring that option when I was struggling as a kid, but I suppose it doesn't matter at the end of the day. My doctor put me on dexedrine, and it helps focus but nothing else.  More often than not, I get distracted and the enhanced focus is used to focus on said distractions. 

TLDR:
Tonight, I feel hopeless because I put myself into a deep hole. I've been stuck in a self destructive cycle for years, with my only attempts to break it being medication which I also managed to fuck up.  With all of the easy options gone, all of the change has to come from me, but due to my own conflicting natures, I don't know where or how to begin changing for the better.",27Apr2019,0
282,"The shelter I work at is in danger of closing down. We rescue, rehabilitate and re-home over 300 dogs a year. We also help combat the wild feral cat problem by engaging in TNR (Trap, Neuter, Return)

Before we were operational, the pound near us had a PTS (Put to Sleep) rate of 80%. Since we have been functioning, the rate has dropped to less than 5% and these are only the dogs that have been killing livestock or who are too vicious to re-home at all.


In Ireland, any dog in the pound after 5 days is destroyed. They only have 5 days to be adopted direct from the pound, reclaimed (if they are someone's straying pet) or for us to take them to re-home them.


We are in danger of losing our land, our premises. Without the shelter running, the rate of dogs put to sleep will skyrocket once again. 

We take the cases no one else wants, ex racing greyhounds that normally would be shipped abroad to be run to death. Ex breeding dogs who are so badly damaged from having litter after litter, that they suffer major internal damage.


We have everything from puppies thrown from moving cars, dogs tied up and left in fields in sub zero temperatures, dogs that have been abandoned, dumped, dogs that have been seized as cruelty cases. 

I am asking, please, does anyone know the best place for me to put up the link to our fundraising page? We are desperately fundraising as much as we can but we are nowhere near our goal yet.

We are hoping to raise the money to buy the land from the bank, or else buy elsewhere.


I have posted pictures before of some of our resident dogs and I am petrified knowing that we risk not being able to help others.

Can anyone help, advice or any idea where is the best subreddit to post our GoFundMe?

I know I am cheeky asking where is best to ask for money, but it is not for me. It's for the animals in our care.


I am scared guys. I'm scared we'll close down and the dogs that CAN be rehomed, won't get the chance and will be destroyed.


I'd really appreciate any help please and of course, I will happily PM/DM pictures of some of our dogs for anyone who messages me.",27Apr2019,6
283,"So, I have a female friend 23 I’ve known since my school days and we’ve had ups and downs. Recently after one fall out things weren’t exactly the same again. She was annoyed at me because I was actually caught up in life and didn’t always have the time to talk and I wouldn’t reply for a while.  

So, my issues are at this stage in our friendship. If I don’t text her and ask her how she is, she rarely does it. A long time went by each time before she’s made the effort I kinda feel like she’s done it once. But more so it’s me 

I personally still feel there’s actual underlying things that haven’t been spoken about when we last had a confrontation. 

I feel like a lot of the time I’m always making the effort, and personally I don’t think 5/6 weeks to not even think to message your friend is fair when we used to speak everyday at one stage until she got into a rship. 

She text me yesterday with a late bday message which was fine, and I replied “hey it’s okay don’t worry about it. I had a lovely day, ate a lot as usual. 
Hope your works going well. Mines been keeping me pretty busy” 
And she just opened the message and didn’t reply. I just feel like I’m at a stage where I know I’m making all the effort and a part of me doesn’t want to make a fuss and confront it. But the other part of me is like, she’s kinda jus being rude and making 0 effort, I’m not sure whether the message is reply worthy. But even still she could’ve made some effort to talk, right?",27Apr2019,1

287,"Hey fellow Redditors,

I found yesterday that I need to be on crutches for a month due to an injury. I’m just starting to get used to getting around on them, but the problem is I have a flight coming up in a couple days, and I’ll be traveling by myself. I’m flying out of a pretty large and busy airport, and it’s generally pretty stressful to navigate there even when I’m walking normally, so the thought of doing it all on crutches has me pretty nervous.

So for those of you who have traveled on crutches, could you give me some tips to make this as easy as possible? How did TSA work for you? Were you able to crutch onto the plane or did you need to make prior arrangements for a wheelchair? How did you actually get from security to your gate in a large airport? I’m trying to pack as lightly as possible so luggage shouldn’t be a huge concern.

Any kind of advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",27Apr2019,0
288,"I recently had issues with a certain project, I could not for the life of me figure it out and the professor was of no help. I tried, for the first time, getting help from an online website. I sent all the files and gave them my instructions. I also attempted to work on it on my own and made progress. The total transaction was 500$. Within a week they sent the finished work and it's utterly wrong and completely unrelated to the subject matter. To say they did 5% of the required work is an understatement.

Now they sent me an Email threatening to report me to my university for Academic misconduct. They gave 24 hours to drop the case.

289,"So my friend is my closest friend and we live on the same city, we always kinda ""bond"" before he left overseas for some reasons. So this friend. I got his back always, I always find time to talk to him and I want him happy always and if he needs anything I am one call away, same goes for him. He is one call away too, and always there for me. He really loves me as his friend and he would always say that. 

Even after he left the country we're always communicating like everyday and I got used to it, then one day he just kinda didn't wanna talk and ask for boundaries, he doesn't want to be bothered, that he needed time and space for himself so I understand and gave him what he wanted because he said ""adult friendships don't always need to talk"" then after weeks, he changed as if we're not that close, as if I'm just a stranger to him. 

He came back, but he didn't ask me to go somewhere or go to his place, he didn't even bought any souvenir or something and he never ask me how I am doing. I told him everything and he told me he's busy. I don't understand because if I were in his place, I'll remember him. I don't know what's going on. I think we're not friends anymore. That I'm just forcing him to be friends with me. I feel like I'm less of a person to be his friend that we're not on the same page anymore, that I can't and will never be related to his life no matter how hard I try.

I don't know what made him change like that. I feel like it was all my fault because I demanded time and attention and told him harsh words when we argued about things, but he's the first one to told me things that will hurt me. I don't really know what to do and what to feel right now. Are we still friends? Am I still his bestfriend? I think too much",27Apr2019,0
290,"This might be long so sorry in advance.
So when I was a kid my brother sexually abused me. I blocked it out for so long and then it hit me in high-school. My mental health took quite a hit and I was left with trauma lucid nightmares for years (I still get them).
I eventually told my parents and nothing really came from it, they are very avoidant people.
My mum went to the doctor for advice and the doctor was going to report it to the police as I was still under 18 at the time. Mum said no and the doctor listened.
Fast forward to last year, I was struggling with my nightmares as I had only just realised that it wasn't a normal thing to be having every single night. I went to a psychologist that I'm still seeing, she worked through some things with me.
I wrote a letter to my parents calling them out on not doing enough and telling them how bad I was struggling. 
The confronted my brother and he acted like he couldn't remember a thing (he's 7 years older than me) which I just don't buy. He told them he was abused in scouts when he was younger which I don't know if I believe but regardless how could he remeber that and then not remeber what he did to me years later. After this, I also sent a letter to my brother. I wrote down every single detail I could remember. I told him the impact its had on me and that I never want him in my life.
As far as I know he never opened the letter. My parents still have contact with him and they don't seem bothered he hasn't opened the letter - it's now been about 6 months since I sent it. And I'm a bit disappointed they aren't bothered, it shows he's not sorry for what he did. I've asked them to get him to open it but they haven't.

I don't know what to do, I'm still affected by this whole ordeal and I don't think I'll ever get rid of the nightmares.

Any advice would be appreciated.",27Apr2019,5
291,"First I should mention that this is my first reddit post, so I’m not quite sure how to go about typing this but I’ll start with a bit of a backstory...

So I’ve been working at this place for about a month and throughout this week, a coworker who was previously fairly distant starting making conversation with me (nbd there). But since then, there have been quite a few times where I think ‘Is he hitting on me rn?’ Because first, he said I was pretty and that he’d be surprised if I don’t have a boyfriend. (Lol classic) but anyway, I brushed it off just as him being kind, especially because he’s mentioned multiple times that he is married. 

But last night/this morning (graveyard shift) was when I really started wondering if he has some ulterior motives. It was just simple at first like “singing” song lyrics as I walk by him; “you’re no good for me” or “oohhh spicy lady” (Don’t think that’s the actual lyric but that’s what he said lol) 

But HERE’S the kicker. And this just happened like an hour ago. When I got home, I realized I forgot my debit card at work in my locker. I’m dressed in sweats but figure it’s fine, I’ll be super quick. When I get upstairs and find my card, I looked over at him and saw he was OBVIOUSLY staring at my crotch. Like for a good three seconds at least. There was someone else talking to me so I didn’t wanna say anything but I kinda pointed at him like ‘hey I saw that’ but then he did it AGAIN. If he got the message that I saw him the first time, but still looked then what is trying to get across? That he’d cheat on his wife with me?? Or am I being too over dramatic/ overthinking it because I’d assume it’s somewhat normal for married people to be tempted but wouldn’t actually act on it.

I’m thinking if I should bring it up next time I see him? Just something like “So am I mistaken or were you checking me out when I came back into work wearing my sweats Saturday morning? Bc I could’ve sworn, you’re eyes were a little low for a decent amount of time” 

Maybe that’s too much. Idk. Maybe it’d be best to just leave it behind me. But what if something like that happens again with him? I know this is a normal thing to be attracted to someone you work with and maybe make hints on it but it’s never happened to me at this level. 

Sorry for the long read. Please help me make sense of this. What do I do/not do?",27Apr2019,0
292,"Today is my first day off in a long time, and I've been on the pc playing games all morning.

After a few minutes, he asked me to stop playing the game until he was finished because the sound of the clicking mouse was distracting him. I asked him if the whole point of meditation was not just to be present, and said that I felt I shouldn't have to stop what I'm enjoying doing for that.

296,"This is a long one. I sold some weed gummy bears at school and a kid got huge anxiety because he never did something like this before and these were super potent. He ended up going to the clinic and they sent him to the hospital. He was perfectly fine nothing was going to happen to him. They ended up searching me the day I sold them and found nothing the other gummy bear I sold was already ingested by the other dude who was fine. They all ratted me out including one other kid who was a witness. They ended up getting camera footage of me selling those gummy bears. Since they couldn't prove those gummy bears had any THC in it I ended up getting 3 days suspension and sent to an alternative school for 75 days with a possibility of early release from there.

Out of State public school - 66k/year with 10,000/yr scholarship renewable each year, low-interest loan, and an honors program.

299,"I was with her for two and and a half years and we were each others first serious relationship, the breakup was very sudden and she gave vague reasons such as i dont feel the same way anymore but i believe she lost feelings due to needy and clingy behaviour on my part. On the day of the breakup i begged and pleaded which i now know was a bad move. I was very close to her family and they all messaged me saying how shocked and saddened they were by her decision. We also never had a major argument during this time. 

After she asked for space i stopped contacting her but it only took a few days for her to message me looking for emotional support and i even picked her up to talk, during this talk she said that she may be feeling depressed and needed to sort her own head out so we could work on the relationship and that she was not sure what she wanted. This gave me a sense of hope but a few weeks later when i tried to initiate reconcilliation she said that she had to follow her gut and it wasnt what she wanted any more so i agreed with her.

I went into a two week no contact period and then sent an elephant in the room text apologising for my needy behaviour and for pushing her away, i also said i still wanted her in my life and i wanted to start over with a clean slate. She replied saying how she appreciated what i had and said, that it took balls and that she wanted to stay in touch. 

After that we exchanged messaged a couple times a week with me mostly initiating and her being blunt at times. 

For the last couple with weeks we have been talking almost every day, with her initiating if i dont message for a few days, during one conversation she opened up about how she has been struggling with her parents divorce and feels stuck in the middle but when i tried to talk to her about that after she said she was fine and it wasnt deep. 

I believe she has been trying to make me jealous with a person from her work whos name she wont tell me , she told me she was going shopping alone with him but in the background of a post she put up on social media i could see her little sister making it clear she wasnt actually with him and when i asked a friend of mine who works with her who it could be she had no idea and it may not even be a person. She claims to constantly argue with this person and vents to me about it but just says she forgives him too easily as they have a complicated relationship, when i asked why she said i wouldnt like it and when i hinted at how i thought there might be something more than friends to their relationship she made a joke about them sleeping together then immediately deleted it and said she was kidding,  that she didnt think i was ready for that kind of banter yet, and that she could never with throwing up emojis. I responded by saying i know we arent together anymore and you can do what you want but i dont want to her that kind of thing and we carried on the conversation as normal. 

Two days ago we had an hour long conversation on the phone, just catching up and joking around. She made a comment about how boys are more complicated than girls because they have no balls and dont say how they feel. Which  may have been a hint at something i am not sure. 

We had a text conversation after this and she asked me if a mutual friend had told me she was playing hard to get which he hadnt done. She was switching between being blunt in the conversation and putting effort in which also confused me. After that she asked why i was making effort to continue the conversation and i said if thats how you feel then all you have to do is say, she replied with nah just saying we aint gotta talk and then carried on the conversation. She also made a comment about how i dont know her very well anymore.

After that i realised she had deleted me from snapchat the day before and now i am very confused and not sure what my next steps should be, part of me wants to call her and ask if she actually wants to remain in contact, tell her how i feel and then get on with my life whereas another  part thinks i should go back into no contact and wait for her to message me.

300,"I went to university when I was 18 to do nursing and I absolutely hated it, I left and had a year out working on my mental health and such. I then started a new university course in forensics and I’m just about to finish my second year but plan on leaving when it’s done. 

The thing is I just really don’t like it, I’m depressed and can barely manage to get out of bed most days. But finishing university is what’s expected of me from all my family members even though my parents/aunts/uncles never went. I have no idea what to do with my life and I think at my age it’s okay to not know as I don’t have children to rely on me or a mortgage/rent and I don’t want to commit to something I hate for the rest of my life. 

How can I convey this to my parents in a way that doesn’t make me just look lazy/look like I just want to sit around unemployed for the rest of my life? And to also help them understand I’m going through some shitty stuff and it’s not just ‘what being an adult is like’",27Apr2019,3
301,"So I have been depressed for as long as I can remember. Throughout my childhood and teenage my way of dealing with it was to supress it, brush it aside with humour and basically not letting anyone know that I was depressed. I supressed it so much, that I wasn't able to accept it to myself. Mom is a psychologist and taught in the same shool as me and being the hellraiser I was, she would have never believed me if I told her about it. And she would have basically controlled the fuck out of me which I never wanted. So I never opened up about it. 

Until college. When I got away from my city and started talking to people, and actually relating to them, that I finally accepted that I have been depressed my whole life. And the more I talked about it. The more it came out to the surface. To the point, where my entire persona right now revolves around it. And I hate it. 

I met this girl, who I fell in love with. She has depression as well. And the more we talked, the more I related to her and ended up making her a part of my coping mechanism to the point where only she is giving me happiness right now. 

We broke up about a month ago. And I am in pieces. Her way of dealing with it from what I understand is not caring about shit and just keep moving on. Which is basically what I used to do before college. But now that it's on the surface and everyone around me knows that I am depressed. Everyone treats me a certain way. Which is getting me more depressed. But if they don't talk to me that way, I don't know how to respond because that has basically become my persona now. And I am hating it. 

Even at home, now that they know about it. I am controlled the fuck out of. Even though I never let my parents do it. Which makes it worse. Constantly being adviced by my mom makes it worse. And the environment at home is basically everyone fighting with each other all the time. Sister is depressed. I am depressed. Dad is depressed. And my mom doesn't know how to deal with anything. So she just loses her shit all the time. To the point where I can't live at home.

I don't know if talking about it more made it worse. As I had never done it before the age of 19. I am so confused right now and I don't know what to do about anything. I want to fix things with my girlfriend and at least be friends. Because somewhere I get a huge confidence boost just talking to her. And now that she isn't responding normally, each time I talk to her makes it worse. She told me I need to be there for myself. I don't know how to anymore. I feel so alone all the time despite having people all around me. This just makes me feel like I am faking it. Despite not. The random crying spells for absolutely no reason. The constant sadness and feeling of self loathing. My loss of vocabulary. I can't construct sentences properly anymore while speaking to people. 

It's not this way all the time. Sometimes I feel happy for no fucking reason. And I do everything I can to keep it that way until it all just goes to shit. Also having ADHD, my thought process is all jumbled up and I am constantly in my own fucking head. 

Meds make it better. But on some days they just give me so much anxiety that I am not able to cope with shit at all. Concerta 36mg for adhd. Sertaline 50mg for social anxiety. Nexito 20mg for depression.

Okay this has dragged on for too long and I don't know how to TlDr this. Someone please help. I don't know what to do.",27Apr2019,1

I've had issues with depression since a kid. I remember teachers would always call me ""Eeyore"" because of my apathetic personality and monotone voice. I can't really remember any time in my life I was genuinely happy...I digress. I think of suicide every day and came close to trying recently. The only reason I haven't yet is because of the repercussions it will have on my family. I suppose I'm just looking for people who can relate, or some advice.

For more context when I was a kid, around 4th grade I was placed into special education and segregated from the rest my peers because, well I would assume teachers noticed I wasn't picking up what she was putting down very well compared to the average students. Not to mention I was extremely hyper and never paid attention. Being in special education wasn't really a problem as a kid until I started to become more socially aware and I realized that there's a reason I'm in different classes. To this day I assume I must not be very bright if I was put in ""special classes"". On top of all these inhibitions bullying was a constant issue in and out of school. Kids at school treated me like a cretin, an outcast then I would go home to a dysfunctional family and wasn't treated much better especially from my sister. I won't really go into that though, I'm sure you get the picture.


So to summarize everything I'm now 25 years old, socially incompetent, only 1 friend, started drinking a lot, can never keep a relationship platonic/romantic, incredibly insecure and depressed. I moved to a new city recently and got a very lucrative job but I'm still so unhappy and alone. I'd like go to therapy but I won't have insurance until November so I'm kinda just stuck in this state of melancholy. Anything will help.",27Apr2019,9

306,"So recently a very good friend of mine has separated from her husband. Since then she has went wild and has been having lots of casual sex. Me being her best friend she comes to me for advice as shes done for the past 8 years. To give everyone some back story weve been friends since I was around 16 and she was 13 and I used to ride a motorcycle in the rain to her house to help her pick out clothes for school, I was the ""man of honor"" in her wedding I came to her house in sub zero weather so she didnt have to be alone, took her out many times when her husband was being shitty to her, i know every facet of this girls life every secret every insecurity, (just to let everyone know how close we were.) Well for all those years I was the go to when she needed help be it financially and emotionally. She would ask for help every once In a while for various things mostly relationship advice which was totally fine I enjoyed helping her. Here recently tho since her relationship with her husband has gone down hill, she has asked me to pay her phone bill which I've done for the past 3 months, I've offered to let her come stay with me and my fiancee to get out of her house and get her mind off things to wich she kept telling me over the course of a week ""o il be there tm"" which never happened. She only talks to me when she needs advice on the situation with her men and afterwards she hear what she needs wont talk until she needs help again. She has also asked me to drive 8 hours 1 way to pick up her mother who has gotten out of rehab. All of this is over the course of 2 weeks. So I recently cut her out of my life and feel terrible for it. Part of me wants to go see her and talk these things out and another side(including everyone I've talked to on the subject) says that shes using me and that's not how friendship goes. To make a long story short what should I do?",27Apr2019,1
307,"Hi Guys just looking for some advise here. My best friend since the age of 3 (I am 34 now) received concert tickets for Christmas from her husband. She made a big deal of offering me the other ticket saying ‘she would love me to come as this band was the soundtrack of our childhood and there is no one else she could think of going with’. Cut to today. I receive a text message with a rambling excuse but the jist of it was, her brother thought he could get a ticket for his girlfriend for the same concert but got let down and would I mind if she went on my ticket instead? The concert is next month. This has really upset me. Why is her disappointment more important than mine? Just a bit of background. We have always been really close, she is married with children so we don’t see each other as much as before but that’s life and we alway stay in touch my text.

314,"Hi, I'm a 22 years old med student but I'm struggling a lot. I'm halfway the course but I will need, being optimistic, 2 more years (8 instead of 6) to get the medical degree. 

All of the stress of not being able or good enough for med school, failing classes are impacting my life in a bad way.

I'm considering changing course (in the neuroscience field where I've already taken the admission test and passed it) where I think I can do better. I think a new start could be a good thing.

But I'm worried leaving med school would be a regret that will hunt me in the coming years.

I'm really full of doubts about my future. Anyone have same advices, similar story or anything else which can help me clear my mind?

Thank you.

p.s.: I'm not from US so leaving med school won't leave me with huge student loans to pay off, so don't consider the money factor (except that I will probably get a less remunerative job than being a doctor).",27Apr2019,1
315,"Here’s some info. 

The library at my school was as loud as the cafeteria last semester. That was extremely annoying in itself whenever I went in because I had a spare and wanted to do work. I couldn’t go anywhere else because at the same time people would have lunch. My teacher (Let’s call her T) was supervising the library at the time along with another teacher. They would walk around, do whatever behind their desks, etc but they didn’t really do anything about the noise level. We have signs in the library that you can’t eat in there and that you have to be quiet. I’ve told teachers in the library to help me out with the noise level and told people to lower their volume but all that happens is them shutting up for 2 seconds or them mocking me and then being loud again. Teachers did nothing helpful. What I believe they should have done is kick anyone out who’s being  obnoxiously loud. That sounds fair, right? 

Fast forward to now. I’m in the library during a class period and lunch doing my project with a friend. There’s a group of boys sitting at the table across from us playing phone games, laughing + talking loudly. Their noise level was quiet then it would erupt to louder. It got extremely annoying to the point I told them to go to the cafeteria if they were going to be loud. Makes sense, right? It was a simple request anybody with a shred of common decency would be able to comply, right? Nope. Not for them. They looked at me for a second and laughed. I’m red faced and started feeling like I was going to cry. I’m not a confrontational person in general, even if I’ve called people out before. They were wild laughing, dancing in their seats, one got up to laugh. I look toward T and she’s standing looking at me. I motion her to come over.

T (to the boys): you guys need to be quiet or else you have to leave 
Boy1: oh shi rlly?! *doesnt look at her and laughs with his friend*
T: yeah, I’d like some recognition please
Boy1: yeah yeah okay *still laughing* 

For 20 minutes they were doing this. Saying how funny this situation was, pointing at me while I sat there trying to hold back my tears and trying to continue my work. Once the period is over, they got up to leave but not before quoting what I said and laughing at me. I went to talk to the main librarian (Imma call her M) and T. I asked for some regulation with these situations. This is how the conversation goes:
T: they were quiet before
Me: yes and I get that but once you leave they’re loud again
T: it wasn’t to my knowledge but they were quiet before
Me: and I’m telling you that they change their volume once you leave. This is a recurring thing that they do, not just today but last semester as well (my friend had them during her spare and they would do this)
T: i didn’t personally know. Do you know those boys (to M) ?
M: yeah I have to deal with them a lot (idr if she said that she’s kicked them out before) 
At this point I couldn’t hold it in anymore, tears were falling and they kinda looks shocked at that. They were like “We see this affects you” and saying that they’ll look into it.

I left to go to the washroom and try to clean up myself because when I saw myself in the mirror my eyes were bloodshot. I didn’t go to my last period, stayed in the washroom for a bit just in case they aren’t in class and so I won’t see them again then left the school. There was so much frustration in me because why do I have to deal with these type of people? I appreciate when other student speak up and at least try but a lot of the time people didn’t say anything but complain to their friends that they’re being loud and annoying. Like we see the teachers doing nothing, I also got the vibe they wouldn’t do anything helpful which discourages ever asking for some help. I don’t get why aren’t the teacher supervisors not doing something about it. M is the one who kicks people out and it’s only her. The others just allow it to happen because their “stern talking to” is apparently enough. 

I told a friend what happened while bawling to her about it and she told me that one of those boys made her sister cry because he mocked her for her accent and because she was defending her friend. Two of the boys also like to mock disabled people and have some history of being rude and immature. 

Now I don’t know what to do. Someone said I should bring it to my vice principal, but that wouldn’t do anything. They can’t do anything. They were disrespectful once to me so I gotta wait until they do something again to do anything. Even so, what would they tell those boys? Apologize? I don’t want their apologies and that isn’t gonna fix their behaviour towards other people either. I’m so paranoid that they’re gonna see me in the halls and mock me and laugh. I hate feeling I have to avoid certain areas just so I don’t encounter them and this added anxiousness. I don’t think that telling them to be quiet was wrong, but I just wish I had never opened my mouth in the first place. I’m stuck with these feelings that I don’t want and I want to do something about it. Most preferably, do something to them that won’t get me expelled or sued, you know? So any ideas?",27Apr2019,2

Its a challenge especially if we are carrying something that needs to go outside. We were planning on having a get together in the yard this weekend but rescheduled to a different venue because it would be embarrassing to have guests walk through her room to get outside.

323,"I spent 20 minutes eating her out and a lot of time massaging her and then she sucked my dick for 30 seconds, got me slightly hard and expected that I be ready to go. I kept telling her that I’m a bit tired and it takes more than a woman just sitting there to get me going.  She wasn’t offended, but I just left.

It’s been a while since I’ve had sex, but I’ve usually had pretty attentive partners. We knew why we were there and did the best to get each other off.  I expected because this woman was older that she’d know to spend a bit more time getting me hard 

Just a bad one night stand or is it natural to have my dick at attention during sex all the time, this has never been a problem in the past.

331,"Due to sexual abuse (and victim shaming by my family), I’ve always been scared to talk to my family about dating. I’ve never gotten past the talking stage or a few dates because I’m scared of the “meeting my parents” conversation.

Even though I tell my mom that I’m not dating or having sex (I’ve had sex before but in general,  I’m not) she accuses me of sneaking around and being pregnant (I’ve gained weight and I find this especially rude because I struggled with an ED in the past and ik that she uses this to make fun of me for gaining weight which she does deliberately at times).

She tries to make me stay the night at her friends house when she does, when I’m home alone for a few hours-a day, she calls over her boyfriend (who I’ve only known for almost a year), and in general she treats me like a younger her (she grew up in the hood going to parties and freaknik but she raised me in a quiet white neighborhood in mainly private school and the only thing my parents taught me about sex is that I shouldn’t have it and to stay away from boys) 

She gets angry and nags and bickers when I don’t want to go out with her even though I’m almost 19 and I feel like I have the choice to tell her that. I do everyone in the houses chores including cleaning her room, grocery shopping, answering her when she calls me to do something like I’m a butler (to the point where my previously treated tendinitis is killing me from running up and down the stairs for her again), and sometimes making her phone calls or filling out her forms. 

I understand that being a working mom is hard but at this point I think it’s laziness and she’s treating me like a butler who’s private life is up for discussion at any time and that it’s unfair

335,"About a month and some change ago I applied to this job right down the road from my house. It was a sweets shop (ice cream, candy, treats, etc), and it was an alright job, I just needed a job fast and for the summer and I was hired on the spot. No interview, I just filled out an application right in front of the manager (who was a year older than me, and graduated from the same school as me, and somehow knew who I was) so I just figured she hired me because she knew who I was, and I started the very next day. 
My first day was chill, a lot of 16 year olds worked there so I expected there to be a lot of drama. (I’m about to be 21 btw) 
There was this one 16 year old who in particular gave off the bitchiest vibes. Like when she came around, my whole aura was thrown off, she just bothered me for no reason. At first I didn’t let my guard down, if she did something or said something bitchy I kind of snapped back or just ignored her. Then I just started realizing like maybe that’s just who she is, I need to chill, give her the benefit of the doubt, and I did. 
I made amends, I tipped her a dollar after she checked me out for a water, and that’s how I personally just ended the pretend war between us, and that was it, I was over it. 
Then she started to try and get into my personal business and ask me all these weird questions and I wouldn’t tell her, I would just ask why do you want to know. 
I personally don’t like having friends because I don’t trust a lot of people, and I definitely didn’t trust this bitch with a single inch of my body. 
I figured out she was also the “whistle blower” of the place, and reported everything back to the manager. I found this out after my boyfriend came in to buy some candy, but it was literally expired from January. I was working with the bitch that day, and I hadn’t mentioned how she was to him before, but he asked in front of both of us if he could get the candy for free since it was expired, then bitch told him there were other candies to choose from that weren’t expired. 
We both ignored her and I told him I’ll just talk to the manager. 
She then proceeds to go into the back of the store, and call the manager, then comes back and starts looking at all the candy and taking down the expired candy and brought it to the back. She comes back to the front and explains how the manager is going to check the candy cause it’s probably still good..... (they knocked the price down to $5, and its still expired.. can they do that?)
But anyways, that bothered me a lot because I could have talked to the manager myself, she just wanted to butt in like fuck off bitch. 
Anyways, so the thing about the manager is she’s not going to tell you straight up if she has a problem with you or not. She takes all the drama she hears from everyone else and doesn’t do anything but talk shit to her sidekick (co-manager I guess). 
Okay getting to the point, so on Thursday at like 9:30am, I was looking at my schedule, and the manager uses this app called “When I Work”, and I had hella hours, I was scheduled almost everyday for two weeks, not even an hour or two later I go to look at it again, and I’m only working one day next week, and one day the week after that. So I messaged her about it to see wtf is up, and she didn’t text me till the next day 15 mins before I was suppose to come in. 
The whole time I was thinking she was about to fire me, it like ruined my whole off day I let it get to me so hard, and I didn’t want to text her again or go up there and look like a psycho. I mean it’s my money I understand but I have hella anxiety to do that. 
But she explained to me how she was sorry she didn’t respond, she had a long day blah blah, and she was just switching the schedule around. 

But my boyfriend was having problems with his gall bladder so we went to the emergency room and were there for like 4 hours, and I told her I was gonna bring a note when I come in, so I wouldn’t get fired, but she didn’t text me back at all. Then when I checked my schedule last night, she had completely removed me from the group on the app. I texted her at 10:15 last night and asked if I was fired and didn’t get a respond. 
So this morning I woke up, and texted this girl who was a couple years older than me that worked there, but had just been recently fired for, what I heard she was stealing tips. (We make a surprising amount of tips for a sweet shop, even splitting the tips between everyone you made a lot of money) 
 But I didn’t think she would do that, she was like cool as fuck and we got along so well, so I asked her if the manager even told her why she was fired. She said the manager didn’t tell her a single thing and she didn’t even know people were saying she was fired for stealing tips. The manager just took her off the schedule the same way she did to me. 
She tried to text her and she left her on read. 
Like what kind of shit is this. 
I want to go up there today and ask her what the fuck is up, like why did you fire me, like would that be the best thing to do?

337,"I've been trying to teach my 18 year old son how to drive. We've been practicing every weekend for three weeks. He has been making no progress. He keeps making little mistakes. He has trouble staying in the center of his lane, he makes jerky stops, he gets nervous when other cars are around, etc. He also seems to not be paying attention enough.

When we were out practicing, he made a wrong turn on a one-way street. He told me, ""I mistook that turn for another turn I was supposed to make."" The biggest mistake he made was yesterday when he ran a stop sign as a truck was turning.
A truck was turning, and I was telling him, ""Get over so you can give the truck some room to turn."" As I was telling him to do that, he ran a stop sign and almost hit the truck. I think he got nervous and was focusing on giving room for the truck that he didn't realize he ran a stop sign.

After that I gave him an ultimatum. I asked him, ""Do you want to drive or take public transportation? You have to make a decision because I'm going to give up. It did not take me this long with your siblings.""

We've been practicing every week for three weeks, and his progress has been very slow. There are days where he did well, but then other days where he regresses. I'm not sure if he's nervous or if he's still not ready to do it.

He didn't learn when he was 16 because he said he wasn't ready yet. Now that he's 18, I think it's a good time for him to learn. But, he's not really picking up on it.

What should I do?

338,"I'm feeling pretty very bad about things I did when I was young (12 to 15).  
Some context, I guess:. 
At an early age and up until the end of high school i was frequently abused. I was held at gunpoint when I was 10 and told I was going to be killed, and very nearly raped a couple years later (I think he only stopped out of guilt), as well as having physical abuse from other children. I was beaten and threatened daily. There was also parental neglect and other things.  
These led me to develop extremely severe anxiety and borderline personality disorder.  
  
The things that make me feel extremely guilty
 - When I was around 14, I used child porn once
Back then I didn't understand the social complexities of why what I did was wrong. I have 0 attraction to children and I've been told that I was just into other kids my own age, as well as the fact that this behavior can be caused by trauma, but thinking about this makes me feel like a disgusting, awful worthless person.  
- When I was 15 or 16, I was into bestially
I'm not into bestiality anymore. as with the other thing I now know and understand that consuming it is just as bad as abusing these poor animals and people yourself.   
  
I have never directly physically harmed another person. I've never so much as gotten into a fight .  
whenever I think about having done these things as a child I feel so awful and disgusting. that these are the secrets that I have to keep, that they can't just be other shameful things, that I can never wash these away. I feel compelled to tell anyone I'm with because they shouldn't be with someone so disgusting, even if I would never ever do what I did now. 
  
I'm so scared that I can never be loved and that I don't deserve it, that I'm an absolutely terrible person for having done these things. I break down frequently out of guilt and honestly feel like nothing is worth it (but I am not suicidal, the anxiety prevents this). 
  
for reference I am 18 now.  
am I disgusting and unlovable? I know I need to seek therapy, I don't have the funds for it. 
I don't want to be a lost cause so early on in my life",27Apr2019,1

Then! There there was unprotected sex, on 18, 19, 20, 21 April. 

I took the pill till 22 April. And then I stopped. I stopped because I was completely nauseous and took me a while to get my head together. So I have the following questions - 

1. When exactly do you start ovulating if you stop taking BC pill mid-pack?
2. Is it possible that I could also get pregnant? I have not had any sexual intercourse after 21st.
3. My endocrinologist said I should wait it out, or probably just take the ovulation test to determine if I have been ovulating. How does that work?

351,"So I’ve recently been working on bringing medication into my life because I’ve heard it helps people cope with stress and anxiety. 

Today I decided to try to meditate for 15 minutes after I took a nice relaxing shower. When I got out, I saw my girlfriend was playing games on the computer with the volume up. I asked her if she could turn the volume off so I could meditate for a bit and she agreed. 

So I tried to meditate for a few minutes but the clicking of her mouse kept distracting me. I asked her if she could pause the game until I was done meditating. Like I said, it wouldn’t be longer than 15 minutes. Then she said that the whole point of meditating was to be in the moment and that if it really bothered me I could find someplace else to meditate. I felt that she was being kind of patronizing telling me how to meditate when she hasn’t been meditating herself at all. Plus I was only asking for 15 minutes of her time.

352,"I've noticed that sister's method of watching her kids is giving them an iPad and letting them watch what ever videos on YouTube they want.  I noticed that lately he has been watching those kids YouTube channels, which are basically parents exploiting their kids to produce content for them so they can make money.  I've always wondered who actually watches these types of videos now I know.

The reason I'm wondering if I should say something is because I've read countless stories about these YouTube kids being abused for not performing well in these videos.  A quick search for ""YouTube Mom"" brings up this story https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/20/us/youtube-fantastic-adventures-mom-arrest-trnd/index.html

It all seems exploitative and I get an uneasy feeling when I see my nephew watching these videos and my sister doesn't seem to care.

With that being said, I am not the parent.  Trying to explain what these types of videos are will probably do nothing except waste my time.  I probably should let it go.

&amp;#x200B;

 ''...i placed a malware on the X streaming (sexually graphic) web site and there's more, you visited this site to experience fun (you know what i mean). While you were watching video clips, your web browser initiated functioning as a RDP having a keylogger which provided me with access to your screen and web camera. immediately after that, my software gathered all of your contacts from your Messenger, Facebook, and emailaccount. after that i created a double-screen video. First part shows the video you were viewing (you've got a fine taste omg), and next part shows the view of your web camera, yea it is you.''  


This person wrote a password I use mainly for job searching websites and that's the only thing I could say he has as accurate pesonal information.

I mean, in order to make it belivable I would copy paste a link of the videos I watched or a Screenshot of me masturbating right?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, he is asking for 966 USD in bitcoins as a donation or he will send the videos to my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I ocassionally watch porn on Pornhub, but I do not have an account. I honestly do not upgrade my anti virus so I do not know if this is really possible or just a pishing case. 

Of course this person says calling the police will not help me as his account can not be traced.

To understand the background, I had a crush on this girl since mid 2016. I eventually realized I had absolutely no chance with her and gave up in the middle of 2018. 

I came back to school after the summer and there was this new girl in my group of friends. I thought she was cute but she was kinda reserved and kept to herself a lot. A few months pass and its about November. Me and her have hung out a few times with other people before and I could safely say at this point I had a crush on her. Still being the shy guy i am I didn't act on it until recently in March I found out she had a crush on me this whole time. But by this point I had given up on her, I no longer really liked her that much.

I didn't want to lead her on because me and her were really good friends at this point and I didn't want to lead her on. I decided to ask her out, and she said yes. We went for coffee on a date.  Before all this me and my previous crush had been getting closer and we started talking a lot more than before.

I realised after the date I went on with the other girl, i didn't really like her that much anymore and I didn't want a relationship to form out of it. I feel really mean for saying this but a relationship did form out of it and I don't want to persue it anymore and I don't know how to tell her.

Tl;dr I had a crush on a girl and realised I had no chance. I developed another crush on a different girl over months and asked her out even though I stopped liking her and started liking my previous crush and I don't know what to do.

He runs his own business which is picking up merchandise from L.A then selling it at the swap meet/flee market and setting up canopies at houses, workplaces, junkyards, etc. On the weekdays I get up around six or seven in the morning, on the weekends I have to wake up around 4 for the swap meet so I’m pretty much working there on 6 hours of sleep. We’re there until 2:00 and my grandfather pays me $30 which is ok since this isn’t a legit job. 

Sounds fine but I don’t like how he speaks to me....every time I make a mistake or get something wrong or if I have a hard time doing something he always feels the need to ridicule me and insult my intelligence. He would also go on about how he’s older and wiser and I’m young and naive. Keep in my mind I try my best on this job. At the swap meet I lay out everything out on the table which takes me an hour to do, I clean stuff, I organize everything, I take merchandise the consumer bought all the way to their car outside with a dolly (which is heavy ass all hell at times), during canopy setups I lay everything out including the bungie cords and I put the tarp over the frame and tie it down. He’s 77 and his arms aren’t what they used to be so I have to literally help him lift the entire frame of the canopy up in order to help him put the pulls inside the slot of the connector. He wouldn’t be able to get any of that done without me and he seems to not appreciate it at all. 
 
One time during a setup I was having a hard time tying a bungie cord and in the distance I heard him call me a “pendejo” which is Spanish for “dumbass”. English isn’t his first language so he’s horrible at being elaborate and he gives me very vague orders. I can’t understand what he’s telling me at times because he tells me to do one thing without any specific detail. For example, he tells me to pt something in the van and we have two vans mind you, he tells me but he doesn’t tell me specifically which van it is or doesn’t point towards it so I have to play the guessing game with him and wait for him to react when I put what he told me to put in the van. Just like now and this just happened....we have tool belts hanging off the frame of the canopy and they were super close to each other they had no slaw in between them so he tells me to separate them and I do that but then he sighs and is like “I told you to put them over here” and points to the far side of the canopy......

I’m done, I’m considering on leaving but I don’t know if that would be the right thing to do....he pretty much counts on me to help him over here. Even our helper is fed up with him.

at night I have to keep my bedroom door closed. my roommates cat is not allowed in my room as that cat has major peeing issues. So I have to keep my bedroom door closed about 99% of the time.

I am convinced that kazooie understand her door scratching annoys me, but it's starting to get really bad. she has been waking me up AT LEAST once an hour, every hour I'm ""sleeping"", for weeks on end now. I haven't had a full nights rest in what feels like months and my brain cannot take it anymore.

it's getting to the point she's starting to tear up the carpet outside my door and I rent an apartment :// 

does anyone have any advice on how to get kazooie to stop?? she is not afraid of loud noises, so clapping/shouting/making a noise at her to stop does not work. she's not even afraid of the vacuum.",27Apr2019,2

374,"Long story short...

I was planning to surprise someone for their retirement and went through the right channels to find out details. I talked to all the right people, I clearly identified myself and reasons why I wanted to do this. I was eventually given a date and an invitation. That invite was later taken back due to ""staff only""

I'm well aware that I received this invite on accident and I would have been fine with ""Thanks for your interest but it staff only, here are some alternatives..."" from the get go but to be uninvited hurts deeply. 

I'm a major donor to this location and this situation has left a bitter taste in my mouth. I understand the reasons behind it, but yet I found it unprofessional in the way it was handled. Through checks and donations, this location has gotten nearly $4,000 from me. 

Do I have the right to not be interested in donating anymore? To me taking back the invite by saying ""sorry, staff only"" is like me canceling a check and saying ""sorry, the money is for family only"" 

What do I do?",27Apr2019,3
376,"Okay. I really hope this belongs here. That's one of my fears. I'm always paranoid about whether or not I'm saying the right thing or doing the right thing in that moment. You could say I should not think too much about what other people think but it doesn't seem to be as easy as just shrugging off. I have never met a therapist and talked about my problems. And it is simply out of the question because it is very expensive around here. And it is also difficult to find a proper, qualified therapist even for a massive price. Which is why I don't necessarily understand what exactly is wrong with me.

I am not, and have not, been able to communicate comfortably with people in social situations. I thought this was just a part of my personality and that I would be able to cope with it with more exposure to social situations, but it has been a crippling problem. I have had friends when I was in school. And a handful at college, but never anyone that I could call a best friend or anyone I properly connected with. I have explored the social game as wide as possible. I have visited clubs and hung out in corners not being able to approach people. I don't even like clubs, but I went that far.

I tried volunteering with a mental health institute but I was still not able to communicate properly. From where I come from, people tend to say ""You don't talk much"" more often than initiating conversation and trying to start a topic to at least talk about. I have never had a Girlfriend because I have never been able to talk to a girl for long enough before embarrassing myself. I'm not gonna say I'm not attractive at all because, I seriously don't know. I have never been complimented in my entire life by any girl or friend about how I look let alone been given feedback. I try, I really do. Not to impress people. But to at least be a part of social life. I did have a girl who I thought was my best friend. She got really worried once when I said I was thinking about ending my life. This was when I wasn't in my best of times and she somewhat helped stop me from doing it. I don't really have suicidal thoughts anymore. But you never know right? She has very carefully ghosted me ever since. I probably scared her off.

I have never talked about this with anyone but I have been sexually abused when I was 10. I didn't even know it was sexual abuse back then. But I feel like....I don't how to express what I feel like in words when I think about it now. Again I don't understand whether this has anything to do with what I am like now. And there has been a lot of fights between my parents when I was a child. My mother tried to commit suicide. I barely remember that one. And my grandmother was the worst and most devious human being I have ever met. Childhood was pretty shit, but my parents managed to stitch things together and haven't caused too much of a ruckus after we grew up. We as in me and my Sister. I can't really talk to my Sister because a) she is abroad attending University and is very busy with a bunch of her own problems and b) I can't really listen to her cry right now over this, it's the last thing I need.

I also have this problem of feeling invisible when I do manage to talk. It's almost as if I'm not heard. I mean I understand that they must have heard me. But it seems as if they choose not to hear. I know this sounds stupid and It's obviously something wrong with me. I want to understand how to cope with this better. There was a time when I would have gladly just swallowed a bunch of pills. But I want to understand if there is a way to live with this. Is there a way to improve connections with people?

I am very sorry about this extremely long post and I completely understand if you skip it. But if you have time to stop by and read it thank you very much. And if you took the time reply thank you so much. I know people have bigger problems than this because I lurk a lot on this sub and seen things people go through that are way worse.

And she gave some hints she liked me last year but then after a while it wasn’t going anywhere and we stopped talking all summer. 

  She’s in my fitness class (basically just working out for a hour and a half) this year and I kinda developed a crush on her, I’m pretty fit and am kinda a show off in class with pull-ups and bench press and all that.  I was hoping she would notice but I’m not sure if she does. I asked to start up a streak again and we went back to the same bs small talk and shit. 

  We haven’t talked a ton in person but sometimes I’ll make a joke with her and she laughs but we don’t talk a ton. This week she hasn’t been snapping much even though she’s usually on her snap quite a bit. Like she wouldn’t open for a day almost when we were just sending nothing pics but when I tried starting up a couple convos about mutual interests and she seemed interested and would snap back right away.

  Any advice on how to move forward? I am always shy when I first meet a girl but idk why I can’t just go and talk to her normally. I have dated a couple girls before and I’m pretty loose and outgoing once I get going but I can’t seem to get over my nerves this time.",27Apr2019,2

Ok so I’m 17F. When I’m on my period I get excruciating pain which doesn’t go away with painkillers, sickness, dizziness and I pass out almost constantly. This seriously disrupts my day to day life, for example I can’t go do school etc. Also I lose A LOT of blood and the iron levels in my blood drop dramatically. 

This started happening when I first got my period when I was 10 and has never stopped for 7 years. When I was about 13/14 I realized that this wasn’t normal and I told my mom, who told me I my period is probably a little ‘heavier’ than average. And I just accepted that. 

About a year ago I started reading about conditions like endometriosis. I told my mom I wanted to go see a doctor and maybe they could help me relieve the pain so I don’t have to stop my life for days at the time just because I’m on my period and can’t leave the bathroom. I told her that maybe I could start taking the pill or something.

She told me I’m being irrational and overly dramatic and she thinks the pill is just an excuse for having sex and she would never let me take it and that now she’s suspicious I’m having sex.

394,"A little backstory. I'll do a tl;dr at the end. 
I just graduated with a master's in counseling. I've been applying for jobs outside of my state. Doing that is really difficult because 1) my experience consists primarily of internships, and 2) a lot of places are wary of hiring outside of their area. I've gotten a couple of bites on jobs but only one serious offer. It's doing exactly what I want to do where I want to do it.

The only problem is the pay. The pay is really low. Like, in my opinion $8000 a year lower than where it should be. I would be able to live on it, but just barely. I may be able to save $1000 a year if I don't go over budget on any of my basics. That means food, insurance, lights, rent, internet, and student loans. That also means I won't be able to buy new furniture, or clothes or makeup or splurge on myself every once in a while. It seems pretty, but in grad school I wasn't even living paycheck to paycheck. I was living off of savings from student loans. I don't want to go back to feeling guilty for buying a $10 shirt. 

But, it's the only job offer I've gotten. I want this job. I've sent them information about my past experience that may up the pay they offer me. But, if it doesn't, I don't think I can negotiate a higher salary. Based on the way they said they pick salary. I don't know what I am going to do. The other problem is where I live now. It's terrible. My worst nightmare. I don't like my apartment, I don't like the area, I literally have nightmares about this place. I need to get out of here. And I want to be out by the end of next month. I just need to be. So I want to take this job. But if I do, I'll be struggling financially, which is something I feel like I shouldn't be doing with a full on grown up professional job. But if I don't take the job, I'll be stuck here, I probably won't hear from other places, and I really can't stay here. It's a literal nightmare.

Tl;dr, I was offered a job doing exactly what I want to do, but the pay is almost too low for me to live on. Taking the job would mean moving to a new city, which is what I really want to do, and I really hate where I live now. Not taking the job would mean staying here longer, as Im not having much success job hunting other than this.",27Apr2019,1

396,"Hello, I’m an 18 year old, female cancer patient. I was diagnosed with stage II adrenocortical carcinoma at 17 and stage IV at 18. My team of doctors at Moffitt Cancer Center has told me that I had developed the cancer at 14 years old. Looking back, I realized that it had affected me my whole time in high school. It started with mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety, and expanded to physical symptoms. The symptoms eventually became so bad in the second semester of my junior year that by senior year, I couldn’t participate in many senior-exclusive activities such as prom, a trip to Universal Studios called “Grad Bash”, etc. Thankfully, I was able to graduate and participate in the ceremony. I even managed to graduate a semester early since I had completed extra classes online.

Since being diagnosed with stage IV, one of my oncologists has put me on a pill form of chemotherapy called Mitotane. I had surgery twice to remove the same kind of cancer, but the Mitotane is intended to destroy any potential lingering cancer cells in my body that may have been missed in the surgeries. Just like any chemo, this pill has debilitating side effects such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, etc. but thankfully no hair loss. Unfortunately, it still has prevented me from starting my life. I finally graduated high school in 2018, only to then not be able to join my fellow graduates in moving on in life. They all either joined the military, enrolled in college, or went straight to work - and here I am.

I asked my doctor how long she intended to keep me on the Mitotane and she gave a vague response of “As long as you can handle it”. I hope she doesn’t mean for the rest of my life, but even if it’s 2 years, I’ll be 20 years old with no job, no job experience, no college degree, not even any college credits. I can barely leave my house, let alone go to a job or college. Some days I’m even too tired to go on my computer to watch something to amuse myself. I’m on SSI and have Medicaid so while I am worried about that eventually being cancelled if they decide I’m not longer qualified, I have 2.5 years until they evaluate my file. I don’t make enough a month to survive anywhere except my parents’ house but I do pay them $100 per month in rent and the rest goes to necessities such as co-pays, medication costs, groceries, etc. 

I guess what I’m really looking for is some sort of reassurance that I’m not a loser. I’m frustrated and angry that this happened to me and affected me so badly that it’s delaying my life plans. I had dreams, I wanted to reach for the stars, but not many people around me even believe I can achieve much in life anymore. Once they heard “stage IV” they stopped encouraging me and telling me I could do anything I put my mind to. I do plan to try anyway, I’ve even been practicing German whenever I can so I can go to Germany for college, since Lord knows I can’t afford the price tags for an education here. 

I know I’m just asking internet strangers for their opinions, but it means a lot to me. Even if it’s not the answer I want, I’d at least want to know what I can do. I don’t want to be a leech or a burden to everyone around me, I want to move past this and become my own self-sufficient person. So, any and all feedback is appreciated. Thank you.",27Apr2019,1

TLDR: What to do after a Bachelor's Degree when you're lost in life? 

I'm really lost in life, so I figured out this may be the right place to ask for advice?   
I'm a 19-year old girl on her last year of Bachelor's Degree. This is a very young age to finish a Bachelor and I'm unsure that I want to start a Master's Degree right after (that would start in September). My degree is languages (English and Chinese) with law, marketing and economics classes. 

I like languages, but I wouldn't want to work in translation or stuff like that, it sounds so boring. The other classes are not too bad but I don't know if I could have a career in that.   
I have no real passions, but I do have several interests such as sports, yoga, reading... But I can't have a job in these fields.   
I'm an Adventurer personality (ISFPA/ISPT) and it suits me very well, but unfortunately, there's no clues on career paths (except that my career path will change lol very useful). 

I don't know if I should do another Bachelor degree, take a gap year (but for what? I don't have money to travel - I could also go to China study Chinese for a year but I'm not sure that's what I want..) or start my Master's degree. I'm constantly torn between ""I need a job with a good salary so I can travel, enjoy life how I want when I'm not working"" and ""life is too short to be bored everyday and have an uninteresting job"". 

If you could have any advice on when you're lost in life, I would gladly take it! Thanks for reading and have a nice day :) (I know there's tons of posts like that on Reddit but most of them aren't really useful like: ""first, choose your career path!"") Thanks!",27Apr2019,1

409,So I went on a walk with my dog on my usual way. So I got to a place ( kind of a basement) where an old man lived before but he was moved out of there. It is just like an partament underground. You can see the door - it is made out of glass. So as I got there I was looking arround and noticed a man in the window and looked at him. He was looking at me as well. I turned arround to see my dog taking a crap ... the perfect moment. So as I was waiting I heard a knock. I looked back at the door and a man stood there. Not the same as the one I saw. He waved at me and tried to ask me with his hands what was I doing there. I showed him my dogs lead to him and walked away. This guy looked suspicious af and now I am scared for myself and my family. I do not know why but I think that something fiahy might be going on there. ( the door was covered with a curtain so you could only see the inside from the upper right corner).

416,"So, my story probably sounds generic as Hell but I really could use help and advice from somebody on what the fuck should I do.  
So for about 2 years already I know this girl and we are best friends. We talk every day, play games together, watch videos or movies sometimes, either by ourselves or with the rest of the group of our friends, all that online because she lives in the US while I live in the Middle East. We are  getting along really good, she says I'm the person she trusts the most because she's not really open about her feelings and all that to other people, that I'm her first ever friend she trusts that much and can talk to about anything, she's quite shy and awkward, we are quite similar to the point that few of our friends used to make jokes along the lines ""Hey why aren't you two together if you are getting along so well"". But we always brushed them off because we weren't interested in each other in that way.  


About a month ago she went through some rough stuff because another good friend of ours stopped talking to us as much and the guy she also met online and liked couldn't date her because of his religion. And I as usual helped her out, she cried on a call with me and I managed to cheer her up and all that and help her start working on what bothers her. And for some reason from that moment I started developing romantic feelings for her (Wanting to meet her, be with her all that stuff) and I am really hesitant about it because she said multiple times that she thinks of me as a brother, which I totally understand but obviously it still hurts. I know that even if I confess I'm just gonna ruin stuff or make things awkward because so much is against us being together, her feelings towards me as a brother, HUGE distance and the guy she's still not fully over. But at the same time keeping this all a secret just hurts so much and I just wanna confess even if it will ruin something.  


I really don't know what to do. Just stop talking to her without any explanation to get over her? Confess and leave? Not confess at all and just try and power through it? I have no idea.

418,"Relevant back story:

I recently moved to a new city and I'm renting a room in my friend's house -- so I'm very unfamiliar with this city. I came here to attend a short career development program so I'm not making any money right now at all.

So the other day, we were trying to find a parking spot near the ""park and ride"" for the bus and we were kind of in a hurry, and my friend led me to an area where he said I could park -- it was this parking lot for some abandoned businesses. Right then I asked him ""are you sure it's legal to park here?"" He said yes.

So yes, the car was towed. As it turned out, there were actually several signs in the lot saying things like ""unauthorized cars will be towed."" My friend's girlfriend was there too and literally none of the three of us saw the signs. Again, I think we missed the signs partly because we were in a hurry and partly because my friend was so confident that this was OK to park here that we didn't even bother to look around.

Well, the car was towed and it cost $360 to retrieve it. Before we know how much it would be, my friend acknowledged he was responsible and said he would pay it. Then we found out it was $360 (quite a bit more than we expected). He still paid it, but I wonder if he's maybe feeling resentful about having to pay all of this and if maybe he's a bit pissed just that I didn't volunteer to pay part of it, especially since I'm living with him too (although I am paying him $1000 per month in rent, as we agreed a few months ago).

So should I feel like I should give him some amount of money just because, well, he's my friend and I wonder if I have at least some responsibility given that the signs were there and some people would argue I should have seen the signs anyway.

Anyway, just looking for opinions. Thanks.",27Apr2019,1

I responded to her message with “how do I respond to that?” 

- I don’t know how to feel, i know she’s not joking but i find it pretty demeaning that she needs to ask me like a child as if I can’t handle my self. I get the sentiment that she cares and that’s why she messaged me but the whole reason I asked her to stop talking to me was that I couldn’t stop thinking about her and these are super important exams.

I have tried to kill myself a year ago and the belt snapped but I got help for it and I’m on top of the world. It’s not her fault as every reason we needed to stop talking was because of me and she’s a good person but ffs I can’t fail these and I’m already extremely stressed without her making me question myself again.

426,"Hi all. Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

Some background: I (17F) have been babysitting since I was 12, and have been babysitting for this particular family, which consists of 3 kids (currently ages 3, 6, and 9) since I was 14. I adore the kids and the family. I babysit for them often, even staying over night a few times.

Where I live, according to care.com, the rate is about $14.50/hour for all the things I do as a sitter (keep the kids ofc, clean, drive kids around, homework help, cook, give baths, etc.), and i always charge &amp;10/hour, which I think is fair. 

On to the situation. The mom reached out to me asking if I could keep their youngest all day when they take their oldest to the beach to celebrate her birthday. She asked me to come at 7:30 AM and estimated they would be home around 9:30 PM. So, 14 hours. I agreed. 

So the day comes (yesterday), and I show up at 7:30 and it turns out I’m keeping both of the youngest kids. Okay, no problem. Wish I knew before hand, but, no problem. The mom told me he would be with the neighbors a lot throughout the day (his best friend lives there). The middle child was also already awake when I got there.

Throughout the day, I spent about $17-ish dollars of my own money on them, as they didn’t leave any spending money (despite that all their suggestions of what we do with the day included going out and spending money). I honestly didn’t mind though because I figured I would get paid adequately. 

I made sure the kids had a blast, we went to the park, got donuts, went to the play place at chick fil a, played outside for hours, etc.. The only times that the middle child spent any time with the neighbors, it was in the front yard and I was monitoring (unlike the mom said). I think it’s also important to note that the 3 year old is kind of going through a “terrible 3’s phase”, and she has been very difficult and defiant lately, which makes things quite difficult. The parents know and acknowledge this). After giving them a bath (not to mention we used a bath bomb I bought them) the kids finally went to bed at 8:30. I cleaned the house till 9:00, and they got home around 9:30. 

They were very appreciative like always. The mother wrote the check, folded it in half and gave it to me (she normally did this). I left, and when I got in my car I noticed I only got $100. That’s $40 less than what I expected for working for 14 hours. 

This has happened before with this family. There have even a couple of instances where they would underpay me like $10-$15, but I always let it go because although they aren’t poor, they defiantly aren’t rich. Another very important factor is that the mother is my moms co worker, which is how I met the family in the first place. They both work at a preschool, and they are good acquaintances. 

I don’t want to just never babysit for them again, because they are where I get most of my money because they ask me to babysit so often. It would be a huge toll if I stopped. 

I also have to be delicate because I wouldn’t want to make things awkward for my mom at work. 

I want to address this, perhaps over a text message because this is our main form of communication all the time. What the hell should I say???",27Apr2019,12

432,"Hi,

I'm a high school girl. My mom has always been short-tempered and will yell her head off at people over the smallest issues. She does that to us (her kids) too. She loves us, but when she gets angry she's really hard to deal with. She's the kind of person who has to get her way -- she only ends an argument when her opponent backs down and submits to her opinion/needs. 

I'm afraid that I've become my mother. I cope with anger and frustrations just like her -- I'll snap at anything that's annoying to me and shut things down so they go my way. I'll scream my head off at family members until things go my way. When it's quarrels with my mom -- we'll scream at each other until we're both in tears or until one of us gets their way. 

Last week we had another fight and it ended because my little sister was so scared from our yelling she was crying and begging us to stop fighting. That's was a major wake-up call to me. I want to fix my behavior -- I know I'm a really toxic family member.

I also realize that because I am a negative person at home, I cover that up by being a control freak and having major impostor syndrome at school.

At my moms we would all sit down for family meals, she would help us with homework, we would watch TV as a family or play games. At his house I was in charge of watching my younger brothers and whatever kids his many girlfriends had over. While he and his gfs went out drinking, partying, and doing illegal drugs.

436,"I am about 14 and a half and live in Baghdad. My parents divorced when I was a child. 
I wasn't very social in primary school but I somehow managed to get two friends in first grade which turned into a circle of about 15 people but after 4th grade I was transferred into another class because the school forgot to put me on the class list and my old class was already full,but I usually hung out with the friends from my former class but I was able to get friends in my new class too.
But nothing lasts forever and primary school ended, I had very good grades so I was able to get into one of a series of prestigious government funded schools, luckily many of my friends were able to get in, unluckily because of location I wasn't able to go to the same school as them, but I somehow managed to lose all my social skills in one summer because come school season and I wasn't able to speak with anyone, I want to talk about this part more but how I felt the past two years I can't put into words, I didn't (and still don't) even feel comfortable in my house so I would stay in my room the entire day, and soon I realized that I didn't actually have any friends outside of school.

441,"In my mid-late 20s, I fell down a dark hole. Struggled with rationalizing the extent of control I had over my thoughts, desires and actions. These years defined me to an extent. I never knew how deep the abyss can go, and I know I didn't even come close to the bottom off my free fall. But, I also fear I wasted precious time in my youth depressed as fuck.

Today, I am much better having crawled my way out of that hole. But I still struggle with the regret of all that time passing by and not a lick of anything to show for it, aside from mental strength, which still crumbles to dust from time to time.

I've always been a day-dreamer. Never seen myself tucked away in a cubicle, kissing ass all the way up the corporate ladder. Most of my time, throughout the whole of my life, has been spent pondering over ideas. Thousands of ideas. Creating my own ladder. And thankfully, I've had enough people in my life to support this abstract way of thinking. But, part of me is growing to believe it's now getting to the time to act. 

Only I don't believe in myself. Part because of the time spent in my 20s, and part my closest friend since 4th grade hardly wants anything to do with our friendship anymore. And that sucks. Him and I always seemed to be like ying-and-yang of one another. He doesn't see it, nor agrees with my abstract thinking because he needs numbers and data for validation, which I unfortunately do not see. And where I see our two ways of thinking as equals. He sees mine as a lesser compared to his. Despite that, I still believe if him and I can somehow see eye to eye, we could probably use our mental aptitude to do something truly great. 

But, we've taken a lot of frustrations out on each other so who knows given the rift dividing us at the moment. Also, recently landed myself a girlfriend. Whom at first I was very weary to lower my guard but a few months in and it's seeming easier and easier to confide and allow her in to a life that I don't feel particularly proud of...

And I don't want to lose her. But I have a lot of insecurities that I thought wouldn't cripple my mental wellbeing but they have.

All in all, I know this is super scatter brain but I'm just trying to paint a general overarc because I ultimately feel out of place, left behind, and unable to act. I'll have these grandiose ideas that I think are truly amazing and the world would love it. But, I start to hash them out, get discouraged, abandon them and move onto others. It's really starting to make me nervous as a lot of my peers, whom I graduated with, are moving up the chain into Senior positions and beyond. And I'm still stuck, living at home, working a well paying job with a brutal glass ceiling, tormented over where the fuck I want to go in life.

I used to always write, and want to become a screenwriter. Or cook and open a restaurant. Or code a video game and release it on Steam. And initially they seem like GLORIOUS paths away from where I am currently. But the more I think over them, and the time alloted to bring them into being, the skills required, etc etc makes me so overwhelmed and discouraged that I just spark up another blunt, get lost in the internet and obsess over watching stock charts day in and day out, hoping to god I hit the right one. And I do hit right plays from time to time but they are so far and in between that I freeze up more than I should, which I think grew out of a string of rejections over multiple years. And things like Disney over the past week, where I have the impulse to act weeks in advance, only to ignore it and watch what I thought would happen come into being without me aboard the ship... just kills me.

I'm worried I'm wasting enormous amounts of my time. But at the same time, wickedly struggle to snap my current set of habits and behavior, which developed over a monumental couple of years of continuous rejection from dating apps, lack of friends, and sheer boredom. Failing here and there with success laced throughout is okay; but failing constantly year over year without any success will fuck you so badly. It is getting better, somewhat, I'll do push-ups, work with dumbbells and try to drink more water while the markets are open. So I'm not just totally sitting in a chair staring at a screen. But I wish I could have blind faith in my creativity and just pursue something with absolute confidence. And as I write that, I feel the urge to do just that. But the thought of acting on it, makes it seem like a 100 ton boulder I just can't lift.

I've already rambled beyond all sense of the word, and I'm sure this doesn't even begin to paint the picture I'm trying to express. But if anyone took the time to read this, I really appreciate it. And if you have any sort of wisdom you'd like to share with me. I'd be grateful. Thank you.",27Apr2019,2

I am torn between loving being a mother and the guilt I carry about my first 3 children. Being happy as a mother now that I am sober feels like betrayal. I have no contact with the first 3 kids. I haven't seen them in 10 years. 
I want another baby so bad but when I think of the ones I failed, I am so overcome with shame that I don't want to have one. 
I don't post on Reddit.  I apologize if I have made any errors. I am just torn. I figured that this would be the place to get the most objective advice.",27Apr2019,1
446,"What short-term, INTENSIVE/IMMERSIVE hobbies (besides traveling) have people have done? I'm too busy to commit to anything long-term, but would love to get involved in 4-8 week crash-course hobbies where I walk away with a solid foundation on something new. I'm thinking of starting with a 7 week pottery/hand building/glazing class?? Wondering if there are some other cool ideas.

For some more context: So, I'm kinda depressed. But I was kinda inspired by the Beyonce Homecoming movie on Netflix 🙃 to try to give myself something joyful to live for... But rather than making a Coachella homecoming for myself, I'm starting small. 😂

First, I'm starting with therapy/counseling consultations and seeing if someone might be a fit for me. Never done this before. So that's cool/scary.

Today I finally realised that I’m very alone . I had a girlfriend whom I broke up (for certain) 2 weeks ago and after that I realised I have no friends .I thought I had friends , but after I broke up from my girlfriend I realised all of them were my childhood friends and they actually all moved on in their own lives . 

After a few phone calls and text messages I can honestly say I have like 3 friends maximum , AND they aren’t people I can hang out with at all , they have their own life so I can’t really hang out with them often even if I wanted to  . So we can say that I actually have no friends . 

I’m not very social , so it is quite unlikely that I can find a new girlfriend by myself . I don’t have a group that I can hang out with . I actually NEVER have thought I’d end up like this . I’m 22 with no friends , sitting at home in a Saturday night . 

I have no idea how to socialise. I made all my friends from school back in the day and now I honestly don’t know how to make new friends . And I’m not looking for an online friend , it caused me a lot of sadness and I don’t think I can do that again .

Basically the title. My(23F) dad was an alcoholic my whole childhood and I have some pretty crappy memories of regular emotional/verbal because of it. My partner(23M) of 6 years is a very casual drinker but whenever he does drink I feel uncomfortable and angry with him, even though he has never even so much as called me a name once. He doesn't know the extent of my childhood, but he knows my dad drank a lot and I hated it. I know my feelings aren't valid at all. I don't want to ask him not to drink because I don't want to try and control him.

455,"Here I go.

We dated for 3 years. Lived together for 2. We always had ups and downs, arguments. Toxic behaviour from my part, and her part. Last august my dad and brother passed away in a car crash and I lost my mom 3 weeks later due to an illness. It was a horrible time and I certainly did not give her the attention she deserved. Anyway, after an argument I told her I wanted to live separatly again and she left on a work trip to Spain. We skyped everyday, I apologzed, when she came back she told me she had slept with someone else, did not know who he was etc and she needed a break. I was devastated but let her stay in my appartment till she found a new place, which I payed her rent for for the first 3 months.

During that time she told me she wanted to have sex with other people, that I should forget about her, I bought flowers, paid her dinner, nothing worked. I started to be on Tinder and started talking to a girl, when my ex found out she went crazy, she was saying I was 'emotionally cheating', she went through my phone etc, I went to see her when she was ill but still went on a date with the girl. Nothing happend.

She asked me to get together again but I told her we needed time, she took this bad. Sometimes texting me to come over, for her B-day etc, sometimes scolding me etc. She made me drive her to the hospital a few times when she broke her hand, and then she would talk about her hook-ups, how she was seeing someone etc. It was hurtfull.

A week later she went back to Spain, texted me she missed me, and when I texted back she missed me too she told me:

'I don't deserve you, why can't you hate me???', 'Should I give you reasons to hate me?'

Afterwards she explained how much she had been hooking up with other men and that she has a crush on the Spanish guy, that they are back in touch cause he 'contacted' her. That she's afraid for his safety, for her safety, that I am 'going to beat them up.' Before, I texted a friend of her to ask her what really happend with the cheating since she knew and my ex always told me she didn't know the guy, it meant nothing, etc'. She also told me her and him are not going to work out. And that I deserved to be cheated on.

Ever since she has been telling people how scared she is for her safety, how I am agressive towards her etc. It's not true, I never did hurt her physically o r called er names verbally...I was often annoyed yes, but she was the one that hit me once. She is telling everyone I am abusive.

She is blocked on everything but I cannot get over these accusations? How should I handle it?",27Apr2019,1

My bf and I had sex (no pull out) the day before I ran out, and the next day, when I was supposed to take my first pill of the pack. Went on vacation that same day and basically missed the first 3 days of the new pack. While I was on vacation I got some bad cramps as if I was gonna get my period or some withdrawal bleeding but I never did. Normally I would get withdrawal bleeding if I missed more than 2 pills in a row so I’m surprised I didn’t get any. As soon as I got back home I started back on my birth control.

Well normally on birth control your supposed to get your period during the placebo week, but for the past 4 months, I always get my period within the first 3 days of the second week of my pill pack. Not sure why, I’m thinking it’s because I switched to a new bc 4 months ago 🤷🏽‍♀️

Anyway, I was supposed to start my period 2 days ago but still nothing. For the past 2 days I’ve been getting horrible cramps as if I was gonna start my period but I haven’t had cramps this bad since before I got on birth control over a year ago. But still no period.

He was really making me happy, and I did get the “butterflies” in my stomach. 

Then we had a little meet up and he dame round my house, all of my friends told me to be really careful in case he would try something as they kept calling him an fboy. But actually he was a really sweet guy, he did not try to do anything and we were just chilling and playing around; we hugged a few times and had a great laugh. But for a few days after that, he kind of stopped talking, like we were talking but only because I started the conversations.

Last time we submitted a draft, which one of my group members wrote most of the final text for, it came back as 34% plagiarized on Turnitin. I had no idea at the time that we submitted it, but it turns out he just kinda changed up sections of entire sentences from our sources (which he did cite), pasted them into the draft and thought it was no big deal. Teacher was a little concerned, but since it was a draft he just said ""try better next time"". I was appalled, to be honest. I don't want it happening again.

We have to submit a more finalized draft of the project soon. This time, the guy who wrote the plagiarized draft hasn't touched it yet, but the text still looks very suspicious. There are lots of grammatical mistakes, like sentences were mashed together very poorly. 

What do I do? I tried basic online plagiarism softwares, they haven't picked up anything, but I am still super suspicious.

What can I do to figure out if there's real plagiarism going on before we submit it to turnitin? Turnitin doesn't let us submit numerous documents in tandem, so even if I fixed it before the deadline, I might not be able to submit the better paper on time, if that makes sense.

Nearly all of her classes are either AP/honors, she is in two sports, and she is greatly involved in our school's ASU (student leadership). Clearly she's committed to school and is willing to take on a full plate. However, she gets mostly B's and C's and is notorious for procrastinating. Maybe around 2 months ago, Anne stopped showing up at school and practice. Ever since then, Anne goes to school maybe once a week.

472,"Hi Reddit, I am a guy who recently broke off a relationship with my so-called 'girlfriend'. I put that in quotation marks because I doubt the idea of us even having a relationship in the first place.

We never dated. She asked me to be her 'boyfriend' around mid-January (?) and I naively accepted. I thought she was nice, but oh boy was I wrong. Namely, she somehow got the idea that if she started pissing off all my friends, it would be some kind of 'inside joke' or comedic thing. I have absolutely no idea where she got that from. When I saw her doing it, I would ask her what exactly she got out of it, and she would respond with an anxious chuckle and carry on. She never once in the relationship made any attempt to talk or at least BE together - and these were just a few of the factors that made my attraction to her go downhill REAL fast. 

A few days ago, I made the decision that the relationship was not worth continuing. I calmly told her that,  she didn't say anything and just walked away. Later I went past her Instagram story, and bloody hell. ""You're so pretty!"" ""Only some evil man could do such a thing."" ""I love you!"" ""I feel so sorry, who in the world could do this? I NEED TO KNOW"" where the types of responses she got on the story that she had IMMEDIATLEY posted after the events. It was a question sticker that was making me out to be some corrupt person, and it was blatantly fishing for sympathy. I all I wanted was for her to be calm and move on with her life, but from hearing about her previous relationships, I guess that's just something that she is physically and mentally incapable of doing.

Later, I was getting borderline threats from her friends about how I was going to hell, that they were going to cut my hair and destroy my stuff, and so on. I honestly have no idea why they were acting like they were. 

I just want some advice on what I should do or say to at least clean up a little. Anything would be appreciated.",27Apr2019,3
473," 

So, my story probably sounds generic as Hell but I really could use help and advice from somebody on what the fuck should I do. So for about 2 years already I know this girl and we are best friends. We talk every day, play games together, watch videos or movies sometimes, either by ourselves or with the rest of the group of our friends, all that online because she lives in the US while I live in the Middle East. We are getting along really good, she says I'm the person she trusts the most because she's not really open about her feelings and all that to other people, that I'm her first ever friend she trusts that much and can talk to about anything, she's quite shy and awkward, we are quite similar to the point that few of our friends used to make jokes along the lines ""Hey why aren't you two together if you are getting along so well"". But we always brushed them off because we weren't interested in each other in that way.

About a month ago she went through some rough stuff because another good friend of ours stopped talking to us as much and the guy she also met online and liked couldn't date her because of his religion. And I as usual helped her out, she cried on a call with me and I managed to cheer her up and all that and help her start working on what bothers her. And for some reason from that moment I started developing romantic feelings for her (Wanting to meet her, be with her all that stuff) and I am really hesitant about it because she said multiple times that she thinks of me as a brother, which I totally understand but obviously it still hurts. I know that even if I confess I'm just gonna ruin stuff or make things awkward because so much is against us being together, her feelings towards me as a brother, HUGE distance and the guy she's still not fully over. But at the same time keeping this all a secret just hurts so much and I just wanna confess even if it will ruin something.

I really don't know what to do. Just stop talking to her without any explanation to get over her? Confess and leave or just see what's gonna happen? Not confess at all and just try and power through it? I have no idea.

Mostly, I just feel lost.  On paper, I have a good life.  A cool job, no money problems, a great wife, great friends, a paid off house and cars, and get to go to cool music festivals and travel the world a lot.  But inside, I just feel like I have no idea what I am doing and am just faking it.  Now that I have a good life, I have no idea what to do with it.  

I have been searching for almost a year now and have no idea what my next goals should be or what any purpose I might have should be.  I've seen all of my favorite bands, have seen all of the places in the world I want to see, have had amazing fun with friends, all of that stuff.  I just don't know what's next.  I've spent a lot of time thinking of it and I just can't come up with a damn thing.

In my head, I am just a constant storm.  I am sad that it feels like all of my friends and family are moving on in life without me while I am seemingly sitting still. I feel so isolated and alone all the time, as if I am just a background character in everyone else's life that isn't really essential to anyone's story.  It just so often feels like if I didn't exist, it wouldn't make that much of a difference.  I am nobody, I have not contributed anything objectively noteworthy to anyone's life that changed it for the better.  Most of everyone I know is moving on to bigger or better things without me anyways.

I've tried a little of everything.  Volunteering, trying to find meaning in religion, tackling hobby projects, joining groups around town, everything.  I am just empty, alone, bored, sad, all of it.

With all of this in mind, I am starting to wonder if existing is even productive at all.  I'm just going to live a finite amount of time and then die anyways.  I've lived a great life to this point.  If I died in a plane wreck or was hit by a truck tomorrow, I'd be okay with it.  I had a good run and had a great time.  It would make more sense for the majority of my time here to have been spent on what I enjoyed rather than to be spent feeling sad and pointless like this.  I don't think I feel suicidal, but I am at peace with the prospect of any end that might come my way.

I still don't like feeling like this.  I'd like to continue to have a productive life and things to look forward to, I am just exhausted with putting forth so much effort into trying to figure out what that might be and coming up with nothing.

My family has told me that it's just like if I was going to school out of state. I'm not seeing this because at least with going out of state for school you have roommates and clubs. Meanwhile everyone I've talked to about community college says that making friends isn't as easy.

I've noticed that I have a problem with being alone. Its gotten so bad that when my friends were all hanging out and I couldn't go (travelling),  I had to go out and walk for a couple hours just to keep myself busy and clear my mind.

Overall, I'm scared that I'm gonna be all alone for the rest of my life. Is there anything I can do? Am I just overreacting?",27Apr2019,2
482," 

6 years ago my ex's friend and I caught feelings for each other (dick move, yes I know but my ex was told about this and we were trying to work through it). Nothing came of it since we went to college in different countries and I was still dating my ex. Me and my ex broke up a year later and I realized I still had feelings for this friend (we stayed in touch and met up whenever we came home) . I told him how I felt and he said he cared deeply for me but did not feel the same way.

We continued to stay friends and both of us dated others over the next 2-3 years. Once again I found my feelings for him popping up and I felt like I could not work through them unless I told him how I felt. Which I did, knowing full well he probably did not feel the same way. I also distanced myself from him for about 6 months - 1 year in which we both began serious relationships with other people. A little over a year ago we both broke up with our significant others (bad break ups both of them). And now we're back to being closer than ever, although we still do not live in the same country and have met up only a few times in the last 6 years.

Through the entirety of our friendship we have remained close even though we don't talk always. He always offers a shoulder to cry and vice versa. In terms of advice, supporting one another and being part of each others lives. Like we are always there if one of us needs the other.

I'm at a point where I'm realizing (for the 3rd time) that I have feelings for him, and perhaps below the surface I have always had feelings for him. I can't bring myself to dating other people because of my feelings for him which is weird because he's not my ex. I doubt he feels the same way and I don't understand why I'm still stuck in this rut. Even though I've loved other people in this time, whenever things are over, I always fall back in love with him (I barely think of my exes). I worry if I don't work through this, these feelings will crop up and ruin my future relationships.

Since I've had this realization it's become difficult to stay friends with him. I keep reading too much into things he says to me, and start overthinking things. Simultaneously feel like I'm betraying him by feeling this way and pretending to be his friend. I know, we're all human and we can't control how we feel but I feel like I should stay away from him and not pretend to be his friend at least.

TLDR; I'm finally coming to terms that I'm still in love with my close friend of 6+ years. I'm afraid to lose him as a friend if I tell him the truth, but continuously feel guilty for feeling this way because it feels like I'm lying. Can't move on and have feelings for other people. Advice?

Edit: in the case that he feels the same way. We still live in different countries so that would never work. Its like either way I lose out on him",27Apr2019,2
483,"So long story short, I'm a junior in high school (17M) and I've been on my school's swim team since my freshman year. I've had on and off crushes on this one girl who is one year older than me since freshman year. She's so beautiful and we get along great, but there's one problem, I'm 5'3 and shes 5'8. When i first originally met her I tried making a move subtly (as she said i was cute so i thought she was into me) but she said she could never date a guy shorter than her, and although it hurt, I respected that, as everyone has their own preferences. I would be a hypocrite if I criticized her for it, as I could never date a girl whose fat, etc. However, that doesn't stop me from falling head over heels for her every time the new season rolls around, and yesterday was the last day of the season, meaning I will probably never get to see her again as she graduates and goes off to college, and it hurts so bad. I don't even care about dating her anymore, I just crave being around this girl, her energy is infectious and her beauty is infatuating and my knees feel like jelly every time I think about her. Cheesy, I know, but I never really get much attention from girls (I've never even had a girlfriend...), but she makes me feel special and has always been so kind to me. The fact that I may never speak to her again makes me seriously depressed and I need advice to get over her, so any would be appreciated.",27Apr2019,1
484,"Not sure if I should put this on rlegaladvice or not, so I will start on here. 

I have 3 roommates. One of them stays out of sight and does his work. He’s an engineer so I totally understand. 

The two roommates that are of concern (call them “A” and “B”) used to be my friends, before I cut them off to a degree. “A” gets high and drunk al the time. He comes home almost daily piss drunk or high off his ass. Or a combination of both. 

“B”  is a bit more quiet, he doesn’t know how to control his emotions so he is just sad all the time. He’s not from the states so there is kind of a language barrier too. 

I will preface by saying I meditate a lot. I often do this in the shower room, with the door locked and the lights off. It’s the closest I can get to actual peace and quiet without leaving the dorms. 

Yesterday evening, I had just finished a great meditation session. A and B were out so it was nice and quiet except for the rustles from my third roommate who is quiet as a mouse. I had no plans, so I decided to take a nice long shower in the dark. It’s a really nice transition out of meditation for me. About half way through my shower, I had just washed the shampoo and my acne treatment off and I heard the room into the dorm open. I knew they were home, but what surprised me was that the SHOWER DOOR OPENED! I have no idea how he picked the lock but I heard ticking noises and then it just opened. The white florescent light comes on temporary blinding my eyes which had adapted to the dark.   A proceeds to rip the curtain away and starts grabbing at it to take it away from me. A is high as fuck. B meanwhile, was just standing in the doorway spectating and laughing at the ordeal. I rightfully told him to get out, by he refused to listen. I then aimed the shower head best I could at A because obviously my words were not helping. He backed off and then yelled curse words for another 5 minutes until he finally left. I came so close to calling campus security, but I was so frustrated I ended up getting dressed and leaving until I knew they were both asleep. 

I really don’t know what to do. I didn’t deserve that and there really was no reason for me to be treated like that.  I had a lot more respect for B but seeing him do absolutely nothing despite being sober was really telling.

487,"Im going to start this by saying I do not think marriage is necessary as “confirmation” or “validation” of a relationship. I see it as largely a financial decision and so does he. We are not religious, so we dont need that piece.

My bf (33M) and I (29F) have been together for five years and are really happy. We have lived together for about four years and I recently moved to an entirely new city in a bew state with him when his military job relocated him.

We have talked about marriage several times over the years and both eventually want to get married to each other, but he doesnt want to get married right now (as of 5 months ago) because he feels like he “isnt financially ready.” He wants to get married in 5+ years because he feels like he will be financially ready at that time. I have tried to be understanding of this and also dont want to be pushy on something so important, but I continue to struggle with the logic.

Our new city is very expensive. He makes good money, as do I, but the military would actually pay him more if we got married! So, financially, he would be in an actually better place then. We are also both very responsible with money but invest and save it differently - in ways that I think are very complementary. Im also better at handling bills and due dates. But he has so many deadlines and things of his own to keep track of (he owns an investment peoperty) that he struggles to keep track. I really think my help would come in handy there but I dont think it’s my place given he is only my bf. He also wants to buy a house for us to live in in this new city.  Im uncomfortable being on a shared mortgage without being married and he gets that. He also cant afford a house without my income adding in.

For me, I had to take a job I dislike in order to move here with him. Im ready to switch jobs, but having his income and health insurance for some financial security would be really helpful for me and would give me more freedom in my job hunt.

Here’s where I think marriage can really solve our problems. We would make more money as a couple if we got married due to military and he would benefit from me being able to help with deadlines, pay bills, etc because things would be easier to share and some of my money would become our shared money. i benefit from financial security as well as health insurance under him if I wind up in between jobs.

I really cant see a downside besides the obvious (divorce, etc) but we have been together long enough that I think marriage would only strengthen us because we can be a team in new ways. Ive considered domestic partnership but feel in our sitation it is kind of an excuse to further delay marriage...

Id love to lay out the facts like this but I really dont want to come off as pushy or make him feel like I am forcing him into something before he is ready. But I cant help feeling like for me, now is the right time. What do you guys think? How can I approach this and should I?",27Apr2019,0

510," 

I  am finally about to graduate. I went through a rough few years at  community college and got my associates degree. Now I am finishing up my  3rd year in about 2 weeks and will gain my BS. I will possibly be  moving to the opposite side of the country when I am done.

For  the last few months my parents would ask me if I would be graduating  and when the ceremony will be. I would tell them and my mother would go  back and forth with saying she will be there, wants to be be there, and  that it will be too hard to make it. I ask my father and he always would  say that he will come and he will find a way to do so. It's coming up  and I ask my father if they will be attending. He said it will be too  hard for them to come up here. The reasoning is due to a few factors. My  brother has CP among many mental disorders. My parents had also adopted  my niece and nephew who are 3 and 9. My parents are in their 60s. I  also attend college almost 400 miles away. I understand all of these  reasons. And I knew it would be always an issue because they never would  come see my performances. Those times it made me feel really upset and  insecure because everyone would be talking about their parents coming up  to watch them and see them at the end of each semester but I would just  leave each performance alone.  Graduation will be the same. I had  talked with my friend and they understand how it can be hard for them,  though they have known for months and should have made accommodations a  long time ago. At least one of them should come. Even one of my friend's  mom takes a bus here and its about the same distance.

512,"TLDR up front:  joined a friend to start a new consulting business, concerned that maybe I was lead to believe the opportunity was better than it actually is.  Would like advice on how to proceed, should I start job hunting?  Should I open any dialogue with my business partner.  Should I stick with it but look for specific things?

My background is working in insurance companies.  I recently left my individual contributor role (making about 130k plus bonus at a Fortune 500 company) to join a long time colleague and former manager of mine.  He was working at a consulting firm for a few years and was quite successful (good impression from various market contacts) but told me he was leaving to start his own firm and asked if I would join him.  Partner also mentioned while they couldn't guarantee a base salary, I would make about 35% of consulting fees.  Also they felt confident that with the deals we'd have in the first year, fees should be between $500,000 and $900,000.  Additionally, we'd have a whole year of marketing to grow the business from there in year two.  I was so optimistic I chose to forgo my year end bonus of about $18,000 with my prior company based on the urgency that there was imminent project work coming in the second quarter.

Since joining in February, the first project we booked decreased from $180k to $60k based on the scope the client actually purchased.  There's additional pieces they could sign on for as we keep going, but they may not.  Additionally, I learned that his first client that was expected to have about $400k in billing, so far they've only signed on for $100k and all of that work was excluded from my income because it happened before I joined the firm.  (although they have expressed interest in some additional smaller projects).  Finally, the largest potential project (which I thought there was no other finalist remaining for, but found out there's another firm in the mix) is still up in the air and they haven't selected anyone at this time.  

Since I joined we've had about three smaller projects on the radar, probably totaling between $100k and $150k in total, but still not signed.  Right now we've responded to two separate RFPs but one fell through and the other doesn't feel great.

Other concerns I have include:

* My partner is heavily engaged on building his other business, a brokerage for insurance benefits, and because they've already made $100,000 this year I feel he might not be hurting for short term money like I am, and am also concerned he's over extending himself and will prioritize longer term goals of that business.
* I was able to leverage my partner's contacts list to begin generating my own sales, but so far only about 30% of the people I've reached out to have had any interest in meeting with me.  I may have overestimated the importance of being a consultant in the market to build relationships over the long term, and these relationships will take me a few years to develop.  

So right now I have only ""earned"" $33,000, with no additional work in writing.  To date the company has paid me zero dollars, since I get paid after the client pays.  This doesn't feel great despite starting with $40,000 in savings to start for living expenses.  It probably doesn't help that I have been working 60+ hours a week to deliver on the initial project.  I also moved cities to start this role and again, left a job I did exceptionally well in last year because I really believed this opportunity was exceptional. (FOMO)

Reddit - was I foolishly optimistic, naive, and not detailed enough before making this jump?  I am worried my business partner is a terrific salesperson but so good they may have convinced me to make the wrong decision about my future.  Am I just facing the normal hardship and loss of faith on the business opportunities we have?  Is it too early (2.5 months) to consider leaving?

Side note: the company my partner left contacted me before they knew I was joining him, interested in hiring me.  I am 100% sure they would bring me on and they do pay a base salary, and still have a posting up.  We also all live in the same city, so there I would be an ideal hire.   This would undoubtedly destroy my friendship with my current business partner, but I wouldn't be stressed about money to put food on the table and could make over $200,000/year if I was successful.",27Apr2019,1

514,"Hi, so I am having some issues in my Photoshop class that I've enrolled in at community college. This is my third and final attempt taking the course in the state of CA and I have a 69%. 

Last day to drop was the 25th. 

I've never had an F in my life and I am honestly not that stressed about this (surprisingly). The course is unrelated to my major. I am simply struggling with the online format of the class and regret not taking it in person. It also doesn't help that it is a fast track 8 week course. 

I just want to know if this will effect my ability to transfer to a university. I can't retake the class because it is my final attempt. 

So in conclusion, will this effect my ability to transfer? Should I stay enrolled or just drop the course even though it is passed the drop date? I honestly just don't know what to do. 

Thanks for any help/suggestions.",27Apr2019,1

517,"Last week, our school held its annual prom and one of my friends went with all of his friends. Before prom, almost all of the couples or groups  take a lot of pictures, and my friend and his group decided to take pictures at our local botanical garden. After taking pictures, he and his friends destroyed a fence of bamboo and pulled out a Japanese maple and arranged the bamboo in a pentagon. I know this because he arrogantly bragged about it to me at school two days after prom. Yesterday while looking in the local newspaper in the police and fire section, a big box saying “Botanical garden vandalized” took most of the section up. It said that a $500 reward will be given leading to the arrest of the vandals. 
This particular friend isn’t really a good role model. He is a big weed/juul dealer at our school and he’s been caught 3 times. After each time getting caught he always said, “Don’t worry guys, I’ll change.” Every time he said that he was back to dealing in a few days.
I really want to turn him in to teach him a lesson and get a free $500, but I’m a minor and I’m not really comfortable dealing with the police, plus if my friend finds out I reported him, he will surely never forgive me.

519,"Hi, I suck at decision making and need some help deciding between 2 apartments.  

To preface, I am a 22YOF in grad school and I have a 50lb dog that specifically loves to play fetch (ie. needs space). 

Apartment 1: $850/m 1  bedroom (760 square feet)

* Located in a quiet part of my city, traffic is average, not terrible
* Comes with a private patio that has a little area my dog could relieve himself (very convenient for me)
* has a lake/trails on property, very beautiful area, but no dog park 
* all windows face out to the fenced in patio so my dog won't have anything to look at all day (not really sure if this is something I should worry about)
* living room is set up funky? Main wall is composed of a fireplace and a big sliding door, so not a good place to put a TV
* kitchen and bathroom a relatively small
* hardwood except bedroom

&amp;#x200B;

Apartment 2: $793/m 2 bedroom (888 square feet)

* worth noting the extra bedroom is really more of a small office space, which is actually fine for me
* no patio, and windows face right out to parking lot
* door opens out to a huge grassy area that is perfect for my dog's favorite activity 
* carpet :( 
* nice sized kitchen and bathroom, living room is really nicely laid out
* has a ""sunroom"" that is more like a little bay window area, but is cute nonetheless 
* does have a dog park 
* biggest concern: in a VERY high traffic location

&amp;#x200B;

Overall: I'm thinking apartment 2 is more convenient for my dog just based on size, play area, and things to look at outside.  Apartment 1 is more convenient for me in terms of it being hardwood, better traffic, and having a nice outside area.

526,"Now let me clarify, the state didn’t force me to take liberal arts as my major. It’s just my state has this stupid rule where if an undergrad surpasses 150 credit hours then the university has to start charging out of state tuition even if I’m a resident. Apparently financial aid doesn’t cover out of state tuition either. And before you say “well it’s your fault that you are exceeding 150 hours”, let me explain. I didn’t know what I wanted to do when I turned 18 and graduated high school. With the pressure of my family, I enrolled in college right after high school. The advisors at the community college didn’t specialize in any major and didn’t know how to direct their students so I ended up taking a bunch of courses I didn’t need. (Not even for basics). I ended up majoring in music education when I went to a 4-year university. Even after years and years of clarinet, I failed ear training and piano several times. Apparently I just wasn’t cut out for it. So I changed my major to education. Things were going fine until I was going to talk to the education advisor to sign up for fall classes and she tells me that if I continue on the education track, I’m going to exceed 150 hours. I exhausted all my resources to see if I could keep going as an education major and I just can’t afford it. My parents aren’t paying for anything and I work 30 hours a week. So I scrambled to find and research other majors that would take all the credits I have and apply to them to a degree that wouldn’t exceed 150 hours. The only degree I found was a liberal arts degree in general studies. With this major, you have to pick 3 minors. I chose music, psychology, and human services. I’ve heard so much that this degree is useless, but at this point I’m thinking that this degree is better than no degree. I’m about to be 24 and I’ve been going to school non stop. I was just wondering if any of you have a liberal arts degree and what kind of jobs you guys have. Any and all advice is accepted. Thank you!",27Apr2019,1

535,"A little background: we met at university because we lived in the same halls, we got along pretty well, which is why we ended up moving in together for the second year too, but now we live apart. I need advice on what to do with our relationship because all she seems to do is let me down and she’s really inconsistent. Here's some of the things she's done:

~ Lets me down lots of times. The formula goes like this: she offers something (like a discount at the restaurant she works), and when you take her up on the offer, she says she can't do it. One time she told me that her dad gets a better exchange rate because he works at the airport, and when I asked her if he could exchange some money (for our holiday) for me she said he can't do it?? So why tell me in the first place? 

~ Sees me as a comity. Thinking back to when we first met, I found it was a little weird that she was so excited about having a friend who was South-East Asian, like “Yeah I went on a gap year across Asia and even have an Asian friend, I’m so cultured!” But being a fresher looking to make friends, I didn't care. 

~ Likes to reveal other people's personal info without their consent. Basically, back in my teen years I used to write Yaoi fanfics, and I told her I did so in confidence, but then she met this guy on Tinder and the first thing she told him about me was that I wrote gay fanfics. Which really made me uncomfortable since it was something I told her because I thought I could trust her. But it just seemed like she was using me to make herself seem more interesting. I told her not to do it anymore because I didn’t like it. 

~ Bitter about my relationship(?) I've recently learnt that she doesn't like my boyfriend, but I'm not really surprised or bothered. Basically, my bf and I were long distance during the time we lived together, and I would go to visit him whenever I can. But when he came to visit, she would be a little off with us. One time he surprised me with a visit after being apart for 3 weeks, and my friend kept asking him when he was leaving, even though he only stayed for 4 days.

~ Attention and companionship issues (relates to point below). She is really insecure about her looks, she won’t leave the house without makeup, at all. Having guys around who are attracted to her really helps it, but she tends to spend all her time with whoever she’s seeing at the time, which is a little annoying when I (and other friends) want to do things with her and she's gets so invested with the guy and puts her friends in the backseat.

~ Asks for advice and doesn't take it. She likes to ask me for advice and completely go against what I say. Basically she went through a bad break up with an abusive guy, and I told her to take time to herself for self care. But she ended up getting a FWB within the next week. 

~ Disregards me because of our age difference (I'm 22 and she's 24) Many times where we were in a situation (like lost in a city) and I offer a solution, she gives a dismissive hum and looks it up on her phone, and turns out my solution was right. So at times, it's like she doesn’t take me seriously because she’s older, even though I just as much life skills as her. 

~ A mooch. One time we went out with some friends, and on our way there she said she doesn't like tequila. So when we got there I offered to buy tequila for myself and the other friends, then all of the sudden she popped out of nowhere and said she wanted one too, despite her earlier remarks. She basically takes anything if it's free. 

~ However, it’s not all negative. She's helped me become more accepting of my body and really helped boost my confidence. We’ve even travelled together to another country, so that was fun.  

Ironically, she also has a friend who always lets her down and disappoints her, and she knows how it feels, yet she does it herself. She’s leaving for Chile soon, so shall I just let this relationship fizzle out or just leave it as it is? I’m torn between not talking to her again and keeping in contact since we’ve been friends for so long but she is kind of a shitty person. 

TLDR; inconsistent friend, lets me down a lot, but helped with my confidence, she’s leaving the country soon, shall I stay in contact or let the relationship fizzle out?",27Apr2019,1
536,"TLDR: Mom jokes about my assault and blames me for not calling the police. Both don't handle my mental health issues well. I'm becoming like them and I want to know how to stop it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are generally nice people, but they've done some really shitty stuff to me. 

I can't get over how my mom reacted after my assault. She told my entire extended family, without even asking me or telling me that she had done it. She makes jokes about it like, ""Oh now you can say that you're part of the me too movement now"" which stings because she clearly knows that it was sexual abuse but she still thinks she can make a joke out of it. She pushed me back to the company that never punished the guy that did it. She never told me I could call the police, or that what happened to me was wrong. She blamed me for not calling the police earlier after they eventually did come because my therapist found out. 

She blames me for my mental health issues sometimes. I have OCD, social anxiety, and possibly bipolar disorder so I'm not allowed to be in my room by myself for very long before she gets mad at me. She's concerned about my mental health but continues to make it worse at the same time. 

My dad is better, but he's a (big) hypocrite and has screamed and swore at me while I was having a panic attack. He doesn't understand my mental health issues. 

My mom screams and slams things when she's mad, usually at very minor things like losing my school ID card. I have found myself doing these things too, and it scares me because I hate it when she does that and I don't want to become like her. I'm worried as time goes on I will only absorb more and more of their traits. 

I've tried to limit contact with them as much as possible. I try to hide in my room but I can't do that for very long before going crazy or my mom getting mad at me. I try to hang out with friends as much as possible but they are often busy with school work and extracurricular activities. I don't want to join a less school focused group to hang out with sometimes because of my high risk of becoming an alcoholic. I've joined track and cross country as well. But they don't seem to be stopping the inevitable, that I'm going to be like them.

539,"  A bit long.

My wife and I are renters. There is something that has been bugging me about the landlord and we want to see if we are wrong or right. While I understand the landlords right to enter the house with notice, as he usually does, there are times where it seems excessive and bothersome to me and my wife. First and foremost, there is a clause in the lease that he must come in to the house to inspect it every three months and he has done so without us objecting to it. I will point out several occasions during our time renting this place where it just feels out of place and outright invasive.

Recently he’s been wanting to replace the roof of the house and he’s had multiple laborers stop by to view the roof from outside of the house for a quote. There is also some water damage on the ceiling inside the garage. He texted me saying that he will come in the house on this day to get in to the garage. I responded to him by saying that door that leads to the garage will be accessible to him if he wanted to get in the garage ( pretty much nudging him to consider if he wanted to go to the garage go into the garage not into the house first) He ended up using the garage opener which he has to access the garage instead of going into the house.

The same evening, I ended up receiving a message from him informing me that he will need to get into the house to measure the kitchen floors since it has carpet and we previously talked about him replacing it with some tile or wood. He also mentioned to my wife that he needed to access the basement to take some photos using an excuse that he wanted to show his buddies from work something. I found this basement thing a bit questionable since he just got done inspecting the whole house a week before. He said he was going to be at the house at four the following day. On this day my wife and I decided to go to the library to study and were going to be back at the house at four to be there when the landlord got there. He called my wife at 3:30 saying that he’s here early and was going to go into the house. My wife informed him that we were not at the house but planned to be there at 4, she also mentioned to him to wait for us to get there before going in to measure because we wanted to talk a bit more about the floor. 

When we arrived, he was already in the house, he mentioned that he measured already and took the photos of the basement. When I came in I made a remark about him being there earlier than expected I said “wow, is it four o’clock already?” he said “ its almost four ok, don’t tell me I can’t go into my own house..”

After some more talking I mentioned to him that I’m not sure if he notices but we value our privacy very much and he previously mentioned that it would take about two to three weekends to get the floor done. I told him that we’d rather keep the carpet for the time instead of having someone at the house working these consecutive weekends. He was like “oh don’t worry it wont just be anybody in here working, it’ll just be me” and I responded with “yes exactly that’s what I’m trying to say.”  

There have been more situations like these but one that really stands out was the time when the gas company here mandated some work to move the gas meters from the basement to the outside of the house. He mentioned that laborers will be here at 11am and 3pm and for me to leave the screen door unlocked. I was at the house doing some lab reports and he decides to show up at ten to wait for the laborer in our kitchen. He made himself comfortable on the kitchen table while I was making my morning coffee and waited for the laborer to show. The 11 am appointment was very short, they just looked at the gas meter to report to the three o’clock guys coming in later. My landlord tells me “wow that was short, I guess I’ve got plenty of waiting to do until 3” he proceeds to have a seat on the kitchen table to wait for the other laborers to show from like 11:20am to 3 pm. This to me was a bit excessive and invasive, like I couldn’t even be myself in my house since I had an uninvited guest just hanging out in the kitchen.   

Another time we had a problem like this was when the garage door broke, and he had to get it replaced. He kept coming into the house and hanging out in the kitchen while there was a gentleman working in the garage. I had to leave to school for a few hours, I proceeded to lock the screen doors and the side door that leads into the house from the garage (even though he has a key to the house). When I came back, he was angry at me saying “why are you locking the doors?” I told him that my wife was in the house sleeping (since she worked night shift at the time) and didn’t want him walking in and out of the house, while my wife was alone sleeping in the house. Didn’t really get much of a response from him, but he felt as if he needed access to the house even though the work getting done was on the garage door.

When i went to school i wasnt known at all. I was rather seen as weird kid or not seen at all. And to be honest - i liked it. I had very low self esteem so i liked being alone. Sometimes i was jealous of popular kids. 
Things kinda changed at the end of middle school. I realised i really lack friendships or just basic human interactions. And it hurt me. I was like „I am so ugly, i am alone, i am loser”. 
High school was coming so i thought it would be cool to start over, make some change, generally glo up. To be honest, it didnt worked that well. I made some friends but they turned out to be terrible. 
Now im hurt by looking at these popular girls from my high school who hang out with everyone, even older girls. It makes me hate myself even more.

541,"I left a good job to join a friend and former colleague of mine build a consulting practice in the insurance industry.  There was no promise of a base salary but based on clients he had or was about to bring on, it seemed lucrative and a rare opportunity.  I moved cities, living off of savings for about 2-3 months now.  Spouse just got a new job here.  I like the city a lot.  I also gave up a year end bonus on the concept that I was needed quickly to start working on imminent work that was about to be signed.  


So far, we still only have 2 clients that were signed when I started and I am concerned the other 2 prospective clients we had may delay their work until 2020.  Also, the scope of the projects have signed is smaller than originally communicated drastically.  Also, since I started later than originally planned I missed out on money from an earlier project in January.  I am only on track to make about $30k so far, and I still haven't been paid a dime since we haven't been paid yet.  

&amp;#x200B;

I do think we still have a solid opportunity to sign a good amount of work still this year, but I am concerned that my partner ""sold"" me on the opportunity so that his firm could sign some of this work (adding another person to a 2-3 person firm).  I have done some prospecting to bring in work but it is a slow start since I am still building a network of contacts and a brand.  Not to mention, our projects are typically all 5-6 figure deals which take time to close.  My partner is also working a lot on a second business, a brokerage firm related to our consulting work.  

His former company is hiring, and I know their leadership team.  They would probably hire me at a solid base plus great bonus (large firm in the business).  This could damage my current firm greatly and would probably destroy our friendship.

550,"    Im 16, turned 16 a few months ago actually. Before i give off the whole “my life is so horrible !!! I hate my parents!!” Vibe, i just need to point out that im aware that im literally asking for some validation here along with advice. I know how basic all of this is going to seem to anyone reading it- but man oh man i have no where else to turn to. 
    Im in a really tough spot. To give some backstory, my parents were both alcoholics until i turned 10. They would take me out to bars and make me sleep in between two chairs in a corner until like 4 am, so id miss school quite a lot. I was really lonely until like two years ago and was struggling with body issues because my father would often tell me hed disown me if i ever “got fat” so i ended up with an eating dissorder too, woohoo
     Recently, for the last year and a half, my father would physically harm my mother, drowned me and my sister with death threats, threatened us all with suicide and called us horrible names. My mother has considered divorce, but the issue is we live in turkey (my father is turkish) and not only would a divorce be extremely tricky, it would mean trying to gain custody of me and my sister so we could move to denmark (where my mother is from)  she she stays to avoid doing all that work. [[for all who may ask “why doesnt she just divorce him and stay in turkey?” Well, my father is an ass and has told us hed kill all of us and then himself if we do that]] 
    A few months ago he kicked us all out and disowned me. We stayed at a friend for a few days until he came and took us back home forcefully. He promised hed get better so again, my mom decided against the divorce.

  If im honest, im so tired. Ive spent my whole life trying to parent these two people who are supposed to look after me- while also trying to be an obedient child. Ive spent years trying to solve their issues and protect my sister. The thing that makes it so painful is that sometimes they’re genuinely so nice to us (most of the time if im honest) and it fills me with such guilt that i wish my father was dead even when he smothers us in gifts every now and then. My mom refuses to leave even after everything. Says its because of his mental disorders. I know thats true, but i dont know what to say to convince her to leave. And also, im terrified of talking about my father to anyone irl, because hes so good at masking this personality of his. Its a small city. Everyone knows him, everyone loves him. 
 
So i guess my three questions i really need advice on are;
1. People who have been in an abusive relationship and left, how can i make my mom open her eyes and leave my father ? Is there any way i could possibly convince her ????

2. Once im 18, whats the best way i can leave this household and move  (and possibly country, i really dont enjoy it here honestly...) 

3. How can i stop feeling such immense guilt for hating my father? Is it even justified? 
   
Also if there are any grammar mistakes in this post im really sorry, english is my third language so im not great at it",27Apr2019,1

The hardest part is that I don’t know how to make friends right now since nobody at work is my age and I personally have a plan to move out of the state to somewhere fun like Austin Texas in order to really feel like I am living.

553,"About a year ago my parents and brother moved to a new place. There they weren't able to take the dog with them because the building didn't allow pets. I told them I would hold on to the dog while they try to find a way of bringing the dog with them (appealing to get him approved).

Surprisingly they were able to get him approved but he still wasn't trained enough to go with them. Since then, about six months ago, my dad has been saying he is going to get the dog a trainer but has yet to do so and has yet to give me any date by which they will be taking the dog.

There is also a lot of disagreement between my mom and my dad over whether or not they even will be taking the dog. My dad does not want to give the dog to someone else because that's my little brother's companion and the dog is a part of the family to him. My mom, on the other hand, does not want the dog at all and does not want to take him because she knows the family has no time for him, on top of the fact that no one cleaned up after or took care of the dog when we all live together and had him.

I did not intend to have this dog for this long. I don't want him. I'm tired of coming home to barking, having to clean up piss and shit, and I am tired of spending money to take care of him.

He's a regular user and I certainly don't want to end up like him, but I don't want to drift away from my friends. If my parents found out they would kill me. I've also got exams starting next week and I don't need more stress. My Brother's also started blackmailing me, saying that he'll tell our parents if I don't do such and such. Does he not understand how much fucking stress I am under with my exams?

What should I do? Should I just give the drugs back? I don't know where else I could get them though and I don't want to drift away from my friends. But I can't deal with the stress right now. I'd love some advice.

556,"Hi, I feel really ashamed and don't know what to do :(

I've been working as a server at a restaurant for quite some time. It's at a chain restaurant (like Applebees, Chilis, something in that league). I lived with my boyfriend at the time, but he's the only person I know from my area. All of my friends/family live states away.

However, yesterday, due to abuse and a plethora of other reasons, I was abruptly kicked out of my boyfriends house and had absolutely nowhere to go and not enough money to get my own place. I won't go into the detail because it's not necessary. But because of this, I took the next bus I could to my parents house, who are states and states away. I have no way of continuing employment, and I had no time to tell them that I would have to be resigning before my first shift began today (all of this happened last night).

I thought about calling them today, but I've been way too ashamed to do so. I know the second I talk to one of them and tell them what happened, or even try to tell them vaguely I had to leave without notice (even if I choose not to give detail), I know I'm going to burst into tears out of embarrassment and shame. I know I don't have to go into detail, but even the idea of telling them I had to quit, with me knowing why I had to do it in my head, really really really makes me feel bad. I loved my job and I think my managers loved me. I'm such a teacher's pet, goody two shoes, be nice to everyone type of person. I feel like leaving without notice was really mean of me and I feel horrible.

I plan on returning to school and getting my degree after what happened (my boyfriend made me drop out of school in the first place), so I'm not looking to serve again (which means I wouldn't need to use them as a reference), but I still feel really bad. I'm so ashamed to talk about it with my employer though :(

any advice on what I should do? Is it appropriate for me to call them after I haven't shown up for work??? I know they probably already have a bad taste in their mouths about me, so that makes the idea of talking to them even harder.

I feel like a mess. I am not in the headspace to really talk to anyone right now, but by the time I feel better, it'll be really weird to talk to them (like if I called and talked to them a week from now). Any opinions would be helpful.",27Apr2019,1

(this got longer than I thought. If you read all of it, thank you)

&amp;#x200B;

A little info: I work part time for the public transportation system in my city. My work consists of helping travelers use the trams and buses when there are events or construction going on which affects the regular routes of the bus- and tramlines. I stand at a stop assigned to me that is affected by the event/construction, and answer questions (or try to at least, sometimes I get questions completely unrelated to my job) or help people that look lost or uncertain. I get to meet a lot of people doing this job; some really nice, some really mean, and everything in between. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, last week I was at work, in my work uniform, when a group of three girls approached my stop. I noticed that one of the girls was wearing what i can best describe as a tight top with a V-neck basically, all the way down to her bellybutton, meaning that you could see half of her breasts (she was clearly not wearing a bra). She was wearing a denim jacket over that and tight jeans and boots. It's not something I would have worn myself, but I have a completely different body type compared with her. I admit I looked, her outfit was very nice and she looked amazing, and then i went back to my work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the three girls were standing in circle talking to each other and after a quick question about their destination it was obvious they didn't need my help. So I went back to roaming around the stop, smiling at travelers when making eye-contact and asking people who looked lost or confused if they needed help. There weren't many travelers around at that specific time so I was basically asking every person I saw if they needed/wanted help. Suddenly a guy shows up. I immediatley notice him, observe him for a second or two, and notice that he is staring intently at something and shuffeling back and forth. My first thought was that he maybe he was reading the sign about the changes made to the tram and needed help. I look in the direction of his stare, and no. that's not it. He's standing relatively close to the group of girls and, honestly, leering at the girl with the lowcut shirt. Seriosuly, the reason he was shuffeling back and forth was because the girls were also moving and I imagine the movement made one of her friends ""block the view"", he was trying to get a better view!

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I wish I could say I confronted him and told him to stop staring, but I didn't and I'm ashamed. One reason for why I didn't take action is because I was in uniform and didn't want to cause a scene because what I wanted to do was yell at him for being a pervert and drawing attention which surely would have put him to shame, but would have also drawn attention to the girls. It would also have drawn attention to myself and this is something I struggle with. I'm not good at confrontations. Especially with confrontations where I'm angry, and I was so angry at this pervert. I'm one of this people who cry easily when angry, and I didn't want that. this was also the first time I had encountered this kind of situation. Fortunately, or not, depends on how you see it, the tram arrived soon and the girls got on. The guy left. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my question is, what could I have done? How could I have best handled the situation? If you had been the girl would you have wanted help? Would you have wanted to know? Like I said, I have no experience with this specific kind of situation where a third party is involved, but I also don't want to not do anything if it ever happens again. I'm really ashamed of my lack of action this time.

558,"I’ve recently moved into a new house with my mom and sister. and it’s just a small little town house. and I mean it’s a nice house. but anyways, a few months before I moved in, a man died directly across the street from me. and his body was there for months. as well, there’s a lady who’s into witchcraft. I live in a circle neighbourhood. Besides that, a few days after moving in. I’d get a super bad feeling in my bedroom. idk why, but I felt a very bad presence in there. and still do. Lights used to flicker as well, in my kitchen, and the heater would go up and down on its own. On high and low temperatures. sometimes stuff knocks over on its own. Or I hear bangs. Recently I’ve been seeing things in the corner of my eye when I’m home alone. no I’m not paranoid). it will be at the most random times. like today, I was home alone. and I just felt like someone was watching me. or I wasn’t alone in the house. then I heard a bang from my bedroom downstairs. I went to go check it out, nothing was there. so I went to take a piss. And walked passed my room and saw a human figure, plain as day. It was day time, my curtains were closed. And it was tall, and black. Like a hooded figure. I went and looked back, and nothing was there. so i went on with my day. I went upstairs to my kitchen and grabbed some cake, it’s my moms birthday today). and I sat down and watched some YouTube and ate some cake. And I saw the hooded almost figure in the corner of my eye again. I looked and nothing was there.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a little confused about my current situation with this girl I recently met and would appreciate some advice. I recently met this girl in college through tinder. We exchange numbers and snapchats and it has been going well. We texted a lot and became best friends on snapchat. We recently have hung out a fair amount during finals week, 3 days straight to be exact and I think every time it went well because she was very interested to see me again. The last time we hung out she gave me her bracelet and told me to give it back to her next semester because she is going home and I won't see her much at all this summer.  I thought it was cute and gave me less worry about the situation but I am not great with this stuff. I am sure there are times she is going to lose interest at some point and not text me so much, like today she hasn't talked to me and hasn't opened my snaps. She snaps a TON so this isn't unusual for her but I just don't like it because it gives me anxiety. I really like this girl but I don't know how to go about it because our relationship exploded very quickly, in about 1 week and now is physically separated by distance. I am wondering about how should I feel about this and how should I go about this without giving me anxiety or overthinking things. I am currently doing that now wondering why she hasn't snap me.

569,"I will start with some technical details, but you can just skip to the **SUMMARY** if you don't want to read too much.

So, almost a year ago I purchased a Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus 64GB Global version from a local GSM store.  
About two weeks ago I started noticing a yellowish stain on the left side of the screen and being hopeful that it'd go away with a little time I didn't do anything about it.   
After a few days not only did that spot become larger but also two other stains appeared which seem to be of similar origin.   
Upon lurking around on the internet I found out that most possibly it's from undried glue under the screen which - theoretically - could be fixed with it being left out on the sun (due to UV lights interacting with the adhesive under the LCD panel) but I personally had no luck with that fix.  


On the store's website it says that it could take from 4 to 6 weeks to be fixed, - which is a problem by itself - but I'm also worried that the replacement screen will have the same issue, which will be after my warranty expires.

So, all summed up: I received  a product that was not assembled correctly, and if I attempt to send it into their repair workshop I'll lose my phone for weeks. I will also risk having this problem happening again, making it a hassle  to maintain and have the resell value of my phone decrease considerably.

Our friends didn't seemed bothered at first but as soon as people found out he started acting very differently with me. He went through a phase of getting angry at everything I did - for example, if I couldn't come over because I was studying or seeing friends, he would suddenly talk very blunt and and become passive aggressive, or just straight up not talking to me.

So, I'm just wondering how to deal with this? It might be just that we're such good friends and I don't want to lose that, so I've become super attached to him??

But also, I'm sure he just thinks of me as 'one of the guys', but he said the other day he's ""my biggest flag flyer"", and idk, we talk on Snapchat quite a lot, and, ugh, when he says something funny, he looks over at me and does this smile while looking into my eyes, and he said he loved my laugh..

Am I looking too much into this?

I don't want to think my life has been a lie, I came out to everyone, I don't want to come out AGAIN as 'in favour of the D'.

Any advice would be super appreciated 💕",27Apr2019,56
581,"I (21F) guess I should start by admitting that I don’t like her. We are in the same major and I’ve had consistent top/above average grades for most my degree (literature). Apparently she has taken it to mean I’m great at creative writing as well (which I’m not).  (This is relevant I promise) 

Also, for a long time now she asks me my grades for every exam/assignment we have. And doesn’t really acknowledge me outside of theses interactions. Basically she’d walk up to me, ask me how much I got and then leaves, no hello or what’s up.  I’m a private person, and I really don’t like this. Last few months, she has started demanded explanations about why I keep to myself (again, I’m a really private person, with social anxiety) and why I don’t help people with studies (because I’m good at studies and therefore I should). I’m really angry writing this post and I’m trying to tone it down but it really pisses me off. She actually texted me a day before a deadline asking me to give her a thesis statement for a research paper...like no I’m going to do that. 

So, getting to what happened. She sent me a document out of nowhere, telling me to give her feedback on her work. And that I should send her some of my work. I’m not interested in sharing my work (I’m not even writing these days.) and I’m definitely not interested in looking at her work. How do I let her down easy, or should I just be abrupt? Is it even worth it? And is there a way I could be rid of her? 
 
Another reason why I’m so pissed, is because in her text she says “ [dude] says you’re a really good writer, so show me some of your work”. And this [dude] is someone I have shared my writing with and a person I was kind of friends with but NC now. Also, in the writing she sent me, there’s a chapter on how good this guy is. These days this dude has a sexual harassment case against him, made by a good friend of mine. Now this girl is totally aware of all this, still hangs out with the guy, and has the audacity to send me this. So, please, reddit, how the fuck do I deal with this?

So the following week she started have light bleeding likely from the pill. The time I’m worried about was the second time we had sex which was Friday 4/26 in which the condom broke again (yes i know, i was probably putting it on too tight). I didn’t actually ejaculate in her but I had cum before and cleaned off my penis. We didn’t get a pill this time, I’m pretty worried cause she has pretty fertile heritage.

585,"People always talk about a light at the end of the tunnel. After years of instability and hardships, I can finally see it. In four months, I'll be leaving for a university in a different state to pursue what I've always been passionate about: zoology. 

In a lot of ways, it's a massive relief. However, powering through this last chunk is becoming increasingly difficult. I'll add a little bit of background. Saddle up, it's a bit long.

I just turned 18, but my mom pretty much put me to my own devices when I was about 14. At 14, I already had 5 different prescriptions and 2 inpatient stays under my belt. I was quite a mess. My depression and anxiety were proving to be pretty severe, and I ended up developing an eating disorder as well. Between 8th and 12th grade, I experienced 3 emotionally/sexually abusive relationships (2 were not official relationships, but men significantly older than me using me). I also identified as a trans boy during this period of time (I don't anymore). I mistook body dysmorphia for gender dysphoria, and it was an absolutely horrendous experience. I currently live in a tiny southern town, and I felt, and still sometimes feel, like I'm less than human. I have no idea how it feels to properly fit in with either gender, or how to be a woman. This isn't a jab at trans people, my heart goes out to people who have to endure what I endured, and worse. It just fucking sucked.

On top of all of this, my mom is an extremely self-centered/emotionally manipulative person. She can do no wrong, and exhibits terrible behavior but blames it on me. She craves approval and attention from others, and lies to gain it or make me look like a monster. My step-dad is young and cares only for his wellbeing, and /sometimes/ my mom's. He has described me as nothing more than an annoying teenager seeking attention, and only speaks to me when he wants to reprimand me. His version of discipline is screaming, putting dirty dishes or cat litter in my bed, etc. My therapists have talked to them. They've put on a good act. It has caused a massive amount of anger to build up in me. I've tried everything. Every analysis of my own character. I've tried so hard to improve myself. Nothing is ever acceptable.

My mom sometimes brags about me to her coworkers, as if she's such a caring parent, but then turns around lies about me to get sympathy. I am so angry with them, it feels like one day I'll explode. Anytime I talk to her she rolls her eyes and gets upset that I'm bothering her. Every. Single. Time. I could sit here and describe everything shitty about my mom and my step-dad, but it'd take a while. 

The positive side of this is that I am very close to my grandparents. They have even agreed to help me financially with college. I am so grateful for them. They live in another state, but I'm glad I have them. It's just so lonely here, and everyday is a battle to get through. I'm starting to get relapse-esque thoughts. All of this money business, driving, being an adult... It's all crashing down on me. I don't know how to do much, but I do have some experience with jobs. It's terrifying. Nobody tells me it's going to be alright anymore. Nobody tells me I'm doing a good job. I can't call my grandparents too much or my mom claims I'm ""talking about her."" I have a wonderful boyfriend, but I don't want to dump my baggage onto him every 6 seconds. He reassures me, but the constant negativity from my parents makes it hard to accept. I'm very social, but I have no friends besides him, since high school was a trainwreck. 

I'm right there. It's so close. But, I have no idea how to be an adult. I have no idea what to do with myself. I have so many appointments to get to. I need to go to work. I need to learn how to manage my money. It's all building up. I'm so overwhelmed. It's just 4 months, but I don't know how to live through it. The stress. I just want it to end. I'm convinced I'm going to fail. The anxiety is becoming a constant 15/10. I feel stupid for thinking I was improving.",27Apr2019,1

We talked on the phone this morning and she said that she wrote the note today.
She promised not to do anything today but couldnt promise tomorrow.
She has told her therapist about this months ago about these thoughts. Her therapist asked how she would do it. She said pills. So she went home and got rid of them. Not sure if she still has anymore. But she does have a gun.

Ive been doing quite a bit of research. But i still dont know what to do.
She doesnt want to go the psych ward bc she says she needs to work. And honestly looking at everything, it doesnt seem like a great experience. 

I convinced her to contact her psychiatrist and therapist. She stated to them that she was having an extremely hard day but she didnt want to say suicidal bc she didnt want to leave a paper trail. But im happy she at least reached out to someone that knows more than i do.

I tell her how much she means to me and that im here for help and going to be w her every step of the way. 

We live in different states and i want to visit her. She says no. But i still dont know what to do.
Im nit sure if forcing myself on her and going anyway is the right thing to do. Bc im pretty sure i wouldn't like it.

She said she has been to groups w the same situation.  And that she liked it. Buts its not like those groups are happening everyday, all the time you know?

Im desperate for advice.
I just dont know if forcing myself on her is the right thing to do.

I did contemplate leaving him, and tried to get back in contact with a few friends, but none of them wanted to know so I just sort of sucked it up, someone's better than no one I guess.   
There are a lot of red flags with him, but it's not been one sided as my contraceptive pill turned me into a monster, I'm off that now and hoping that we could maybe have a fresh start but honestly I'm not sure. We've been together for almost two and a half years and he hasnt told me he loves me.

592,"Hello,

Recently, i’ve been in a strange situation. I have a group of friends (7 people) that have simmilar hobbies and interests. I love being with them but there is a slight problem.

There’s one person who always drops me by my dance school when he’s going to his music school. He’s going to the same direction and there are no busses that drive me to the school so I am kind of stuck with him. 

There’s also another girl that’s always negative about things and I don’t like her personality at all. She’s easy to manipulate, has no opinion about anything and does nothing but act that her world is the worst place, she can’t do anything but she doesn’t even try to and always gives up. So yeah, a very negative person.

They both are very negative people and I want to become way more positive about everything, but if I don’t stay friends with them, I will always be late at my dance school. Main reason is that when they are together, they always make fun of me constantly and act like 5th graders. (Not saying that I don’t criticize them, but I think friends should be able to accept criticism, but they are making fun in the most annoying way, like 5th graders) Also, being in a group of friends with some not being your friend would be very awkward. I mean, when they are apart from each other, It’s fun being with them and when they are in that group of people, that annoying girl almost never talks, so it’s fun then, but annoying thing is that I am in the same class with them and I have to see them every single day, when I am in a great and a bad mood so it’s very tiring.

What should I do in your opinion? Should I just not be with them? I really want to become a more positive person so I really need your help.

Thanks.

P.S. Sorry for mistakes, since I am from Finland.",27Apr2019,2
593,"So I want to sing ""Don't Stop Me Now"" by Queen for graduation, the problem is that it very briefly mentions sex and ecstasy.

I visited my mom during the years I lived with my grandma. Every time I visited her she treated me like shit and always compared my two older brother to me and always bragging. When my grandma died, my mom finally told me I could live with her. She always treated differently from my brothers, she set up such extreme rules for me to follow and I still follow them. The first years were rough mostly verbal and emotional abuse. It has more recently calmed down but when I talk about my future career's and ambitions she gets hostile and yells at me , telling me things like ""OH SO NOW YOU WANT OUT YOU SHIT"" ""I'VE WORKED MY ASS OFF FOR YOU AND NOW YOUR GOING TO LEAVE ME ALL ALONE"". She still verbally abuses me and when I cry she just insults me. I feel so trapped and I don't know what to do. I don't want to tell police or teachers. I don't want to go to Foster care it's scary to me. We do have some good times it's just, it hurts me. I am afraid to turn into her in the future, I can just feel the anger and suppressed emotions from all these years ready to snap.
To add: she is prejudice and she doesn't let me have certain friends of the opposite race, I am not allowed to date,I must have an A grade average, I am limited on my phone, I am not allowed to talk to ""strangers"" online or play any online video games (even though I still do and those people are the only friends I have, I am bullied at school casually and I find the ""online realm"" as a release) she doesn't let me have friends over or let me go outside even just to walk, I can't have ""gay"" friends, and lastly I am not allowed to move out of state she wants me to stay by her.
It hurts me, at first she didn't want me and now she does, I'm so confused, OH btw those rules don't apply to my 3 other brothers. 
I don't know if she is doing this to ""protect"" me. My mom has been divorced a few times, me and my brothers all have different dad's all of them are assholes, including mine.
She is always preaching about how "" ALL MEN ARE NASTY AND PERVERTED"" ""ALL MEN WILL DO IS USE YOU FOR SEX"" but idk

Now my immediate response to this is that it's a scam.

However after sending that email I began thinking about it and analyzing the email. There were no links to click on to inject PC viruses. It didn't ask for super personal info like social security number or bank info. I looked up the guy and he's an actual guy. There's very few mild poor grammar and punctuation marks, largely just connecting words like ""and"" or ""the"". Was I too hasty, safe, and cynical about this? The only issue I still haven't found a possible reason for is how this came from my original application, which was to a construction company for a desk position. Maybe this guy owns the company? Maybe he's an investor? Maybe they referred me to him? I have no idea.

I am a father of two beautiful children and married to an amazing woman who is going to school full time to get a career as a teacher

I missed the birth of my first born due to a military deployment and when my second was born I could only spend a few hours before I had to return to work as a police officer at the time.

I left the police force to be able to spend more time with my family and started another career. Over the last few years I have maintained a full time job while attending school at night full time. 

Over the years both of my children have required medical attention and we've had several vehicle issues but we maintained. 

Then last year my son had a medical event that requires daily breathing treatments. The combination of past medical debt, vehicle problems and continued treatment has racked us up a fair amount of debt. 

We pay almost $1,000 a month in debt alone and it's crushing. To make the bills I have to feed a family of 4 off of $100 a week, which is quite difficult with young ones, and still receive hospital bills for other trips. I can't even afford to get my daughter a soccer ball right now.

This month we are running short and won't be able to pay a fair bit of our bills let alone our debt. 

I feel like I'm being crushed, drowning and hopeless. It feels like not matter how much I pay it is never enough. 

All of our debt is medical related and if I could get rid of it i make more than enough to comfortably support my family. 

What do I do!?",27Apr2019,1
616,"This is my first post on Reddit. I always thought I'd just be a lurker but here I am. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have always had a seemingly close relationship with my mother but for the past year I have been really working on myself and digging deep into my traumas and pain and attempting to heal so that I can be a better person all around especially for my daughter. My mother raised four daughters on her own after leaving our father because of his addiction and abuse issues. I'm grateful for it and I respect her for doing what she had to do. My issue is that for most of my childhood, I never felt stable or properly cared for. I can't remember being hugged often and when others hurt me, I never felt like she tried to protect me mostly due to her fear of confrontation. 

We were evicted from every apartment, sometimes because of the rent and other times because of the condition of the home and have been homeless too many times. One of our homes (the worst) was a roach infested apartment, which was an issue when we moved in, but, only worsened due to the lack of cleanliness. There would be mounds of clothes that I would have to climb over to get to my mother's bed and the floors were so dirty, I'd have black dirt caked on the bottoms of my feet. I have horrible memories of being made fun of because of my smell and dirty clothes. When I'd spend time at my best friend's house, she would ask her mother if we could take a bath because I smelled. I knew the way we lived wasn't right because I'd see other people's homes that were kept clean. As I got older (middle and high school) I did my best to clean but with limited knowledge and hoards of things that weren't mine, I was afraid to throw anything away that didn't belong to me. There are a million other things I could go on about but these are my biggest issues and I'd like to keep this as short as possible. Anyway, I learned how to keep myself clean and healthy and now as an adult, I am consciously teaching my daughter all that I wasn't taught. Now that I am making an effort to heal from my past, things are coming up that I know are hindering me. My mother still isn't good about her personal hygiene and keeping the home clean. She is a very sensitive person and I always feel like bringing something up is being disrespectful but I also have limits and I've reached them. I love her and she's a good grandmother to my daughter but I also don't want to continue suppressing my thoughts and feelings just to keep her's from getting hurt. 

How do I approach the pain of my childhood and my issues with my mother without causing a huge rift between us?",27Apr2019,2
617,"Me  \[18F\] and my best friend \[19M\] have known each other and been best friends since 6th grade. We're senior in high school right now so it practically feels like we've grown up together. My parents consider him as family and his parents feel the same way about me. Throughout the years our friend group has changed a lot but we've always stuck by each other.  

Right before we started high school I met my now ex-boyfriend. Conveniently he attended the high school we were going to.(He's two years older than me). We got pretty close pretty fast but my best friend (and most of my close friends for that matter) never really liked him that much and always told me I could do better. Naturally being as infatuated as I was I didn't listen to any of them. We get in a huge fight and end up breaking up for a while before eventually getting back together. This time my best friend felt even more strongly about us not being together. In the back of my mind I always knew he was right and didn't blame him for not approving of him, but what really bothered me is that most of the time he would say things that were mostly offensive to me instead of my ex-boyfriend to get his point across. I won't get into the details of it, but he ended up making this elaborate plan to break us up. I was tired of it and broke up with the guy eventually. This caused a bit of tension in our friendship, but not for too long.

Things were fine for a while, but last summer I had a lot of time to do some introspection and I realized I didn't really like some aspects of who I was as a person and I really wanted to change that. I wanted to become a kinder and more positive person and really made an effort to make that happen. Since then all of my closest friends have pointed out that they see a huge difference in me for the better and that I also seem much happier. My second goal was to become more motivated and work harder on my goals. So being a senior this year I started studying harder and started a robotics project which takes up a lot of my time. It was around this time (in September) that I started noticing that my best friend would have such an ugly attitude towards me. It got to the point were 1 out of 2 sentences he'd say to me was some rude passive aggressive remark. I ignored it for 3 months but I knew we both knew something was wrong in our friendship. This went on until New Year's when we were both drunk and he was actually the first one to bring it up. We got sentimental about it and were almost crying about how bad we felt we'd let ourselves almost lose our friendship and agreed we'd talk about it again when we were sober.

After New Year's we got together to discuss what had been going on. Now I do need to say that the reason I didn't bring it up earlier with him is that being the person he is, I assumed he'd get really defensive, would try to put it on me and not admit any of the blame. To my surprise, he was actually much more mature about it than I would have expected. Long story short, I thought we sorted it out and  we were ok for a couple of months.

Now, however, even though the situation is not how it used to be there are so many things that bother me. The first thing being that he is the biggest bully I know. He has such a superiority complex which I think is him trying to hide his insecurities and he does it by trying to make everyone else feel like shit. He does this especially with the people he's closest to, including me. Whenever I mention something about my achievements he gets low key angry, tries to passive aggressively suggest that they're not as impressive and diverts the conversation back to himself. He gets absolutely furious if anyone tries to tell him he's doing anything wrong. One time for example, a friend of ours tried to help him light his cigarette because there was a lot of wind, and he got so angry and made a whole scene in the middle of the cafe about it because our friend ""shouldn't try to teach him how to do something"". It was absolutely crazy. Another time we got in a debate about the definition of a something and we literally looked it up in the dictionary and showed it to him and again, he made a whole scene, telling us we weren't reading it right (wtf???) and again, just went totally nuts over it. Also, this goes back to him being a bully, but all the time he'll just make rude remarks about us, his closest friends about anything he can think of to make himself feel better.

It's not like this all the time, when we have fun we have a lot of fun together. But I really just feel like shit for being best friends with a someone who I don't even fundamentally really like as a person. Part of me thinks I should just suck it up for a few months, because in September he's going to Germany to study abroad and maybe we'll just naturally start to drift apart. What do you think I should do?",27Apr2019,1
618,"Okay so...I don't really know how to word this.

&amp;#x200B;

I logged into my dads Facebook (for different reasons) and saw that he's been talking with this woman who I've never heard of before and we don't have any mutual friends. If we had some friends in common, she could easily just be a family friend or something.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to look through their conversations (a shitty thing to do, I know) and they send fucking huge paragraphs to each other. Calling each other babe and honey and they end each message with ""xoxoxo"" and kiss or heart emojis.

My dad lives with us (me, my mum and siblings). Also might be worth noting that me and my siblings are all adults. He's told this woman a few times that ""if she kicks me out again, I'll be straight down there"". My mum doesn't kick my dad out. They rarely have bad arguments. I don't know what the fuck he's talking about.

627,"Hi all, thanks for reading if you choose to do so.

Lately I have just been feeling like a screw up. I have been really blessed in life and have had great opportunities, but I feel that I have been squandering all that. I am a bio major, but I have lost all passion for the subject and I now plan on going to law school. I originally wanted to go to med school and lost my drive to get in. Now I am stuck in these higher level (jr-sr) science courses and they are bringing my gpa down. I used to consistently be above a 3.5 and I'm down to a 3.3. I know that this is my fault and I keep making dumb mistakes that bring my gpa down. Missed assignments and test scores that are lower than they should be. I am really worried about being able to get into the law school that I want to go too.

Honestly, I am really worried about everything on a day to day basis. My anxiety decided to pop into high gear and its been kicking my ass. I am fairly ADD and I usually take adderall to help deal with that. Well, I have had to stop because its been a huge part of my anxiety. Now, my ADD is messing with me more than usual. It has been a battle to get assignments done and get acceptable grades. My motivation has taken a huge hit and I just feel really dumb to be honest. A lot of my friends succeed in school really easily or have super impressive abilities to grind. (Quick side note: I am happy for my friends and I really hope they all do well because they are the best). Being around them does make me feel ashamed of my grades and level of success so far. Part of it is my pettiness, but it still kills me at times.

I am getting this feeling of dread as well. I just look at the future and worry that I will not be successful or able to provide enough for my future family. I have a really serious girlfriend and she comes from a well off, successful family. She will love me no matter how much I makes, but I want to live up to or exceed the standards that she sets for me. I want to feel good about myself and my accomplishments too. Lately, I have not been acting motivated or diligently enough to reach my goals. I need to makes changes but it has been hard. Somedays, I just want to call my parents and all the people that have supported me along the way to tell them sorry for being such a god damn mess.

I really want to get back to a high academic level and get motivated again. I want to feel good about myself.

632,"So I'm just your average everyday 14 year old. Or that's who I was before everything went completely wrong. To start off, I'm a teleiophile, the opposite of a pedophile being that I'm sexually attracted to adults. One of my 21 year old friends and I ended up liking each other after a while of knowing each other, and at some point this month we took things to another level, which you can probably guess what happened. Just last week, I was on my spring break and so I decided to spend that week with my 21 year old friend along with the rest of the friend group (stayed at his house all week) and we ended up taking things a bit too far, in which I was going to stay silent about it, but I couldn't help myself but talk since that's just who I am. I have difficulties keeping what's going through my mind in my head and end up saying it.

And so on Friday night, we were chilling at one of our friend's houses playing Cards Against Humanity and all that (she invited us over for a bonfire at first, in which about 8 people showed up including us). By 3AM, everyone else already left besides obviously, the host, and another guy. My 21 year old friend had already gone home by this time and I wanted to stay the night at the host's house due to lack of social interaction the entire week, and so my friend left without me. The entire night, the one friend who stayed and I were just talking about our pasts to the point it was already 6AM when we checked the time, and I felt like I could trust him and so I told him what was going on between me and my 21 year old friend. Although I wish I didn't, because everything went wrong from there.

He felt the need to tell his girlfriend because she was also my 21 year old friend's sister, and he wanted to let her know of what was happening, and so he had me go to his house around 7AM, and we spoke to her about everything, in which when she got the news she freaked out in which resulted in me sobbing my eyes out and regretting saying a word more than anything. Right before she left the house to go to her brother's house to speak to him, their aunt, and their uncle, I begged her to spare my friend, and she promised me that much, but couldn't guarantee that her aunt wouldn't do anything about it.

And when she came back, her aunt came along and the minute I somewhat calmed down from my hour-long panic attack, everyone was surrounding me and ordering me to press charges on my friend, and I had another total panic attack on the spot. But I didn't want to because I love my friend more than anyone, and he was the last person I wanted to hurt. But of course it was too late to turn back at that point. They sent me to the hospital for a pregnancy test, and the police spoke to me about everything during my stay. By 4PM, my friend was arrested and in custody, and a no-contact order was placed instantly, and I never even got to say a single word to him since he left on Friday night.

The verdict is supposed to be decided on May 1st and for the time being, he's staying at one of our friend's houses, although I can't communicate with him through third-party either, and he's not going to have that much freedom (being outside of prison) once he goes to court on the 1st (he signed a $500 bond to get out for a bit). Losing him has caused me more devastation than anything, and now he's seen to the world as a sex offender, and I'm completely heartbroken and unable to recover from everything that's happened.

638,"I’m an undergrad student at my state university, I’m a senior but need to take two classes this summer and then I’ll graduate (not that it’s important really but I know normal graduation happens during Spring semester, but I’m graduating early, not late).

For my major, I need to take 3 out of 9 available core classes, I’ve taken and passed 2 already. This semester I took the final one class I needed and haven’t been doing great. The teacher is an old tenured asshole. He’s condescending and pedantic and his class isn’t what it’s supposed to be (his course material is only loosely related to the course description, he basically only teaches what he wants and his area of study  and ties it back weakly to what the class should be). He’s rude to students and doesn’t articulate his expectations at all. I can rant for days about how awful a professor he is.

The class is set up with two projects, a midterm, and a final. Each exam is 30% and each project is 20%. Everyone got a 100 on the first project. The midterm I got a 61% on. I realized I need to step it up for the final and I studied hard and walked out feeling great. I got my grade back today and it was a 54% which included 5 points extra credit. I don’t think I’ll pass. I can if he gives out all 100% on the second presentation, but I don’t know if that will happen or not. Even then, he is technologically inept. His syllabus doesn’t explain the breakdown of the grades, I had to ask him for those percentages in class, so they aren’t in writing. He doesn’t understand the online service Canvas, the way the grades are weighted in Canvas aren’t how he told the whole class, and I’m afraid he doesn’t realize and will not weight them properly. If that happens, even a 100% on project 2 will still mean I fail. And because I don’t have these numbers in writing, there’s nothing I can do except hope other students will back me up that that’s what he said. 

I know people will say to fill the requirement this summer, but there is only 1 class that would fulfill it, and it’s full. Not just one course with multiple class times, but just one class. I can try to appeal to the professor and see if they can manually put me in, but who knows if that will work. 

I feel like if I don’t pass my world is just fucked. I don’t even care about my GPA bc that isn’t the biggest problem. It’s not just a normal situation of “oh don’t let one failure bring you down, it isn’t the end of the world” because it feels like the end of the world. If I don’t pass, it looks awful on my transcript because I failed a core class in my major, that’s pretty big. I’ve spent months job searching and all that goes down te frail because I won’t be able to start until December, because I’ll likely have to stay in the fall. I wasn’t planning on staying here after graduation so I don’t have an apparement and I cannot renew my lease, it’s too late. Not to mention all the pressure that’ll come from my family. I’m on a full ride scholarship, i luckily won’t lose it, but I will have to pay back the cost of the class. My dad pays for my rent and groceries and textbooks. Knowing my dad, he’ll make me pay it, which I can’t really afford because I quit my job this semester because the pressures of school and having multiple internships was too much to also work part time.

640,"Hey there,

&amp;#x200B;

So 4-5 months ago I applied for a scholarship from my former elementary school.  I got the letter today that I was chosen to receive it, and there was a check attached written out to me (not a crazy amount, but still in the triple digits).  However, I decided to go into the military a while ago, and my tech training and schooling will be paid for, so I'm conflicted as to whether or not I should deposit the check. I am definitely leaning towards a hard no, but I was wondering if anybody has an opinion on this.  Thanks in advance.",27Apr2019,3
642,"It's fine when people get to know me, because it's pretty obvious after a while whether someone knows their shit or is full of shit, but when it comes to new people, I find that it's hard to get people to take me seriously. 

I used to just roll with it, but I've realized that first impressions make a difference and I don't want to be passed over for a job I'm well qualified for because I don't ""seem"" smart. 

For some background, I'm a small, relatively young female. Social skills are *not* my strength and some people (including my mom and my psychiatrist) think that I have Aspergers, but my friends think there's no way. I'm really good at math, and will be trying to enter a quantitative field. I see that people do a bit of ""flexing"" with regards to their skills sometimes, but it comes off as being in bad taste and as bragging, so I normally try to avoid it. Yet time and time again, I see these people go far in their professional career. 

How do I show people that I, too, am smart, but how do I do it without being an asshole? 

I will say that when I'm talking to someone who straight up shares my interests or is in my field of study, they are very impressed with me. It's when I talk with generic ""business-people"" types who aren't in my area of study that I seem to fall flat. I guess it's because I can't think of anything to talk about? Again, small talk is not my strength, nor is talking to people I don't know. I mean, for some, saying that I ""like math"" is good enough for them to label me as smart, but I'll be honest-- I think that a number of people see ""woman"" or ""not great social skills"" and equate it to ""must be incompetent.""",27Apr2019,3

646,"Basically I’m an 18 year old male from the United States, soon to graduate high school. I’m not a nerd but I’m not a jockey.

It’s been eating me up inside for years now, and it gets progressively worse.

So this summer, I’ll be studying abroad in Sweden for six weeks. My father has told me that he’ll be sending a box of condoms with me (my family is generally against pre-marital sex), but he didn’t give any implications as to whether he is against me having sex while there.

What I’m getting at is I (feel as if) I need to have sex while in Sweden. I can’t take it anymore, every (excuse my language) fucking person has had sex. And I’ve not even dated yet. I need. To. Have. Sex. In. Sweden. I have no more hope for this.

649,"I’ll just call it what it is, I’m insecure as shit. I’m insecure when it comes to myself and my relationship. I only recently started dating (I’ve dated three guys in my entire life). The last two BOTH cheated on me, which I am 100% certain. I didn’t snoop through either one of their phones because believe it or not I absolutely HATE when people do that. It’s an invasion of privacy and if you don’t think the person is telling you the truth, you need to just ask them about it straight on. 

I’m married now, we’ve been dating for a while and only been married for a few months. We’re also expecting. 

Our relationship started online. 100% online. We loved 1,000 miles away from each other. We would call every night and video chat. 

He told me he loved me pretty early on. Before we had even met in person. I definitely developed strong feelings for him as well, we were definitely in love. Or so I thought. 

To give you a time frame, (without adding years because I don’t want to be too specific) we started officially dating in May. Literally the start of May. He told me he loved me towards the end of that same month. Quick, I know. He accidentally blurted it out while we were playing video games and he was completely embarrassed because it was super fast. But after that, he kept saying it. 

I didn’t say it back until maybe half a month later. 

He went home to Cali in July for the Fourth of July. I didn’t see him for the first time until October. On his phone, his Instagram DMs, he messaged a few girls about wanting  to see them while he was there. As in... /see/ them. They were unbelievably flirty and if you were the girl getting those messages you would definitely think “Damn this guy really wants to hook up with me.”
Whether he actually slept with anybody or not, I do not care. The fact that he TRIED is what’s pissing me off and upsetting me. 

I noticed the three girls he tried with, he unfollowed them and hadn’t been in contact since. All his exes he’s blocked, he doesn’t talk to anyone suspicious. I’m confident that he isn’t currently cheating on me. Please don’t comment saying that he is now. 

I was so upset that I told him I looked through his phone. I started with how it was wrong of me to do that because he trusted me with it. But then I told him what I found. He said that it wasn’t what I thought it was (original, I know) and that he was being flirty but not like that. He pretty said they were friends. I asked him if they were just friends, why did he unfollow them? He said they were posting annoying things. 

Obviously, I know he’s lying. It’s so hard to look at him in the face right now. I feel sick to my stomach. I don’t know what to do. I figured if I told you him that I pretty much caught him in the lie, he’d tell me the truth. 

I’ve asked him about three other times before if he EVER slept with or kissed somebody while we were together before we saw each other and every time he’s denied it. He’s still denying it. 

I don’t know WHAT the truth is. I’m a big believer in leaving an asshole who cheats on you, but now he’s my /husband/ and I’m 19 weeks pregnant with his child. I don’t truly know if he cheated on me, but I am pretty damn sure he tried. I cannot support myself due to financial issues, I definitely couldn’t support a child without him either.

I suffer from avoidant personality disorder which makes it hard to go outside, let alone to a job or school.

I decide to change this and I'm now volunteering at an animal shelter and the people are super nice, but I have really bad panic attacks and I might come off as weird or unfriendly. On top of this I find one of the girls who work there cute and I get super anxious whenever I see her. I tried talking to her and I just couldn't bring myself to do it. It feels wrong because she's in a higher position than me and from what I read from the internet is to not interact coworkers you find attractive. This is my first ""job"" so I don't know the what's common knowledge. My coworkers are extremely nice to me and I feel defensive about it. When I was in school bullies would usually act kind towards me and when I opened up they made fun of me. Because of that I am cautious towards strangers who approach me in any sort of friendly manner. I know not many people go through this kind of thing but I'm trying to better myself and be happy.

However whenever I come home from my weekend job, I often can't get up from the couch because my hips hurt so bad. If I do get up, it feels like I'm The Little Mermaid (original Hans Christen Andersen-style) -- there's a fiery pain shooting through my legs with every step and I have to waddle to my destination or crawl up the stairs. And the pain even makes it difficult to sleep because it's hard to flip over to get comfortable -- the pain is that intense. 

I just saw a doctor (or just medical professional -- she might have been an NP) yesterday and she recommended a few things, like physical therapy and muscle relaxers, the latter which I picked up from the pharmacist. But my schedule is such that I don't know if I can really attend that therapy unless I want to quit school and not have time for anything else, such as my (main) job. So I'm looking for other alternatives. (I get it, I might have to put school on hold for a while, but that would be my last desire.)

In the meantime, what are some other jobs I could try that would be less taxing on my body? I've already researched a bit, but haven't found anything great. Weekend-only jobs are hard to come by, and whatever job I find has to have a certain degree of flexibility and decent pay for me to grab it. My current job, while it comes with harsh treatment by the management and body pain, has a good enough schedule that I've kept it for two years. It's a retail job.

657,"Foreword: I've been reluctant to ask for advice because on one hand I don't really know what he is going through, and it would be foolish of me to assume I knew what lead him to this point. On the other hand, I believe your true friends are able to tell you the stuff you don't want to hear, for the sake of making you better. After teetering between the two I thought it was finally time to get some answers from a bunch of strangers on the internet. I'll try to keep this brief.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a freshmen in college majoring in CS, I went to a public HS that honestly didn't prepare me as well as I thought for college. My friend who we'll call X went to a really good prep-school and has essentially taken all the classes we did first trimester(we're on a trimester system). So it was relatively a breeze for him. But despite this he still has some pretty bad inter demons. He has mental health issues, the worst of these being Misaphonia(this is extremely important later). Misaphonia is a rare psychological disorder that causes distress from sounds like chewing, typing, sniffling etc... Exposure therapy has no effect on remedying the situation. I also believe his Misaphonia is particularly bad as well. So first trimester as I said it was essentially a breeze, and he would show up to I'd say around 70% of his classes maybe more. Everything for him, I on the other hand was struggling pretty significantly and learned a lot about how to get my work done in college. Throughout first trimester, I also believe he began to drink and smoke a lot more than usual because his parents were pretty strict. Fast-forward to second trimester, and he has a spike in his anxiety levels and stopped going to class at around the third week. When I say stopped I don't mean like he took a break for like a week, I mean I never saw X in class besides the midterm and the final. This anxiety spike, I surmise, was from X trying to get with a girl he was obsessing with combined with his Misaphonia. Now my other friends who are also friends with X all share the same concern for this as I do. He finished that trimester only taking two classes, and barely passed them. Now we're close to the half way point of the third quarter, and it's like deja vu. He's stopped showing up to class, and he's in a very difficult major. His high school knowledge seems to have reached its limit, and he's showing no signs of improvement Last trimester I had the same CS course that he had, and If he's not willing to put in a significant amount of work, he probably won't pass. The courses only get harder from there. I'm afraid he won't pass and have to drop out.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I can do or say to him. It's hard to tell someone who's suffering from a mental illness to pick themselves up off the dirt and keep walking, but that's what I'd want someone to tell me. If I can't say this what should I do. Should i just let it happen?  Should I voice my concerns more honestly? Any sufferers of misaphonia with any advice?",27Apr2019,1

I gave him money to attempt to fix his car but that didn't go well so I gave him an additional 2k to help him fund a new vehicle. Turns out the car he bought had a faulty engine and he needed to either replace it or fix his old bike or buy a new vehicle. This was 2 months or so ago. He decided to try and fix his bike and was able to with some support from me. He was supposed to come up to visit me. I took the whole week off. We had planned it for 2 months. He tells me 2 days B4 that he can't due to money and he doesn't want to ask me for money due to pride and refuses to come up even tho I said I'd pay for it all bc I really missed him. After a long argument I decide to just let it go. 3 days later (I wanna say this past Tuesday, he gets run off the road bike totaled and needs more financial support from me.

So since i recognize her and knew she would show up, I started to set them aside incase she showed up i could ring her up faster and mantain the line empty.

Well she notice that and eventually we started like hey how are you? And ""Im,Back!"". I personally never think anything more about her interaction with me, Another customer and that's it.

Well i told my coworker about her, like she will order the mint pod and i put it aside for just in case she showed up. 

Well my coworker attended her and said oh you must be the girl that orders the pod. (Santiago_j) told me about you he set this aside in case you came.

My coworker texted me and say dude! She was so happy when i told her about you!. She was smiling and say it's like you guys connected!.

Long story short from one day a week she showed up 3 times in the week each time mycoworker attended her and they chatted.

3 or 4 days ago she came and asked my coworker, Did i miss him? And my coworker told her oh no he's arround here, want me to call him? She say yes! I just want to say hi! So i went she was with her family on a restaurant and was dress very cute i most say. 

Went there and her face got a huge smile and she was hi!.  Any way since that interaction my coworker been like i think she likes you! 

I dont even know her name, yes shes very gorgeous but i dont want to think oh she likes me! And then maybe shes just friendly like that.

I'm a freshman at a large state college. I've grown up in this state and always had wanted to go to college at this school. Senior year I started wanting to go OOS a bit, but I had always imagined myself at this school and wanted to make my dream come true. 

I believe a huge part of making friends and connections in college is joining clubs and organizations. I always knew exactly what clubs I wanted to be a part of and kind of painted a perfect picture of myself that I was sure I would become. Unfortunately, after trying to join 7 of these clubs I had always wanted to be a part of, I actually got into none of them. Some of these are cultural, ethnic ones, some are professional frats, etc. I'm heartbroken and I'm having a lot of trouble making friends without having a community I'm really part of. And for those of you wondering, I'm pretty shocked I got into none of them. My older brother went to the same school and most people in the clubs know me through him. I'm a pretty social person, on ASB in high school, and I've always needed clubs to make me thrive and to pursue my passions in. I'm a super positive person, but after SEVEN rejections, my self confidence is totally failing. I do see other non competitive clubs I can join, I just really want to be a part of those and the others don't interest me. 

Another problem is the feeling I never really ""started fresh"" in college, I know a large amount of the people from high school, coming from the same area as so many of them. I can't just start over again and making friends is really tough.

Now i want an apology from S because she is an asshole and whatever and she refuses and she is being a bitch she said and i quote ""i was gonna say sorry but you didn't answer when i called you over that day so im not saying sorry anymore"" BUT IF YOU WERE GONNA SAY SORRY YOU KNOW YOU FUCKED UP.

668,"I got a speeding ticket for going 11 mph over in a 25 zone because it is ""aggressive driving enforcement month."" I have been considering fighting it (I'm very knowledgeable in law and raising doubt about the officer's ability to time my speed using the stopwatch device he used), but unfortunately, I think it's still an uphill climb to win the case. If I had only been going 9 over, I would fight it without question, because police in my state cannot give tickets for going less than 10 mph over...it's in the legal code.

I would love to bring it to court and question the officer and waste his time, but I just don't know if it would be worth it. I may just plead guilty.

However, I am strictly opposed to paying the corrupt local government in this manner. But if I don't pay, I guess they can arrest me.

I've seen those videos online of people paying tickets in all coins, which are pretty damn funny. I would really like to do that except I kind of feel bad because it's not the police that have to count that; it's the clerks at the court who had nothing to do with the ticket.

Does anyone have any ideas of petty ways to handle this, or ways to get back at the douche of an officer who ticketed me when I was going a completely reasonable, safe speed on a straight open road?",27Apr2019,1
669,I just saw a post on Instagram about how a cure for malaria will be given to thousands of African children and it does not make me happy but realistically I can’t help but think that this is only a negative thing in the long run because of the already unsustainable growth of the worlds population. The same thing with Japan’s population I know it’s not ideal their situation with the shrinking youth and their against population but I cannot help but think this is only a good thing when it comes down to it. I’m also privileged in the fact that those closest to me are not affected by this and I don’t want anyone to die and it’s definitely not a race thing or me thinking some people “deserve” it more than others it’s just the fact that our population is unsustainable as it is. Am I a horrible person for thinking like this about people’s lives?,27Apr2019,2

I want to approach it so I can get someone to try to support me or help in some way, instead of just acting as a medator for me to vent (to me, being a near useless method for coping).

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going  to as I was going holding the plates and  she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right while she looked at me as  I was wrapping cutlery on and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on  she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and  smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.",27Apr2019,0

673,"First! sorry fo my English, and sorry if it's long and boring. 

So! I live in my parents house, and lately my older sister ( 24yo. I think !)moved in our parents house for sometime she'll stay here for about 8 months or so, and she's that person who criticize you all the time and bring you down, I know all her behavior but lately I been feeling low and she was the last person in the earth I want to listen to, so I'm (20yo F drop out of college no job no friends no SO nothing and so suicidal) and my sweet sis remind me of how horrible my life is every fucking morning, and she use hurtful words, last thing she said ""even retarded ppl are better than you"" so I took the advice of cutting negative people from your life and I had a fight with her and told her to never interact with me again.

Now I bring my cat because I am so lonely and wanted some company, but my cat seems to like my sister and she only cuddle with her! Now you may think that I'm evil for sperate them, but my sister don't care for her she only likes to cuddle and kiss her, all my family like to cuddles with my cat, but no one really cares about her, few weeks ago I was feeling so depressed and had no energy to move out of my bed! I stayed in my room for 3 days, I thought it's a big family and they all love her, they will probably take care of her, in the third day that I got some energy and wanted to check out my cat! :( I found her milk become spoiled and all of her food! Nobody cleaned where she takes a shit! She was so thirsty too, I was so mad I fought with everyone! After that my cat always cuddles and sleeps with my sister so told my sister to never touch my cat again! She ignored me of course. I felt sad that my sister who's happily married and have friends and family who loves her couldn't just step out and leave a little kitten to love me! Even my family doesn't like me and she knows that.

So I decided to give away my cat! I just contacted someone who I believe will take a good care of her, but I feel so sad I can't stop crying because I don't want to lose my cat but she hates me and I can't stand seeing her cuddle with my sister! I'm her least favorite person in the house (I guess because shower.), when my sister went to her friend house my cat seems to be sad and depressed she kept and standing looking at the door waiting for her to come home, (I can't give my sister my cat my sister hurt me a lot I know that I am a loser but she went too far! She likes to embarrass me and tell everyone how loser i am. 

I really really really really don't wanna give away my cat! I thought about living the house but I can't afford to live on my own, I'm my body is little and fragile I can't be homeless, I don't know what to do, please any advice!?",27Apr2019,0
674,"I recently met a friend on a social networking app and she is in need of all sorts of help. I don’t know all of the details, but she is the main source of income for her family due to her single mom’s disabilities. All of the money she gets from minimum wage jobs goes to paying for her mom’s medical bills and the monthly bills. She also suffers from a heart lung condition where an artery of her heart is cut and is leaking into her lungs. However, she can’t afford surgery and she’s accepted that she will die at 21 if her situation doesn’t change. She also plans on enlisting into the military when she turns 16 next year in order to provide more income for her family although she hates the idea of joining the military. So, I was wondering if there were any low-bar requirements jobs that provided a good amount of money. She has said that she doesn’t care how unpleasant the job might be because anything would be better than the situation she is in right now.",27Apr2019,1
675,"A now ex friend of mine has wronged me so much. From refusing to be there for me through my depression and then making it act like I’m in the wrong for being sad, to getting angry at me for being friends with her boyfriend (who I’ve been friends with), to becoming bff’s with my recent ex boyfriend out of nowhere (which contributed to more shitty things and is a whole other story), to becoming friends with my other ex who abused me and she even witnessed the abuse first hand.


I tried apologizing (for what, I don’t fucking know, being a human being with emotions because that’s bad apparently) and reaching out but she snubbed me and also makes me out to be the bad guy. Now I want nothing to do with her. She disgusts me as a human being, I’ve seen her true colors and I see that she’s not a good person. She has made me hate myself more than I already do, I blame myself everyday for her hating me, even though my therapist told me it’s not my fault that she feels this way, and have convinced myself that I’m a bad person because she’s been treating me like I am. Because of this I have repeatedly relapsed into self harm and have suicidal thoughts. It’s ruining my life. 

I ignore her and let her live her life and I try to live mine but it seems like she’s always appearing to make me miserable. I’m not even sad anymore, I’m angry. I want her to  feel every bit of pain she made me feel, I want her to suffer like I did. And the fact that I feel that rage terrifies me. I’m not a vengeful person who would intentionally hurt someone, even if they wronged me.

How can I move on from her and the pain she’s caused me? I want to be free of this burden and free to live my life with my REAL friends who are kind, caring, loyal, and love me like I love them. I don’t want this anymore, it sucks. I feel like I can’t escape. I don’t get why someone who I loved so much and was supposed to love me would do this. I hate the anger, the sadness, the resentment. I don’t want to be her friend, but I don’t want to hate her. I want to feel nothing towards her so I can be free of this pain.",27Apr2019,1
676,"So basically I'm thinking of telling someone about all the abuse I've been put through over the years by my parents.  I want to be taken away from my parents but I'm scared of what will happen. The abuse is rarely physical so it's not like I can just show some scars or something to prove my case.

 My mother convinced doctors I had extreme learning difficulties as a kid so my teachers would spoon feed me all the answers to the questions or do most of my written work for me, at the time I thought this was great because I didn't have to do work but to this day I'm still trying to catch up with everything. I'm getting better but spelling is still kinda hard for me, so I google most words I'm trying to spell.  

When I was 12 my dad groped me while I was getting ready for school. I told my mum about it but she beat the shit out of me and called me, and I quote, ""FILTHY, LYING WHORE WHO'S TRYING TO BREAK THIS FAMILY"". Again, I was a 12 year old girl, this was my first sexual experience and I was just trying to get help for what my dad did to me but my mum still doesn't believe me when I tell her that it did happen.

Then when I was 14 ( just about to turn 15) I was almost raped by my cousin. I told my mum about it right after it happened and she believed me but didn't think I needed help. The man who tried to rape me was her nephew so she didn't want anything bad to happen to him, so she forced me to keep my mouth shut. Anytime I tried to ask to visit a counsellor she would yell at me and say if I wasn't flirting with him he wouldn't of done it. 1) I was barley 15 at the time and he was 18, 2) when he tried it I was asleep and 3) This wasn't the first time he did shit like this, he sexually harassed me for weeks before this, so your're full of shit when you say I was flirting with him. 

I'm at breaking point here, I truly believe I'm going to die if I stay in this house any longer.  

If anyone has any advice can you please PM me?",27Apr2019,1
677,"Idk where to begin here... 

My little sister tends to make huge messes everywhere, and she never cleans up after herself. This ranges from her clothes to leaving dishes and her pink lemonade cans everywhere in the basement where my room is. 

My mom automatically thinks that I’m the one being the slob, and she thinks that I need to clean up messes that aren’t mine. I’ve told her that my little sister wears WOMENS CLOTHING, and I’m a GUY. 

She doesn’t care, she makes me pick her crap up anyways. 

She tells me to clean up my lemonade cans, I tell I don’t drink lemonade, she still doesn’t care, she makes me clean them up anyways. 

So just recently my sister had a stupid girl’s night in the shed where they had a pizza/pop party. My sister made a tremendous mess, and my mom tried to get me to clean it up. 

She snaps and declares that I’m pig, I snap too, and I tell her that I’m not responsible for messes that aren’t mine. I tell her that my room and everything are clean. She’s not satisfied with that fact, and she storms off with a bad attitude. 

This has gone on for quite some time, I get so sick of having to clean messes that aren’t mine. Any advice would be useful, if I touch another pair of overused panties that have racing stripes on them, I’m going to snap even more.",27Apr2019,1

I had a friend share to a group of us a snippet of a song they put together. She was feeling down, so for the first time since she was 13  years of age, she wrote some lyrics instead of wallowing.

Here’s the song snippet:

[Song Snippet](https://youtu.be/daOVtgQ3fmc)

Some of the responses she received was that ""*song writing is a good way to process emotions, maybe even the best kind of therapy  since no one is pushing them for an answer.*""

""*Their voice is beautiful and turning pain into art and sharing it is the best kind of processing.*""

682,"My (29f) partner (29m) and I just moved from a huge, incredible city to a tiny nothing town about 15 hours away. We're not planning on staying forever, but certainly for a while. There were good reasons for it (namely affordability, the thing with huge incredible cities is that they're also stupid expensive, and it was getting to the point where staying was going to torpedo future financial stability) and boyfriend is trying to start a business with his brother who lives here, so it's absolutely something we're doing with the future in mind. I got a better job here and we have a nice place, but frankly, I hate it here. There were things I didn't love about the city, but the good far outweighed the bad in my opinion. I loved that there was never a shortage of things to do, and I loved feeling like even doing nothing was still doing something. The notorious unfriendliness of the city really suited me, I especially loved being totally anonymous, in 10 years of living there I never saw anyone I wasn't trying to see. Even though I was surrounded by people, I didn't feel like anyone was actually looking at me, and I loved it. And even though living there meant essentially living paycheck to paycheck probably forever, I was really happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

This place is peak small town. Everyone knows everyone, after two weeks I already am recognizing people everywhere I go. Its so different than what I'm used to! There are no self-checkouts at the grocery stores! There is one yoga studio and two gyms! There is exactly one good restaurant! Our neighbors are super-friendly (nosy), there are people I work with involved in every outside-of-work activity I have tried, and bf's family is relentlessly welcoming. I feel super watched and almost panicky and trapped constantly. We didn't bring my car for the move (the town is so small that having two cars insured felt very excessive for our say to day given that we did this to cut down on costs) but I deeply regret that and I feel so trapped without it. I could fly home to get it, but it would be a massive multi-day undertaking and it's just not realistic at this time. This is the first time in my life that I'm sharing a vehicle, and I knew it would be an adjustment but I didn't realize how fucking awful it would be. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're really into the outdoors and this place certainly has a lot to offer in that regard, but it's freezing cold here, it's rained almost every day, and I am just getting over a brutal cold (definitely made worse by stress) that has knocked me out for the last week.  I don't know anyone here except bf's brother and his girlfriend, who are both awesome people, but she is so aggressively friendly that I feel almost attacked - if it was up to her we'd probably have dinner there every night of the week. It's just a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

This wasn't my first big move, but it felt a lot different than my move to the city from the town I grew up in - then, I felt like I was moving to something better, so the little challenges were fun and exciting. This could not be more different. I do feel that it was the right decision in the big picture, but something can be both right and difficult, and that's what I'm dealing with. I know that in time I will probably adjust to this, but what can I do in the meantime? I'm so desperately unhappy and I just want to go home.",27Apr2019,1
683,"A year ago I got out of a 2 year relationship which ended quite badly. My mum is my best friend and I tell her everything about my life (minus the details, if you know what I mean). 

A few months ago I grew closer to one of my male friends and we started seeing each other, it’s hard for me because I don’t want a relationship as I am quite nervous about having something so serious again and think it’s important for me to stay single and have time to myself. 

Me and him get on so well and always end up drifting back to each other. I have stayed at his house 2 or 3 times after a night out and we have a great time together and my mother knows this.

One night, my best friend was at my house and I explained to her and my mum that I couldn’t find a ring I wanted to wear, they helped me look for it and I suddenly realised I had left it at my male friends house. My mum proceeded to say “oh well you shouldn’t have been there anyway” I laughed this off, and she continued to call me a “hoe”. (She said she was joking) This has been incredibly hurtful to me, mainly because she knows I am very private when it comes to that area of my life and I don’t jump into bed with any and everybody, up until this point I had only been physical with past boyfriends.

Knowing the bad relationship I’ve been in and the fact I don’t do this type of thing, her words have really affected me and have made me not want to tell her anything anymore, which leaves me feeling very alone. What do you think I should do? Am I overreacting?",27Apr2019,1
