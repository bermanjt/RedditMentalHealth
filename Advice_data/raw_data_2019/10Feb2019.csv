0,"Hello.

I went on holiday why my friend (Sara) and her boyfriend in Sweden, at her ski lodge.

He ski lodge only has 3 bedrooms.

My wife and I were in one room, and the my friend and her boyfriend were in another.

After a few days, Sara told me she had invited a friend and his girlfriend, and that her friend invited another couple. She then asked me if I could sleep in the living room...

Now, my wife was ill, recovering from a chest infection. Sara knew this. She knew my wife wanted a private room where she could go to rest. I asked Sara if one of the members of the couples could stay in the living room with me, but Sara said the issue was that they were couples, and it wasn't her ""hospitality"" to ask that of her guests....

We came up with the solution that my wife could stay in the same room as her bf, and that she would stay in the living room with me, since Sara's boyfriend really didn't want to stay in the living room. My wife really didn't like that, as she would feel uncomfortable in the room with Sara's husband, and she really wanted me with her.

So we eventually settle with my wife and I sleeping in the living room...

The night was awful. Everything was loud in the living room, and guests kept coming in and out of the living room. My husband and I got no sleep, and his condition worsened a lot. Moreover, his anxiety kicked in, partly due to his anger towards Sara...

The next day, Sara, after listening to how bad it was in the living room, said how terrible felt, and offered to stay in the living room with her bf. I told it doesn't matter who stays in the living room , they'll have a bad night too, and we'd feel really bad subjecting them to the living room...

So we stayed in Sara's room, all 4 of us. Sara snores like a dying horse all night long. 

Because of the terrible night and my husband's worse condition, we also had to cancel going to a fun ski resort, which we really wanted to go to.

Sara keeps saying it was unlucky my husband was ill. I think she fails to understand she shafted me and my husband, clearly prioritizing her other friends over us. 

So. Should I cut her out?

3,"so I (16f) live with my mum, her partner, and her partners son, 19m.

how do I know someone came into my room? well I have a seperate screen door that leads outside, as well as a regular wooden door that leads to the rest of the house. since the humidity has been between 80-100%, the regular wooden door has swollen and you have to slam it to get it closed. just before I went to bed the night before, I slammed it shut (because you can see through little cracks between the door and it's frame when it isn't closed properly, and I like my privacy. 

so, at like, 6am in the morning my cat was scratching at my screen door and meowing, and because I wanted to get back to sleep as soon as possible, so I went to my door to find it not closed properly (the way I had done the night before). so I fed him, and went back into my room. and went back to sleep and thought nothing of it. jump to about 8/9, mum tells me she's going out for a bit with her partner. 

I started to think, 
- the wind couldn't have opened my door because there is no direct wind flow that can pull/push at my door
- mum went to bed before me, and wasn't awake that early
- mum's partner has no reason to come into my room because he thinks it disgustingly dirty (he has a thing abt germs and I'm a dirty teenager) 

any advice on what it mightve been or what to do about it?",10Feb2019,1
4,"My roommate has been becoming increasingly paranoid over the past year. It started with suspicion over vans parked in front of our apartment (we live downtown and there are always vans parked on the street in front of our apartment). I'll spare the details, but the past three months things have been getting progressively worse to the point I am very worried. His girlfriend of over 6 years left him, his employer fired him, and now he thinks people are trying to kill him. Today he woke me up yelling that he figured it all out and all the evidence is on his USB drive and to find it if he ends up dead saying it will explain everything. He was on his laptop in the basement parking garage today so that the satellites couldn't hack his laptop. He has unplugged our internet, AppleTV, and basically all electronics that he thinks are listening to us. He thinks people in our apartment are spies and sometimes follows them to see where they go. He thinks big companies are collaborating against him and mocking him through the ads that get displayed to him. I could go on but I think that demonstrates my point. 

Any attempt for me to reason with him just builds resentment. He doesn't trust me and is questioning my loyalty for doubting his delusions. He just gets mad if I try to suggest therapy even when I tell him I need it too and I'll go with him. He is a heavy smoker, takes Adderall daily for the past decade, and smokes weed, all things that I know aren't helping and I fear could lead to schizophrenia (if he's not there already). He also had a rough childhood with abusive parents who kicked him out at 18. Everything I look up about paranoid personality disorder, Adderall psychosis, and schizophrenia fall perfectly in line with what I know about his back story and personality. 

He is a friend, I want to help. I don't want to walk away like others in his life. I just don't know what to do. The internet tells me not to deny his delusions which I've been trying not to do but he sees it in my face that I don't believe him and gets upset with me. He is a very smart guy and can rationalize just about anything to the point where he is never wrong and everybody around him 'just doesn't get it.'

I've thought about calling his doctor to get his Adderall cut off, but I know this would basically kill our friendship if he found out and he needs it to work and make income. I've also caught him stealing mine when he ran out which I removed from the apartment and take to work with me now. We barely scraped by on rent this month because people gave him money to help. I know next month we will most likely get evicted. I'm his only support where we live and I know he won't be able to afford a place to stay or even a plane ticket home. This is going to severely affect my life as I also cannot afford a place on my own and will likely be forced to quit my job. He insists that won't happen and just gets defensive and angry if I bring it up. 

Sorry I really needed to vent. It's just me and him living together in a city where we don't know many other people. I'm at a loss. I feel helpless. Is there anything I can do?",10Feb2019,1
6,"My bestie and I have been friends for eleven years, we do absolutely everything together and tell each other everything. I mean, EVERYTHING. So a year ago She had a very toxic relationship with this boy, let’s call him Matthew. When they first started dating, she wanted him and I to be friends so she introduced us. We hit it off immediately, and started talking literally 24/7. she knew we were really close, and she was happy about it. However, he started flirting with me and I set it down at first, but then I slowly started to flirt back. She would tell me all the time about horrible things he would do to her, forcing her to do things, controlling what she wore, being overly jealous. But he was never like that with me. But one time, we weren’t careful and she went through his Snapchat and saw me call him “so fucking attractive.” It all went down hill from there and me &amp; him got in a huge fight and stopped talking. I lied to her, and she believed it and broke up with him because I told her to. I was in love with him. To this day, there’s always a silent elephant in the room and I think deep down she knows I liked him. Me &amp; Matthew made a pact that we would date in three years when she wouldn’t be upset anymore. It’s been a year, and I’m still waiting. Am I a bad person?",10Feb2019,1
7,"How come some people get rejected over and over countless of times no matter how much they try to be a good person and no matter how hard they try to be positive while some others can just point at someone in order to gain a best friend or lover? The worst thing is when you, someone who is rejected starts to love and care about the kind of person who gets whoever they want. I’m so scared that I’m not their choice, and as time goes by, it seems like I get further away from being chosen by them, even though I’ve never cared about anyone as much as this person before. It is killing me knowing that anytime, they could point at someone else and forget you. 

I have never rejected someone before, I have never gotten the chance to, so I don’t understand how someone so easily can just throw away the opportunity to have someone in their life that cares about them more than anything. I have never had a significant other nor gotten a love confession targeted towards me. I guess that I wasn’t born to be happy after all, only to care about other people with nothing in return. 

I haven’t even been rejected by this person yet, but I still can’t stand this because I’m sure that no one wants me at this rate after not being wanted for my entire life.",10Feb2019,1
8,"It’s gonna be long and I’ll summarize as best I can but if you read the whole thing and help me out I will greatly appreciate it. 

A little background of details for the mess I just made. 
I’m dating someone, I’ll call her Kay. Kay and i haven’t been seeing each other long. But we get a long pretty well and enjoy each other’s company, however, she called on a break because she wanted us both to get through the semester with better grades before we transfer from community college to university. I agreed and we still text occasionally and check up on each other and only once a week at work I’ll have e shift with her. We both work in the same place and have a mutual friend that works with us. I’ve driven my girlfriends car before so she lets me drive hers to move it to a closer parking spot than where she normally has it so she doesn’t have to walk far. 

Now to the the part where everything falls apart. Where I live we rarely get ice or snow or sleet of any sort. After two years of nothing we got really bad sleet and there was at least a little less than half an inch on my girlfriends car windows that night.  She and I are very young. We both just hit the legal age of being adults (18) so we got a whole life ahead of us. So that’s why I’m here because I’m not experienced in life and well I need advice on more things than one. 

Sorry I’m getting off topic i went to work on my day off to hang out with a friend and (even though on a break) to see my girlfriend. She sneaks in a couple kisses away from the cameras and tells me she misses me a lot. Towards the end of her shift she’s telling me maybe we should call it off because she’s doing just fine with school and so am I.  Everything was feeling right that night. With the ice being bad we were instructed to move our cars to the front and be careful. So my girlfriend asks me to move her car closer to the stores entrance. My coworkers are crazy so instead of just letting the car defrost they open the door and drive with their head out. I saw this want figured it was the fastest way to move hers too. My drive didn’t go so smoothly. My foot slipped off the break and the car kept going. I couldn’t reach it in time but i knew i still have full control of the wheel. So i steered the car away from my friends to avoid hitting it head on and just scratched the car. There wasn’t even a dent just some paint scratched off both cars. 


Everyone freaks out, my girlfriend tells me to just go home and that she’s not mad at me. My girlfriend takes the blame for me and my friend knows it was me who hit her car but lies to her parents and insurance putting my girlfriend as responsible for the accident. They both tell me to keep my mouth shut and to stay out of it. They’re literally saving my ass. My mother doesn’t know a thing. Just us three, and now you guys reading this. 

All this happened at 2 am this morning. 30 minutes after i leave my girlfriend calls me and tells me she’s not upset with me in anyway and that she loves me. I don’t believe it. Yeah, accidents happen but this can mess everything up with her parents and i just made her life harder so how could she? 

I can’t tell or vent  anyone i know because I could put myself. I told my friend and girlfriend I’d pay for damages but they don’t want my help or money. So now I’m just stuck here with guilt, cluelessness, and sadness. I don’t know where to go from here, or what’s best and can use a little guidance and advice. Although the insults for my mistake are welcome too, I know I deserve them.

9,"Hi yall. I have a college friend that I do really like and think they're a great and funny person. We happen to live very close to each other back home (which is like 5 hours away from school)  and she asked if I could drive her back home for spring break. I have a car and she knows this which is why she asked. I kinda said yes. But I get anxiety and the thought of someone being in the car with me for 5 hours makes me super nervous. I also like to use that time to decompress and be by myself after all of the interaction with people at college. Am I being unreasonable if I don't want to drive them home? How can I let them know this without them thinking I'm a terrible person? We only live like 15 minutes away from each other back in our home town so I feel really guilty because it's not like I'm going out of my way to bring them home. It's not about the money for gas or anything either, I just really want to be able to relax. Any advice is welcome :(",10Feb2019,1

I planned on bringing all my books as well to store them. I know the furniture would stay but there's all the little things like wall hangings, stuff on the windowsill, kitchen stuff, Etc that I'm not sure if I would pack up or not? I know there has to be a sense of compromise because I'm technically sharing the space, but I also don't want to give up every element of this being my home because I'll be returning to it.

13,"So , everyone on highschool already knows what they want to be when they get older . Thats not the issue , the issue is that people think its stupid and I'll never make it  .
When people ask me what I want to be I always answer ""acting"" , its my dream , i started acting in school plays . Thats when I started liking it.
I told my mom , but she says it would be ""inappropriate"" and also because I dont know how to speak english VERY well . I told her i could spend some more time studying english but she says it would be in stupid. She tells me to study stuff like my cousins ,an engineer,an architect or a doctor. I dont like those ideas because i think i could be a change for this family and i want to be an inspiration for people.
Friends ?... well i cant say to much ... they say i cant do it cuz im not good at it , others just laugh 
Teachers?... this one time a PE teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grow up , when I answered she just laugh and said I would never make it and be more realistic .
Acting is my biggest dream , being a Hollywood star , act in movies and plays, win an Oscar or Oscars, a golden globe,other.Be someone important that everyone will remember. All though , sometimes i think its a waste of time and start believing that everyone is right.
Im still studying english in my country ,it hard but I'm doing my best.
I want to know you guys opinion of what should I do .
Continue with my dream or just give up.

21,"Hi everyone, I never thought I'd come to ask this question as it seemed like such a foreign disease. 

My brother (33) lives in another country and has 3 children, aged 2 to 6. 
SO many things happened randomly during the years, but I never connected the dots. 
Recently he told me that people are following him around town, he is sometimes seeing and meeting an old exgirlfriend (who is 600km away from him, so not possible). A few years ago he asked me to check his computer, phone and wireless connection to see if someone might have ""infiltrated"" his network or devices. Giving the benefit of the doubt, I checked everything and nothing weird was happening, but every time I visited the wireless router was turned off (supposedly because of the dangers of radio waves). My brother has a PhD and knows that all the scare is bullshit, but I understand that we're not always rational beings.

Anyway, he came to visit me last summer with the kids and girlfriend, and he mentioned to me scaredly that some people from our country are following him, and he saw them a couple of times. 

His girlfriend almost left him a couple of times because she thought he was cheating on her, but she seemed to understand that this ""ex-gf"" is not really real. Technically, she is, but she's really far away and hasn't spoke to him in more than 5 years. 

He also told me that sometimes they communicate using youtube videos with special meanings to them, through fake profiles. 

A few weeks ago thought, he accused my father of touching one of the nephews and she told him that my aunt is going to punish him for this (that aunt died more than 10 years ago) for this, because he also molested her or something like that. 
My father has never touched me, my sister or my brother inappropriately. 
He mentioned a couple of times that he saw this happening, one of which I was there and nothing happened. Me and my father were playing with a niece, and her leggings came off a bit. 
Another time the kids were jumping on the beds while my parents were trying to watch TV and they grabbed them by the legs so they would stop jumping since they didn't listen and the bed is like 1m from the ground.

While putting all this on paper it seems like my brother has schizophrenia, but I'm not sure and will not be until a diagnosis is confirmed. I want to help him, but the problem is that I'm 4000km away from him and so are our parents. The girlfriend seems to have shut down after this accusations started so not much I can do.

So I really don't know what I'm looking for, but how would you help him? Don't know where to start, and I feel so helpless being so far away. 
Does this sound like schizophrenia? ",10Feb2019,1

23,"Okay, so I need to lay out a picture for people to understand: I am a 20 year old college student with absolutely no money, no job (due to severe medical issues) and only 8 months of work experience, 6 of which is retail. I had to stop working in March of 2018 due to increasing amounts of pain and problems breathing after longer shifts. I spent all of my time since then bouncing between doctors trying to figure out what is wrong with my body. It wasn't until I got fed up with doctor's giving me the runaround and misdiagnosing me that I went to a well-known rheumatologist, who did a more thorough examination of my problems than any other doctor I have been to, even my PCP. After an MRI in October of last year (2018), he found two cysts near my tailbone, which I believe to be causing the pain. The discs in my spine were perfectly fine, and I have minor scoliosis. Since then, it has been a battle between finding a neurologist and managing pain. What I am worried about is the fact that I am in college. I am enrolled in a junior college, expecting to transfer to a local university after the fall semester, about an hour and a half away from where I currently live. I am planning to rent an apartment with one to two roommates. However, I can't work due to the level of pain. I can barely clean up small messes, much less constantly bend over, reach up, sit and stand... It all causes an extreme amount of pain. 

Furthermore, since I am moving out, I have roughly 9 months to put together enough money to put money down on a used car which a parent will be co-signing for, start a phone plan, and be able to afford about 6 months worth of rent. It feels so impossible. Not being able to work now feels like all of my dreams will be thrown out the window. The only way I will be able to afford my tuition for college is student loans and financial aid, and my success isn't even guaranteed. I need an incredible amount of advice, as I have no direction. My parents can't help because I do come from a lower income family, and paying for my things is not an option. They already have trouble paying for the things that I need. I really want to push past all of this, become financially independent and change my life for the better so that it will take the load off of my family. Being 20 years old and being 4 years behind schedule isn't fun. What I'm asking for is some form of direction. How can I take the $11 in my wallet and potentially turn that into $1,100, or even $11,000. How can I actually become financially independent? or rather, what do I need to do to start on that path to success? I have next to no job experience. Working from home could be an option, but I don't have time to build a website and manage it due to my studies, and I don't have many exceptional skills other than reading and writing. I just need a direction.

She’s trying to set me up with another coworker, but it’s in that weird way, like she’s found some safe ground adjacent to intimate relationship talk, and she keeps bringing it up, usually in conjunction with some talk about how she’s not my type.

This isn’t entirely new territory for me, I’m very friendly and not unattractive. I can usually come up with the right combination of feigned ignorance and politeness to kind of skirt the issue long enough for them to lose interest or whatever. But this is the first time dealing with a work superior and someone I’m forced to be around every day. 

It’s not making me feel uncomfortable but it’s just kind of exhausting having to watch everything I say so I can tread the line between being friendly while not giving any indication that I’m interested. Clearly, the best thing would be to just bring it up, but I don’t want to embarrass her, or upset her, and I definitely don’t want any negative fallout to affect my career. 

So, advice for dealing with crushing supervisors I have absolutely zero interest in, but who’s feelings I want to protect for both personal and professional reasons?",10Feb2019,1
29,"TD;LR: Disabled, can't work (disability income), I definitely can't do most trade skills but everyone still pressuring me to go to college, don't want to go but don't want to disappoint them. Any alternatives? Hobbies? Business?  

Ok, so everyone keeps pressuring me to go to college even my doctors! But the thing is I don't want to go to college and I'm not getting a job after college (I can't work) but if I don't everyone is gonna be disappointed. We can barely afford the essentials, only one of us working (mom) and I can't accept them wasting money on college for nothing, it makes me feel bad. My dad couldn't care less about college but my mom won't give up asking me everyday ""go to college to at least go outside?"" So I gave her my counter arguments, I told her I'm not going to waste money on a degree I'll never use nor will I go to college just for the sake of learning when we have the Internet to learn so many things with the bonus of being free! I have started doing many online courses and started to go to the library several times a week to prove that I can learn without college, I even have certficates from online courses!

She still won't change her tune, now it's just the battle of who is stubborn longest and it's been 3 years since I finished high school! Now other problems I have are I don't know what to take in college, I am artistically inclined interested in Art, design (web/graphic), gaming &amp; tech (especially IT, Coding not so much) but I was rejected to the graphic &amp; web design program, don't have the requirements for IT &amp; programming... My grades in highschool sucked but managed to get honors some how in the first year but I did so badly in the last year. I researched every college, every course, every program near me and we can't move but honestly nothing interests me at all and I don't fill most of their requirements. So I don't know what to do! Do I give in to expectations so my mom can finally shut up about it or is there a far better alternative to college? Hobbies? Business? Maybe Volunteer?",10Feb2019,1
30,"Hey all!

So I’m a 25F living in Australia. I have brown hair, olive skin and blue eyes. Basically I look white as heck with the exception that I don’t burn in the sun I just get a nice olive light brown glow. Thing is my Mum is Aboriginal/Croatian and my Dad is White Australian hence the blue eyes and lighter skin. 

The problem is I identify myself as an aboriginal woman. I’d like to take pride in my culture and it’s rich history and take pride in my identity! The majority of my family is indigenous and our family history goes back hundreds and hundreds of years.

However I’ve always had this one problem when I explain to people that I am aboriginal.
I’d get comments like

“How much aboriginal do you have in you?”
“So, you’re not REALLY aboriginal then are you?”
Or
“You don’t LOOK aboriginal”
Okay so WHAT? Like do I have to clap my legs, paint myself black and carry a boomerang?

It’s just I’m a very passive person so usually is just let it slide and smile but I think it’s really naive and a bit racist to be honest or am I being over the top?

SO to sum up
1. I want to stick up for my self and my identity.

2. I want a good comeback(maybe funny but serious) to put these people in their place and realise that that’s NOT an okay thing to say to someone

I’m probably being over dramatic as heck but it makes me feel like I’m not entitled to identity as my own culture.
Any tips?

31,"This is going to be pretty long and since this is because of pent up frustration.. i hope that to who anyone who reads this please bear with me

It started when I was very young my father tries to spoil me with materialistic gifts. Well as a young child who does want that, right? One one problem though. Whenever I do something wrong, even if its just a little mistake, I would get insulted and get hit on the head or got spanked on the rear so it would sometimes force me to sit not so comfortably on a chair or sleep face down.

The insults and physical hits continued when I was a teenager only that the spanking decreased but the insults stayed but this time, I was even compared to other kids and get called disrespectful whenever I tried to defend myself. I tried everything to cope up with what he has done: tried to smile when I was hit so that I wouldnt really feel the pain that much, try to keep quiet when I get insulted on my choices or just keep my head down. But even with this, I still get to go to a very nice school and get almost anything I want but I have never ever experienced a hug or some sort of emotional affection from him for 20 years.

I really never liked staying at home to the point that I really really loved going to school and hanging out at other friends houses on the weekends. It stayed like that until I started college.

It got worse at college.

I was ""brainwashed"" (as my aunt used to say it) to take a course I never wanted to take because it was my father's choice. I got so frustrated at not being given a chance to choose where I wanted to go, that I almost tried to attempt suicide. But decided against it. I didnt really want to but the feeling of just giving up still kind of lingers.

And all throughout those 20 years my father would make me feel that I should be thankful I had a father like him because he had a violent dad that would hit him and insult him, a mom that left him so he was forced to run away and fend for himself. So he kept on saying that I am lucky that I got a lifestyle like this.

And now he has started a new religion or something that sounds more like a cult than a religion. And was kind of forcing it on us but at the same time called us hypocrites for not attending church. (I became an athiest because of him.)

He has developed this thing that only his opinion mttered nd if you contradict that opinion you get a ton of insults and nonsensical stuff thrown at you and most of them dont really make sense.

I love my mom but I really really hate my father's guts. 

So what I am saying is..

I really really need advice. I have a part time job but it is only enough to pay my college tuition, my allowance and my intallments for the pc I use for my part time job.

I really cant stand him anymore but I am really confused on what to do.

If anything in thw post is confusing you can tell me right away and sorry in advance since I am very distraught while I made this so I probably left out something..

TL;DR: my father has been very controlling of my life but keeps telling me Im lucky I was born as his kid but I dont really feel that I am lucky.

Now, at Sadie’s you match. We planned on matching and wanted to go pick out an outfit at the mall. I say I can either meet her there or my mom can take us both. I tell this to her mom. Her mom says we can’t go together. She says that she’ll take V to get a shirt, and I can go to my mall to get the shirt. But, the whole point was we wanted to pick out a shirt TOGETHER! And what if my store doesn’t have the same shirt or the right size? Anyways, I tell V yesterday at school that I can just buy both of our shirts. We picked out ideas online. She says okay, but her mom won’t be okay with it (cause she’s a butch). I tell V that I can text her mom and say that it’s a birthday gift for V too, cause her bday just passed. V tells me no, and that her mom will yell at her. I say I can make it super reasonable, but she INSISTS no. She also says she won’t want to come in a tshirt and change cause her mom will get bitchy. 

Today rolls around. My mom and I get us shirts anyways cause there was a sale. I call her and talk to V. She’s wearing this fancy ass dress thats like for Prom, cause her mom wants her to. V is okay with it, but mostly reluctant and defeated. I have a dress that’ll match in color, but they don’t look alike at all. We’re going to feel out of place, since Sadie’s is for matching.

43,"Hi guys. This is my first Reddit post as i am truly at my wits end. I have been in a 6 years relationship. The guy I’m with is a true Prince Charming reanimated. He is hot (crazy hot) sweet, kind, amazing, charming,  I couldn’t not say one thing against him if I tried. The only thing is that he seems to have libido that is waaaaay lower than mine. 
I could have sex at least 3x a week. He could have sex once a month and not think twice about it. 
We are Msimilar age (26&amp;30), both have been sexually active before.
He is the sweetest guy I have met. He is kind and I love him to the end on earth. When we make love, he is a generous and great lover. Sadly, it is way to rarely and I feel like I’m sexually frustrated as hell 90% of the time. 
I really care for this guy. He is the best. But it really seems like he doesn’t have the same sexual need as I do. 
I considered whether he is secretly gay but it doesn’t seem like it (I suggested three some with guys and girls and he was strongly agains it). We live in a country where homosexual marriage is legal and quite common. 
I suggested an open relationship but he is strongly against it. 

I don’t consider myself to be crazy hot but if I have to be honest, I’m quite good looking. I have nice face and nice features. I really like my body and he always says he is attracted to me. I put on costumes, which seems to arose him a bit but I’m tired of CONSTANTLY initiating sex.  If I don’t do anything, we can just live in monastery. Most of the times he just says he’s too tired to do anything. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I really love this guy. We have been together for 6 years now and I cannot imagine life without him. We have great time together and common interest. And sex is really good too (even though it’s too vanilla for me) once we get to it. But it’s just so rarely I’m really sexually frustrated all the time.

45,"Hey there reddit, this is my first post so please bear with me.

My ex girlfriend and I adopted a puppy last month, before a series of events went down (several instances of abuse) and we are splitting up. Our lease is ending in about three weeks (our pet friendly lease was not supposed to end this early but because we are breaking up and there is abuse we are being forced out). We paid 50/50 for this puppy and I was the one who was in contact with the breeder the entire time.

Before I continue, I know, I KNOW, I shouldn't have gotten this dog. Really did not expect this break up and I did not expect that our lease would end randomly and I would be broke ass. I know.

The problem is, this puppy has been destroying the house. The house that I paid the damage deposits on. Like I said, the lease ends in three weeks. I really need that money back and I’ve been busting my ass trying to fix up the house. However, this dog just keeps on blowing up the house. Whether I’m home or not. She’s been peeing on the hardwood floors which are now bubbling/cupping and scratching the walls and doors, knocking over garbage bins and stuff off the counter. This dog is seriously adding so much to my workload. I work pretty much full time and I go to school full-time. My partner is gone all the time and doesn’t seem to care about me not getting my damage deposit back.

Even though we paid for the dog 50/50, I spend the most time with the dogs (I have another dog of my own), she’s gone most nights and I spend so much time on my hands and knees trying to clean up the messes and organized everything with the breeder, she INSISTS that it is her dog. There is no vet paper work so far because she is almost due for her booster shots so I don’t have my name on the vet papers. Now she refuses to board the dog for a few weeks while I fix up the house, refuses to get a crate, and refuses to leave with the dog.

My ex isn’t even supposed to be in the house. She had her keys taken away from the cops the other week and isn’t supposed to come back into the house until she picks up ALL of her stuff under the supervision of the police. She broke in the house the other day through the window and I haven’t called the police because I am worried they will take my keys and I will seriously have no where to live and the last time the police were contacted it took up 12 hours of my day that I should’ve spent studying and working!

When she was removed from the house, the cops strictly directed me not to touch any of her stuff. Since she claims that the dog is “hers” and I am worried about legal implications, I’ve been letting the monster roam around my house. I’ve talked to SPCA about the situation, asking for compassionate boarding but even though its 50% of my dog, there could be legal problems. That’s even if I let them watch the dog for two weeks until I have this house fixed up! Not surrender the dog.

I've tried talking to my ex about the situation. I've explained to her that I need my damage deposit back and I explained that there are options that wouldn't involve giving the puppy up. I asked her for her permission to compassionately board the dog while I fix things up. I asked her to get a crate for the dog for when we’re not home. And finally I did suggest that it would probably be in the best interest to re-home the dog as much as she doesn't want to. I told her that the dog is a puppy and she would get a decent amount of money that she needs in exchange for the dog. I told her that we could find new owners that could take care of her way more than either of us are capable of right now. I told her that the puppy will have a better life. And it’s true. The dog is very unkept. Neither of us are home often and we can’t afford to get her booster shots right now. She is ruining the house and she is not responding to training probably because she is so focused on playing with my other dog all the time.

Does anyone here have any advice as to what I should do? Should I just re-home it anyway? Or give it to SPCA temporarily? Also I am based out of Vancouver, BC, Canada if that helps for legalities.",10Feb2019,1

51,"I'm 33 and I have 2 elementary aged kids. I was with my husband (my age) for 9 years. About a year ago he decided he should quit his job and that we should separate. I was a stay at home mom. We'd also just sold our house and had thousands in our bank account. And he went to Europe twice using a huge chunk of that money. Without going into too much detail, I hit rock bottom and came out (still coming out of it) a stronger, more mentally healthy individual. 

I moved 2000 miles away to try life in a different area where I thought the kids would be happy. My ex agreed it could be good for them and promised to be in their lives as much as he could while he went to school back in our home town. So I've been far from my friends and the city I lived in for 9 years, learning how to be alone without being lonely. I can't get a job since my daughter is not in school until next year. Meanwhile my ex is now dating someone over 10 years younger than himself, quit school and hasn't worked this whole time, meaning we both were living off our savings. I trusted him when I should have just taken half the money from the sale of the house. Even his mom advised me to take my money out of our joint account as soon as I told her we were separating, and now I feel like an idiot.

For a ton of reasons, I have decided that I need to move back to my home town to go to school, get a job, and have the kids around their dad more often. Plus I have some family and very good friends there. Ultimately I believe this will make us all 4 happier. I have no expectations of my ex. I'm moving for myself and the kids, though I do hope having them in his life again will help motivate him. I know I will be a better mom when I'm able to actually have some personal time, since currently I'm just burnt out having to be a single parent and barely able to get an hour out of the house alone once or twice a month.

So now we're broke. I have no idea how he's paying our credit card bill. I feel like I'm trapped now. I want to move forward with my life and finally be independent. Anxiety has held me back for my whole life and I finally feel like I can get my shit together and be an adult. But how am I supposed to move back if I can't get a job and my ex is likely making around minimum wage.

52,"TL;DR: if you could be guaranteed that 100% of donations went toward spaying and neutering the 5-10 feral cats in your neighborhood, would you donate?


I had to come to reddit to ask this because most of my neighbors added me on Facebook so I didn't want to ask there because the ones that added me are a huge root to this problem. I don't think they're entirely ignorant, but I definitely don't think they realize the harm they're causing by not fixing their pets.

I've lived in my new neighbhorhood for almost a year now. We moved in at the end of March, 2018. As of the last two weeks, every day, morning and night, there are cats in my yard marking their territory, defecating, fighting, about to fight, and last night we came home to find two breeding next to our other car.

I've taken my dog out to go potty and scared the crud out of one cat that didn't hear us coming, I've had TERRIBLE fleas the last 6 months (I've NEVER had issues with fleas! And I used to work at a humane society where I handled animals, fostered, and I've owned animals my whole life), and I'm worried about ever letting my own 3 cats (all fixed) outside because I don't want them to get attacked.

All night and day you can hear them meowing, mrrowing (that weird, long meow/mating call) like it's a jungle out there.

Some look to be in terrible, beaten shape and in general living rough lives.

Last year one of my neighbors cats, who's indoor/outdoor, had 7 kittens. Then she found 3 from another cat. Sadly, one of the other tomcats had attacked these kittens and were in terrible shape. We thought one wasn't going to make it. And at some point, while talking to her about her kitten-situation, I remember her saying that she can't afford to get them all fixed...

If someone in your neighborhood was to create a GoFundMe page where proceeds could only go towards a specified vet clinic in order to fix neighborhood, feral cats, would you donate? I was thinking that maybe I could create an account, or speak to an associate at a clinic and have them create an account for this project, then I wouldn't be able to have access to the funds myself -- so to guarantee to those donating that the funds go 100% to the cause.

The clinic would also be low-cost, photos of receipts would be documented, even photos of cats caught in traps in front of a significant neighborhood landmark (like there's this gazebo in front of our local police dept that's just down the road from me) as proof of catching cats, or any other ideas to show legitimacy?

I would simply hand out ""flyers"" to my neighbors, personally, going door-to-door, and post the funding page on my FB, to get the word out.

I have contacts that can help me get cages and I don't mind doing the physical work of taking the cats in. I truly hate knowing that these cats are just bringing in more unwanted cats, many probably getting hit by cars, spreading disease, fleas, ect.

I definitely couldn't afford to fix all of the neighborhood cats on my own.

I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I’d appreciate some advice. Please and thank you.

60,"I'm 18, I live with my mom, I'm a senior in high school. 

When I was younger, she'd let me play games for kids, like Dora themed and Blue's Clues games. I didn't really pay any attention to any games until I was like 11, until I found out about Portal. My dad, who still lived with us at the time, played games on the computer, and he got me both the Portal games on Steam, as well as the Half-Life series, and would let me play on his computer. One time my mom heard me playing the game and got mad because she thought the portal gun sounded like an actual gun. I showed her it was just a puzzle game, she calmed down, but told me she didn't want me playing it anymore. I still played it, I just managed to switch tabs quickly so she wouldn't see. Later on, my dad got me a laptop, and I started playing TF2 when I was 14. 

I'd like to make a point that I don't specifically like violent games, they wouldn't be my first choice (CoD for example). 

I kind of stopped playing games once I got into high school, I was on the swim team, I made more friends so I went out more often got a boyfriend, got into makeup and I kinda stopped. 

Meanwhile, my mom (who is Russian), was watching a lot of videos by some Russian woman about how American's design video games to lead kids to becoming violent, leading them to suicide, making them insane and withdrawn, some other stuff that I didn't really pay attention to. 

I'll also add that maybe the above is true if you play nonstop, but I go to school, I have good friends, I just have more time to play games because my mom forced me to quit swimming. I haven't been ""sucked into video game world"", I don't think I have any violent tendencies from ""Angry Birds"", which was one of her main examples.

Fast forward to this year, I saw the Nintendo Switch being advertised. A couple of my friends have it, and Splatoon 2 really caught my eye. So I got it, got the game, and whenever my mom isn't home or isn't watching over me, I play it. 

The only games I got for the Switch so far are Splatoon 2, Super Mario Odyssey, SSBU, and Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. 

I was in my room in bed, sick, and my mom came in to tell me something, and I quickly shoved the switch under my pillow. She asked me what I was hiding, and there was no way I could've told her nothing - when she wants to know something she doesn't fucking stop. Anyway, I showed it to her and told her my friend let me borrow it, she took it and walked out of the room. She walked back in two minutes later, saying I was a lost cause, I may as well just kill myself now since video games make you kill yourself?, and that since I'm defending video games my brain is already messed up. 

So my question is, what do I even do or tell her? No matter what I say I'm messed up in the head. I'm just mostly annoyed that something that's literally harmless in her mind equals literal death. She knows I'm not messed up in the head, she's made me read a lot of books and when I discuss them with her she tells me she's proud she raised a smart kid. I really don't know what to do here. ",10Feb2019,1
61,"Basically, there's this group of three friends I'm having trouble with. They are all really close, and every problem seems to rely on my relationship with other member of the trio. Let me introduce them.

TB: my best friend for almost three years and also my dance partner. He used to have a big crush on me a few years ago and it just went away completely four months ago. Still, he kept being sexually attracted to me.

FG: My ex-boyfriend (he broke up with me). Used to be really sweet and understanding but became harsh and selfish after we broke up. 

MC: FG's best friend for half a decade. We were a casual thing for almost two weeks before he dumped me because he was afraid I wanted something more serious. Kind of childish, not a bad thing but still good to consider.

Anyways. After MC dumped me I started talking with FG, he had said it wasn't a big deal anyways. At least until we started dating. Apparently he had feelings for me and wanted to ask me out but his plans were ruined when he found out FG and I kissed for the first time. This led to him not speaking to us for the entire relationship, and only accepting his best friend back if he broke up with me.

FG ended up breaking up with me for other reasons and him and MC started talking again. I thought this meant MC and I could stop ignoring eachother...but not really. He tried to talk to me when he found my depression was getting bad to the point I was hurting myself, but stopped after a day cause it was too weird for him.

The MONTHS he kept ignoring me, TB and I started being FwB, nothing bad there. At least until TB told me while drunk that he liked me. I realised I liked him to and told him so. A few days later he confessed that it was just a dumb thing he said because he was drunk. Since then he started being colder with me while in public and in text, but turned a 180 when alone. This made me uneasy because I also have anxiety (yay!) and it comes out especially with these things.

We did fix that and he went back to normal. Still were FwB and I still had a crush on him. Tried to ignore it the best I could but never worked. You may be asking yourself ""Don't you think he might feel the same way?"", the answer is no. Because the WHOLE TIME he was also FwB with an ex that cheated on him and asked me for advice about her because he was still in love with her. This went on until a week ago she got in a relationship with someone else and he stopped talking to her (I hate to admit that made me happy).

Anyways, back to MC. We went back to talking when a friend of mine forwarded him an audio of mine talking about how grateful I was because of what an amazing friend he was before all of this happened and that I thought he was great. He then unblocked me and we went back to talking every day. Eventually we started sexting for a while and even made plans for me to go over once I came back from vacations. One day he said he couldn't keep going with that and wanted to go back to just being friends. I said sure, no big deal. 

Immediately he starts plain ghosting me and playing dumb if someone confronts him about it. And I really don't want to talk about it with TB because he's sick of hearing me talk about MC for almost a year. I feel really used, but I still miss him. I don't know if as a friend or something else. Still, those feelings for TB are still there and he confirmed over and over that he just likes me as a friend. To top it all off, FG is their best friend and gives them advice all the time, and he really doesn't like me.

64,"I don’t want to make a huge, long post, but I have become very frustrated with this. 

My (27F) brother (35M) has been diagnosed bipolar, schizophrenic and possibly more over the years. 

We aren’t very close. He was a troubled kid and was mean to me. By the time I was a teenager and he was an adult he put me in dangerous situations (gave me hard drugs, went to buy drugs and used me to drive then left me unattended with a 30+ year old man who tried to push drugs on me/sleep with me while my brother was inside using/buying, physically harmed me (shoved me to the ground/out of a vehicle at one point- and I’m leaving out all the “playful” ways he physically hurt me because I know siblings can be like that (but he was an adult and I was not,)  and begged me to sleep in the same bed with him to name a few I remember distinctly. I don’t remember what happened when he did that. I have no recollection of doing it or not. 

I quit talking to him for awhile. He’s in and out of jail and has also been in prison. He’s always had addiction problems as well and has had multiple suicide attempts (I have cleaned up after one.) My mother consistently gave me a hard time about not speaking to him- she also has no boundaries and can’t seem to see why I don’t want to be around him. I am afraid I am taking after her in this way. I eventually I gave in, but I get no enjoyment from contact with him. Just a sick, stressed feeling. 

Recently I got pregnant and told him and since then he’s been texting me a lot asking how I am and telling me how to take care of myself (something I am fully capable of doing, but he’s never been able to.) He messaged me today and asked me to forgive him and he’s sorry for being so shitty (a very common thing for him to do- he often sends messages like this. I know he is an incredibly guilty person.) 

I’m just fed up. I don’t want my child to be a part of anything like this and I hardly want it to have much to do with my mother either because she’s enabled my brother so much and never done anything constructive for him. The thought of having my child be alone with either of them makes me nauseous and it’s not even born yet. Luckily I live far away now so it’s not something I have to deal with at this time. 

I know he’s mentally ill. I’m bipolar, but I go to therapy/take medication/have found ways to manage it. He scares me. I don’t know if I should say something to him, cut him out, repair the broken relationship since I’m the more stable person. I’m at a loss. 

If anyone has advice I’m all open. This has been one of the biggest sources of stress for me in my life. I wish I had the tools to handle it on my own. ",10Feb2019,1

The ability to rely on and use my authority is a skill I need to develop anyways--I'd like to be a teacher some day--but the whole idea of having to enforce the rules on someone, even possibly to a physical altercation (I realize this would be rare, if ever), makes me stressed and nervous.

66,"So usually relationship posts like this are not my thing but this has been eating away at me for literal months now and I think it’s really starting to affect me mentally. I warn you this is a long one. (TL;DR at the bottom)  really hope I explain this well enough for people to understand!

Before I start, I am NOT in a relationship with this girl, we are just good friends. 

I have known this girl for a year and a half now and we talk regularly. We are quite good friends but we are no where near best friends. We share quite a bit in common. Her favourite band is also my favourite band, we have the same exact job but work in different places. Just to name a couple. Although I have know her a while, I didn’t really start talking to her properly until About 7 months ago. She broke up with her long term partner in January of last year. A group of our mutual friends went out for some drinks and that was when we really started talking. It was that night that when she told me she had been single for around 6 months now. I had no idea. Until that point I had never looked at her in THAT way before. In fact I didn’t think about her at all. But that night we got closer. Nothing happened between us but there were signals that something might happen. We were holding hands pretty much the whole night and in the taxi home, she was grabbing and rubbing my leg as I sat next to her, but I never made a move. Partly because we had a lot to drink and partly because of what she told me about her BF. She didn’t seem completely over it.

Fast forward a couple of months and we’re talking a lot more. We text almost everyday over the summer, including some drunk texting. We start to see each other some more but this time just us two. This was very much platonic. She even started to come out with me and my old friends from school and I was going out with her old friends as well. Eventually we go back to our jobs over summer break and we stop seeing each other as much but we still talk. Then our favourite band announced their new tour. Of course we agree to go together. 

This definitely brought us together again. We talk a lot more and we are excited for this night. But this is where things get complicated. During this period before the concert, I ask her out a few times and she agrees but then cancels (we do meet on a couple of occasions and it’s fine, no awkwardness, but still platonic). My friends have a tradition that we go out together on Christmas Eve for a few drinks. I invite her and she says she can’t but she wants to see me (just us two) during the day on Christmas Eve before seeing her family in the evening. An hour before I’m supposed to meet her, she cancels. It left me feeling pretty low I won’t lie. 

During this period I really start to struggle. I’ve clearly fallen for this girl. Massively. I start to develop this insane jealously, even though I know we are in no way a couple, like not even close. But I still get so jealous every time I see she’s out with people I don’t know.

Fast forward a few more weeks and it’s the night of the concert. The best/worst night of my life thus far. We enjoy ourself and have a brilliant time. But at the same time this is probably the worst thing that could have happened. We both drink a lot and really hit it off, more so than usual. This may sound crazy but the worst thing that happens that night? She stays at mine.....All night. We don’t have sex but we do get a lot more intimate than we ever have before. At the time I was over the moon but then in the morning I started to doubt myself. Was this a drunken mistake? To my surprise she behaves the same way she did the night before. She even says how she wanted to stay in bed all morning.  I end up walking her home mid morning and go back to my day. I text her later that day a couple of times..........no response for nearly 3 days. 

My relationship with this girl (a close friend) is so complicated. I know I have fallen for her massively. More than I have for anyone in my past. But she is so hot and cold with me that I don’t know where I stand to the point I am getting jealous over a girl I’m not in a relationship with. And I’m some cruel way, every time I finally stop thinking about her, a text from her pops up in my phone. EVERY. TIME. It’s like a cruel divine intervention that trigger this jealously all over again. 

TL;DR I have fallen for a friend and we have been intimate with each other. But she is so hot and cold with me that I think it’s starting to affect my mental health to the point some days, I think about her constantly. To prove this it’s 2:18 am and I’m writing this post....and while I’m writing this, she’s messaged me.

What do I do? I feel if I jump in and get turned away it will ruin our friendship, and I really don’t want that. But the longer I leave it the more it affects me mentally. 

Sorry for the extremely long post!

68,"I live in a small town in Idaho, and I hate it here. My family and I don’t get along, we’ve had a bad falling out. My family is very toxic and I just need to get away. I own two dogs and I have to take them. I’m not willing to give them up and my family wouldn’t keep them. I’m 25 and I moved back home with my parents when I was 22 and I had bought my dogs when I was 19. 

So, anyway it’s time for me to go. Where should I go? I’ll go anywhere. I only have 11,000 saved up at the moment. If I work two more months I’ll have close to 13,000.

69,"I don't even know how to word this properly or where to begin. Basically, I was an idiot. Everyone around me was drinking, so I started drinking, and in typical 'me' fashion I talked out of my arse and dug myself a deep hole.

I spoke to the other boss, he said that I'm not getting a written warning or any warnings, we're just having a catch up.

I guess that I'm writing this because I need help. Tomorrow will be good because I'll have a very clear outline of expectations and that sort of thing, I just think that I acted far too cocky when I was drunk and said lots of stupid things and made myself look like an absolute idiot.

70,"I have been having some issues with my mom and her behavior in the past couple of years. I don't know if I'm overreacting or being too harsh or what. I'm just not sure what to do with this. Thanks in advance for reading. It gets pretty long.
My first issue is how she treats animals. She'll get a pet, keep it for a few weeks, and once it does something ""naughty"" or they become too much of a burden, she takes it to the humane society. It has always upset me to see her go though animals like that. Last summer she went through 2 dogs, 1 cat, and 2 ferrets. 
My second issue is that less than a year ago, I had posted that ""#metoo"" on social media. My mom saw it and kept pestering me about what I meant by that, what happened. Finally I caved and told her that I'd been molested as a kid. She asked who and I told her that is was the daughter of one of her friends, we'll call her Carla. To preface this next part, I have a stepsister, we'll call her Courtney. My mom goes on to say how this was my dad's fault which made no sense (dad lived a few hours away and I saw him maybe once a year my whole life). I realized she was saying that it was my stepsister, whose names both start with the same letter. I explained that, no, it was Carla. When I left, I felt confident that she understood that was Carla, not Courtney. She then calls my husband crying and telling him to take care of me and hung up. Then she calls me sobbing and telling me that she had called my dad and told him that Courtney had done this and how he should never contact me again because he let this happen. I was shocked. She was so hysterical at this point that I didn't know if I should tell her what she'd done. I just told her that I still loved her and we hung up. So obviously I had to do damage control and messaged my stepsister that my mom was wrong and I had never told her that and ended up with me having to explain that I had been molested, but not by her. I am extremely sensitive about this topic, so this really sucked. I didn't want anyone to know. My stepsister was cool about it, so that resolved easily. But haven't been able to talk much to my mom since then and I don't trust her anymore. I don't even know what to do with that situation without her freaking out more.
Lastly, and this might be me reading too far into things, but she always seems to acquire the medical issues that I have, within 6 months of me telling her about it. I had sciatica, she had sciatica. I tore my rotator cuff, she claimed to. She had her doctor check her, he didn't think she did. She insisted on an x-ray. It showed nothing. She told me that she was able to swing her arm around, which made me believe that she didn't actually tear it. She then got an MRI, which showed nothing. It just happens too often for me to not question it.
If you made it through all of me probably overthinking, thank you. I just don't know how to deal with these issues on our relationship. She's super sensitive to the point that it's hard to say anything even slightly upsetting. Or if I'm being silly, let me know. Thanks!",10Feb2019,1
72,"So today, LeBron James tweeted about some officer that was unjust to a black man. In the [video](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article225998300.html), the officer was asking for the man's ID, the man asked why and the officer said so that he could figure who his baby was going to stay with, the man asked why again, the officer asked again for the ID, the man gave his name, the officer asked for his ID, the officer took the baby and choked the man against a car.

So I have this problem that when I am in a public area I do not see the body language that women give as in tying to get a guys (me lol) attention. For example one instance that I will not forget was during my senior year in HS. Well I was kinda dressed nice because of yearbook pictures and walking out of the school there is a group of 4 girls walking in I did not think much. But once my family and I got at a reasonable distance from the school they ask me dude are you blind or something. And me being oblivious asks what do you mean. Then they tell me how did you not notice that all 4 girls were blushing (can not really think of the phrase in english). I say how can you be certain. My aunt and mother basically say dude we are older women reading the body language off of some HS seniors is really obvious for us. Even my younger sisters noticed. So four women in my life that honestly were not going to mislead me tell me that I am oblivious to the signals. Sadly there are more stories.

Like I would ask them what should I look for and honestly their advice is not really useful.

So women of this subreddit what is the body language that you give when you see a guy that you like in public. Not being able to read body language in random public places kinda bothers me because I think of the missed opportunities interacting with new people and just the confidence bost knowing that I am somewhat of a like able person.

I’m a fourteen year old guy, freshman in high school. Asian, with Asian and Christian parents, live in the U.S.


I’m conflicted.


I’ll first start by saying I’m not so sure if I’m straight or not. Recent people that I have met makes me question myself in terms of that. Am I just, gay?? Or maybe bi? Because right now I feel like a big question mark.

I don’t feel secure enough to talk to my parents about this. They’re extremely Christian and I’m afraid of the consequences/what could happen. The ladder can also be said for talking about this to friends. So these feelings have been only with me for the longest of time.

Now that I’m getting closer to adulthood I’m starting to try and...see life ahead of me I guess? My parents want me to go into the business industry in the Philippines. The thing is, if I come out as bi or gay, what will happen? What if it changes everything? How is the LGBTQ+ community tolerated over there?? What if I’m just being ridiculous right now over a couple people??

These questions are not things I can ask to some friend or family of mine and if I try to research for myself I get a little nervous.

One part of me is saying that I need to figure out or at least outline what to do if anything goes wrong because of these feelings. College is getting closer and everything after that. If I don’t make any moves now there could be consequences. 

But it’s just so nerve-wracking. The other side of me is telling myself to relax and that I shouldn’t be worrying  right now and I should be enjoying myself while I can, and ignore this. But what if I ignore it for too long??

*Help*. Im sorry this is extremely vague. I’ll be happy to clarify anything in the comments.

Alright. So we have this healer, my parents received her from one of their parents and... it's a heeler! Like, one of those ranch dogs, for herding and controlling livestock. She is active and energetic, and just really needs a big open space to live in and play. You might be able to tell where this is going.

Alright, so here's the issue(s): my mother, whose mother gave us this dog, is not particularly fond of her. My father does, but he (and everyone pretty much) doesn't have time to play with her and give her attention. My mother just won't. I try and take her out at least once a day for as long as I can to play, bht my schedule is generally pretty busy and I can't even give her a fraction of what she needs (and deserves).

Because of this, she is basically always stuck somewhere (the only exception being when I take her out). During the summer, it's in a small pen out in our half acre (it's like a 10x10 ft, not enough to do anything) until nighttime. During the winter, it's in our mudroom, which is even smaller than the pen. She is not allowed in the house, nor allowed to roam the half acre.

My mother is constantly complaining about her, and yells at her anytime she tries to come be with us. So all she does, literally all day, is sit around in a small enclosed space isolated from any interaction. She gets maybe 30 minutes outside with someone a day. 

She gets so hyper any time that she gets to do anything, it's so saddening...

So anyways, I need to find her a home. Two problems arise:
1. She is fiercely distrustful of everyone she isn't very familiar with. This makes it especially difficult when we have guests over. It's just a cycle of her trying to be with us, growling and barking at guests, and getting yelled at and shut in the mudroom.

2. I don't even know how/where to start looking! I don't use Facebook or other big name social media platforms like that, so I don't have that option.

My parents keep saying they want to find a new home for her, but I don't think they are making a very solid attempt...

Its only continuing to get worse and worse; at least even last year I could still get a lot stuff done for the most part. My main problems are in school but my concern is that its eventually going to bleed into my performance at work, whenever that will be. Im actually good at school but I do so little of the work and have so little motivation to show that. Its not that I dont want to do it, its that I cant bring myself too.

87,"I've never been stalked before, so I'm not sure if this is really staking but I'll tell my story anyway.

I'm a freshman girl in high school. On the first day of school, in my first class period, we got a seating chart. I was set at a table in the back corner, next to my best friend and across from two guys who I've never met before. The one I was seated across, we'll call him B, just seemed off from the moment I met him. He stared at me any time the teacher talked, while we were doing our classwork, while I was talking to my friend, etc. Just like, full on staring, barely blinking, not ever saying anything. It kinda creeped me out, but I wasn't comfortable confronting him or telling my teachers.

One of my new friends this year said that B's just 'gross' and ""creepy"" and did some reaally nasty stuff in middle school, but that friend lies constantly, so I don't know if I can trust his stories of B.

We got new seats halfway through last semester, and B stayed in the same seat. I was moved to the complete opposite corner of the room, which felt like a blessing (I still hadn't told anyone besides my best friends and boyfriend about him, so it was kind of out of nowhere). Until my best friend and I realized he was still staring at me during class. Then I noticed him more often in the hallways, always lingering a few feet away from me, just like, walking around with his headphones on. I never really caught him staring too often, but I did see him looking at me a few times.

This semester, my schedule changed a bit, so I have a different teacher and class period for that class. I have B in none of my classes though, just my lunch period. I see him a lot more often in the hallways and main seating areas during lunch. Like, he's constantly near me. He never says anything though.

It's kind of freaking me out, but I've got a boyfriend and tons of friends I could turn to if anything actually happens with him. I just don't know if I should tell a counselor or confront him or if I'm just overthinking and overreacting. Do you have any suggestions?",10Feb2019,1

89,"Hey guys. So my (I guess ex best friend) and I have been friends for almost 10 years. It's been a frustrating friendship to say the least. I feel like I've given a lot to it and she has given the bare minimum. She wasn't there for me when my Mom passed away, for example. But she battles with mental health/addiction so I tried to be understanding, but it's hard. She has parents who support her emotionally and financially (honestly to the point of enabling her, IMO) -- they've probably spent out of pocket upwards of $50,000 on her rehab/mental health treatment and she just really takes that for granted. She manipulates her doctors into giving her the meds she wants. All she does is make excuses for her actions. She complains about living at home, but won't follow through with applying for jobs. She complains about not having friends, but won't do anything to meet anyone. As someone who doesn't have the same family support, it's really frustrating to hear her complain about how her Mom/Dad won't give her money, etc. She still drinks with no remorse, (despite being in rehab 3x) in excess and verbatim told me ""the point of rehab isn't sobriety."" (So what is the point of it?????) I don't know. So I got fed up with it today and told her that being her friend is difficult and draining. I love her to death but I feel like she is a weight on me. I've been through so much and she's barely been there for me. I didn't mean anything by the comment, but she's 25 years old and has never had a job for more than 6 months. And I get it, she's struggling, but she just dumps that shit onto others and doesn't seem to care. Anyway, she like seemed to want to end the friendship after my comment.

91,"Hi there. 

So my boyfriend\[25m\] and I\[24f\] are really wanting to move to California, specifically the Los Angeles area. We are wanting to move with another couple\[25m\],\[22f\]. I've been super excited about moving up until recently when I've been mentioning to people in conversation. Their first responses are negative saying something about all the taxes and how it's super expensive to live there. The gas prices, traffic, people are rude, etc. We all have a good chunk of change saved up for this big move, we've planned it all out and are well aware of what to expect. We are willing to work hard for this dream to turn into a reality. 

I guess my question is directed toward locals of California and the Los Angeles area, is it really as bad as everyone tells me? Should we reconsider moving elsewhere? Is it true that a lot of people are moving out of the state? The only thing is that my boyfriend and his best friend are super into art and the art scene is amazing over there, that's one of the main reasons we all chose LA. They've gone to conventions and loved being there. I feel sad that people are shooting my dream down, but I also don't want to move there and end up being miserable.

93,"Throwaway account.

I'm a 23 year old dude. I graduated a year ago, and am now working full time in a small software company. For what it's worth, I think I have a lot of upward potential, and could see my compensation go up in coming years. I'd also say that my job isn't extremely secure, like being a nurse or municipal worker, so I'm not ready yet to 'mortgage' against it per se. I'll probably just stay at it permanently, but I would like the flexibility to not be tied down to a long term lease or ownership.

I make 55K a year base, and am expecting to get some bonuses this year to get me close to 60. I'd expect a minor or zero raise next year, but could possibly jump to a bigger company for a decent pay bump if I so choose. I have zero debt from college or otherwise, I stayed in-state and lived at home, got scholarships, and my parents paid for the (entire) rest out of their savings. I live in a moderately high cost of living city, like Denver or Raleigh. By the spring, I figure I'll have about $20K saved.

After my first full year working, I am thinking about moving out. I have lived on my own during study abroad, and thought it was better overall.

1) It was really good for my own development. I cooked healthy foods and kept my place clean. I focused more time on my own betterment. I read a lot and stayed active.

2) Dating. I'm not under the delusion that having some dumpy place (with roommates) will help me get girls. But as I said before, the outward vibe I give off is just different. Plus when I live on my own in an inner-city area there's tons of young women, and I'd get out of the house way more which ties into...

3) Lifestyle. I'd be likely within walking distance of working, as well as all of the major bars. I would plan to volunteer at the cool rec centre in the city's downtown.

But there are also some major downsides I see

1) Roommates. I don't have any close friends that I see as viable roommates (multiple reasons). I could ask around on Facebook or Craigslist groups, but that's a mixed bag. What's the advantage of moving out of my beautiful parents' home, to live with some old dude or weirdo. There's literally 100 things that could go wrong, whether it's an attitude against drinking, etc. I feel like it's pretty tough to find an aligned roommate

2) Affordability. Not sure if I could keep my car if I moved out. A nice place would be about $1300 a month alone, or $700 with a roommate. It just makes things like travelling, playing sports, etc all less feasible when I'm paying for rent. Also, I'm seeing my investment accounts stack up. I figure I could save another 25K next year, where if I move out it will be more like 5K.

I do have a ton of regrets about living at home through college, even though it made fiscal sense. But I'm starting to get hesitations about moving out. What do you guys think?

&amp;#x200B;

From what I've thought about everything started a couple years ago. Shortly after moving to college, my girlfriend at the time was insecure and projected her insecurities on me. Basically every other day she would want to break up because she said I would lose interest or cheat/leave her. But she ended up leaving me for another guy up by her so plot twist there. Naturally that left me pretty messed up and I still have trust issues when it comes to dating. That semester I also failed and the same next semester(I finished the year with a 1.15-ish GPA). I also started drinking around that time to the point where I'd routinely black out on the weekends(I recently got this under control and rarely drink to the point that I lose self control).

When the next year started, my ex got in touch with me saying she wanted to be friends right after her and her boyfriend were going through a rough patch. She did stop talking to me after I called her father when she told me she hadn't eaten in a while and tried to make herself vomit earlier that week. I was still drinking pretty heavily at this point. At the end of that semester I was doing better grade-wise but still was struggling. After the year ended I did manage to get off of academic probation. The summer went decently enough but towards the end me ex reconnected with me and we started talking again. We did actually talk for a while and were pretty good friends. It was interesting because I would tell her that I didn't like when she talked to e about her ex or guys she'd hooked up with. Don't get me wrong most of our conversations went really well, but that would come up from time to time.

However, we stopped talking soon after she started dating another guy and she didn't like that I said I'd understand if she stopped talking to me; after she asked. 

That's basically a run down of the past couple years.

Really I need advice because I put on weight and have confidence and trust issues. I know to go on a diet but finding the motivation has been very difficult for me recently. I want to work on my confidence and trust issues because I want to eb confident so as to not seem boring or uninteresting.

The problem is the mathematics. I have to take remedial math, algebra, because I experienced a disconnect between myself and mathematics around 7-8th grade. I was lost in HS and no one really took the time to sit down and teach me, I didn't know what was going on because I didn't learn what I needed to in order to keep up with the class. I just got left behind.

Anyways, I'm currently in a 7week class that moves 2x as fast as a normal one, and I'm having to use calculators to even make decent grades on my own. I have like 8-9 assignments each week that I have to do, and I have hardly any idea of how to do any of them. The teacher teaches in class, but I'm in the same spot I was in HS. All this did was put me back into an environment that is still ahead of my capabilities. I can do SOME of the work on my own, but I don't think I can pass this class without using calculators that essentially do the work for me.

I don't think I can sit down and learn/recall the formulas on my own. It just doesn't stick for some reason. It's like I can perform a problem and immediately perform it again by switching things out for the new problem, but typically I don't really understand what's going on nor am I able to recall what to do with that type of problem a week or so later. 

The class moves too fast, and quite frankly might even be too far ahead of my skills, for me to learn what I need to learn to actually pass the class completely on my own. Yet, I don't really want to pay more money (loans) to have to retake this class/ the other part of this class (It's a 2 part remedial class) so I'm doing whatever it takes for me to get a good grade, regardless of my ability.

I've always tested very highly in verbal intelligence. My skills within mathematics are severely crippled, however. My CS degree requires me to go up so far as Calculus, and whatever is included in ""mathematics for computer science"".

My reasoning is that if I'm having to use calculators for algebra, I will have to use them for calculus. Ie my own capability without access to calculators will be insufficient to pass calculus.

&amp;#x200B;

I switched to CS, quite frankly, because I do like computers, and I find topics such as virtual reality, neural networks, software engineering, and robotics fascinating. Also, because compared to psychology, the career expectations are quite a bit better. It just seemed like a much more logically sound choice with respects to my future wellbeing. I could switch to IT or IS and not have as much math. That is an option.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Before declaring CS, I was a psychology major. I love psychology. I wanted to do something more biologically oriented with it, such as neuroscience. The only problem is the amount of time I would have to dedicate to school before I seen any real return on my investment in my education. Originally I wanted to be a psychiatrist/neuroscientist. I changed my mind because I realized the amount of debt and time it would take before this major really rewarded me for my effort.  Psychology is much easier for me, and I feel like I could excel in it and possibly contribute something meaningful because I would want to do it less as a""social"" science, and study the more ""hard"" scientific elements of it. I would want to really try and contribute to understanding things such as the brain, personality disorders, neurochemistry, pharmacology, and general human cognition/behavior and the motivations and mechanics by which those things operate in different individuals and populations.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't really know what to do. CS is a lot harder, and I think that would ultimately be a better choice. I think that the difficulty of a program is an indicator of the value of the program, so long as it is actually feasibly doable. I think I can do a CS major, but I am very uncertain as to my ability to perform well in my math classes without essentially having calculators do all the work for me. I just don't seem to be able to do well in math at the moment. It just doesn't click yet, and it's only going to get harder as I continue through my major. This is going to cost me more time and more money. Albeit less than becoming a psychiatrist/psychologist.

I CAN code. I'm fairly certain I can learn how to code decently/possibly even excel in it. What I have covered so far makes sense to me, and the information concerning computers that I've been taught so far make sense. That aspect is understandable to me. I've touched on java fundamentals and HTTP fundamentals. I'm not claiming to know a lot about either of these languages, but I am saying I think I can learn to code proficiently in general with enough time and experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Any input? My heart used to lie in psychology, because I'm fascinated by humans, cognition, patterns, and behavior. However, my head lies in CS because it has reasoned that this is a much more optimal, safe, and rewarding major that will actually train me to have a marketable (and lucrative) skill right out of college while minimizing the debt and time I have to invest before it pays off.

I'm just honestly not sure I can make it through the major because of the math.  I might be able to by using my computer as a tool to do the math for me, but I don't think that's what they expect from me. ",10Feb2019,1
127,"Alright, I don’t even know where to start the story.  About 3 years ago, I met someone that I considered one of my best friends.  I considered us super close, but he started using me.  He would find ways to get money from me.  I didn’t notice that I was being used at the time, but it is clear now.  About one month ago is when I drew the line, he had told me he had some bud and that he would pull up.  I get to his car and he threatened to stab me if I didn’t give him all of my money.  I did so, and then he forced me to leave.  This guy had the audacity to ask if I needed anything the next day.  I jokingly said I’m going to report him (never did) and then blocked him.  He has contacted me multiple times from different peoples social media’s, threatening to beat me up if he ever see me in public and that he will be waiting outside my house.  I made it clear that I didn’t submit shit, but I’m still being threatened.  I don’t want my family involved at all, and I don’t know what I can do.  Nobody else knows about the situation and I don’t want anyone else knowing.  I don’t want to live like this and I don’t know how I can change the situation.

She tells me how she looks cute in everything because of how flat her stomach has gotten. I am genuinely happy that she is happy with her new body and glad her confidence is boosted. But today, she kind of made me feel bad about my weight.

She came over and asked me how much i weigh. When i told her, she said me i couldn't possibly weigh that little, since it was close to her weight. She was in disbelief and pointed to my stomach. That kind of hurt. I dont even think she realised her words hurt me. I just laughed it off but then she told me to prove it, by jumping on a scale. She giggled when she seen i had weighed only 1kg more than i had said. My gutt sank and i had suddenly got a flashback of her pointing to my stomach. I don't blame her for the way i feel, i blame myself. For being insecure about my weight. I need to learn to love myself and my body but i can't.

I was pulling into my university late one night after a late dinner. We noticed a car on one of the smaller roads that were part of the university, but it wasn't just idle. The car was reversing back a couple feet, then driving up to the stop sign repeatedly, back and forth. It was also shining a flashlight through the driver's window on and off, sometimes moving it in circles. Another car pulled up next to it, presumably asking if they needed help, then pulled into the parking lot the stall next to us. The creepy car did it's reversing maneuver again, pulled into a stall for about a minute, then drove off.

I'm a senior in college and this honestly the most difficult class I've had simply because of the instructor and the amount of homework she assigns. 

It's a web design project that she is just having us do the layouts for, no coding. 

Every critique, and we've had 4+ she gives me absolutely no real advice on how to improve my work. For instance, she'll say: 

Her: ""Your type needs a lot of adjustment."" 

Me: ""Can you tell me what exactly needs to be changed about it?""

Her: ""You just need to move things around."" 

Me: ""Like what exactly?""

Her: ""Just try different things.""

Other people in the class have also been complaining that they have no idea what we're supposed to do and that this class alone dominates hours of their time to the point that their other classwork suffers. I'm in the same boat.

135,"Now that I'm older, I'm becoming increasingly more disappointed in my friendships. I'm someone who enjoys the company of others and strives to create positive relationships with my friends. This week was the final straw for me as I came to the realization that I needed better friends in my life.

I am an early planner, according to my friends' standards (someone who plans days in advance so that I have weekend plans). I didn't plan the get together tonight, but my other friend took the initiative and invited my friend and me to his hometown, about a 1.5 hour drive for me, for drinks and food. I was definitely excited because these two friends are two of my closest friends that I have known since I graduated college (about 7 years).

The day before the get together, my other friend backed out because he realized that he forgot he had another event that was planned with his other friend. I was obviously disappointed and expressed my feelings of disappointment. I told him to please not flake on me again, and he responded that he understood. He also said that he was sorry for not letting me know sooner. He was preparing for a presentation for his graduate class the following day so I was sympathetic.

I asked my other friend who invited us if we were still planning to hang out. I was okay with not hanging out since the dynamic would have changed. His girlfriend would also be part of the hangout. I asked him if it was okay with her and he said everything was good. I decided to make earlier plans with another friend from grad school before meeting up with the friend who invited me to his hometown. The friend who invited me confirmed that we will be meeting up at 6.

When I finished catching up with my other friend from grad school, I texted my friend and asked where we were going to hang out 5 minutes before 6pm. He told me to choose, so I chose a place. 5 minutes after 6pm, he texted me back telling me that his girlfriend wasn't feeling well and didn't want to go out so he didn't want to leave her alone. I asked him what was going to happen. He told me that I could head over to his hotel room to hang out, but I felt uncomfortable since his girlfriend wasn't ""feeling well"" and didn't want to go out. I told him that he should've told me before I made the 1.5 hour drive trip out to see him -- now I have to drive 1.5 hours back. It felt worse because he told me this after the time we agreed to meet up.

He said that he ""owes me"" and that if I still wasn't down to go back to his hotel room, he hopes that I can accept his apology. The thing is, he never said sorry.

136,"k so hi this is my first post and i just wanted somewhere anonymous to talk about this. 

im a gay boy in a long distance relationship that im very happy in and have been for almost a year now. before we got together, i started working at a mom and pop pizza shop and have been there for over a year and a half now. i have a coworker, for privacy reasons, ill name him after a wwe superstar, lets call him seth. 

seth is an asshole. has been for the majority of time ive known him. 

seth found out i was gay after my boyfriend at the time, now ex, picked me up from work once. when he found out, he started acting suspiciously nicer to me, but still kept to his asshole ways, including yelling at me for filling up tiny cups of dressings ""the wrong way"". 

after the ex and i broke up, i was a lonely, petty, horny bag of scum. seth had been more and more confidently hitting on me, touching me, and one night shift, while our driver was out on a delivery, seth told me to go into the walk-in freezer with him. you can guess what followed. 

it happened multiple times. i never LIKED liked him, just kind of saw it as ""i need it"" and ""its practice for future usage""....besides, maybe itd make him act nicer to me bc if he yells too much, i wont wanna blow him this week. 

i mean it worked tho so i didnt stop. 

i should also mention that im closer in age to seth's daughters than i am to him. still with me? cool. also he haS (as in still has(as in never left)) a girlfriend. STILL still with me? cool. 

after me and my current bf got together, i stopped with him for obvious reasons. seth didnt like this. he started begging LEGITIMATELY begging me for it. i quote, ""please i really need it"" and not stopping no matter how many times i said no. he eventually let go of it... for that week. it took months for him to stop touching me. by the way, all of this happens in the store. he's talked about wanting to ""pick me up from school one day"" and ""take me to a hotel"" but i super dont feel comfortable being by myself with him. i even bought matching rings for my bf and i, i wear it everyday, everywhere, on my left ring finger. yes, i know thats mega creepy but hi, nice to meet you. i also thought that him seeing it would be like ""damn imma yeet outta here"" but i was wrong. so, so wrong. 

yadda yadda yadda, tonight. tonight was extremely busy. like, busier than we were for the super bowl. tonight was also my longest shift ive worked there, so i was already tired and sick of everything and everybody. in my last hour there, he tells me i should leave my boyfriend. 

me- ""and why's that?""
seth- ""because i wanna be your boyfriend""
me- ""what about your girlfriend? and your girls?""
seth- ""im leaving them""
me- ""youre leaving your girls?""
seth- ""yes""
me- ""as a kid without a dad, that's seriously fucked. i haven't spoken with my father in years, and look how fucked up i am from it. i know it tortures him too. i don't want you or your girls to go through that.""

and i went back to wiping down the tables. not an hour later he tells me that he's in love with me. word for word, in love with me. i dont know what to do anymore. i told him i don't feel the same way and he says ""you dont have to apologize. thats how much i love you. ill wait for you.""

ive been at a loss for words since this happened not even two hours ago. i don't want to tell my boss and get him fired, regardless of how much of a dick he is, i dont want to see any other children lose a father figure over their irresponsible stupid decisions like mine.. and i don't want to quit because it's relatively good money for a relatively easy job. and i get free food.

Leah also has a boyfriend. I'm not sexually interested in her but I generally do nice things for people that I'm friendly with and that has lost me a friend in the recent past. I don't know how to talk with her and her friends more frequently without seeming like I'm coming on to her.

There's this other lady I'll call emma. I worked on a project with her last semester she was cool to talk to but I never was able to befriend her. She recently came up to me in the hallway and we had a brief conversation. She gave me her phone number because of the project we were working on together. I would like to keep talking to her and get to know her better but I have anxiety about jumping out of the blue over text and asking if she'd want to do anything.

The only thing I got wrong was the color of the vehicle. It all happened to fast so I guess I didn’t focus on the color of the car. After I told him what happened and described the vehicle he went to the house and looked at the vehicle and came back and told me it was how I described it just the color was wrong.

More Info (if you want it). 

I'm trying to go out with her again this week, I sent her a text wondering if she wants to go out Valentines day. She said she has school that day (I'm a drop-out, she isn't), and that her and a girlfriend had plans. No biggie. I asked her out tuesday, said it's her moms birthday. Again, no biggie. But she isn't rescheduling, she's said nothing. That's usually a bad sign right? But on our last date (the makeout one), she said she really wants to go out again.

What I'm thinking of doing: 

Slow the texting to a halt until she asks me out or our non existent relationship peters out. Or conversely, on our next date (if it happens) bring up the relationship thing, say what I want, then if she still doesn't know, I'll tell her to call me when she figures it out. Both cases suck because I really like this girl, and want to talk to her more.

He’s moving out to a city 3 hours away from me in 4 months so that makes this time we spend together all the more special but my mom hates how his parents think we’re going to this hotel for a romantic night of having sex. I also can’t just go without her permission because she’s threatened to go tell them the truth and knows where they live.

151,"Why?

I love you more than words can describe. Your thoughtfulness and compassion overfills me with joy. But a lingering thought in the back of my head is always there ready to run rampant through my thoughts: Why?  I struggled for quite a while now to subdue these thoughts. Thoughts of you with other men. How you moaned in pleasure with them. How you touched them the way you touch me. It becomes hard to see what it is that I can offer you. Or  will even I measure up. I sometimes wonder, but never pry you for an answer, what did it feel like to lose your virginity to someone else? What did it feel like when that relationship ended? Where did you go from there? How many men were you with since then. And what were the thoughts going through your head as you continued moving from one to the other? I try to recollect the opportunities that I had to have sex with a previous girlfriend or random encounter just to try to equal the score. But I never went through with it. I waited for marriage. I waited for the one to give myself to. But you didn't. You didn't wait for me. You gave herself to other men. And it tortures every fiber of my being. I want to forgive. I want to forget.

This is long, so TLDR at the end. 

My (15M) high school is incredibly large, and therefore has a shit ton of clubs and sports. I think it has around 210 clubs, 22 sports for boys, and around the same for girls. (also has about 4k students) I want to try men's gymnastics as a spring sport, not because I think I'd be super good at it, but for a number of reasons. I haven't brought it up yet, but I'm 95% sure my dad will say no.

A bit of background info: I have not had a good history with grades, with last year and this year shakily getting better, but still not good. (My school is getting rid of the standard grading system, and instead implementing Evidence Based Reporting (basically 1 is and F, 4 is and A+) so it's hard to tell, but I'm probably a low B student.) I tried joining Wrestling about 3 months ago, but I didn't even make it one week before they (parents) made me quit. 

I brought it up with my mom, and she said that I should go to the info meeting this Monday, not tell my dad, figure out if it has a good schedule, all that stuff, and if I get a good grade on my math test this week, we'll talk to my dad to let me join gymnastics. 2 main problems: The smaller one is that I'm bad at taking tests, and it's really hard for them to wrap their head around the new grading system, especially if they don't try.

The bigger problem is that even though I'm sure that my dad will let me join, I'm 100% sure that he'll pull me out after a week when he sees that my grades haven't magically risen in that amount of time.

To clarify, my main arguments to let me join are that an after-school sport will teach me time management skills, increase my muscle (I'm skinny and underweight) and give me opportunities to make new friends. He has it set in his mind that because his yelling hasn't motivated me, nothing will, so as a result I need as much of an empty schedule as possible to make sure that I get my work done. To be honest, if I wanted to, I could easily get my work done in 3 hours instead of 8, but I don't want to, and I have a youtube/ Netflix addiction that I also think gymnastics will get rid of. I have read countless amounts of articles on how when a person has less time, they do work faster, and I've done that same thing for the week that I had wrestling. I have done my work pretty fast for a couple weeks, but then I stopped bc I was lazy, and once I finished I had nothing to do bc I had close to no friends (another thing I hope that a sport will fix).

How do I convince my dad to let me do sports and do more stuff?


TL;DR:
I go to a very large school with good opportunities, and I want to try gymnastics, (no cut, haven't tryed before) for a lot of healthy reasons. I think my dad won't let me. I don't have a good history with grades, nor commitment. I don't think my dad will let me join or stay in the sport, bc he will think that no good changes in my grades means that the fact that I can do a lot of work. In little time means I need more time in my schedule.

153,"So my friend (let's call him A) had sex with my other friend (B)'s girlfriend. We were all pretty tight and hung out pretty much every day, including A, B, and B's girlfriend. However, B and his girl had some problems so they relied on A for relationship advice. As a bit of time passed, B's girlfriend started to feel more compatible with A and with a bit of alcohol involved they crossed the line and cheated on B a few times. B found out, broke up with his girlfriend and stopped talking to A.

I was originally closer to A, so I tried to understand it from his situation and he seemed to realize what a terrible person he was and sought out religion to become a better person. Since everyone makes bad decisions, including myself, I thought I should help him during his reformation. Meanwhile, B quickly forgave his girl but refused to forgive A.

But a bit more time has passed now, and A still refuses to apologizes to B and there has been no apparent change in his morals. I got really disappointed in A and his unwillingness to face his mistakes since I believe that the only way to truly change is to start by fixing past mistakes. I have now given up on his ""reformation"" and no longer talk to A.

162,"There’s a lot of backstory to it but I’m going to try and sum it up as easy as possible so I can get to the root of how I feel and how to continue on.. for people who have experienced this in some way or another, please respond. 

Been married to my to my wife for over a year, total time together is 3 years. Currently pregnant with our first child together, I have a son from a previous relationship who I have custody over and we have been living as a family unit for just about 2.5 years. 

Summer of 2018 I had begun to feel distant from my wife and to all my efforts, nothing brought us back to that love that brought us together in the first place. Every nice thing I did, was met with criticism. Any quality time I tried to give, was never enough or never wanted so any GOOD quality time that was had, in the end failed because we ended up fighting. Sex had come to a complete standstill. I had start feeling happy when working late because I knew it was better than coming home to her... I just was so mentally broken and exhausted people. Like I had thought I experienced my breaking points before but wow, this FAR surpassed anything. Well, I had reached it mid November and asked for a break. Something for me to rejuvenate and find a way to find myself again. Make myself happy. Fill my empty cup back up. Well it went into full blown drama and ended up wanting to divorce. 

Now I’m not here to press religion or anything but this is how I experienced this and this is no lie. It was a Thursday night mid December. She and I agreed that it was best to tell my son what was going on and that his step mom and I were separating to try to make ourselves happy and to see if being together is the right thing to do. I then helped her pack her car and she was off to drive to her parents house the next state over. Well, I broke down and cried and yelled. I felt so confused over being so angry at the woman I loved and how I felt like a failure and cried out to God to just give me a sign. Something to show me what I should do. And just as I finished that sentence she texted me saying she forgot her wallet on the counter and if I’d walk outside and give it to her.. 

Well I took that as a sign and the next day told her not to leave and that I wanted to go back to our counselor (we had seen this counselor a few times before but stopped going because she was “siding with me”) to give it a 100% effort on both of us to make this work. Fast forward to after the new year and one of her family members had a health situation and wanted to spend some time to help her family and to be there for them. At this time we had seen the counselor twice and literally had our flame back. I felt comfortable that we could sustain it said absolutely that she should go and be there while I hold down the fort. Well she comes back at the end of January and for the most part we were exactly how we left it and sustained this momentum long distance. About 2 days after her return we had a catastrophic meltdown... reverted back to exactly how things were in November... now it’s the second week into February and I’m exactly in the same shoes as I was last summer. I feel depressed, overwhelmed, hopeless, drained.. like fuck dude. Right back where I was and I just feel even more lost than before..

Just found out my significant other is on FetLife and I feel so betrayed. I've never been an intrusive girlfriend, EVER. But when I came across not only a different email that he has stored in his phone, but also an email that says ""New message on Fetlife""? My heart sank opening it. The message was from months ago but still. I know exactly what the site is and what it's for. 

He told me when we began dating it was only a brief thing, he didn't really pay it much attention, etc. But I come to find emails between a man where he (bf) states he is not gay but has always wanted to feel the real thing? He messaged this guy first. 8 months ago.  Nothing after the guy told him to come down and see for himself. Not to mention his bio is incredibly detailed. So how the fuck is that ""brief""??? He even had notifications dating back only 3 months ago that XYZ accepted your friend request. No active messages past 8 months ago BUT he told me way back when we became sexually open with each other, and I quote, ""I was always really worried that my fantasies and what I like somehow made me different. But I realized that's not the case, I just like butt play"". We started dating in September. 5 months ago and by all accounts we have laid EVERYTHING on the table no matter the shame associated with it. And now I feel like its not the case. So now I am stuck wondering is he on this behind my back? Browsing? Closeted? Do I now have to worry about his sexuality being truthful? Am I just a fucking cover up? I have never been a judgmental person in my entire life. But I have been in situations finding out that potential partners were bi, and I couldn't bring myself to move forward with it. I tried so hard and I just couldn't. Sexual stimulation preference is one thing but romantic and sexual attraction is a completely different thing. 

I just feel betrayed. I feel hurt. I feel like my gut has been ripped apart. And I feel like my reaction is justified. Lying by omission is still lying to me, in my eyes.  Not only did he know his response by saying his ""fetlife period"" was very brief, nothing to it, was a lie - but is still trying to justify it after I bring it up. 

Help? What do I do? I am heartbroken right now.

173,"So right now I honest to goodness feel like my life is going to implode in on itself. I’m only 17, so I know people, especially older people, are going to think I am being dramatic, and I probably am. But, right now in my life I feel so trapped, and I can’t talk to anyone in my real life about it, so I might as well confide in strangers on the internet. Honestly anything would help right now. Also btw this is just going to be a 17 year old girl bitching about her problems, so probably not a very interesting read haha. 

I do not even know how to begin. Let’s just start with some basic background information. I am currently a senior in high school due to graduate in May. I have basically lived my entire life with basically different degrees of anxiety and depression, and for the last 2 years I have been struggling with an eating disorder. I have also recently come to the conclusion that I think my household is extremely toxic and that might have contributed to my issues. My dad has anger issues. He has never put a finger on me, but I have a lot of vivid memories from since I was a kid of me running to my room and crying myself to sleep after him screaming at me for god knows what. He has gotten better, but now that I’m even older we fight a lot. I just want him to respect me, but I feel like my opinions and my feelings never matter. It’s only ever about him. He hates being late so if I’m making him late I get screamed at. Fast forward to the next week, he’s now making me late. I tell him we need to get going and he just tells me to not be in such a rush. I will say something along the lines of hey remember last week when you were upset how we were going to be late... well that how’s I feel right now... Him: DONT YOU DARE SAY ITS THE SAME THING. I just am always getting undermined and belittled. When he gets mad, he looses control. He can’t stop. Just yesterday I told him that he can yell at me later but if I dont to leave now I will go to school crying. He didn’t stop and I got to school late and crying. My mom is emotionless so to speak. You will not get any sympathy from her. I can’t tell her when I’m upset I fear judgement. She’ll laugh at me when I’m upset or angry. She doesn’t have any time for me. I know I’m practically an adult now but I still want my mom you know. I don’t get but five minutes with her a day, and even then she’s on her phone. It’s been like that with her also for as long as I can remember. I’m never a priority it feels like. I’m always last in her mind. They have never been supportive about my issues. Whenever I would have panic attacks they would just get mad and tell me to get over it. How I will never survive in the real world. They will yell and scream at me for not being able to do something they can do so easily. It hurts knowing they think I’m incapable because of something i can’t control. They know very little about my eating disorder and depression. They never bother to ask and I don’t feel to keen on sharing. But that causes me to bottle it up. My depression has gotten really bad over the last few years. It’s hard to shower, change my clothes, get out of bed etc. I know it’s gross but it’s just so overwhelming sometimes. Since I can’t confide with my parents, I want to confide to with my friends but my friends don’t know the real me that well. They know this fake image I put on and the limits of us hanging out are school and work. Not exactly BFFs. I just can’t text them out of the blue saying “Hey! I really just want to kill myself today!” But I do this for a reason. I have a hard time forming interpersonal relationships. I don’t want people to get to know me out of fear that they will reject me and laugh in my face. But yeah that’s the background... might as well be the whole novel. 
I decided that for college I wanted to go somewhere as far away from my home as possible. I did all this research and planned all this stuff, but everyone in my life told me I couldn’t do it. They told me I would fail and I started to believe them but I still kept pushing. I got to jobs and was rarely home. With me no longer being home, the fighting and yelling stopped. My mom not being there didn’t matter because I wasn’t there either. However with the stress of two jobs and senior year looming over me my various disorders started getting really bad. (Another piece of context I was a straight A student until my junior year when my ed and depression got really bad, and through a teachers help I was able to get my F to a B, which may seem good but my mom acted like I was a failure) I got a C in a science class. I felt like I had ruined my life. I didn’t eat for a week. I cried myself to sleep. Unable to tell anyone of my great shame looming over me. I completely gave up on my dream of that university. Why would they want someone as awful as me? With my C, I decided that I was instead going to take a year off and work. Though, a part of me knew that I just wasn’t going to eat until I was dead. But then for some unknown reason, my life started picking up again. I was happier and my bosses were telling me what a good job I was doing and giving me all sorts of amazing new tasks. It was amazing. Finally, I was doing right by someone! Fast forward to two weeks ago, and why I’m writing this now. 

I got a text from my boss at my secondary job. I had made a terrible error. He was very mad at me, and gave me this long lecture. I apologized. I was having a panic attack the entire time and for days after and the next day it got even worse. I was at my primary job. I got called into my bosses office and she told me that I had been making a bunch of mistakes. There’s more to what she said but this post is long enough. Basically, I am on the verge of being fired of both of my jobs. I thought I was doing well. No one told me about my mistakes. I didn’t know other wise I would’ve fixed it. This sent me into an extreme downward spiral. I’ve been binging and purging. Can’t get  up. Sick all the time. Constantly feeling like the world is going to end. Can’t focus. This is causing me to make even more stupid mistakes. I’m going to get fired. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’m stuck in my house. I’m going to loose my jobs. I don’t have any friends. My parents feel burdened by me. Some days I feel like they wish they never even had me. They aren’t bad people. They are also a byproduct of their parents. I just don’t know what to do. Please If someone could just give me any advice I would appreciate it.

Then she made a point that she can't use one of my pieces of advices because it's 11:30 at night and most people are either sleeping or out and about. The rest of wallowing in negativity like me. But she said she didn't mean to come off as rude and said sorry if it did.

I thought it was bitchy and honestly, it made me feel so much worse. I felt like I was being a burden to her and was wondering if I'm tiring out. She said i wasn't upsetting her. Then she stopped responding. I think I pissed her off and I feel really guilty about it. What do I do?",10Feb2019,1

181,"Hi I'm a 20 year old female and I am having some trouble I guess. Ive always had pretty bad anxiety and am really shy. I haven't had any real life friends in about three years(literally 0) and Im getting tired. I don't understand, I'm out and about busy most of the time and interact with a lot of people throughout each day, but people still don't seem to like me or want to be my friend. I know not only from being confident in myself, but also being told all the time that I'm really pretty cool, funny, and nice, that makes me sound like an arrogant bih but the point is that I'm all those things, confident, not mousy(i.e small talk to people, look them in the eye, make myself heard, etc.) and yet I still have no friends. This may sound stupid and probably the reason I don't have any friends but honestly I figured by now someone would approach me or invite me or initiate things, bc as I said before I'm really shy and so I am really bad at approaching and initiating. That being said, I tell myself to step out of my comfort zone all the time and  most if the time I'm the one who starts the small talk hoping the other person will also want a friend and we would take it from there, but people just don't seem to want to talk to me. Idk I'm doing everything Google says but I stay being forever alone. I hear I'm eating my youth away bc I don't do anything fun really but I don't have any friends to do nothing fun with.

187,"21 (F) I've always hated birthdays. Even as a kid I'd feel that twinge of anxiety when the cake was coming my way and the older I've gotten, my disdain for them hasn't gone away. As I was growing up I didn't have any friends and would have no one to invite to a party so I'd just have dinner with my parents, a lonely but nice affair (as parties in my 'honour' don't sit right with me) and now I've grown older, I've found myself a lovely group of friends whom I live with and one of them has the same birthday as me. I've been friends with them for a couple of years now and my shared birthdays haven't been a success (one year an ex 'friend' started an argument with me for no reason and the next year me and my best friend argued) and this has just further pushed my disdain for the day and this year I'm frankly dreading it. I know it's assumed there will be a joint celebration between me and my friend, like there has been the last two years, but all I want to do on my birthday is just stay in and watch a couple of movies with some food. I want my friend to have a good time and celebrate her birthday how she wants and I don't want my baggage with the day to effect that- but I also really want to spend this year celebrating my birthday how I want. I'm really stuck at want to do, any advice?


TDLR; Me and my best friend celebrate our birthday on the same day, I know it'll be assumed that we celebrate it together, but with my own personal baggage with the day I just want to chill and relax- but also I want my friend to celebrate her day to the fullest and how she wants. ",10Feb2019,1
188,"I already posted this on r/family but not many people reply on those treads.

So my parents are Asian immigrants. I love my mom very much, and would give my life for her. But just like your typical Asian parent, she complains about a lot of stuff I do or don’t do. (For those of you who don’t know, in the Asian community, we have 2 types of parents. The first always praises their children to other people, and the second one complains about their children to other parents. My mom is the latter) Now my mom does so much for me, and she is the most generous person ever, and she’ll do anything for anyone. 

However, I really dislike her best friend. I would use hate, but I feel like I’d rather not put any of my energy on her. This lady is the most pathetic women I have ever met. She always asks favors from my mom, and constantly complains about how her life is this way or that way. She continues to praise her son, even though he doesn’t give a crap about her and only cares about his wife (he basically got married to an extremely rude, obnoxious girl, but that’s another long story). 

Now here’s the part that bothers me. She’s constantly calling my mom and wasting her time. My mom is a busy women and actually takes initiative in her life and works for long hours. This lady however, does nothing, and never bothers to try to do anything. She won’t even learn to drive, and asks my mom to take her to places. She talks crap about other people, but when people talk about her, she gets shook. I’ve told my mom several times that she just asks for favors and is somewhat toxic, but my mom is too nice. Now I believe everyone has good qualities, and since she’s my mom’s best friend, my mom must now about her good side more than I do. 

This is what the title is about. So the other day our family had visited someone who had a grand child, and we had to pick up her friend. We get to the house, and me, my mom and sisters, and her friend were sitting in the living room. Everyone was casually talking and I didn’t really care that she was there. Then this lady has the nerve to say to me and my little sister, “Why do you both annoy your mom so much?” I was playing with the baby and I wasn’t paying attention, so I didn’t hear her. Then, my older sister quickly came to my defense and said, “They don’t annoy her, everyone else does.” My older sister basically implied that my mom’s friend annoyed her the most. 

I didn’t know that this happened until we got home and my older sister told me. Now the reason I’m upset is because this lady had the audacity to say this to someone who she’s not related too, and when her own daughter and son act like cruddy people. I was more upset at my mom though, who didn’t say anything to back to her. It was also partially my moms too, because if she didn’t complain to her about us, her friend might’ve not said anything in the first place. I told my mom about how I felt, and she just said “she must’ve been joking”. 

My mom gives her the benefit of the doubt, which really pisses my off, when she basically insulted me and told me that I’m annoying. I’m an adult, and I’m not close to her, so she has no right to say anything that involves my family, no matter how close she thinks she is to my mom.

I basically wanted to let this out and know your opinions. Do you think I’m overreacting? I can understand that my mom wouldn’t want to make it a big deal, but should she had something?

TLDR: My mom’s friend said I annoyed my mom, when she knows nothing about me or my life, and my mom just said she was probably joking and didn’t defend me.",10Feb2019,1
189,"Hello, I'm a young mom with a 10 month old baby. He's an absolute angel %80 of the time and has truly changed my life for the better. 

Back in August we discovered we were expecting but I had recently gone through a gall bladder surgery, was bed ridden, and we were struggling pretty hard financially. We ended up getting an abortion and it hit me pretty hard, but I knew it just wasnt the right time at all. 

Here we are expecting yet again and I honestly was pretty excited when I saw the results.

We're doing extremely well financially, settled into our home, our son is doing great and is ahead of schedule with growth. He knows over 40 words and is simply doing great. 

My fiance when he discovered I was seriously pregnant and wanted to keep it then went silent for awhile. A few days later broke down crying and told me he simply wasnt ready for another child. Is there ever really a time you'll be ""ready""? I know we didnt think we were with our first.

I don't think I can go through with another surgery.. the first brought me so much guilt and I honestly think I would spiral into depression again if we did go that route. 

Is there any advice on how to get ready for a second child or atleast ease my fiance's fears.. 

PSA: I know we should just keep it in our pants. Not going to go into excuses about that. Nor am I going into the pro life fight. I only want advice or I guess opinions on the situation, not on abortion.

192,"I got a text at about 8:00 PM tonight from my mom, telling me that she was cleaning my younger sister's room (she's 12-13) and she found a diary that my sister had been writing in. She admitted to cutting and being extremely depressed, and at some point they found out that she has been thinking of ways to commit suicide. I'm assuming my mom freaked out, and she was getting ready to take my sister to a children's hospital nearby when she saw that my sister had gone into the bathroom and cut her arm up with some blade. They're at the hospital right now, and my mom just told me that when they were coming in, the security guy found a blade hidden in her phone case. She is being considered ""high risk"" and they have found cuts all over her arms and thighs. She won't talk to my parents at all really, right now. My mom thinks she's going to be committed to the psych ward at the children's hospital for a few days.

She has one friend, who has apparently been calling her a ""fat cow"" among other things. She is very isolated, and stays in her room almost all day unless she's out in the living room playing Roblox. She's been dealing with some other stressful shit--a while ago, we found out that one of the neighborhood kids she was playing with was forcing her to sign up to porn sites on her phone (!) and another neighborhood kid she's closer with told her that this girl made her little brother masturbate in front of her. We recently found out our old dog has cancer and may only live for a few more months, and we had to put down another family dog last year for a different type of cancer (she didn't want to come to the vet when we had to put him down, and she didn't really talk about it afterwards). She really doesn't do much other than play video games, watch videos on her iPad, and create videos of her toys on YouTube. I thought she may have had depression a while ago (she has a really messy room, is super isolated, etc.--stuff I did back when my depression got really bad) but because of her age and because she seemed to be doing okay otherwise I dismissed the idea. 

I'm sitting in bed right now, shaking a little bit, completely unable to sleep or calm myself down. What do I tell my mother? What do I tell my sister? What do we do going forward? I am away at college right now, an hour away. I have zero experience with any of this and I'm kind of at a loss.

On 20 December, I sent a package to my new address. I was moving overseas and would have put the items in my check-in luggage except they were too heavy. I sent the items via media mail. I made the mistake of, along with the 30 pounds of books, putting a blanket in as well. Mid-January, a package with the tracking number arrives, but it was a repacked package and only contained the blanket. I have no way of tracking the missing items as the tracking number says ""Delivered"". I also don't have insurance on the package; I didn't know insurance was a thing for mail (I rarely mail stuff physically), was not offered the option, and also read that media mail can't be insured anyway.

I immediately started making calls to the Memphis Distribution Center (where the sticker said the package was rewrapped and repacked). They said they can't help me since the tracking number says delivered and that all I can do is put a claim into my local post office. I plan to do this, but I also want to know if there's anything else I can do. I'm to the point where I'm going to start trying to track the exact path of the package by calling each stop along the route. This is driving me insane, not just for the fact that I'm missing almost 30 pounds of books, but also because I don't know what happened to them, and 30 pounds of books doesn't just evaporate.

198,"Hey there! Obligatory wrong-sub-delete-post. 

I’m 21M. I was with someone for 5 years. She was a really amazing person. She and I met in school and hit it off. We worked through a lot of stuff, like inability to see each other every day and arguments and things like that, silly stuff that couples work through before they’re adults. We were together until the very end of 2017. I’m talking like right before Christmas. 

The reason why we broke up, well, it’s a few of them. I felt like she wasn’t being as thoughtful and considerate of me and my problems. Not only that, but she also started seeing another guy. Everything that had to do with sex she was doing with him. She told me about how they make out when she goes to his place. She cried a lot, and apologized. I tried to make it work. She told me that she would try too. But every day I saw her (when she wasn’t with him), she would say things like how she needed more than one person to love, and how she needed to be polygamous. I mean it was constant. We would hang out every week and each time she saw me she would ask me if I gave polygamy any thought. 

I’ve got nothing against polygamists. You do you. But when she told me about this and pestered me about it, I broke down. Years of how she told me she only wanted me and how I worked mentally and emotionally for both of our sakes all felt like it was flushed down the toilet in an instant. It hurt. It hurt like hell. I wasn’t myself for weeks. When I was at my work, I would break down every hour or so crying and wondering what I did wrong, why I did this, and why this was happening to me. 

I broke it off. 

She was understanding. I’m glad she was. And there weren’t waterworks when we saw each other last. Just emptiness and a hug. That was the last time I saw her in person. 

Since then, I’ve grown as a person. I have a better handle on my insecurities and emotions, I have a newfound pool of confidence to eventually drain, and I am so much more social of a person than I was before. I feel great, some of the time. 

Something still bothers me. Whenever I see her on social media or pictures I have of her still, it breaks my heart. I remember what I felt then and how it affected me. I still feel affected. I live in the same town too, so it’s very likely that I’ll see her again.

I’m with someone new now, we’ve been dating for almost a year now. And she is so great. 

But my main point of posting this here is to ask advice. How do others get over your exes? I know I’m not in love with her anymore, and I can hardly stand the sight of her now. I just need something to hold on to when I start falling down the deep hole of despair when I inevitably see her again. 

Again, if this isn’t the right sub (or if there’s a glaring issue in how I wrote this) then please tell me and it’ll be fixed in a snap.

202,"So I play online MMO and was part of a guild. Found a member of the team in pvp after a small fight, and jokingly tbagged her. I sent her a lighthearted message through our group chat, which I had also sent to other members before. She absolutely flipped out and tried to get me kicked from the group. I was confused and was asking what the issue was, it was a joke, it's no big deal, etc.  Other members of the group threatened to get *her* kicked is she didn't cool down. Losing a fight in this game is a very minor problem and has little affect on the player. I didn't report her, since none were severe enough and I was honestly stunned that someone I had run with for several months would act like this. We were a tight group and did this to each other regularly. I really want to emphasize that this was a completely normal thing between our guild, and she was aware of it. She later left on her own, after multiple members had come to dislike her for similar issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward, I didn't encounter her in pvp for a very long time, but recently joined a new guild she happened to be part of. Once more, we fight in pvp, she dies very quickly. She instantly starts attacking me in discord, demoting me (she can't kick) and being an all around terrible person. Discord is super lax about harassment, and since the previous toxicity was through another platform, nothing can be done. I denied one insult (she stated something odd as a fact, and literally only said ""Uh, no I'm not?"", and nothing more. She refuses to leave me alone, with the odd threats and constant insults, and keeps demoting. I want to be part of this discord, but she absolutely will not leave me alone. The demoting is affecting what I can/can't see and the head of the group doesn't see the problem. I'm new to this team and don't have as much sway. The person who invited me always re-promotes me but since she won't relent it's not a perfect solution.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really sure what to do. I shouldn't have to leave a discord because one member is absolutely toxic, not to mention it'd feel like she's winning. Since it's between two platforms it's harder to fight. Not to mention, she knows how to reach me through even more. I had to use a throwaway account since my main is the same as my in game name. I play pvp with my friends who have no connection to her, and now her group specifically targets me. My friends shouldn't have to stop what they enjoy because one member has a target on their back. I don't know what to do or where to go. I'm already struggling with recently diagnosed anxiety and have yet to get any treatment, and this was originally an outlet to release some of my energy. Now, it's making the problem worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I leave? Message someone else who has a high rank? Report her through the game? She refuses to speak to me in game, only through discord so I don't have chat logs to use. I'm heartbroken that a joke between a team has resulted in my group and I being targeted through the game and discord.",10Feb2019,1
203,"I used to go to a friendly elementary school because I grew up with those kids. Around 4 grade, my family moved to a different house and  I went to another elementary school. Immediately I was rejected by my classmates and that went onto 5th grade.

In 5th grade, a girl in the class made fun of the way my shoes smell because I stepped in a rain puddle and it gives off that nasty smell. My family was poor so at that time I couldn’t afford new shoes. I was made fun of near the end of the year. Two things I will always remember is 1) every morning i tried to rub deodorant in my shoes before school to mask the smell and put paper towels in them. 2) the class was practicing for our graduation song and i was standing on the 2nd layer (whatever thats called), a girl made a comment of “ew i smell something nasty” referencing me and i was embarrassed so i moved away from everyone. 

Moving into middle school my elementary teacher said don’t worry things will get better. I don’t want to make this story long but verbal became physical bullying from the guys. I couldn’t make any friends and I always hid on the lowest building floor to eat lunch away from kids. But whenever i can muster up strength to sit at a table i attempt so even knowing they don’t like me. Someone made a joke by calling me fish face (im asian male) and that nickname stuck with me. 

High school it was less physical but more verbal from the girls back in elementary and middle school. Like a clique of girls. They made fun of me with fish face again and saying ew something smells like fish.

I try to avoid school everyday or hid in parts of the building that i knew i would be safe. Eventually i dropped out. I mustered up strength to attend a local community college and i thought it would be the same. To my surprise it wasn’t because no one cares or more open minded. 

I took on leadership positions that require more mingling. I observe how others talk and you guys seem so natural. My gf is also nice and everyone loves her. But i give off a bad vibe is what ive been told. 

But my issue is not being to hold normal conversations and get extremely uncomfortable looking at people in the eyes with the fear of judgement. I was looking into options and didn’t want to do therapy (broke) or believe in those anti depressant pills. Because i believe im strong enough without those.

So about an hour ago my good irl friend reached out to me on discord and told me he had concerns about my living situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basic gist of it is he's concerned about how I'm living with only my mother whom isn't in the house very often (I'm 17 and I'm attending high school, grade 11). She works a lot, usually travelling for her she does work for major events and festivals, usually managing staff. Not only that we also move house a lot (actually getting ready to move again after about 3 months) 

This was a bit confronting because he accused my mother of being an escort and or drug abuser which I found quite distasteful and rude. But disregarding that he asked me if I wanted to come live with him and his family instead. telling me ""You'll be surrounded by a caring family and have a stable home"". 

I don't really know what to say, but I would be lying if I said I didn't wish I had more company. My mother has complex PTSD and refuses to have connections to any parts of our family and my father is out of the picture for good. She can have episodes and take it out on me when she is home. But I still love her regardless, I would feel so guilty to leave her all by herself if I took up my friend's offer. But I don't know whats better for me to do? I also feel like it would be selfish to just up and leave my mother after all we've been through, but I just really don't know what's the best option here.

208,"I have bulimia.

I live in the dorms, my room is laid out so that there are two bedrooms sharing one bathroom. I share the room with a close friend who is also my roommate. She left for the weekend on a trip to Florida. So (regretfully) I took the opportunity to eat a hearty lunch then throw it up right after. I usually go back to my parents house on the weekends for work, and so I left soon after. Apparently I forgot to clean up. I didn’t flush the toilet or something... I’m really not sure. But she got back tonight and she texted me “hey, what happened to the bathroom?”. And it dawned upon me what I had done... I forgot to hide my mess.

I’m feeling so ashamed right now. I sent my roommate a lengthy text apologizing for my disorder. And she said it was okay, I shouldn’t apologize and that if I ever needed support, she would be there.

But I know that’s just a nice respond. Who actually wants to share a room with a bulimic girl? No one. It’s disgusting and gross and I’m a mess. I feel so embarrassed. I hate myself right now. I know she’s a clean a clean freak so that fact that I’ve been vomiting in her toilet must be such a disturbing thing to find out. That and she has to spend the night near a bathroom that probably reeks of my throw up. 


I don’t wanna go back tomorrow and face her. I am so ashamed.

I didn’t like my major and I was at a liberal arts school which bothered the hell out of me because I was a nursing major at the time.

I transferred to a community college to rebuild my gpa (it was 1.8 when I dropped out, all those F’s from incomplete classes killed me) and got accepted to a much cheaper state school (closer to home so I chose to commute, it saved me about 15 grand) and I’m now studying chemistry. 

I can’t help but feel that education at other universities are better because I get shit on by people whenever I say where I go to school and what research I’m doing. 

I want to transfer to another school, somewhere more prestigious because well I have the gpa to do it now (3.81) that I’m not taking one off weird electives like archeology. Although I’m probably doing it so I can just get away from home and can’t help but feel I’ll screw up again and end up with a horrible gpa again.

214,"This is my first post so please forgive me if I use this incorrectly. I [17F] broke up with my long distance [18M] boyfriend of over a year a few days ago and I cant stop thinking of him and i dont know why. He constantly treated me poorly and i think he was also becoming manipulative. It all started with the usual him acting upset for days on end and having dry conversations. He never stait up tells me why hes upset. It would always end with us getting in an argument started by me over how he wont talk to me about his emotions but ending with him blerting out whats wrong at the last minute in turn making me feel like an ass. This last time he said he was just tired of being alone only after 3 days of dry conversations and passive aggressive comments. It feels like we have that same fight at least once or twice a week so i finally told him i didnt want to be in a relationship with someone who cant talk to me about how they feel. Thats when he got really pissed and started saying this like i probably had my ""guy friends"" lined up anyways and that i was probably with someone the whole time. He never apologized and we haven't spoke since. I hate the fact that i miss him, cry thinking about him, and wonder whether he misses me or regrets what he said. I hate how i want him to feel as awful as i as i do and know how hurt i am. I feel like that makes me a bad person to want him to feel the same way. I know the ""him"" i miss isnt who he actually was. I know i miss the person i wanted him to be. I know that if he missed me the way i want him to hed show it by now. So why does it hury this much? He was an ass. Yes we had some good times but we both knew that they were starting to get few and far between. I think its also worth mentioning that anytime the subject of us splitting up came up hed say stuff like he'd be better off dead or something along those lines. I know thats one of the reasons i stuck around so long. I was afraid he was going to hurt himself i also didnt and still dont think i deserve or could find better. I have a lot of anxiety and family issues that i think also affected the relationship. I see similarities between our relationship and my parents. Who i dont think should've ever been together. I dont want to be like my parents. Their relationship is okay at best. I cant go to family over this. I never told my family about the relationship for fear that they wouldn't allow it because the truth is we've never physically met. We texted for over a year before we actually ""dated"". I know im not gonna find a perfect price charming or whatever but i just want to be happy with someone one day. I know im young and boys are stupid and i should be more concerned with school. I just dont know how to cope with this and get over him. I dont have many friends and again i cant tell my family. Theres no point in telling them now and id probably get in trouble anyways.

215,"I think some background is first needed for people to understand the situation better.

So this house, not too big, not too small, has been in the possession of some member of my family for almost a century now. Countless memories and events have happened in that house, so needless to say it has sentimental value for (almost) everyone. Hell, my grandpa (my dad's dad and all references to grandparents will be to my dad's parents) was born in, and died in, that house (in the exact same room, no less). 

 I know somebody has had it for a century now, but here is the timeline of its ownership that I remember it. My grandparents moved into it, and then two or three years later moved out of it and sold it to my uncle (dad's younger brother) and his then-fiance, who is now the aunt in question. A couple of years after that, my grandparents came back to it and remained there for four years. 

It was at this point that I have the most memories of the house. I spent countless days in the summer there for those four years; practically living there in the summertime. 

Then, grandpa died at 75. Grandma (73 at the time) stayed there for a few more months but eventually transferred ownership of it back to her youngest and moved in with my other uncle (dad's *older* brother). My younger uncle, though, leased it to my cousin (oldest brother's son) for a few years but eventually returned to it all the same, where they are up to this day. 

Now, however, things are starting to change. My young uncle and aunt are about to be empty nesters in June. Now this aunt, unlike my mom and other aunt, has never really ""clicked"" into the family. She's pleasant enough and is far from mean, but she's always been more uptight than the rest of us; you can tell when something is her idea basically. She's the one, to use an old phrase, wearing the pants in the marriage, too, as my young uncle is a rather weak-willed and submissive man, especially compared to his more assertive (but by no means mean) brothers. Meanwhile, grandma (now almost 80), is alive and well and still entirely ""there,"" but has basically relinquished, for lack of a better word, authority to my old uncle and my dad (who, by the way, chose to jointly inherit the vacation house when grandpa died instead of the house in question, hence why they don't have much of a say in what I'm about to tell you). 

Turns out, as we were planning her 80th birthday party, my aunt mentions that she can't stand the location of the house and wants to sell it after her and my uncle's daughter moves out for college this fall. I mentioned that that shouldn't be a problem as there are plenty of family members that may want to move into it (a lot of my cousins are just starting to get our footing with a stable adult life, but I'm not among them quite yet and won't be until I finish college in about two or three years). But she specifically then said that that probably won't happen; that she wants to sell it to someone outside the family. That was the end of the conversation, but everyone could tell that everyone wasn't exactly happy at the situation. 

I, however, was probably the angriest of everyone when my young aunt and uncle left the room briefly. I never really expected her, as an outsider-turned-in-law, to fully grasp the significance of that house, what with all the memories and events that happened there, but I at least expected her to understand and respect that they were there. But I guess not, since she wants to just arbitrarily sell it because of her own preferences (seemingly not even giving my uncle a say in it either). But we all sort of agreed that there was nothing we could do and would thus have to just watch it slip out of our fingers after all this time. 

What should I do? I know there probably isn't much we can do if she wants to sell it sans maybe one of my cousins convincing them to lease it to them, but I mean in response. Afterward, how should I, at least, approach this aunt. Tell her that nobody likes what she did? Disown her(!) (I've never been especially fond of her in any event)? I'm a very sentimental person, and I can just tell that her just throwing away so much family history and countless memories with practically no input from the ""proper"" family in question will not be something that will just anger me for a few days. It *will* be a visceral anger, one that will turn into a grudge that I'll hold for years to come if something doesn't give. I can just tell.

221,"First off, I'm not normal. I'm a lone wolf. My parents divorced, I was emancipated, and switched schools. when I was 16 years old. After I graduated and moved away two years later, none of my friends stayed in touch. My family also isn't close. I have one friend I met when I was 21 and we've hung out once or twice a week since and then I have my fiance. That's really my clique. I have fb friends I could message and have a chat with sure, but as far as people messaging me asking how I'm doing; no one does that. I'm not depressed about it, I feel it's not a reflection on me, but maybe just how life is. I don't have a lot of money but I survive quite fine. I feel this info is important to give you a picture of my mindset. 

I met my fiance while I was in a previous relationship of 9 years. I was mostly unhappy during the 9 years. At the beginning of that relationship, there wasn't trust right away because of something she did, and then I retaliated but yet we stayed together for 9 years. I could have made that relationship work, but I always knew I wanted someone else. I didn't know how to break up so I messaged a random person on FB. I looked into singles groups because I wanted the advice of a female, I knew any guy would just say f that b dump her. I also didn't want to message a girl with a boyfriend because I guess I just thought that it would be harder to get a response from someone in a relationship. 

Long story short, the person who responded told me to try to make it work with her and I did, I had a longtalk with my ex and aired out my feelings, but it just wasn't meant to be. However the girl who gave me that advice, well we started talking. I broke up with my fiance, then met her, and now we are getting married in 4 days. 

Rewind a few months. I start a new job, I really like it, I can do the work well and I'm making a career high in income. A few weeks in, I meet a girl at work. 

I can't express how much I love my fiance. She's the sweetest person I've ever met, extremely gorgeous, and is a great lover. 

I had no intentions of liking anyone else ever. A few times in the previous 9 year relationship, I had crushes on other girls but all of them were unrequited. I was really depressed at the time, and I actually spent time in the hospital for a failed suicide attempt and another for suicidal thoughts. Once I met my fiance I thought all my problems would be gone, that I could finally be happy. I am really happy, but I feel incredibly guilty because I can't stop thinking about this other girl. 

The girl with whom I work asked if we could carpool, (the nature of our job involves travel and some hotel stay) and I thought that would be cool. I thought she was cute, but I had no intentions on being anything other than a perfect gentleman. 

We've spent a lot of time alone in the car together. We talk about everything, our relationships, our past, our futures, funny stuff, sad stuff, smart stuff, dumb stuff. We've listened to the radio for maybe a total of 20 minutes of many many miles on the roads. It's so wild to me how I  never met anyone like my fiance, and then like my work friend. They are both unique individuals. With all the time spent with the work girl, and my complete lack of a social life I think it was only natural I would start to catch feelings.

The nature of my crush isn't sexual at all. I guess that's just not my style. I'm not attracted to lust. I'm attracted to the feeling of being loved by someone that I thought would never love me. 

The work friend put in her two weeks because she got a new better job. She also has a boyfriend  of 5 years but I don't think he's good enough for her because he never buys her flowers. I feel sad because we've become good friends, quite frankly I would consider her my best friend because the friend of 10 years I previously mentioned just isn't that great of a friend to me. I know she wouldn't say I was her best friend, but that's because she has a normal social life unlike me. After she leaves the job I know I'll never see her again. Another person in my life to come and go.

Nothing is going to come of this, I'm not going to tell her that I care about her. I'm going to get married in 4 days and live happily ever after. Part of me just really wants to know what would happen if I went nuclear and told everyone the truth. 

I'm a little afraid to post this because I know the work friend and her boyfriend are both on reddit, this is my first ever post here, and I have no idea the chances of either one of them knows that it's me that made this post. My fiance does know that I carpool with this girl, she trusts me. My fiance, the work friend, her boyfriend and I have actually all gotten together for drinks. 

If you made it this far thanks, it was nice to vent. Seeing my thoughts in text gives me a better understanding of my feelings. I actually want to write a book of my previous life experiences, for now I'm excited to see if this post gets any replies. A little scared too like I said. 

TL/DR
I'm getting married in 4 days and I love my fiance and I'll be happy, but I feel guilty because I can't stop thinking about another girl and am going crazy wondering what would happen if I told everyone the truth.

223,"Throw away account, for reasons soon to be revealed.

Recently, my father has been laid off from work. He is an amazing dad, and would do anything to keep the family afloat, and as such has been taking on odd jobs to help finance the family. 

However, after the redundancy, changes started to appear. He has become less social, and had begin spending more and more time on his phone. He seems to have lost his will, and his pride. The spark is gone, and I'm so worried. This could be a by-product of him being tired, but I'm not sure. 

He also has begun to show violent tendencies. His temper has shortened drastically, although it was always short. Most recently he threw some toys cars at my brother after he refused to clean up for hours. I understand his frustration, as my brother is consistently being annoying, and refusing to acknowledge and accept authority. However, after this, he grabbed my brother by the neck and threw him into the bed, screaming at him. At this point I intervened, and grabbed him. After he calmed down he apologized profusely and we had a talk about the unacceptable nature of this punishment. He is essentially and orphan, and was raised in an orphanage in a third world country, where abuse and physical punishment as such is normalised. However, he has since moved with us, to a country where this is unacceptable. 

I don't know what to do. I'm so sorry I have to unload this to strangers on the internet but I don't know what to do. 

I just want advice. I am stuck. My dad is a good person, but his actions have been altered under the stressful circumstances. However, that doesn't excuse his behaviour.

229,"So it’s been a little over two years now that I got out of a very manipulative and emotionally abusive relationship. For context, I was with this adult man from around the age 13 to 17, I was just out of middle school. Looking back I realize I was lied to and manipulated by him, he groomed me and told me what I wanted to hear. I did WILLINGLY have sex with him at first, but after a while I felt depressed and wanted out around 15. I never did though, he just wouldn’t leave me alone, I even tried breaking up with him and he still wouldn’t go away. He initiated sex multiple times where I said no. At first he started begging and wouldn’t leave me alone, and guilt tripped me into it. I still remember the first time as if it’s happening right in front of me, I felt like every good thing about me was stripped away. Then it went to he didn’t care if I said no, he would just do it. I was psychologically damaged at this point. When I was 17, we finally broke up, but there was still me trying to get away from him because he would stalk my home, he even went through all of my accounts with my passwords, hacked my phone, cyber stalked me, and did some very illegal and invasive things. He even sent things to my mom to humiliate me. A few other things as well but maybe I will save that for another day.

Well I finally got out, I am 20 now. I moved away from that place, got a fresh start, but I still feel heavy. My mom has always been my rock, I tell her everything. But I can never bring myself to tell her this. I still feel ashamed and humiliated, I really feel hurt and traumatized from it still.

Met my friend 4 years ago, 2 years ago she and my other (Ex) Friend (I got them together and then they both pushed me away somewhat) pulled a week-long online troll on me, They thought it funny, It wasn't. We slowly fell apart, I was forced to leave the school we were in (Not expelled, it's complicated) and a couple months later (June 2018) we broke up in a pretty fiery argument. In about Early-Mid November last year I got a random Email from my original friend saying she missed me and wondered how I was going, I was pretty lonely at the time and getting kinda depressed so I decided to take it seriously, whether it was or not. We've met up a couple times again (I had to set them up, if I didn't nothing happened) and she seems slightly off, I can't quite tell. We had another argument irl (Pretty minor but she reacted a lot) Not too long ago and then she went on holiday for all of January and we slowly stopped talking online much (We did mostly, meeting up now and then but only before her holiday) and she's stopped responding most of the time. Last time I visited before her holiday she spent most of her time on the computer and mostly ignored me. We talk now and then at the moment and she doesn't seem hostile at all, but neither does she seem that friendly. Ignores a lot of texts I send. 

I am wondering: 

1: Could this all be set up again like she trolled me before? She basically obeys everything her other friend (Who dislikes me) says. I think she may want to get back at me. This might all be another troll?

233,"Hi! I just wanted to ask something, I’m kinda new to this but I just wanted to ask if its okay that my 18 year old friend is dating a common friend of ours that is 28 (going 29) yr. old? 

The female btw is 18 and the male is 28. I just want your opinions, but if you’re wondering how he’s treating her its actually surprisingly well. I mean I know the guy myself but I just cant shake off the feeling that its a bit.. weird? But he treats her well like whenever they go out he offers to ride her home, treat her to movies and her food as well (even if she doesn’t want for the guy to pay for her food) and is really sweet.

Technically the overall treatment of the guy to her is really well, and is expected for a mature and financially stable boyfriend. (Even if they’re not together... yet)

I just wanted to ask if that relationship and mostly the age gap is okay? Your comments and feedbacks will be highly appreciated! Thanks so much :D ",10Feb2019,1

235,"I think I fucked up big time. I told a girl in my class who already had a boyfriend that I had depression in effort in trying to explain the reason why I was so quiet most of the time. But she took it as a form of criticism for rejecting me when it was just intended for her to see a clearer picture for why I acted so strange most of the time. It was a very clumpsy move of me and I can see why she thinks that im trying to guilt trip her. And keep in mind that I told her that she wasn't the reason for my depression but I don't think she believes me. And it seems like she thinks that im 100% obsessed with her when I try to solve the problem

TL;DR: Girl thinks that im guilt tripping her for telling her about my depression",10Feb2019,1

I lost my little year old brother to suicide last year and so im in kind a bind.
Im currently living with my parents cause im broke and i dont know what i wanna do with my life if my music fails.

My parents want me to do business but tbh i dont really wanna go to university. Ive always hated school...i know that sounds lazy but thats the honnest truth....anyways my dad is smart and he insists i get a degree or diploma or something (he dropped out and had to go back so he doesnt want me to make the same mistake...which i understand) and i also hate the trades so thats not for me......all im really interested in and motivated about are things like: playing music, modelling, acting, photography...basicallt the arts...however the arts dont pay well and i dont wanna be frugal for my entire life...
.
As for the issue of me being broke. I hate minimum wage jobs. Ive tried a bunch....the people (both staff and customers) all treat me like worthless stupid human peice of garbage pawn scum...... this causes me to be depressed and get angry with everything and it got to the point where i hated my life. I quit and ever since ive felt better about life...ive been a happier person.

Also my parents stress me out alot and my dad isnt the nicest guy to be around now since we lost my brother last year...tbh Hes handling the death badly. So being stuck at home with no car, no anything all alone and around constant negativity is starting to get to me...
.
I feel trapped guys what do i do?
I was thinking of applying for mental health disability. Because i have PTSD dreams, insomnia and depression/anxiety. But im scared that ontario will gut me financially and cripply my credot score and ultimately do somthing that is detrimental to me.

TL;DR - broke, depressed, cant work shit jobs, hate school, love the arts but also like msking money so nvm the arts lol, im stuck at home with negativity....help.

245,"I’m a high school senior. I’ve been in this class for 2 weeks now, it’s interpersonal communications. I only took it for graduation requirements. I don’t like the curriculum and the constant group activities and talking with the class. I’ve had the teacher before for a class and he is the funny and outgoing teacher, always making jokes. Last year in class he would always say things like “quiet down” or that I was talking too loud or too much but of course he was just joking. I was fine with that but he has recently crossed the line. For the past few days he has been making remarks about me in front of the whole class. The first day he was talking about who would not show emotion as an example for something and he called me out. But a few days ago has pushed it for me. I was looking at him when he was teaching as usual and he mentioned my face again and how I looked. I wasn’t smiling or anything because I never smile. He said something about my face and alluded to how I was emotionless and looked at him in response. And the whole class was laughing. He seems to only pick on me. Then later in class he asks me if it’s ok if he picks on me and I say “it’s ok” but obviously lying and he backs off. I don’t think he’d do it again. For the rest of the hour I had waves of small anxiety attacks and watery eyes. There are other people that are quiet but why would it be fine with me? I never smile or talk, how could he just assume it’s ok without ever talking or knowing me? I don’t really like the group activities and I feel like I don’t fit in. It’s not as easy for me to want to talk as everyone else and I am quiet and emotionless. I’m pretty sure I have GAD. I’m on the fence of whether I should drop the class or not. I’d probably have to switch to an online or other English class. ",10Feb2019,1

247,"The mistake is that i utterly crushed the heart of my ex-gf.  


I just want to start by saying yes, i have been despicable and feel despicable for all of this.  None of this is justification, I am simply trying to lay out the facts.  If you are going to tell me I am a bad person, thats fine, I deserve it.  Im really going to paint an ugly picture here.  But for those of you who arent here to pass judgement, just be completely honest with me, okay?  Im going to try to give as detailed an account as possible.


I broke up with my ex about 7 months ago.  Towards the end of our relationship I admitted (to myself not her) that I was in love with a girl I had been living with.  This led to a lot of problems, but I want to back up a bit.


Now, my ex and I are basically soul mates.  Ive never had the connection I had with her with anyone else, and i know it was the same for her.  We were two sides of the same coin.  I mean even before we ever started dating i think it was painfully obvious that we belonged together - which had never been my intention until she kissed me.


When our relationship started i was very, very hesitant.  There are two main reasons we got close in the first place.  The first is that we both had just lost a parent, and the only place we found solace was in each other.  The second was that we both got tired of the people in our immediate group of friends for  various reasons, and decided that we should cut ties with them because the whole thing was starting to feel a bit toxic.  In no time at all we became best friends, and we eventually started to hook up, which led to us dating.  I had never ever ever been in a real relationship before.  I lost my virginity to her.  This is when I was 22 and she was 25.


Fast forward a bit, after being happy together for a short period of time, things got bad between us and we broke up.  It was mostly because i was pretending that i didnt want to have sex with her because I wasnt attracted to her.  This isnt actually the case, and i have no excuse as to why i said this (yes I said this to her), but it shattered her confidence utterly and it led to us breaking up because we wanted to “remain friends” - which of course turned out to be impossible.  I had a dozen excuses - i felt trapped, i wanted to be with other people, i didnt want what she wanted, i felt like she drank too much (this isnt true, she just liked to have fun, but my mother was an alcoholic and she drank herself to death and I found her corpse in her bedroom on the morning she died and drinking is just a very sensitive subject with me) - but really they were all bullshit.  Im really just very narcissitic, as much as I wish I werent, and i guess i couldnt deal with the fact that I wasnt going to have a bunch of fun sexual encounters like I fantasized about all my life, even though ive never made a move on a girl because I have a paralyzing fear of being rejected or looking like an idiot.  I have extremely low self-confidence and any blow to my ego is huge and causes me to act out in awful ways.  This is one thing id truly like to fix about myself. 


So after realizing we cant just be friends, we spend some time apart.  Months later we get back together, again under the pretense of just trying to be friends.  Of course, we sleep together.  So now were back at square one.  But, things seem different now, im not sure if they truly were, but we decide to try dating again anyway.  At first things seem better.  The time apart seemed to teach us something.  But slowly we fall back into the same patterns.  After she did a but a research she came to the conclusion that we were in a counter dependant relationship.  And then she tried to commit suicide.  It wasnt like an ‘I found her in the bathroom situation’ but she took some pills and then immediately vommited them up because she regretted it.  Then she told me about it, and i suggested she get some help, so after a bit she ends up in an in-patient program for a number of weeks, completely isolated from everyone and everything in her life.  And i am nothing but supportive throughout all if this - the only part of this relationship where i put everything aside and just wanted to be there for her.  I hated how terrible things had gotten and I felt responsible and knew she did not deserve what she was going through because she is truly a wonderful, bright, beautiful girl.  So she gets through the outpatient program, truly grateful to me for being there for her, and I break up with her.  I was terrified.  I cared about her a lot, and the idea of dealing with the death of another person I loved was not something I wanted to deal with.  This wasnt an isolated incident - before we had ever started dating or even gotten close she had tried to kill herself and went through the same thing, so i saw it as a pattern.  This obviously devastated her.  For the next month or two we would go back and forth on being in love and not wanting to be around each other - which really only fueled her depression.  She genuinely wanted to get past her depression, and really tried to make the most of her life with or without me.  Eventually things calmed down a bit, and we were just ‘together but not together’ because neither of us could really get a grip on just being happy.  Around this time I left my house because my dad got a new girlfriend and i couldnt stand her and he’s the source of my narcissism, because hes even more of a narcissist than I am, so i just left without a word and decided I would be homeless.  Shes nothing but supportive, offering me what little she can even though she literally has nothing.  But then, the other girl who I had repressed feelings for offers for me to live with her family, all of whom I am very close with and love dearly so I said yes.  She was still with her bf at the time so even though i knew I was repressing feelings for her, i genuinely believed she was happy with her bf, who also lived with us, and while im a huge jackass I could never interfere with that, i simply am not courageous enough to do so, nor do i want to hurt anyone.


Again, things begin to get tenuous between me and my ex, but for the most part, without the restriction if being in a relationship, things arent so terrible.  Were still hanging out all the time.  Were still having sex a lot.  Were still hanging out with each others friends, and aside from a few anger-fueled blow ups, we know we still love each other and we dont want to be apart.  Hell she was seeing another guy, with me fully in the loop, and it didnt make me jealous or take away from what we had.  We may as well have been dating.  But then my roommate breaks up with her boyfriend.  And suddenly im caught up in the overwhelming urge to drop everything i have going for me and be with her.  Things instantly grow bad between me and my ex.  I grow cold and distant to her.  I stop wanting to hang out with her.  I stop wanting to have sex with her.  Basically our improving relationship grinds to an utter halt because i suddenly dont want it again.  We end up breaking up for good after a few bad exchanges where we get really angry at each other and say hurtful things to each other, and she has a mental breakdown and i leave her there alone because Im the cause of it and i cant fix it.  She asks me to never contact her again because she literaly cannot handle it.  We both leave the relationship feeling like garbage.


About a month later she calls me.  Shes pregnant.  Both of us are very distraught over this.  I did not want to keep it.  At first she did not want to either.  Looking at the situation logically, keeping it would have been a bad idea.  Neither of us had good jobs - between us we maybe made 18k a year.  Neither of us had a real home to live in - we both lived with people who were kind enough to give us refuge because we couldnt afford it.  We were both heavily depressed and clearly couldnt be together without issues arising - she was still too heavily dependant on me for validating her views of herself, and I was so far away from wanting to be with her at that point for my own selfish reasons.  But, i begrudgingly begin to support her in her process of making the decision of what exactly to do next.  However this time I am not as attentive or caring towards her.  Our encounters are bi-polar in nature.  In one minute we’ll be having what was by far the best sex if our relationship, and Ill be doing things like watching movies with her i would have never cared about before, and we started looking for an apartment to get together, and I bought her a car, and we talked about going to the gym to improve ourselves together, and I started to teach her how to cook, and did my best to let her know that whatever her decision was, even if I didnt support it, i would be there.  Then in other moments I would be extremely cold to her, avoid her, not answer her text messages, and do anything I could to get away and hang out with my friends - just any way to express my unhappiness.  It was very toxic at this point.  On her end too, she mentioned committing suicide again a couple times, but I dont blame her for this because i know we were just both in a bad place that stemmed from my decisions.  It was just bad.  Eventually she decided to get an abortion and we resolved to never talk again, although our last meeting wasnt so aggressive, because my grandmother had just died, and she felt genuine sympathy for me even though she had no reason to.  Our last meeting was a lot like a funeral, like we knew that this thing we had together that had such great potential we just let die quietly.  Since then weve had no contact.


So after all of that, my question to you is this: is there any chance, or is it even a good idea to attempt to reconcile at this point?  After avoiding dealing with it for months I finally realized that I am in fact the biggest idiot in the world.  I feel like if there were a hall of fame for truly terrible people my picture would be on the wall a few down from Hitler.  She absolutely, positively deserved none of what she went through, and I only wish i could make it better, because I believe we do belong together.  But, Im not so sure if contacting her would be a good idea.  The last thing i want to do is ruin any progress that she may have made in completely erasing me from her past, which would be the sane thing to do.  Im so scared because I know that everything would be riding on this for her if she were to even want to communicate with me again.  There would be a lot of obstacles too.  Her family most certainly hates my guts.  There is alot of emotional scarring that wont simply go away, we would probably need therapy to deal with it.  I know I would need to work my ass off for the rest of my life to make things right, but i am ready to finally accept that responsibility and do everything i can to work towards that.


So please, just be honest with me.  If ive truly missed out on this it will be my biggest regret and I will have to live with it.

248,"Until now, I always thought that I was gay so this has never been a problem but now I am starting to realise that I am probably bisexual.

I know a girl and she is just absolutely amazing. We speak everyday and I go to meet her after her classes, spend frees with her etc. She has said that she likes being around me and that she has never met anyone like me before.

I could see myself asking her out but my parents would never accept it if anything long term came of it. I can imagine spending the rest of my life with her but they would never allow me to, I’m sure she would want to meet them eventually it how would I tell her that they are racists ? Not only that but she is a Christian and I haven’t told her that I’m not, she wouldn’t care but my parents probably wouldn’t like that she is.

Someone is trying to tamper with my friendships. Anna is my best friend, and May is the girl trying to weasel me out. Anna and I have been best friends for a long time and I know that Anna sees me as her best friend because she has told me multiple times/recently, and I view her as my best friend as well. I think the only reason May pretends to be friends with me is because she knows she would lose Anna if she didn’t. What happened today has pretty much confirmed my suspicions about May.

May always tries to only have conversations with Anna or eventually direct a group conversation into a one on one with Anna. She even taps her tray a bunch just to get her attention during lunch. Noticing Anna kind of ignore May or shrug her off made me feel a little uncomfortable, so I try to make conversation with May. She either ignores me or tries to get Anna to join the conversation. May does this often. But she makes sure to laugh at my jokes to make it seem like we are friends. And I thought I imagined her slight dislike of me until what happened today.

The Issue:
May invited Anna and another girl in our friend group to a hockey game/her little brothers birthday party, I only know because Anna told me while we were hanging out. I was hurt and surprised about it because I thought May and I were friends, but I decided to let it go and just nod my head.  I could tell Anna felt bad that I hadn’t been invited, but I tried to make it seem like no big deal. Then I thought about it. May talks about how she messages everyone else in the group often and how she usually doesn’t leave people on seen. May has never reached out to me on social media, and if we do talk on social media she always reads it and doesn’t reply. Fast forward to about 4 days since May invited the two of them to the party. Suddenly, May sends me a message that same day/the day of the party. Since I’m having doubts about her I ignored/didn’t read it. Eventually I get a phone call from Anna. She says that May is inviting me to the game, but I know its because the other friend had to drop out and May needed someone to fill the extra ticket. And because Anna told her to invite me as the replacement. I said no and made up a believable excuse, but I think Anna knew the real reason because she sounded like she felt bad. I replied to May’s message saying I couldn’t go. She seemed too happy about it. May doesn’t know that I know I was invited as an afterthought. I’m sick of her two-faced actions. If I did confront her, I think she’d play dumb to make me look like a jerk.

He tells me he will leave, but presents various reasons as to why he hasn’t yet (daughter, holidays, Christmas, my moods (which aren’t amazing - granted - however I do feel like I’m being treated like a mug). He has asked for a three month break to sort his shit out, as yet nearly 1/2 way through the first month I have seen no evidence of this.

262,"Sorry if this is horribly formatted. Just woke up and writing this on my phone. 

My mom and my sister live with me and my husband. Mom is messy and has been having a hard time adjusting to living with other adults who have opinions on how to use shared space. 

She hates to throw anything away (she is as bad  or worse as my husband's great grandmother who had the wartime mentality who would go through everyone's trash to collect anything useable). But lately she has been making a ton of food waste and I dont know what's going on. 

Since we arrived she fluctuates buying way too much food (usually when she is stressed) and then we end up having to throw a bunch of things out. Normally this is only a little frustrating because I like to cook and I would prefer to pick up ingredients for meals but I feel forced to use whatever she bought that might go bad. These past few weeks have really ramped up, she cleaned the fridge out last week and I cleaned it out yesterday and there is still a funky smell coming from something I've yet to find. 

Some examples from this week:
-She did not want anyone using the bread she bought because she wanted to make paninis and then it went bad because it didn't get used.

-I cleaned out the fridge yesterday and there were three bunches of cilantro bought 2-3 days apart. The last one I picked up at her request 2 days ago, she never said what it was for but I made the mistake of asking if she needed anything. I had to throw 2 of them out

-We have about 7 or 8 avocados that are about to go bad if they don't get used (I planned on making a ton of guac to use them all) today as well as leftovers that need to be eaten, ingredients for a  very simple soup that I intended to make last week but couldn't due to other ingredients going bad that I had to use, and a fridge full of random veggies at various level of decay yet she just went to the grocery store last night and picked up several bags of groceries to make a soup that requires more ingredients than she actually obtained which means they will go bad unless I purchase the remaining ingredients and make it myself. 

I feel like I'm stuck in this loop of using suboptimal ingredients trying to play catch up to the piles of food she is buyin. I'm failing and it is making me  miserable because I really just want to cook what I want and not be micromanaged by her grocery shopping. I have asked her to stop shopping for meals for me to make but she seems to think she is going to cook them all even though she works and I only work a few hours from home and then I am forced to cook it or let everything go back and deal with her leaving veggie (and sometimes meat!!) sludge in the fridge or get mad at me for throwing out unusable food. 

Does anyone have any insight as to what is going on here? Is there anything I can do differently that will improve?",10Feb2019,1
263,"So here is the story. I met my friends back in elementary school and we've been close ever since. We would often play outside, play video games and do various activities together. But after he entered highschool he's been pressured by his parents to study so much that he doesn't do anything else besides that. I'm completely serious when I say that. I haven't seen him in about a year maybe, his parents don't let him go to parties, don't let him be on computer unless it's a school related thing and don't give him almost any free time. We talk maybe once or twice a week when his parents are not at home and I just can't convince him to rebel against it. He's always like ""It's ok, I'll manage somehow"". Now I want to influence him to man up to his parents (Might be a selfish and maybe not a good idea but fuck it) or make his parents think they are doing something wrong but I have no idea how, so far I've only tried to talk to him about that but no luck.",10Feb2019,1

266,"This is a throw away account. So I’m from India and I’m kinda done with everything in life. My mum has always been physically abusing me. She’s beaten the shit out of me with a pan. She’s thrown me out of the house while I was just in my underwear. She starts shouting at me when she has a problem. ( she recently got an iPhone from her office and couldn’t operate it cause she had been using android her whole life. She got angry and threw the phone against the wall and broke it. Then started shouting at me for not immediately coming into the room and helping her then proceeded to say things like I’m useless and it wouldn’t affect her a bit if I died - this is one of many examples about the things she’s done) whenever we get in an argument she tells me My expression look exactly like my fathers and she knows him very well thus meaning that I’ll be unsuccessful in life. My parents got a divorce when I was around 6 and they used to fight everyday before that so I didn’t really care also I didn’t know what it was then. My mum then moved to another state away from my dad and bought a house on her own there which she brags about all the time cause she thinks that it’s an impossible task even tho she already had a stable job and lived with a guy there who was probably her boyfriend for all I know..I lived with my father for a year and everything was perfect until she called me to live with her and at the time I was probably 7 and missed my mum so thought I’d go live with her. We lived with the guy I told you guys about for like 5 months until she got a house and it was ready to move into. Ok yeah I still remember when we are at the guys house I was playing around and accidentally slapped my mum on the face and laughed idk what I was thinking but my mum got really angry dragged me down and locked me down on the 2nd floor room for like 2 hours. Later her “boyfriend” came in and told me to join them for dinner and told me he had convinced her. Things moved on I became shit at studies I was in like 3rd grade maybe? And she would beat me a lot for not understanding things and say I’m just like my father and a slow learner. She’d constantly compare me to my dad. These kinda things have been going on for a while so I’m currently 15 and now know that I don’t have to deal with this kind of shit. I have genuinely lost all feelings for her. She has been affecting me negatively. I recently burst out on her and almost punched her. She then threatened to call the cops on me and pull me out of the house. I am now genuinely done and have decided to move out cause I have established the fact that me and my mum will never have a relationship. I’d say I’m a twat but her boyfriend and her fought all the time too and broke up long ago she has even been on dating sites and met with multiple people. None of the guys she had a long time. I even remember two of the guys ghosted her and she telling me they probably got into and accident. She then gave up. 




Anyway now that you have this information and kinda know the reason why I have decided to move out tell me how do I do it. She doesn’t have a problem with me doing it. The problem is I can’t find a single job cause no one will hire a underage kid to do shit for them unless it’s illegal or fucked up. Can’t apply as a waiter either. I can speak English and hindi which are the main national language of the country but people here speak different language and I don’t know shit about it. I’m bisexual so I think I’ll probably try and go on Grindr so I don’t have to spend the night on the streets for sex in return maybe. I know that’s a big low but it’s doable cause I’m above average looking and doesn’t matter what I’m saying is I’ll manage that bit. Question is how do I survive on the street alone when I don’t have someone where I can crash. Also what kinda work is out there which I probably don’t know about and is not like proper dog shit. I know I’m probably gonna get fucked and die but it’s gonna be an experience I guess and honestly I just wanna do this for the heck of it and don’t care much. Just want to know if there is anything you guys can suggest.

It made me seem like some weakling who would never tell and I also knew he doesn't like me like that so now it's embarrassing for him and me as well.

My husband will get in depression funks where for weeks he will literally sleep the entire day away, and then only wake up at night to play video games.  (He is on medication btw)


During all this he becomes really mean towards me. If I try to gently encourage he eat something, or go for a walk, or just sit with him, I am met with hostility. He tells me I do nothing to help him, and says I’m a d*ck


I have reminded him I’m not a mental health professional, so I can’t be expected to fix this for him, (and I don’t think his mental illness is solely my responsibility anyways),

I have started to distance myself from him because I can’t deal with his hurtful attitude towards me anymore.


I 100% understand that mental illness is real and serious, but does that mean he can treat me however he wants when it’s acting up? 

The other issue I am having is feeling resentful towards him. To me it seems that his depression is rather convenient, I seem to be the only person he acts like this toward. He can have family over and be perfectly fine, or be laughing the night away until 7am playing video games- but wants nothing to do with me, and is just rude to me when I am around him (as long as others aren’t there to see him act that way). 

But Then I start feeling guilty for having any resentments because I know not every mental illness presents in identical ways.

I just don’t know what to do or how to handle things.

I (25 f) have been married to my high school sweetheart (25 m)for almost 3 years . 

In the beginning , we were teens ,and very young and in love . But I had a lot of emotional issues (that I’ve just recently been starting to take apart and work on )and I really thought of him as more as an “thing” that would complete me and boost my self esteem.

We did love each other and have a strong sexual attraction . But I pushed everything . Him dating me , him seeing me all the time , him marrying me . They were never his first thought . I just always wanted to be surrounded by him him him . My own personal life was failing and I had no hobbies . I ditched my plans with friends . He was my hobby . 

As we got older , he finally proposed to me . The funny thing is , the ring , the engagement party , the wedding...nothing ever felt right . I just felt like this is what people “do” when they’ve been dating forever . I didn’t have that excitement walking down the aisle, and it never felt really special. We went on to have 3 kids in the next 3 years, and that feeling has never went away.

Along with all of this , We have always fought in destructive ways . Our relationship is good when we act more like friends ,but our wants and needs are complete opposites . When he gets angry enough he is emotionally abusive and throws or punches things . Which I no longer want to accept.

My SO is close with my family ,and I’m close with his. Our children are very young , all still toddlers . I know that I do not love this man anymore ,and I’m not attracted to him ,and do not respect him . I want to stop feeling guilty for wasting his time and my time anymore . I see that my selfish thought patterns have created a storm of repercussions . But I don’t know how to leave .Should I tell him I’m not in love anymore and haven’t been in a long time? I’m scared to let everyone down and make a huge mess of things . Basically , I’m being a p*** and im scared to look him in the face and tell him how I feel...

286,"So my birthday was Friday. One of my newer friends who already has an established friendship with a group of others befriended me but I’m single so I don’t get invited to lots of things because of that (which is crap because I’m comfortable with being alone at some of the  events). She wanted to go get pedicures then head to dinner with a few of her other girlfriends after. Problem is there’s always a hold up or an issue about hanging with her. She cancelled the pedicures due to some drama with her soon to be ex husband (common occurrence and not surprising) and is continuously changing standing plans because of what her boyfriend wants to do or lack thereof and who she’s only been seeing for 2-3 months. She always says it’s because of money or something but said she couldn’t come to my birthday outing last night that was planned over a month ago with her attending because she’s going on a cruise in October? 

About me:  I went through a divorce last May and have dated 2 guys and only briefly. But I have this other friend who is also mid divorce and she has a boyfriend now (it’s a revolving thing) and was also committed to come last night and all of the sudden at dinner beforehand says her bf isn’t coming and never gives me a straightforward answer as to why she can’t go for drinks at the place I reserved a table
for. 

I’m always supportive of my friends and not just with my presence in being there when they need me but asking if they need anything before I come over or getting food for everyone. I’m conscious of who they’re dating and trying to help them make the best choices for what end goals they have for relationships and careers. 

Is it wrong for me to be hurt and completely pissed at them. I just cancelled my plans last night and went to a local bar with my mom, sister and friend who is always there for me. 

It just seems like my friends lose sight of who they are when they’re attached to someone and as a formerly married woman I’m sure I’ve done it a handful of times but honestly,,. Throughout the years I’ve made sure I was present when my friends needed or wanted me around for something important to them.

292," First of all, I'd like to give some insight on the situation.

Me and my gf have been dating since Christmas, but been best friends for about a year and quater before that. She always had mental issues, such as depression, anxiety and possibly something more undiagnosed. But up until the start of December, on surface she functioned like a normal person, went to school and seemed to be actually dealing with it. But around Dec, she stopped going to school as she has some sort of a mental block that she cannot get over. She was absent for weeks and of course, it became a problem for her to pass due to having not enough tests completed. The school decided to do what they can to help her and gave her more time to finish the tests she needed to do than to the end of the semester. She had exact dates set up to write all the tests she needed and all except one are yet to come. That one was last thursday and she didn't show up for it because she had a very bad panic attack that morning. I spoke to the teacher for her and she was kind enough to delay it. I will probably sleep at her place for the next dates since I'm the only person that can get her to school right now and also help her with studying, as I did couple times before. Even if she doesn't finish everything due date, she would just repeat the year, which by itself wouldn't be a problem as she's no shy kid and already has many friends in the lower classes, but let's not go there, that's not that important right now.

Well, the thing I'm concerned about is her behaviour throughout this week. Normally we text a lot, she says she hates to text but does it anyway and I see her usually once a week (Most of the time it's a sleepover so technically for two days), but this week is different. We also skype call and play video games sometimes, so I asked her to join me this monday, she said she's not in the mood. I never force her to do anything since that never works on her, so I said it's okay. I really wanted to play though, so I asked her multiple times during the week again. We never called, once I fell asleep (And woke up a hour later only to find out she aparently fell asleep too) , once she did and once her family had an argument so she wanted to be alone. I want to believe it was all just a concidence, but considering the fact that she usually goes to sleep at aroung 2am and this was like 11pm, I don't, I think she wanted to make me happy but didn't really want to call herself. I also told her multiple times I can visit if she wants me too, to which she sometimes agrees, sometimes not so not agreeing this time wouldn't be all that weird as a stand-alone thing, but with all the shit around it worries me. I also mentioned texting a lot. That is another weird thing as she keeps ignoring me (And all the others, I assume) more often than normal this week.

Now, let's get to this thursday, the day when she was supposed to go to write the test. In the morning I messaged her is she's going or not since I noticed she was online way past the time her bus arrives. She said that if she wasn't crying for half an hour straight, she would come. This happens to her, so I offered to stop at her place with my dad and take her to school. She said there's no point, that she would only send me away as since the start of this week, she just wanted to be left alone by everyone. Then she said she'll be fine, just needs to clean her head. I believed that at first, but as the week proceeded I got more and more sceptical.

So, thursday and friday are okay. We text sometimes, not as often as usual but she replies a few times a day and seems to be doing better, I thought it's because the holidays are coming, so she won't have to stress about school. But the yesterday came. She straight up ignored everyone on all social media, even when I asked her to reply, even if it were one letter because I'm worried about her. She ended up replying around midnight, just because I tried to call her twice. The only thing she said she doesn't really want to talk right now and wants to be in her own world. I said it's okay but to reply me at least sometimes so I don't get worried. I also tried to ask her to hang out with me, told her she could come or I could visit, whichever she prefers. She ignored that completely.

The thing that only adds fuel to the fire is the fact that I probably know what could have started this. Last Saturday she was sleeping at my place and we went out and got drunk. I was much less drunk than she was so unlike her I remember it well. She cried in front of me and another friend who was present, for the fist time in few years she cried in front of a person. She said a lot of personal things she wouldn't really say otherwise, including that I and the friend are one of a very few reasons she didn't commit suicide yet. There was a lot of less important confessions, I kept telling her I am here for her and that I won't leave her, of course.

Then we went home and sobered up and ended up having sex for the first time. I have no problem with it as I don't have that much body image issues as she does and would honestly take her on a first date if she was fine with it, so she was the one who needed time. I was okay with it and told her I'll wait until she's ready. I didn't expect it to be so soon though. She was the one to start things, not me. If she seemed still drunk to me I wouldn't do anything, but I think she was sober at that point. Aparently I am pretty good at it and she thinks she's not as good.I told her I'm fine with it, it was her first time after all (The reason I'm saying this is because I think it could also contribute to her insecurities).

The whole night was probably a lot for her to proceed, so the following happened. I probably could've done things better, but there's no point in questioning what could be.

I am very worried about her completely isolating or hurting herself. I plan to give it a few more days and do a surprise visit if it doesn't get any better, but I'm very unsure if it's a good idea or not.

TL, DR: Gf wants to be left alone, acts unusual and I'm concerned since she has mental issues. I don't know if I should visit her despite her ignoring me when I ask her about a visit or not.",10Feb2019,1
293,"I dont know why.



Im a guy, 22, in university, never been in a serious relationship and i have no idea of what im going to be doing in the next 5 years.


I basically wasted my teen years jerking off and playing video games, was 20kg / 45lb underweight, got into fights on a weekly basis and used to get rejected a ton because I just wanst attractive. The one thing that kept me away from depression and possibly turning into an incel, was that I always had this posture of fake confidence and positivity. Im not shy and can get a good, fun conversation out of anyone, so I can make new friends out of anyone pretty easily. But in a weird way, I always felt alone when I wasn't with my small group of geeky friends from highschool (whom actually progressed with theirs lifes and arent 2 or 3 years behind like me). Its like I have this weird gift of being easy to like, but I dont want to put effort in liking them back.



3 years ago, I started seeing myself stuck in life. No goals, no girlfriends and friends were moving on with their lifes. It was only then, I decided to turn my life around. I applied myself in school and finished highschool by 20. Then I worked minimum wage for a year to save up money for University and had my first girlfriend... I would be lying if I said that I didnt think about her today, but I am being honest when i say I dont want anything to do with her. This girl ended up using me as a rebound, told me I was a mistake and just really wasn't attractive for her. This marked the start of the darkest period in my life. University was about to start, by favorite aunt was diagnosed with a brain tumor, highly self concious about my body, still in love with a girl that had no real interest in me and was still feeling being left behind by everyone of my year. I went to a psychologist and she told me I was beginning to suffer from anxiety and that later could developt into depression.
Thankfully University started and i made a new group of friends. They don't know it, but they really helped me out getting through what I hope will be the toughest period of my life. I got the right motivation to eat and go to the gym. Today I'm at 185cm / 6'0 tall and weighting 80kg / 176 lb, with about 16% body fat. I still have issues with my body, mainly my face, but i am aware that im about 20kg better looking.
My grades are fine. I only have one class behind and its the hardest of the whole degree with only about 20% passing rate per year.
Dating wise its still a complete disaster. I dont like drinking alcohol, so i dont like hooking up on those parties where everyone gets wasted. My city isn't big and there arent many other ways of getting to know girls.


But thats the thing... I can see my life is way better then before, but its still not enough. Im not happy with it and I dont feel different although I know I am different.


 I want to decide what im going to do after my degree (its very versatile and I have a lot of choices on what to do with it).
I want to be more handsome.
I want to get a girlfriend. One that actualy loves me this time.


Im tired. I know I cant rush certain things. But im tired of seeing my progress but not actually feeling any better about myself. ",10Feb2019,1
294,"As the title says, (and I regret it a lot, mild PTSD, don't do drugs kids). Apparently one of the teachers at my high school has been talking shit about me and my friends, to middleschoolers, that ""he knows OP and the rest"" did it. If either he or someone else was to talk to someone in charge of the school, could we get into potential legal trouble, or at the very least lose scholarships or even potentially get kicked out of college? I've been overthinking this a lot the past several months and finding out he's been talking without any real proof fucks me up, I couldn't go back to sleep so I had to make a burner account and see if I could get any kind of reply.",10Feb2019,1
296,"I’m a 16 year old girl in high school and some recent events in my life made me realize that I don’t really have friends.

A little background:

I moved to my town at the end of middle school and I’m currently a junior. I was struggling really badly with anxiety for the bulk of 8th grade, so I didn’t really come out of my shell until the beginning of freshmen year upon which I retreated back into myself later in the year. I made an effort to be more social this year but I can’t say it’s worked too well so most people still consider me the shy 13 year old I was which is understandable. I have this bad habit where if I don’t automatically click or feel comfortable woth someone, I’ll make no further effort in the relationship.

Honestly, this perception of who I am socially is probably really the only thing holding me back. I have most qualities of an average teen girl regarding interests and style. I’m acquitanced with most of the well liked girls in my school individually, though I admittedly could use work with their male counterparts.

I have a “best friend” whom I don’t really like and haven’t for years but I dug myself in such a deep hole with our friendship back in freshmen year that she’s literally the only friend I have. If you’re wondering why I don’t like her but still remain friends with her, here’s why:

- she’s constantly complaining about things she can change: for example, she hates her job and always says she’s gonna quit but she doesn’t. She doesn’t study/turn in assignments for her classes but complains about her grade being low. The list here goes on. 
- she never says anything uplifting: I mention something I achieved (not because I wanted to but because she asked) and all she says is “cool”, or some backhanded compliment, then goes back to talking about herself.
- speaking of, she is always talking about herself. I’ll say something to her and she’ll something back completely unrelated that brings the conversation back to her.
- she’s awkward and annoying. And not in an endearing, normal way but like intentional. She thinks it’s quirky to make “funny” faces, random noises or randomly burst out into song when she can’t think of anything to say. It’s just cringey and quite annoying that she seems so socially unaware.

At this point, I’d rather remain socially isolated for the rest of the year than continue to remain friends with her but that presents a big issue since we sit at the same lunch table (I’ll get into the issue there later), have 2 of the same classes and sit next to each other (by assigned seating, surprisingly), and since we’re literally each other’s only friends, she’ll know something is up if I just stop talking to her.

As I mentioned we sit at the same lunch table with a group of other girls we know. They may sound like friends but theres a good chance they don’t actually like me.  

They literally make plans right in front of me and aforementioned best friend without inviting either one of us (granted, there’s another girl at the table they do this to but she’s considered less disposable to them). They ask me to take a picture of them, not with them. They share that look of understanding when I try to make plans upon which they’ll let agree to let me down gently or flat out say “yeah, no” but try to pass it off as a joke. 

Before someone suggests it, I’m already involved in several clubs, all of which my best friend is in, although my amount of participation is better. If I try to join a new one, she will too likely.

All in all, it’s really messed with my self confidence. 

I normally could’ve lived with these things but some recent events in my life have just made me really sad about the whole situation. I went on vacation recently and met a group of people who opened my eyes to what it’s like to have a normal high school experience. I’ve spent the past 3 years buried in school work and stuck to a girl who has done nothing to help me grow as a person. Prom is coming up and if the people I sit with everyday, and have known individually since freshmen year don’t even want me around, who does? 

I guess my question is, how do I make new friends when everyone has a warped perception of who I actually am and everyone else’s friend group is set in stone? ",10Feb2019,1
297,So a close friend of mine recently blocked me and said she never wanted to speak to me again. I took this pretty badly and really fucked me up as she was someone I could turn to and speak about anything. So on nights outs I do lifts for folk and I get the occasional phone call from her asking for a lift. I haven't given her a lift since she blocked me but I was out last night and later in in the night she grabs my hands and tries to make me dance and then she comes up to me and asks questions about things. It was ok and I was just weirded out by it. Later that night we went back to afters and she just ignored me the whole night and then in the morning ignored me. She doesn't say bye or hey to me but I'm just confused as I don't think she was even that drunk. What do I do?,10Feb2019,1

302,"Bit of a back story- I'm a final year student at university. I lived in Germany March 2017-July 2018, and stayed at home until September, when I moved back into halls at university. I'm 22 and have been put with people aged 18-20. They're all in their first years, and are making my life hell.

One girl just screams. All. The. Time. Literally, someone goes into the same room as her and she screams. It is even worse when she's drunk. The other girl is really quiet so she's not so bad.

One of the guys have dropped out of university but still lives here (he shouldn't really). He doesn't have a job or anything, so he literally goes out every night, wakes up at 2pm and continues the cycle. From 2pm onwards he plays this shitty bass music. Another guy is just a complete and utter tool, has an obvious spolit, last born baby boy attitude and is extremely inconsiderate.

Put them all together, its a noise complaint every single night. They party every night, and don't stop even when security comes to tell them to either turn the music down or go. They've even started banging on my door before they leave, and screaming outside my room. All I've ever done is ask them to be more quiet after 11pm.

I only ever had mild anxiety before, but I've had to go to the doctors over the dread I feel coming home, and the fact I can't sleep easily around them, and have been diagnosed with anxiety-depression disorder.

I've been to accommodation services, and they have given me the option to move to another room in a flat with international students. They're all very quiet. However, I'll be in a different size room to what I'm paying for. The new flat also has a really filthy kitchen.

However, I’m an heterosexual. I’ve read a bit online about females wearing tuxedos(to prom), and it usually relates to their expression of their sexuality. I don’t want to give off signals that I’m something I am not.

306,"I (27M) have an amazing friend who we'll call M (26M). We met 4 years ago, but started getting closer about 2 years ago, when we reconnected after a long time. We met through a mutual friend, who was my best friend at the time, but with whom I ended having a fallout. So when we reconnected I was a little bit lonely. He was also going through a rough patch with his family and we started going out to party more often, then to do other things besides partying, until eventually we got so close to each other that he started saying that I am his best friend. I feel the same way about him. He has been increidbly supportive, taught me a lot of things, and we just have a lot of fun when we are together. And he makes an effort to include me in almost all of his plans. That is, until last Saturday. He went to work as a watchman at a party, so we couldn't hang out that day, but when his shift finished, he let me know and asked me if I wanted to go out, but I told him I didn't have any money. However, I had a fight with my older sister that day, with whom I live (and we otherwise love each other very much), because since he told md he wasn't available, I visited another friend, and arrived home drunk (this is a point of contention with my family as they want me to abstain from alcohol, plain and simple, and they don't seem to accept the fact that I will drink socially). So I was fuming and wanted desperately to go out, but wasn't clear enough and I just stayed home. When we met again a few days later, we were with a few friends of his, and they inadvertentky revealed that they were hanging out drinking at his house last Sunday, till the early hours of Monday. I tried to tell myself that I was mad because he did that when he knew that I needed to go ourt, but when I remembered that day I was already on good terms with my sister again, I just realized I felt hurt that he hung out with other friends without me and I wasjust trying to rationalize it. He explained that it was totally unplanned and I just replied that he could have called me regardless. I was upset but decided to calm down and not say anything before analyzing things, and eventually I decided that something like that was bound to happen once in a while, and that I had no reason to freak out. So, comes this Saturday (yesterday) and he got me a job as a watchman, just like him, so that we could hang out without drinking (his words), but since I was new I was assigned to a different event and were separated the whole day. He called me before his shift started from his friend's phone to see how I was doing, but didn't talk anymore. We had agreed the day before that we would go clubbing after work that day, but he never called, and when I called his friend's phone no one picked up. I went to the club by myself and ended up meeting some other, more superficial friends, but started to constantly check my phone to see if he wouldn't call. I'm freaking out that he might have gone drinking with his other friends without me. I am becoming clingy and needy (even if I refrain from acting that way) and don't know what to do. I don't want to end ruining a great friendship over that.

Key:
Me: Me
B: Babysitter
M:Mum

So my Mum works the night shift some nights, and when she does I go round to B’s house with my PS4.

Upon arrival I find I forgot the controller for the PS4, so we decide to walk back with his pet husky (Lily).

So we start walking back, all is fine. The doors unlocked because I forgot to lock it but no one broke in. I greet Tiny (a little dog we’re babysitting) and go inside.

We get in, get the controller and decide to go see my pet ratties (I have 4) and only 3 are there. We notice of of the mini pull up hatches is slightly open, and realise Squeak has escaped.

So I freak, and order B to take the dogs into the bedroom. My bedroom light isn’t working so I use his phone light (with his permission) to look for Squeak.

Instead he switches my light and my Mums bedroom light around (the one we agreed to put the dogs in) around, and leaves them in the dark. I open the door and Tiny barks at me out of instinct (he was abused before) so I cuddle him to comfort him.

So I take the dogs outside, and go to look back inside, and B comes in with me. He begins walking around VERY loudly, and I suggest he goes and watches the dogs.

Im unable to find Squeak, so I open my spare cages door (so she has some where to sleep) and fill up the food and water for Tiny and leave with B and Lily.

On the way back, I talk (in a slightly pissed tone) about how loud he was, and how he might of scared Squeak. I do this until we get home and a bit after, and go to bed.

Just as Im about to go to sleep, I get a few messages from my Mum claiming how B said I was swearing and shouting, and apparently I abused poor Tiny and made him yelp.

At this point, Im PISSED. I would never, ever abuse him, I love animals with all my heart, especially Tiny since he’s so cute and Ive known him for a while.

My Mum says we are no longer going out tomorrow (we were going to get a game together and maybe food) because of my behaviour. So I cry for an hour and fall asleep.

My Mum wasn’t happy when she picked me up this morning, and doesn’t believe me. She was also saying how I was calling her rude names behind her back, and that I my behaviour was disgusting.

After a conversation with said person, it never happened. All the trails lead back to my friend who is known to start stuff and lie. I told her I asked this person if it ever happened, and she immediately got defensive and was asking “why I care so much” and that I’m “involving her in my work drama”. She also has a habit of gaslighting people when they call her out on her lies. I’m asking for advice because at this point we sit next to eachother at work, neither of us plans to quit anytime soon. The only way I can think to deal with this is to keep her close but not too close, don’t tell her anything anyone else says, etc. Confronting her about the lying just leads to her getting angry and defensive. I don’t know what to do. 

If you guys have any questions that I can answer that would help you form an opinion or advice, feel free to ask me in the comments. ",10Feb2019,1
320,"So this is my first reddit post and it might be on the longer side. I didnt really know who else to ask so... here I go. (Also English isnt my first language so I'm really sorry if there are some errors)

So I've been friends with this girl for about 2 years,let's call her 'A'. We've known eachother for about 9 years but we became close when we transferred to a new school from our previous school. 

Since we were close, the first time I actually started to like a guy I obviously told her. I became really good friends with this guy and I was really happy that it was going well. I'm not the type to confess to someone because I absolutely hate those kind of awkward situations so I tried to take it as slow as possible. I really liked this guy and A knew this. So she kept pestering me to ask this guy out and I told her that I just wasn't ready. One day A says she has to talk to me about my crush. Turns out she had asked him if he liked me and all that and told me to just give up on him. I don't know what exactly she told him but long story short, it became really awkward with my crush and A became really good with him. She kept telling me what good friends they were. I didnt think she meant anything bad by confronting him so I gave her the benefit of the doubt and ignored it. That was a few months ago.
A while ago we were talking about kinks and all that and she tells me that she's got this weird thing for her friends' boyfriends. Like if someone she knows starts dating someone then she wants to break them up and date them or something. She said it was really fun. 
This was a huge red flag for me so when I realized I liked my good guy friend C I didnt tell her or anyone else. Let's just say its obvious when i have a crush. My friends kept asking me if I like someone and all that and I finally gave in and said yes I do, but i want to keep it a secret. I did really well in keeping it a secret for a few weeks until A started to guilt trip me into telling her who my crush was. She told me that she tells me everything and that I dont trust her and all that. I couldn't take it anymore so I told her and asked her not to tell anyone. The next day I find out that she had already told one of my other friends who it was. Second red flag.
Finally, today she texts me saying that she had a talk with C about me. So she had told him someone likes him and when he started guessing who it was he eventually guessed me. A said no way it's her and C replied with yah shes my bro so of course not . I already knew this obviously. Hes a really good friend of mine and I knew he didnt see me as anything more than a friend. A then said ""Haha you were  BROZONED"". I said that I already knew he saw me as a friend for which she replied ""well now you're sure!"". This really annoyed me and this was the third red flag for me and I just ignored her messages after that, which is a really dick move on my part I  know.

 Shes not a bad person I know, but I dont know what to do. Should i confront her about this or ignore it? Maybe I'm just assuming things.
 Thankyou for listening to my rant people.

322,"Hello everyone,

Since May 2018, I’ve been dealing with important symptoms that always worried me, but I would constantly brush them off with multiple reasons (too busy with work to see a doctor, let’s wait and maybe it’ll get better, …).

Last week, I finally found the courage to contact a doctor, that I will meet next Wednesday !

But now, I am getting really anxious. I won’t get into details, but I realized this weekend that I’ve been dealing with those heavy symptoms since May 2018, that I would take random medicine to cope with the pain and symptoms, and I’m actually worried that it’s actually something serious.

I know it’s ridiculous, but I keep googling my symptoms and I always find the most alarming results, such as different kind of cancers. I’m just so anxious to meet my doctor and hear a bad new. I can’t help but think about the worse.

Have you guys already been in a situation where you couldn’t bear the wait until a doctor’s appointment ? How do you deal with the anxiety of waiting ?

I wish you all a beautiful day.",10Feb2019,1
323,"I have this friend, let’s call her M. I’ve known her for about a year. She is lowkey abusive and i don’t know how to avoid her, since I see her in school everyday and all of my other friends are Kinda tied up with her.

First time I talked to her she’d just had a fight with her friends. She went and sat with us (me and my other friends) at lunch. I started talking to her, she was alright. Then I went and got water and when i got back she was giggeling like crazy. I sat down and continued eating. First bite in and I realize she had poured salt all over my food. I did not eat lunch that day, and i felt really bad throwing away food that was barely touched. I didn’t think much of it, just thought that maybe she was socially akward and did not know that that is not an okay thing to do to someone you’d known for about 10 minutes.

Fast forward about two months, my best friend moved to another country, so I started hanging out with M and another girl (let’s call her S) alot more than before. 

S is lowkey depressed ( has been diagnosed with depression), and M still insults her every day ( says that she is ugly, dumb and so on).

Two weeks later, We were walking home from school. My school has thorne bushes planted along the entrance. She decides it would be funny to push me into them. I was of course not prepared for that, so I fell right in to the thorne bush. She laughed. I started bleeding and I was limping When I stood up and tried to walk. All she did was continueing to laugh, although she knew that I live about a mile from the school and had to walk home.

I broke my hand about one and a half weeks ago, She was there, and legit made fun of me while I was crying. 

I enjoy drawing, and I was showing some of my drawings to S, cause She wanted to see them. M also likes drawing, but she doesn’t like it when I show people my art cause ( her words btw) ” it is not fair that I’m better than her at drawing or whatever”. She then decides that the apropriate reaction is tho throw her keys as hard as She can at my face, so that I start bleeding.

TL;DR my friend talks down to me and my other friends, has pushed me into a thorne Bush, and Thrown her keys at my face so I Started bleeding

What can I do?

326,"The only person who I’ve told and is supportive of me losing weight is my mom. And for some backstory on why I’m afraid my family won’t support me, is because when I started to lose weight by cutting calories (down to 1200 which is fine) my dad just lost his shit and started freaking out and accused me of starving myself. That’s something I really don’t want to experience again. Something that also happened the last time I lost weight is that I ended up developing an eating disorder, and my whole family knew about that and was afraid. I’m afraid that if I tell my family I’m gonna lose weight again, they’re going to think I’ll go back to the eating disorder, or make unwanted comments about it. My goal for losing weight currently is 1300 calories and exercising regularly. Basically, I don’t want my dad to have a shitshow again, and I don’t want the rest of my family to make rude comments or be afraid because of what happened last time I lost weight. So I’m secretly trying to lose weight in secret now and my family is unknowingly sabotaging me because my dad’s side of the family (but mostly my dad) likes to feed me so much unhealthy crap.

327,"The story is i met a girl that i fell in love with we started talking every single day for hours for like 2 months and then my bestfriend who knew all along how i felt towards her started talking to her too after he saw me talk to her at first i thought he was just talking to her as a friend and nothing more then he hit me with reality that him and her are dating, I was so hurt and heartbroken and i still dont talk to him to this day he still apporaches me and keeps asking me to forgive him every chance he gets.

As for the girl when she knew that i loved her she called me and told me why i didnt tell her how i felt before and then she started crying because the whole situation is fucked up she then asked me to continue talking to her and told me to promise her that i would never stop talking to her and i did because i felt so bad for her.

However, i realized after 1 month of that whole thing that it still hurts me so bad and me talking to her is only maling it worse because its not allowing me to forget her eventhough i love her and feel comfort when i talk to her its healthier for me to let go and move on so i did exactly that i called her and explained to her the whole situation she was very sar but understanding at the same time and told me she would do anything to make me feel better because she loves and cares about me so much.

329,"TL;DR: my ex-friend is calling me non-stop and on one hand I'm not sure wether I should talk to her cause something serious might have happened, but on the other hand I want to block her on social media because the thought of talking to her is making very anxious and unwell. I'm not sure wether I should call her back or block her 

Several months ago my best friend, Kate (18) had a psychosis breakdown. We both live in different countries, and I (17) was her go to friend through all this period, and she would always call me and talk to me whenever she felt down. However, whenever Kate talked to me she would always be rather rude, but I tried to ignore it seeing that she was going through a rough patch. 
One day she crossed the line, started personally insulting me out of nowhere, blocked me in every social media, and even bad mouthed to some of my friends. Of course I was worried sick, thinking she went through a break down again, and I tried to reach her every way possible, with no luck. Kate texted after a week or so, and didn't even apologize, and just talked as if nothing happened. That's when I realized how toxic our friendship was (due to many other instances before the whole breakdown), and I finally told her that we can't be friends anymore. And so we stopped talking. 
Several months passed and today, out of nowhere she called a about dozen times, and her mom is trying to reach me too. On one hand I have no interest in talking to her, and tbh I'm freaking out and I am really anxious right now, and due to the fact that she has this effect on me I'm thinking about blocking her, but on the other hand I'm worried that something serious might have happened to her wellbeing. So what should I do? Should I talk to her or should I block her?

333,"I’m sure a whole lot of people understand what I mean by *depression room*

When ur mental health is in absolute shackles and your rooms cleanliness just gets worse and worse.

I’ve been in a straight PIT for honestly about 5 years, and it is completely reflected by my bedroom. (In regards to my mental health overall, I’m working on it, I got to therapy and I’m just trying to work on it overall) 

I(19f) live mostly with my boyfriend but I do actually live at home, so allll of my belongings are here. My sister (24f) still lives at home too. 

So I guess what I really want some advice on, is how do I make my family realise just how difficult it is for me? 

They have always picked on me over how messy my bedroom is, they forever get angry with me and constantly pester me to tidy it. My dad will repeated about six times a day how much I need to tidy it, my mum understands a tiny bit more and since seeing me fully breakdown over it asks me a whole lot less. But then my brother (26m) and my sister both make fun of me all the time over it. They will constantly come into my room and make small comments, and nasty remarks “how have you not caught a disease yet” “are you even in here under this mess” etc etc.


I absolutely hate the state of my room and I do make small progress every day, but for the most part it is a tip, and it completely overwhelms me. I will have multiple breakdowns a week, just because of my room. When I do try to tidy it it absolutely exhausts me, if I’m in a good headspace when I start, and within maybe ten fifteen minutes I’m unable to continue. If I’m not in a good headspace first it’s even worse and I’m likely unable to even make it that far.

The comments my family make, makes it even harder to try to be positive about it, and when I’ve brought up before how tasking it is they don’t take me seriously. Or tell me I’m being overdramatic 


They definitely act this way bout my mental health in general, but that’s a task for another day... 


Any thing I’m able to say or explain would be so helpful. I feel like I’m literally drowning and it’s having such a big impact on me just by how they act about it.

335,"Hi.

I guess a bit of background is necessary? I'm a high school senior who just applied to colleges. It was a really, really stressful time for me and my parents (only child). I guess it is since I'm an only child, but they were so controlling: forcing me to show them every little thing I wrote, making me change details (not lying, just putting it in a different light), not letting me include what I wanted to on my application. Plus they forced me to do a project I really didn't want to. Led to lots of yelling and (me) crying.

The advice I'm asking for is twofold. The more important question: **How can I get my parents to see things from my point of view?** Even now, they're forcing me to do things I genuinely don't want to. I want to spend my time dedicated to my extracurriculars and my friends for my last year of high school. They want me to sit in front of a computer and write 24/7. My school just had a break for 1 week for Lunar; aside from going to practice in the morning for 2 hours and an extra course I enrolled in because I genuinely wanted to and basically begged to do it, I was forced to stay at home. One of the last long breaks before I graduate, and I basically had no interaction with my friends.

I tried to express this to my parents, but they just said, *""Oh, you need to do this. You can't go out; think about your future. If you just relax now, are you going to relax forever? Look at your dad! He's working so hard, everyday! Unless you're like this, you'll never succeed! Think about college: all the kids there play but they work so hard too. You can't do that, so you just need to work hard all the time.""* (general gist)

2nd question: **How can I stop myself from bursting into tears every time they criticize me harshly?** I don't know why, but whenever they start raising their voices, I just can't stop myself from crying. Today was especially bad; I actually stood up to them and told them to give me more freedom and to let me do what I wanted to for the last few months of high school. They started yelling at me, again about how everyone's working so much harder than me and that I'm lucky if any college wants me, that I'm so much worse than my friends, how I can't relax even when they are. And I just cried again.

Then came my breaking point: I accidentally knocked my phone off my desk, where it then hit the leg of my chair. The screen shattered. I told my dad (bc of course I'll tell them about this) and I got absolutely yelled at. *""Why are you on your phone?! Stop being so addicted to your phone and keep working! What is wrong with you? Why do you keep doing this? This is the 2nd time this has happened!""* And I just started sobbing. I really tried hard to not break my phone; I know there are no service centers in my country for this brand, and I'm a generally clumsy person. And having them accuse me like that really hurt. TBH, I'm still crying as I write this post. I just really don't know how I can stop myself from doing that.

I’ve been at my current job for almost 3 years. This is not my first job in this field.  I have loved my job from my first day there. My employer is fantastic and for the most part the coworkers are pretty good, too. When I first started everyone complained about one particular person to me. I’ll just call this person A.  I was told that A is annoying, tough to get along with, and generally just a pain in the back. At first, I thought everyone was just being whiny. A was overall great to work with. Sure, A has their quirks but who doesn’t! Then I started noticing little things that are more than just quirks. A started being more openly 2 faced, criticizing every little thing under the guise of “oh I’m just messing with you.” I alphabetized files and some pages got stuck together without my realizing it.  Later I was told, “I know you’re just trying to help but you did this wrong so don’t do it anymore.” Meanwhile, A makes the same exact mistakes consistently. On a weekly basis, I’ll be doing something and A will come up to me, physically take what I’m doing away from me and say “Do you want to go do xyz and I’ll do this?” I of course have no choice at this point because A has already taken my project away from me so I say “Yeah I guess so.” It literally doesn’t matter whether I’m holding something that’s 5grams or 50lbs. It will get taken out of my hands. Other days, I’ll be doing an unpleasant task that would be finished much quicker with 2 people and A will stand there without bothering to help.  Which wouldn’t bother me if they were actually doing anything useful at the time. However, more often than not, at those times A is on their phone browsing the web. A does have seniority since they have been there longer than anyone so that is also an issue. Basically, is there any way I can stand up for myself without being a total jerk about it?

Richard decided to get us a round of drinks, and while he was gone I realised that I really should get myself home so I didn't get myself into any grief, either of my own doing or another's. So I left. By myself. Alone. End of. 

A few months back, I received a few sly comments from a different coworker about Richard and I getting flirty at the party, and got quite snappy because I thought people were just winding me up. I didn't really think into it too much though. Now, I realise that they were teasing me because they had obviously heard some things from Richard that weren't true. 

So, I've found out another person (coworker mentioned up the top) has heard (likely) the same thing from Richard- if there are two, how many more people have been told this lie?! I'm concerned about my professional (and personal) reputation, especially as this supposedly took place at a work event. What's worst about this is, when my good friends (who are mutual friends of Richard and my other coworker) found out about this, Richard told them never to bring this up with me because I was embarrassed about it and always avoided him in the foyer when I saw him. I never see him in the foyer to deliberately avoid him, let alone do that, and it seems like that's just a front he wants to put up to stop me being exposed to his lie. 

I am beyond furious! What do I do? Do I confront him? Do I take this to HR? Is there anything I can do?

I mean, I never really had an issue with those that shaved their body hair, but to me it was always strange...but recently, I started to hate my body hair. I don’t want to shave my arm and leg hair, but I have hair in other places that just seem out of hand and need to be gone.

I decided on two things: I’m gonna trim my pubes and shave my ass hair. I think that’s a simple start and not an immediate change, but my question is a bit awkward and embarrassing, but I need some advice on it so I won’t tip toe around it..

How exactly do I shave my ass hairs? I some on my cheeks, and it’s sort of out of control between my cheeks and towards my crack. But I can’t just simply use a razor, right? That would be way too hard to get all the hair and not cut myself. And I want to use a method that would decrease the rate that it grows back, and kill the hair follicles (but I don’t want to do something completely crazy like laser hair removal, because that sounds really unnecessary).",10Feb2019,1

I'm currently 20 yo f college student thinking about leaving family. After my 1st year I have realized I'm not studying something I want to so I've decided to transfer to another college which will take 6 months till i can study again using that time working to get some money (have to wait about a month to register on new school, get accepted and wait for autumn for the first semester), after my mother found out she freaked out and told me she wont let me live In her house unless i pay her even more than i pay for my current rent even for that 6 months period when I'm working. I have part time job paying my expenses but cant afford that even though I'm home maybe every 2nd weekend.

All thats left from my family is my mother and my older brother and sister (which is the only one who worried about me) but sometimes it feels like I had no family at all.. we never spent any time together, my mother missed every ""milestone"" in my life, my prom, graduation, birthdays. When she divorced my father everything was a mess.. it was all out war between them and i was writing down some phone conversation between them from audio to paper and at one point where they argued about me she said that my brother is fine but I'm never gonna make anything, that i have no friends and I'm a complete failure, I never told her i heard it. When I've attempted suicide and went missing the only person searching for me was old highschool friend, none of my ""friends"" or family didn't care

&amp;#x200B;

When my grandfather died year ago he left about 40 000€ for studies. None of the money have been used and is sitting on my second account (shared with my mother) and I'm thinking about using it to get me through college, however if i touch it It's clear my mother will kick me out for sure so I can either 1. take the money, pack everything I got left at home and move out and most likely never see my family and maybe even people from my town again, changing my phone number maybe even name and leave my current life behind starting over alone 2. Continue going on somehow on new school and see my family from time to time risking i might not afford to pay the bills.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of everyone I know maybe 3-5 people would really miss me, the running away option is every day getting more likely but there is something inside me holding me back telling me even though my family is that way and nobody except my sister cared, if i do it i can never speak to them anymore, my mother will most likely try to turn everyone against me.

364,"I've been ""friends"" with this guy since I was 15 years old. I'm 20 now and he's a year older than me. We started hanging out when we got set up by a mutual friend to go to prom together. I just wanted to go to prom and I didn't care who with so our mutual friend asked him to take me. He said yes. But as it turns out, he was under the impression that it was an actual date and he had a massive crush on me. He's been obsessed with me ever since. I've told him I'm not interested numerous times but he continued to pursue me. Eventually he kind of moved on and stopped trying to get me to go out with him. After that we were just friends. 
The problem is, all he does is complain about how shitty his life is to me. I try to help but he always has some excuse as to why he can't make things better for himself. ""I'm stupid"" ""I'm not good at anything"" are common reasons as to why he believes he will work at Walmart for the rest of his life. He has had numerous relationships fail, he gets ghosted a lot, and he believes that none of it is his fault. He likes to argue about things he knows nothing about and when I give him factual information and credible sources his reply is "" you believe everything you read"". He says that he doesn't need credible sources because he has all the facts he needs. When I ask him what they are he says that he hates arguing. He never actually backs up his opinion, he just changes the topic. He also loves to insist that I think he's still obsessed with me. He goes on and on about how he's over me and how I need to get over myself. He will bring this up almost anytime that we argue even if it has nothing to do with the argument itself. I have told him that I know he's moved on and that I do not believe he has feelings for me but he continued to insist that I do believe it. He thinks I want him to like me because I like the attention. I'm in a long term relationship and I do not need his attention. We recently had a conversation about body image, going to the gym, etc. and he sent me a shirtless picture of himself. It pertained to the conversation but it was unnecessary and made me uncomfortable. I ignored it but later told my bf about it and he thought it was weird. So I texted my friend to let him know that it made me uncomfortable and that I would appreciate if he didn't do it again. He went off on me. He spun it around saying that it was rude of me to call him out for it and again brought up the ""I'm over you stop insisting I like you"" argument. I didn't bring that I up when I called him out. I simply said ""I forgot to mention this the other day, but if I don't say something I think it will happen again. Please don't send me shirtless pictures of yourself. It's weird and makes me uncomfortable. I don't send you unsolicited pictures of my titties. My boyfriend did not appreciate it either."" It might not have been the best way to put it but I never mentioned anything about him liking me. I don't know what to do. I'm so tired of him.

I’ve been at my current job for almost 3 years. This is not my first job in this field.  I have loved my job from my first day there. My employer is fantastic and for the most part the coworkers are pretty good, too. When I first started everyone complained about one particular person to me. I’ll just call this person A.  I was told that A is annoying, tough to get along with, and generally just a pain in the back. At first, I thought everyone was just being whiny. A was overall great to work with. Sure, A has their quirks but who doesn’t! Then I started noticing little things that are more than just quirks. A started being more openly 2 faced, criticizing every little thing under the guise of “oh I’m just messing with you.” I alphabetized files and some pages got stuck together without my realizing it.  Later I was told, “I know you’re just trying to help but you did this wrong so don’t do it anymore.” Meanwhile, A makes the same exact mistakes consistently. On a weekly basis, I’ll be doing something and A will come up to me, physically take what I’m doing away from me and say “Do you want to go do xyz and I’ll do this?” I of course have no choice at this point because A has already taken my project away from me so I say “Yeah I guess so.” It literally doesn’t matter whether I’m holding something that’s 5grams or 50lbs. It will get taken out of my hands. Other days, I’ll be doing an unpleasant task that would be finished much quicker with 2 people and A will stand there without bothering to help.  Which wouldn’t bother me if they were actually doing anything useful at the time. However, more often than not, at those times A is on their phone browsing the web. A does have seniority since they have been there longer than anyone so that is also an issue. Basically, is there any way I can stand up for myself without being a total jerk about it?

372,"Hi guys. I need some help. I’m a total mess. Basically, I’ve screwed up my undergrad completely and I have no idea what to do.

I graduated with honors from high school six years ago, and since then I have achieved nothing. Not even an associates degree. I went straight to a state university after high school but I had no idea what to study. I was majoring in neuroscience (don’t know why), got decent grades, but felt scared about what I would do with that degree. That fear, paired with immaturity and laziness (depression, maybe) made me want to take a break from school. After the first year, I moved home. 
Since then, I’ve gone to my local university, still no idea. I have majored in Computer Science, Nutrition, and Nursing since then. I’ve gotten decent grades in all of those introductory courses (probably because they’re easy.) Basically I have a lot of prerequisite courses and a lot of elective credits to my name.

Well now, I have no financial aid. I lost it due to not making satisfactory academic progress and taking too many breaks from school, which I totally understand. It is so embarrassing.

However, I ended up getting into a local associate’s degree nursing program at my community college. I can pay for it out of pocket as I’ve saved up money. But the thought of being a nurse scares me. I’m not really sure if I like it. I don’t know if I have any other options but to go through with that program. I mainly went for nursing because I heard they make good money and it is a stable job.

It will take my two years to complete that ADN program. Then another 1.5 years to complete an online bridge. To begin a career I may not like. 

I was looking at some online bachelor’s degrees that are paid for by working for certain companies. Considering I have all the prereqs done for most majors, I was wondering if it may be better for me to start working somewhere with those tuition reimbursement programs and finish my bachelors that way. It should take me the same amount of time as what I have planned with nursing. 

I think I’m the past I have tried to go for science-y majors or for things that sound impressive. My cousins are radiologists, veterinarians, doctors so I guess I wanted to be like them. But I think I like “softer” subjects like literature and foreign languages. I could envision myself being a librarian or school teacher maybe. 

I have no idea what I should do. Please give me some advice. If any one has been in a position similar to mine, what did you do?

Thank you.

Recently,  id say within the past 3 years,  my anxiety and depression has worsened severely. I have constant dizziness,  brainfog and fatigue. i feel constant guilt, anger, and feel very poorly about myself, often reminding myself of my failures and all the ways i am a bad person. I began realizing that my abusive and neglected past was seeping through. To help with the anxiety I started self medicating with alcohol (not drinking every day,  but to excess every time) and it got to the point where i would black out and lash out at my friends.  After this i realized i had a problem and started going to therapy for the first time. However the physical symptoms make it very difficult to function and interfere with my work and concentration and I'm afraid it will never get better. 

Since im 29 and have basically no attachments, i thought now would be the time to move to Vegas with my friends who are nurses there.  I'm very unhappy with where i'm at,  and while i'm well liked,  valued and excel at work, it has become unhealthy and toxic for me for many other reasons.  As unhappy as i am at work, i'm also afraid to leave.

I believe my work is a big contributor to my  mental health, and i'm so ready to move on.  But at the same time it would be foolish to not take the opportunity. 


I just don't know what to do.  Im unhappy and depressed.  What if i'm still unhappy and depressed after moving? What if it's just the way i am?  Should I leave my stability and good job for the unknown in Vegas? Or further attach myself to a place i feel i don't belong by taking the promotion. ",10Feb2019,1

384,"Hey yall! Essentially the title, last summer I spent 2 months in South Korea at Yonsei International Summer School and had the absolute time of my life. I made ridiculously amazing friends, got started on learning the language (which I have continued back home), clubbed every weekend etc. etc.

One of my best friends from the summer is returning to do their internship program, which is not guaranteed but something I would definitely apply for if I did return, and wants me to go back with him. And initially I think yes, as I don't see myself going somewhere where I am not studying the language and I had such an amazing time before, but I cant help but feel trepidation as I consider my plans.
 
Basically, I feel like all of the experiences I had that created this perfect summer couldn't be replicated and I am treading on all of the great memories by just doing the same program again. All of the unfamiliarity to culture and language and being totally foreign to everything in South Korea played such a big part to my experience so that aspect would just be out the window. A part of me knows this is silly to think, but I can't shake this feeling that I'm lame for wanting to go and do the same exact summer program rather than branch out, as if I'm holding on to past memories that I know I would compare all new experiences to.

So is this feeling justified in any way, or does it not make sense at all? I'm unsure of what to do alternatively as a sophomore with little knowledge related to my major so internships have been difficult, and I'm not looking to stay home! ",10Feb2019,1

392,"We were married from late 2016 until January this year but have known each other since 2004. It started when we got back from our honeymoon and she sucker punched me for calling her out on a lie. So, I started recording everything I possibly could when I could see things turning for the worse.

A few months after we got back from our honeymoon, I caught her in another lie and she got in a good right hook on my nose. A few minutes later she admits she cheated and wants to move past it. This whole exchange is videoed, including her pulling a knife on me and running into the street threatening to kill herself and a whole slew of other instances.

Not only is it embarrassing coming to work with a bruised up face, but she knew I would never hit her back. Partly due to my upbringing, mostly because “I don’t key my own car” and I knew if I did I would lose the game no matter what she had done up until that point. It didn’t stop her from harming herself and telling our friends and her people that I did it. Luckily I have her trying to choke herself and banging her head off a wall and other videos of insanity to back me up that she will do anything and play as dirty as she can including emotional and financial abuse, which is a novel in and of itself.

It took a while to get the funds together to get free after moving halfway across the country for her and enough failed attempts at reconciliation to give up. Lawyers weren’t much help considering I’m a 6’3 and 190 pounds ex-serviceman and she’s 5’3 and 130 pounds, but, they said it’s a bad deal all around and good luck.

Being diligent and exercising the utmost in self control is what kept me out of jail, especially when she started dating a LEO while we were married and still living in the same house.

Supposedly, the statute of limitations for three counts of violence within a one year time frame is three years. I’m still within that timeframe, however, my main concern and primary objective is to get my experience out there so that maybe I can keep another man from ruining his life over a girl and getting locked away in a box. None of my support system had any clue on how to deal with something like that and I was left to figure it out by myself. I was told by my expensive lawyer to keep being a good boy and keep my mouth shut until the divorce was finalized.

So, now that the papers are signed and filed, what platforms/outlets/avenues would be best suited to my endeavor? I had thought about just piecing together a highlight reel and dropping it on social media/YouTube/sending it to her sponsors and employers/etc.. I know I’d get instant gratification from taking the low road but I’d rather capitalize on the material and help someone else out there who’s battling on their own.

Thanks.

394,"I texted my dad late last night, saying I wanted to see a doctor about depression and that I didn't want to talk about it. This morning he said I'll get help, that it'll be fine. That was around 9:00AM. It's now noon and my mom has been yelling for three hours.

I'm an attention seeker, apparently. The sole reason that I turned gay and transgender was because my friend E is transgender and I wanted to be cool. I wanted to be cool so badly that for the last four years I haven't spoken a word of my feelings to anyone around me, because I am just That Cool. I know, really badass. I just want so much attention that I don't say anything.

My mom thinks I just want attention. She's turning this into something about her. Sure, she is the main source of all stress and depression in my life, but I've never told her that. She just already knows. She believes that I am going to singlehandedly destroy the entire family because I want to feel emotions sometimes. All I want is to be happy. I haven't talked to my mom at all today, mind you. I literally haven't spoken a word to her. I am an ungrateful child (also a tranny dyke respectively) and all I want to do is dedicate my life to destroying a 50 year old mom with a marriage only hanging on for the 'sake of the children' (its for my dads money everyone knows that she cant work a day in a real job)

Yes, Leisa. I, a fifteen year old ""tranny dyke"", who couldn't even lift a gallon of milk securely up until a year ago, am going to dedicate my entire life to making you feel bad.

I'm starting to think that maybe she just has some weird god complex. Also, I've never told her I was trans and gay. I was forcibly outed as trans by my cousin online somehow and ever since then I have been the worst child in the history of the world. Right now, my mom (who has expensive makeup, orders stuff from amazon every day, has TWO LAPTOPS AND TWO PHONES) is complaining that this year for our spring break trip, we are going to Florida. A nice florida resort. Shes upset because it isnt a cruise. Oh no! I cant possibly be relaxed in this five star florida resort on the beach :(

I'm using humor and sarcasm to mask the fact that I am killing myself internally at every second. I don't feel safe to leave my room, all I asked for was some help with depression.

So hi im bam and i am 14 years of age.Recently(for the past lets say year)my head is well not like it used to be.I mightve grown up too fast but i just started thinking about how shitty my life is,how much i dont like everyone around me and that im in a bad position in life.

Im a lazy ""smart"" kid who spent so far spent his life on youtube watching so much different types of content where he gained the power of engrish and got a cert.Although its a B1 it still was my acomplishment and probably the last.The only thing im confident about is my english and lately im even losing confidence in that.

Then there are games the thing ive loved ever since i got my first pc but even they lost a bit of their appeal in like 2017 which was kinda the beginning of all of my problems.Then i fell in love for the first time and that was a thing but it basically ended in me getting hurt because she had her own problems(mainly depression)and didnt even want a relationship in general.Said she was focused on her school work.Still kinda heartbroken after that ngl.Then i started online dating,got into a relationship that lasted like a month with a girl that lied about her real age(she told me she was 15 while she in reality was 13)i didnt love her the same way i did my first crush love thing but it did make me happy for a short period of time i guess.

After that i went through a tough week where my life turned into a bleak mushy mess of confusion and just pure apathy.

Now im here playing apex legends which i hope is the fortnite killer and it does make me happy but i just cant play for 8 hours like i used to.Everything is so boring and bleak and ive lost the will to do anything i liked doing. Now ive got this big ass test which determines what middle school i go to(serbian education system for yall americans out there google it if youre interested i cant be bothered to explain)where i basically have to know everything we did for the last 4 years in every subject. Ive never studied in all my 8 years of school and my hard core brain power is what has been pushing me through this.But now that wont help. Now you tell me what the fuck im supposed to do.

And another thing:my brain wants a gf and a real friend which he hasnt acquired even though he has a friend who hangs out with him all day. But yeah i have no real friends. That gf thing tho i suspect is bcs i want hugs and cuddles unlike other boys my age but its hard for me to find one bcs im unable to find a suitable partner. Plus ive never went out bcs im scared of all the normies out there and honestly i dont see the point.

411,"I have worked for this vet hospital for almost a year now in a kennel position. There's 3 of us kennel attendants. Me, Brenda who's in her 60s (I think) and Tanner who is maybe 30M. 

Pretty much since the beginning, Brenda has decided she hates me. She isn't a supervisor, but she is in a way since she is the most senior employee. It's ""her"" kennel and everything we do is based on how she wants it done. However for the most part kennel works alone (as opposed to other departments where there's usually 2 employees per shift). 

When I was being trained by the guy I replaced, he warned me that Brenda usually hates new hires until they buckle and do things the Brenda way. So right from the start I've tried doing things the Brenda way. I don't really care, I've cleaned many kennels many different ways. However she wants it done, I'll do it.

The thing is... I never seem to do it right. Week after week I'll come in to a note from her. ""Rede, you missed a pee spot on the toilet"" ""Rede, there was a hair in a dog run. If you aren't going to clean them out, leave a note so I know to do it."" ""Rede, you didn't pick up trash around the clinic because there was a wrapper in the gutter.""

Usually it's crap like that: things I definitely did do, but something out of my control happens (wind blows more trash into gutter over night, dog hair sheds and drifts, etc). I've tried explaining that to her to no avail. I've tried picking up every single little speck that could possibly be considered dirt and it's never enough. 

We've even reached the point where Tanner will do something like clean the drain wrong and she will blame that on me. 95% of the things she complains about me doing wrong, she doesn't tell me. She tells Tanner when they work together, and she goes to our *boss* about these things. Luckily both Tanner and our boss are like ""Brenda we don't fucking see anything"" or Tanner will say ""Brenda that was me that messed up"". She'll just go ""oh"" and point out something else ""I"" did. 

We don't have an HR, the practice is owned by our boss and she's been aware since the start of all of this. To my understanding, she's tried to get Brenda to chill out but Brenda just will not. So talking to my boss won't accomplish anything.

I've tried *everything*. I've tried talking to her, I've tried killing her with kindness (I smile and thank her for pointing out what I've missed, I voluntarily covered her shift last minute when her granddaughter was being delivered etc). I've tried ignoring it. Brenda's own son who occasionally works there told me I can't take it personal, it's just how she is.

Friday she left me a ton of laundry to fold. (Brenda can decide not to do things and leave them for me, but the other way around = I'm a shit employee). I mentioned it in passing to Tanner, who mentioned it to Brenda because she texted me stating ""If you have a question as to why something didn't get done, you need to ask me so we can resolve it. I didn't fold the laundry because I was busy doing all the things you didn't do the night before."" I decided not to respond because everything I could think of would only fire her up further. 

It's really starting to affect my work ethic. I do work hard, I may not get every stupid speck of dirt but it's clean. If I miss a water mark in the corner of the mirror I don't do it on purpose! But if I miss a small stupid spot she accuses me of not doing anything at all. I'm in school to switch to an actual career away from the animal world and my projected grad date is hopefully this summer, then I take a certificate exam and hopefully I'll leave after that. But in the mean time... I'm starting to wonder why I should give this job my all when all I'm gonna get is bitched at for small things or even things I'm not at fault for. 

Do I just continue ignoring her? Is there anything I can say to someone like her? I've tried outright asking her but she won't talk to me face to face, only in notes or texts. If I ask her she just smiles and says everything is fine and she doesn't hate me. Tanner thinks she'll retire soon but I think she will be there until the end of time. 

TLDR; coworker blames me for literally every small thing even if it's completely out of my control, or if someone else did it and I wasn't even there. Boss knows she's nuts, doesn't know how to stop her. It's starting to affect my work ethic. Wtf can I do???",10Feb2019,1
412,"Hello,

I am currently 15 years old and am visiting the eleventh grade in Germany. Since I skipped a grade at early age, I pretty much will turn 17 when I have finished school. And in a certain way, I am not comfortable with the idea of going into the wide wide world at that age; I simply do not feel mature enough. By this I do not mean that I want to stay home with my parents, I rather mean that I want to stay another year in school, but not in Germany.

I do not have a lot of friends in Germany, at least I do not consider them as friends. To give you an example for this: The last time that I was invited into a birthday party was in eleventh grade, a couple of months ago. Doesn't sound bad right? But I was only invited, because the whole class was invited. Before that, the last time I was invited to a birthday party was in fifth grade.  I do not have a lot of problems with that, since I do not see a lot of need in making friendships with the people I currently know. Not because of arrogance, just because I think that we do not have a lot of similarities. 

You might wonder why I am telling you about all of this although this is not topic-related at all?

Well, adults talk about the youth like it is some kind of holy thing. ""Ahh, I fell in love with her.."" or maybe ""My best friend and I...."" is what they say. And I want to experience this too, since I am afraid of growing up and reaching adulthood. I know that this time should be the best and most precious time in my entire life, but nevertheless  I did not had a good friend in ages nor was I in love. When I am thinking about my life, I do not feel *the* happiness. Maybe my conclusion ,that I have to visit another countries' school, is wrong, but I cannot explain the missing adventures in school life, since I am not a heartless, asocial or gifted psychopath: I am pretty normal and I want to have a really fun and normal life.

So what do I want:

I want to experience some sort of nice school life, if possible in industrialized countries outside of Europe, such as the US, Canada or maybe more exotic countries such as Japan. Other ideas/solutions about my future are very welcome as well, but please have in mind that I will be 17 then.

Do you have any ideas that you want/can to share? In this case, please leave it down below.

With best regards,

414,"So my sister has been dealing with several issues in the past few years, mostly involving alcohol. Her and her boyfriend have been living with my mom \(rent free\) for the past year or so, which hasn't been going so well. Now, let me clarify real quick, my mom is the nicest, most giving person I have ever met. She raised me and my 4 siblings pretty much by herself once she divorced from my abusive dad, paid my sister's rent for two years who couldn't pay it because she was jobless, took care of her dying parents while working 40\+ hour weeks. You know, she's one of those moms that always puts her children and family first.

Anyway, my sister \(who we strongly suspect is bipolar due to her violent mood swings\) has been lashing at my mom since she moved back in from school. She claims that my mom treats her different and is a bad mom, etc. She also started drinking heavily. We found her passed out on the toilet a few times, on her bedroom floor, even on the deck. Then 2 days before this past Christmas, she had a suicide attempt. She was forced into a rehab for a few days and promised my mom that she would attend an out patient program, but never did.

Now, after 2 years of being jobless, she and her boyfriend both have a job, but they haven't told us where it is. We assume they're working in a kitchen, as they both have a culinary degree and work long hours, but we couldn't figure out why they refused to tell us where it is. Then today, my sister told my mom that shes planning to move out, and she isn't telling us where she's going. She's getting a new phone number, blocking all of us, and claims that she never wants to see any of us ever again. 

I've been really angry at my sister the past few years, but the last thing I want is to lose her forever. She's been really distant to me, which has been really hard for me to deal with since me and her used to be so close. This is something I never thought I would have to go through, and the worst part is thinking that she really must not care about us if she's willing to cut us off like this. I love my sister, and its hard for me to watch her do this.

415,"I don’t want to give too much detail for obvious reasons but here’s the story. Soon after my friend started her job, her boss came on to her at an office party and she ended up staying with him that night and they had consensual sex. This happened again a few times. While it was consensual at this point, certain things were already concerning like how much he’d encourage her to drink every time and how he’d manipulate her by complimenting her and telling her he’d take care of her at work. She didn’t say no at all at this point but she definitely wasn’t initiating anything either. At this point in the story, would it be considered harassment/assault due to the power imbalance? 

After a few times of this happening, she started feeling really uncomfortable and decided to cut it off. She told him she didn’t want to continue and at first he tried to convince her to, but then he accepted it. While he stopped asking her to come home with him, he didn’t stop texting her in a flirty manor and other subtle things that are inappropriate for a boss to do. 

Fast forward a month or so and an incident happened while they were at a conference. She had decided a long time ago she wouldn’t have more than 1 or 2 drinks while with him and she was sticking to that. But he took her and some other coworkers out one night and he kept ordering her drinks. However, she said she really didn’t have much to drink and she felt fine until the very last drink when she suddenly blacked out for the rest of the night. I wonder if he drugged her drink but we’re really not sure. Anyways, she wakes up in his bed next morning to him taking off her clothes and trying to have sex with her. She told him to stop and he did but that night really affected her. She also found out that night that he is consistently sleeping with another coworker.

Background info is she lives in West Virginia (different state from mine) with her 16 year old daughter and up until this weekend, her long time boyfriend. She has not worked in several years, first from helping raise her now 19 year old son who has severe mental illness and behavioral problems, and later because of her own health problems. Her 16 year old hasn't been in school for at least a year, maybe longer. She missed class a lot for various health issues, and getting into fights, etc. She did join job corp this year upon turning 16 but left after a month because she needed her gallbladder removed. Allegedly she is supposed to rejoin next year. My sister's health problems include stomach bleeding, acid problems, several ulcers in her stomach. She just had surgery to remove a large cyst from her thyroid gland last month.

&amp;#x200B;

She lives in a trailer that our aunt owns but is supposed to pay her $425 a month for utilities and lot rent. The issue is, her boyfriend, who used to be a great guy, has dealt with some PTSD from his time in the military and after losing 2 family members he was very close to, has turned to drugs. I believe he is on meth, not sure about others. They are a few months behind on what they owe because he's been spending all the money on food and drugs.  From what I understand today, he left her today after she discovered that he was sleeping with other women and men in exchange for drugs and also possibly found some underage porn in his possession.

So I 100% own the home I’m in and I have a good job (50-60k per year)(in management) with promises to move up the ladder into better posistion down the road. I allready have an associates degree in a field where there’s plenty of work(Insturmentation)

But I’ve always been interested in Engeeinering but the newest college that offers accredited program is out of state a few hours away. I would buy a house(there very reasonably priced where I’m looking at) I would rent the house I allready own. I have a friend who just took a job in the city and said he would rent a room from me(more income)(we’ve lived together in the past with no problems) also the army will now pay me to go to college so my finances would be fine.

He automatically assumes that I won't be able to get a job and its, he said (and i quote) ""a bad uni"" because its ranked 106 on [usnews.com](https://usnews.com/). Essentially he's saying I don't have a choice what I get to do, and where I get to do, because its his money that pays for it, I've had him talk to multiple students from the college itself, and a couple of my friends, but he simple doesnt wan't do move from his stubborn points, and doesnt listen to me whatsoever. Every time I talk to him, I end up yelling at him, and I just don't want to talk to him anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

My family lives in Colorado, my brother went to New Orleans for his 30th birthday with a group of friends and his girlfriend and I got a garbled text from him at about 5 am this morning saying he was in the hospital. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently he was on Canal Street which is a fairly busy area from what I've been told. There was a ""party bus"" and some people on it were harassing a homeless person. My brothers friend stepped in (they are all skinny, dorky types, not tough guys) and found himself surrounded. My brother told the group of harassers that they were leaving and didn't want any trouble. While walking away (back turned) he was punched in the base of the head, knocked out and hit his face on the concrete, losing 3 teeth and breaking his jaw in several places. The friend who originally intervened was punched as well but only had minor injuries.

&amp;#x200B;

The hospital in New Orleans got him patched up and my mom bought him a plane ticket, he will be arriving back in Denver in a few hours. A police report was filed but apparently the police only got the ID of a single person on the bus. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother is uninsured and the ER said he needed to have surgery immediately. A dentist also came and pulled what was remaining of his 3 front teeth. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm beyond shocked about what happened, my family is looking to me for advice and I'm googling as fast as I can but I'm a little lost. The advice I've given so far:

1. Get pictures of the medical report so we can explain to a Denver hospital what has been done and what needs to be done.
2. Call a personal injury law firm in N.O. that has contacts with a private investigator, found suggestions here ([https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/7y8xme/who\_are\_some\_of\_the\_best\_personal\_injury/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/7y8xme/who_are_some_of_the_best_personal_injury/))
3. Get on the detectives ass to get the surveillance footage of the area to ID the guy who did it
4. Try calling a local TV station with the story/pictures

Not sure what to do when he gets back, should we just take him to an ER at a public hospital (like Denver Health?). Can he be turned away without payment? He is currently uninsured, and makes too much for medicaid (he works part time for the public utility and is graduating next semester to a full time job with benefits).

As the title says. I don’t remember how this type of marriage is called. My parents are “modern” religious and tend to keep traditions. On the other hand, I’m agnostic and hate most of the traditions in my hometown. So, one of traditions is that men and women should marry as early as possible. My father married my mom when he was 21 and she was 20, and their marriage was too organized by their parents. 

Now they’ve been persuading me to marry a second girl they found which they think suits me and she is “normal” and her family is “normal too”.  For more than a year they are saying I should marry and have a family as soon as possible. Every time I said I don’t agree and don’t want to. They told me many times that I will regret not marrying now and contrary all I think is that I will regret marrying this early. 

Honestly, I suffer from mild depression and I’ve been trying to work on the causes of this depression. And my parents don’t see it and in general it seems like they don’t worry or think about mental health. I don’t want to talk about it with them because their parenting is one of the reasons I hate myself sometimes. That said, I think this marriage will just worsen my mental health. 

Maybe it is important to mention but I don’t think I’m unattractive at all. I watch my hairstyle, clothes and somewhat fit. However I’m sometimes socially awkward with people.

This is my second year (second busy season) working. Not big 4, but still big 10, and I really don't like the work I am doing at all. I like a lot of the people I work with as they are mostly my age, and the flexibility is really nice. I honestly don't really mind the hours, and although busy season is A LOT at times, it isn't unbearable. But the work is so boring. I enjoy working with the clients and talking with them, but 95% of my time is just sitting at a computer copying shit we did last year. Like so much of the work is so mindless and repetitive. I really don't understand how people like this stuff or have a passion for accounting. I got into this major because I was in general business in college and just didn't know what to do. My dad would push for accounting and he said it was great job security and good money, which it is, but it is also so boring. The classes weren't too hard so I thought why not and went into accounting.

I really don't know what to do at this point and kind of feel stuck in this career path, and the longer I stay in it the harder it will be to get out. My passions have been fitness, as I used to play football, rugby, and baseball, and I still work out often, and I always wanted to make a career out of fitness, or even go into the marines but I just felt the money wouldn't be great, and I feel like I wouldn't be going down the path my parents would have wanted.

- He's a bit too promiscuous. Now it's not my business, he can fuck whoever he wants, and whenever he wants it.

See, at first it was all fine and dandy. Me and k were best friends, we did everything together. It was awesome, my sister, k and I were super close. But as time went on I started drifting from my sister and getting closer to k. Well fast forward 2 years, my ex (19f) had just broken up with me, this person is k’s sister. so that kinda put a strain on our friendship, but we were still relatively close. After a year of being broken up I decided I wanted to try dating guys again. K did not approve, she was the one who wanted me to date her sister in the first place claiming ”i want to see you with a girl”. K wouldn't blatantly say she doesn't want me to date guys but it was very obvious. (she outed me as bisexual to 2 of my sisters in a very passive aggressive way) We slowly started to drift apart, which I was sad about. We had been friends for so long and I thought she really cared for me. Well I started talking to someone amazing, a guy. We started going out a lot which eventually led to us being in a relationship. I tried multiple times to get k to come say hi and get to know him but everytime I would try to call her over she would blatantly ignore me. She started talking shit about him to my little sister, even though she had never even said one word to him. I was upset and angry when my sister told me this and stopped talking to her with no explanation. (which may be where I fucked up) We were no longer friends in my book. About 4 months later k cheats on my sister with, you guessed it, a guy. I was so pissed off and hurt. How could she do that to my sister? How can she be so hypocritical? My sister and k break up for a few months, but k still lives with my sister, they still sleep in the same bed and everything. (wtf) they ”get past it” and start dating again, claiming they are going to work through their problems. Good for them. My mom still loves k. The rest of my family does not. Well k keeps texting me, her first text was rude, then all of sudden she wants to be nice an apologize saying she misses me. I forgot to mention how manipulative k was. There are heaps of stories I could share with you but right now I just want to stick to the real reason I am here. Anyways, im afraid if I don't text her back my mom and sister will be angry with me furthuring our broken relationship. I'm also afraid that if I speak my mind and tell k how I feel they will still be angry with me. It's like no matter what I do they will never understand my side of this and continue to make me feel like a bad person for not wanting to be her friend. So my question is, what should I do? I'm so lost. I don't want to ruin the relationship with my sister but I need k to just leave me alone and let me live my life.

456,"So my 13 year old niece has had a trans boyfriend for a few months and now she is claiming to be trans as well and I'm not really sure how to talk to her about it or if i even should. 

A bit of background: she has always been pretty girly liking dresses, makeup, doing her nails and hair. She has never said anything about not feeling right or acted uncomfortable with herself beyond the normal preteen stuff. She was even super excited to go get her first bras a year ago. This whole thing only started once she started dating this boy (who is very sweet and kind). 

Now I have been a trans rights supporter for years and I'm not really sure if i should say something or not. I'm 99.9% this is a phase and a way for her to get some attention (the oldest of 7 and pretty much gets ignored or treated like a babysitter) and my issue with it is her claiming a struggle that isn't really hers. 

Some advice would be great, thanks ❤",10Feb2019,1
457,"I'm in my final semester of grad school, doing my final project and one last class. The class is educational research but it's very philosophy-heavy. We're currently in week 4, so about a quarter of the way through. Generally I do fine academically, but with this particular class, I've been really struggling to get through the readings and feel depressed and anxious as I read/take notes. In class (which thankfully only meets once per week) I feel even worse, and have been sitting in the back row in the hope that nobody notices when I start crying during class. (Not like full on weeping or anything.)

&amp;#x200B;

This week, I think I figured out why. Philosophy and the nature of reality and knowledge and all that was the pet topic of my abusive ex, who would often want to have conversations about it, then berate me for being too stupid to understand. He'd give me things to read on the subject, and then react the same way if I didn't enjoy/understand them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, I figured out why it was bothering me--subconsciously bringing up bad memories or whatever--so now I can get over it. Right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently fucking not, because now I feel even worse and more distracted as I'm trying to do the work for this class. I realize how absolutely absurd this sounds. I was hesitant to even post about this because I'm already imagining the ""triggered snowflake"" jokes in my head. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have to take this specific course to graduate. I also can't just drop out because I have to complete the program I'm in to finalize a provisional professional license I hold--basically I have to do this in order to keep my current job. I just feel like this is so stupid--*I'm* so stupid for letting this affect me. The class also has an extremely strict absence policy, so I can't just skip meetings, either.

460,"I’m 23. I graduated college with a ba in psych in May. In June, I accepted a full time position in a drug and alcohol rehab. Long story short, it was extremely understaffed/unsafe, drugs everywhere, and insurance fraud was committed constantly. To top it all off, I had to get wrist surgery in January because of this place. Once workman’s comp paid for my operation, I quit. 

My surgery occurred in early January and was a doozy. I tore an entire complex of ligaments, my tfcc which is a shock absorber, and needed a lot of inflammation removed. I’ve been immobilized since surgery and see my doctor in three weeks. I’ll then begin therapy. PT stated I’ll be splinted still for another 4-6 weeks. That puts me in a splint until APRIL. I can’t weight bare/use the arm for another 2 months. Full recovery isn’t expected for 6 months. 
Needless to say, I’ve been really struggling from surgery. At this rate, I feel like it’s never ending. 

I ended up going back to the restaurant I worked in throughout high school/college. I’m there full time just answering phones and hostessing. The flexibility allows me to attend appointments and therapy without any issues. I also can work regular hours without accommodations.

I will not begin the job hunt again until I’m confident I’m 100%. Let’s be honest.. a new employer isn’t going to put up with tardiness, leaving early, absences within the first 90 days. 

I want to be damn sure I’m as good as I’m going to get before I tell the insurance company that I’m fine again. So I plan on taking a few months once cleared to go do whatever my heart desires to see what the arm/wrist can handle.

466,"So, i’m not really a desired person at school so i guess that might be why i attract the creepy boys lol. basically in math class last semester i met a boy who started his conversation with me with writing “u r very cute” on the calculator, I didn’t really see anything wrong with it at first. Until he kept touching me in class and following me. after that day he suddenly stopped talking to me? Then like three weeks after he took my phone from my hands in class and while i tried taking it from him he started laughing and added/followed himself on my snapchat and instagram. That night he started spamming me on snapchat with “talk to me” and “hello”. After that i immediately blocked and unblocked him on both Instagram and Snapchat just so he could get off of my friends list, i was too shy to block but oh god i am so mad at myself for not blocking. I saw him mentioned on my friends story i’d say about three months later? and my stupid self added him again. It went fine for a few weeks, he just responded to my story most of the time when i posted memes but then the night before my birthday he started asking me to play truth or dare, i was fine with it because usually when you play truth or dare it’s harmless fun. after a few silly questions he said something like “well are you a freak?” and set the chat to 24 hours. i asked what he meant and he said “sexual”. i said i would rather not answer. it sounded like he got mad about it or something because he was all like “you don’t even trust me with anything, you aren’t in the mood for anything”. i told him to calm down and that we could keep playing if he wasn’t so invasive but, he didn’t want to listen and kept asking me to tell him what turns me on and that if i don’t he would be “very mad”. i told him i don’t like him like that and he just kept repeating that it makes him feel sad that “i don’t trust him”. i just let him go on about it for a while, he said he wouldn’t ask me again, at this point i was so annoyed lmao. he just kept asking me questions like “does your friend like me?” and i just replied with simple yes and no answers. then he asked me to “dress dirty” for him and he kept begging me and spamming me. that’s when i unadded again. now ever since then he has somehow thought that i like him and keeps touching me and following me in class? he has a bunch of other girls that he flirts with and he basically is friends with almost everyone. my friend is friends with him and she is always walking around him when i’m with her. recently in theatre class my group gave him my number for a project even though i said i wasn’t comfortable giving people my number. i’ve blocked his number. it’s just that he is a friends with a lot of my friends and a lot of cool people. i told one of my close friends about how he is making me uncomfortable but she said i need to stop being so sensitive and let him be himself.  people don’t take me seriously and this guy is just creeping me out, i am scared because he has literally everyone with him and when i back away from him people at school think i’m weird. any advice to get him away?

468,"I graduated last May with an undergraduate degree in a social science field. Because I was on a four-year scholarship  (full-tuition + stipend) but graduated in three years, my school has allowed me to apply my final year of scholarship towards graduate school. Last semester was my first semester of graduate school, so this semester is the last semester that I'm on scholarship. If I stay in graduate school, I can graduate in December.

However, the reason I'm writing this is because I'm very unhappy. 

I'm currently taking four classes (the normal is three), I work twenty hours per week at a nonprofit, and once a week I drive a friend who is dealing with what has become a long-term mobility issue (he's basically learning how to walk again) to and from his physical therapy. Because he lives 45 minutes away from me, the therapy is 40 minutes from his house, and the therapy session itself is an hour, this is about the first third of the day on a day when I also have work and school. (He doesn't have reliable transportation and has had several bad experiences with services like Uber (which are also expensive.))

I don't enjoy the subject I'm studying in school. I didn't enjoy the subject I studied in my undergrad either, but I realized that bills don't pay themselves, and considering that I still don't know what I really want to do in life, I decided it'd be most practical to get a degree that I can support myself with. (I know this might seem counter-intuitive, considering that I mentioned that my undergrad was in a social science field, but my major is one of the more practical disciplines in that sector. (No offense to social science majors out there! Just my opinion.))

I'm planning on dropping the class that's been the biggest thorn in my side so far this semester if I hear back from my adviser that doing so won't keep me from graduating in December. But even if I were to drop that class, I still don't know if I'd be happy. I go to a job I don't enjoy, I go to classes I don't enjoy, I come back home and do homework I don't enjoy. The best part of my day is sleep, because I can just forget about all of the day's worries. I don't feel like I have time to myself anymore. I don't feel like I'm growing as a result of school. I just feel like life is beating me down.

The only reason I decided to go for a graduate degree was because I felt I'd be throwing money away if I didn't utilize the final year of my scholarship. And I recognized that getting a graduate degree would increase my earning potential, so that even if I'm not yet participating in my dream job, I could at least be making better money while I figure out what that dream job is. But now, I don't know if that's worth it. I don't know how I'm going to get through 2019, because so far every day is a drag.

I'm sorry for the length and scatterbrained quality of this post, I just needed to vent. I appreciate anyone who has any words of advice. Thank you.

Note:  In case the finances regarding paying for graduate school factor into any advice anyone may have: finishing out my graduate degree over the summer and fall semesters will cost about $10,000. Because I live with my parents and am able to save most of the money I earn at work, I currently have a bit more than $10k in my savings.

Note 2: After writing the first Note, I'm starting to think that maybe quitting my job might actually be the better option? Dropping out of school hurts my future earnings potential. I've already saved enough money to cover the rest of my graduate school education. Would I be a bum for living with my parents and not working when I have an undergrad degree?",10Feb2019,1

475,"When I was in my early twenties, right before I got my bachelor's degree, I had a picture of what I expected my life to look like in a few years. I expected to be living on my own, have a good paying and stable job, a significant other and just general sense of happiness. I wasn't expecting nor wanted an extravagant life, just \*something\* that would make me look forward to every day. 

I just turned 28 in January and it's almost as if the exact opposite of what I had hoped for happened. I feel hopeless and empty at almost all times of the day, like there's nothing for me to look forward to. For the last several years, I've started to develop this apathetic view of my life stemming from feelings of envy, jealousy, depression, anxiety, sensitivity and fear towards my future. I've noticed now that I've always carried these feelings, but they weren't so prominent in my early twenties and it's likely because I still had a very positive outlook in my life then. 

Now that I'm almost 30 and my life hasn't shaped itself into what I wanted, all of these feelings are now amplified. I'm envious and jealous of what I hear and see people have that I don't. The smallest things people say or do get to me  to badly to the point that I blow things out of proportion. I have little to no self confidence now. Before I had at least \*some\*. I still live with my parents because I chose to go to school another year and get my master's degree. I've paid off my school debts and a new car and have very little money now. I absolutely \*need\* to move out because my parents insist on treating me like a child still, but I don't know if I'll be able to handle the expenses of living by myself in an expensive city. I just started a new job paying $60k a year after having left one that paid me $75k because the company I worked for was too unstable--it began giving me intense anxiety where I would wake up in the middle of the night unable to go back to sleep because of all these thoughts relating to work raced through my mind. My new job isn't like this, but there's something about it that feels so artificial to me, like the work I do is cold, empty and meaningless. Everyone around me is so cheery and I'm just there, sitting at my desk so serious. I try to feign happiness while I'm there and it just taxes me. The things I did on the side, my hobbies, just don't appeal to me as much anymore. 

Mentally, I just feel like a jumbled mess right now. Every day feels like I experience all the emotions I possibly can at different times of the day and I feel like I have no stability. I just want tranquility again. I want to feel at peace with myself, but yet I don't want to be complacent with what I have now or my future.

Growing up as a young teen, I had absolutely no clue what I wanted to do with my life. I had 0 real interest in any subject, and no real desire to persue something seriously. Skipping months worth of school, and failing more classes than I could remember. I graduated somehow. 

I had obstacles that I noticed were becoming more and more serious. The suicidal thoughts. The crying episodes. Sabotaging relationships. 

I finally got myself a doctor, and told him all my thoughts and woes. He prescribed me Cipralex, an SSRI for anxiety, and depression. A lightbulb began to warm up in my mind, and surely but slowly, switched on.

Before I go into TOO much in backstory, I'll just say I've never felt such great desire to do something with my life, in a positive wah. I could finally see a future for myself.

this past August I moved back in with my parents in save $ while I’m in grad school. Right around that time, I started dating my now bf. It’s great bc my bf has his own place so we get the opportunity to have ‘alone time’ and just do what we want. Which is nice bc my last bf lived with his parents so I’ve never truly experienced this luxury and being in an adult relationship. The transition from being in college and not having to report to anyone, to moving back and just having them there is enough as it is. Let alone being in a serious relationship with someone and trying to navigate that. 
Of course my bf and I like to spend the night with each other and bc of that I am always lying to them about where I’m staying, who I’m with, what I’m even doing because I unfortunately do not have parents that would be laze fair about me crashing @ his place due to my catholic upbringing (yay) 😒

I also live @ their place rent free, they pay for car insurance, phone, I mean everything (except for school) that’s one thing they can’t hold over me any longer. 
What can I do to alleviate the situation and help my parents realize I’m not a child anymore. I want to be able to take weekend trips with my bf but I don’t wanna lie anymore!

483,"Yesterday, Saturday the 9th, me and my brother were headed to the mountain to visit my sister. When we were over half way there I overtook a truck going 40 mph in a 55 mph. I didn’t think I was speeding but a cop was in front of the truck and had a rear radar that clocked me at 70. Subsequently, he pulled us over and smelt weed (I argue there wasn’t any smell but that doesn’t matter) and after arguing for a minute my brother admitted to having drugs and more than weed he had mushrooms, an automatic felony. He was taken into custody and brought to jail where he still resides as of right now. How do I handle the situation because I have a feeling, and rightfully so, that he will blame this arrest on my driving and will hate me for it. I don’t want our friendship to end after all that we’ve been through. So any advice on how I can go about helping the situation and retaining his friendship would be much appreciated. Thank you to all who reply it means more than I can ever show. ",10Feb2019,1

485,"First of all sorry for the long post...

I am feeling broken.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend or ex-girlfriend now, whom I considered the love of my life left me for her abusive ex-partner who is roughly the same age I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I really loved her, and still do, and do care deeply for her and whatever may await her.  

&amp;#x200B;

I met her a few years ago but at the time she seemed to be living happily with the guy in question, we went as far as trading some flirtatious looks but that was that because I knew she was with him and even though I really liked her I decided not to act on those impulses. Several months later she quit that place and I did not hear anything more of her for a few more years until....

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 2 years and I find her at a temporary job assignment on a different company, totally at random and by chance, we exchanged anecdotes and that was that, I did not even ask for her number on that occasion.

&amp;#x200B;

As luck or chance would have it a few months later I find her on another temporary job assignment where I also was participating and she went on to explain how she was not very happy with her partner, they never really married, and that she wanted a solution.  She asked for my phone number, I did not ask for hers not because I was a coward but because I did not want any kind of problems with the guy.  So, in the end we exchanged numbers and then chatted for a few weeks and long story short we set up a date, it went great and we began date, she was still with him but claimed they were emotionally appart and were not intimate anymore, so I said, well let's do this. 

During this time she elaborated on the type of abuse she received, for instance, the guy would repeatedly get drunk and violent and hit her as a result.  A few things that called my attention were how she described how she once fell to the ground and he instead of helping her up insulted and hit her on the back of the head, another thing that destroyed my heart was that the guy, allegedly, forced her into pregnancy, let's call it by means of violence, she claims she did not want any kids.  He cheated on her at least 2 times during the course of her pregnancy.

Anyways we went on to become boyfriend and girlfriend, we shared special moments and even had great sex, this lasted for about 1 year and during this time he moved out of her house leaving her and her daughter to fend off for themselves, this was a great period and we were both so happy. 

Come the end of last year I took her to the office Christmas party, the guy works at the same place I do, he probably saw us there being happy and leaving together for the night and that probably triggered something in him, probably he felt lonely on those dates or maybe he just did not like seeing her happy with another man who actually loved her, come January, he started contacting her asking to get back to her, she claims she repeatedly said no and that she was in love with me, we were even on the stage were we discussed getting married but to be honest I was not ready financially or mentally I wanted her to be my wife but also I felt myself not ready to assume the role of father for her kid.

All of a sudden about 2 weeks ago she told me that recently she had been in contact with him, he cried and begged for her forgiveness and just like that he was back at her place. A day later she says that she asked him to leave because she loved me and he went and cried some more and promised he had changed (we were not living together mind you) and they are now planning on rebuilding their lives and says that she is doing it because of her daughter with him. She wants me to accept this and pretend nothing happened between us and wish them well.

I know that guy will probably do well by her for a few weeks, months even and then I am sure he will be back to his former monster self (some insight on this would really be appreciated Reddit!) And so he will hurt her again probably even worse than before, I fear he might even try and kill her at some point being who she claims he is.

During these last few days we exchanged emails and texts she explaining that she loved me but was doing it for her daughter, how he loathed him but was trying to make it work, she even implied they were having sex already, which to be honest destroyed me.  In desperation, I offered to marry her and adopt the kid, but even though she considered it for a moment she flinched and hesitated claiming he might become violent, I said I could handle that but not losing her forever.... and so it ended

&amp;#x200B;

I was advised to avoid contacting her and I was going strong and I was and still doing great at the gym but, somehow, I forgot I had sent her a facebook friend request a few days ago and just yesterday she accepted this, how is this? why'd she do that, she even blocked me on WhatsApp only to unblock me later a few days ago, she claimed my words were lovely but hurt her as she was still in love with me and so she had decided to block communication with me, how should I read into this?

&amp;#x200B;

Foolishly I sent her an email explaining I still love her and how hurt I am, not really trying to get her back but explaining my feelings.  I have not had a response from her but I feel helpless and anxious again.

&amp;#x200B;

Explain to me please,  she clearly is somehow trying to keep in contact with me and she explained in a sincere way and I have no reason to doubt it really, that she is in love with me, and that she hates having to see and kiss him, can't even imagine what else she is doing and don't really want to.  Is this a message of sorts of her to me asking me to fight for her, for us?  I have since learned that I am not required to save her from her choices but it still feels like I failed her by leaving her to him... I truly love her, she is unique and I fear and somehow know this won't end well for her.  

&amp;#x200B;

Help, please...  I am shaken with all this... and feel powerless.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading and sorry for the long post.

491,"So I'm going to be dropping out of uni this week. I'm not enjoying the course what so ever, and along with other personal reasons (a large one being mental health) I'm looking at taking a year out.

However I dont really know what to do. University is the life for me, it just is, and i cant see myself doing anything else, however if I'm to be smart about the situation, I need to take time out and set myself up. I know what uni is like now, the finance issues, workload issues etc, I know from the bottom of my heart that if I leave and reapply at a later date, I will be able to set myself up much better.

I have a general plan of what to do, working somewhere being the main plan of action (retail more than likely). But I dont know for how long.

I know for a fact I will more than likely be bored at home. Yes I'm with family, but I dont have any mates at home and it is a very quiet village. So idk how to go about thinking of the gap year length. On one hand, if I take 6 months out, I will more than likely be able to defer to another course starting in September, and wont forget a lot with regards to maths and mechanics. However on the other, taking a further year out means I have longer to work on my mental health, get more money behind me, more time to prepare (e.g. I dont have to rush as much to reapply for this year) however possibly be bored longer, forget a lot of work (unless I consistently revise), looks like a big gap on the CV etc. I genuinely dont know what to do.

So am just looking for advice on this matter, as well as any general advice with dropping out please.

My brother has held things against me stemming my whole life, and i realize now hes trying to get me back.
I feel like its enough and needs to stop but he wont admit to it. At all. Hes good at making up lies enthen doing something screwed up to me. 


They ignore me when i am ""dormant"" basically meaning doing what they want. Drugs drinking whatever. The drugs were my fault mostly being around bad people. The drinking is my fathers i lived around it all my life 

When i talled about moving my dad threatens me and says all the stuff they bought stays. This is a control tactic because they buy me things i dont ask for or even need if i say no they do it anyway. And it is hard for me to leave all of this stuff but i haft to its either possessions or my life. 

Not a whole lot anyone can tell me here. I am starting a job with slightly higher pay and am hoping i can get a loan from the bank to get an apartment. But i need to prepare to leave everything. Because they wont let me take 

My dad has started to mention throwing me out, the earliest he did this was a week after my 6th birthday and i was upset packed my toys and rembering walking down the street. Probabaly to teach me something but now the lessons are just controlling and like im being mocked. I dont know what to even learn from them and no one tells me, i overheard him talking my mother into throwing me out she wont hear of it.

My mom is in poor health and wont have long. And i can feel them breathing down my neck they are all anxious to throw me out i cant make sense of anything They are doing except being cruel. 


My last effort is a job i got im hoping to save up money and try to get a loan if at all possible the job is new i havent even started and already i made mistakes. Its a new realm and i dont even know if im going to be able to make this job stick.

Its a bad enough job where they dont drug test, i had a moments weakness and got pressured into it. I said no the first time but they persisted and since it was a family member that knows me i caved. Not like it matters i have never been able to focus on Me. I got a good job once and my dad decided it would be great to go on a bender, drive out of town and get stopped and it was on a sunday night about 9 pm when i got the call not asking but demanding i come get him.

 Its unfair my brothers get to focus on their life and i haft to focus on everyone elses. So i did not go but he had me anyway. All my money went to drug dealers he introduced us and they pushed really hard like my family does. 

I dont know who to trust, i fear my dad has my brother wrapped around his finger or that my brother has just hated me from the start which makes more sense knowing the way i get treated. 

He surely has the rest of the family that way as i cant even show my face around them he claimed to be joking but considering he has supposedly ""joked"" my whole life and he has been the only one laughing.

501,"Unconventional relationship advice needed

My husband and I have been married for almost 16 years. We have two beautiful girls and are relatively happy in our lives in general. However, our sex life is nonexistent due to ED. Because of this, we decided to have an open marriage but with the conditions that we don't want to know who the other has been with as well as some general other rules. We are still working on our marriage and making the best of the situation. With that said, I have a friend turned coworker who is in a similar situation, open marriage due to medical, and we decided to pursue something with each other with a clear understanding that we would only be invested physically. However, it has been a week and every time I try to contact him to make a plan to get together, even just to hang out, he doesn't answer back. He prefaced everything beforehand by saying he was really bad at answering texts but this is ridiculous (btw he is 38 I'm 32). He asked me to hang out after work for coffee but when I texted to set up a plan, he didn't get back to me until six hours later to say he was busy. This was Monday. Tuesday, wed, same thing. Thursday, I let him know I was annoyed at his lack of communication and he said, ""Dont be like that, dont be insecure."" So I left it at that. I see him around work and we say hi, nothing out of the norm but he said he is afraid of rumors starting at work which I totally respect so we are very professional there. So he asked if I wanted to get coffee Friday after work to make up for the week and I said ok. Then, when I texted him to meet him he didnt get back to me for another six hours and said he had been busy with midterms (he is going back to school), sick kids, and unexpected things at work, ect. I finally snapped and texted that I understood having a busy life, unexpected things, etc, but I also had to have reliable communication to plan anything and I couldn't wait all day for a text. He never answered me. We were supposed to meet Sat to hang out, nothing, no reply text. I feel stupid because I get being busy but I cant even talk to him about any of this because he literally wont answer. I am very conscious of not wanting to nag or come across as some psycho but I also feel like, if you ask me to meet and then dont get back to me, how can you be mad? I never thought I would be in this situation and normally would never let someone treat me like this. It sounds completely pathetic when I actually type it.
I guess my question is, should I even bother pursuing anything or should I just tell him let's stay friends? Why do you think he would do this? I am not sure if it is pure ambivalence, or how much is actually being busy. And if so, why ask me to go out only to ghost me? Why do people not text back? Please don't be harsh, I have no where else to turn to as the only other person I asked for advice, my brother, passed away last year and I feel very lost.

The main issue is, at recess she always hangs out with her own group of friends, out of which I only really know one person. This means that If I were to hang out with her then, I would have to make friends with all these other people, and I'm really god damn slow at making new friends. It doesn't seem feasible. There's also this thing. One of her friends is a girl who's been orbiting me for the past year, and who I recently rejected when she asked me out. That makes being with her group even more awkward.  

Another thing is that I can't make conversation from nothing. If some person and I are doing something together, then perfect - I can say stuff and have fun saying stuff. Otherwise I just enter a stupor.

Other than the rare group project in one of the two classes we share, there are no openings for me to just talk to her. How can I become friends with her despite these inconveniences?

508,"I started working in this agency about 2.5 years ago with little industry experience before. My first manager was really shit. He normally was a nice guy but couldn’t cope with stress at all. He would put me or my work down bc he felt insecure about his (like saying „did you really write that email it sounded way too professional to come from you?“ or „you send an email last night at 9pm did you just save it and send from home so people think you work late?“).

I was short before quitting but then I looked at all my options and used a department restructure to switch to a different team. The manager there was amazing. I didn’t know much about his work style before I requested to go to his team but I always saw him taking time and explaining stuff to people below him.

He was such a great manager and we worked amazingly together. He also became my mentor and generally was very inspiring to me in the work place. When he left the company i got his position after a lengthy interview process.

The thing is that the position is normally for people of min. 5-10 year experience and I got it after 2 years. I know the top management thought they take a conscious risk with me as they saw me as too junior but with the highest potential in my department - at the same time my old manager was very well respected, recommended me and I had a lot of respect from my team that I would from now on manage. 

I’ve been in this position now for half a year and it really wasn’t easy. The pressure is just enormous. I felt like drowning for the first three months but managed to settle in eventually. Generally my team and I are coping now. Not only that but I’d say we produce probably the highest quality output and business growth compared to all other teams and we won many industry awards in the last 6 months. Main driver for that success is that I am so close to my team and they would do anything for me (they want to do their best work and would never complain to stay late with me).

But it’s so much pressure on me. I love my team and I’m constantly scared that I can’t offer them the development they deserve or that they do too much for me bc they like me and that’s unfair to them. We had a promotion freeze across the company and a few people in my team really would have deserved it. One had to go to another team and hates it there and I want to get involved to support him in his new team but I’m scared me interfering will make things worse. I also have little respect for most people on my level that manage their teams. None of them seems to really care about their team or is inspirational in any way to me.

I used to love my job but since my promotion I feel more drained than anything else. There is just so much that needs my attention and energy and I feel I don’t have enough to give but all seems too important. And i am good at delegation this is not the problem, my team works very self sufficient. I just think back to the time I used to have my manager and it was so much more fun for me.

At the same time I feel incredibly ungrateful bc my salary is quite high (well way too high if you go after work year experience) I have 30 holidays a year, generally a fun job where I pretty much have any freedom on what to do and how to structure my work day and an amazing team that would do really anything for me and respects me as a manager plus without over time my work week is 35h.

I feel crazy for thinking that this opportunity isn’t great and the top management kept saying that I show the highest potential (the CEO and the MD took notice of me and know my name) but more often than not I just really wish my old manager would still be here and I could just go back to my old job without being responsible for the career of other people or company growth.",10Feb2019,1

One aspect of our relationship has always been “looks”. I am more or less obviously better looking (though I have always found him to be very attractive) and I have spent much of our relationship tending to his insecurities about how much attention I received from other people. I never cared if people made comments about how he looked or his teeth or anything else, because I loved him and he treated me like a goddess. However the last year of our relationship I noticed strange friends on Facebook (girls with only 1 mutual, which was him) and a lot of deleted messages and history. He has an old phone and said he has to delete old messages to make room, and I couldn’t prove otherwise so I believed him. I seem to always catch him, but with only enough evidence to have a suspicion and nothing more. Last night that changed when I found him messaging two women we know and attempting to sneak out with one of them after I fell asleep. 
    All of this comes as we are in the best part of our relationship by far. I really suspected nothing, and I wasn’t even looking through his phone for those messages, I just needed a contact. It’s so shocking that I haven’t even cried yet, I feel strange like it’s not really happening.

My parents are moving up north because my dad is starting at a new job this summer and they allowed me to stay here to continue my education since in-state tuition is much cheaper and I'm willing to stay here by myself. Since that's what's going to happen, I really need a job and I've been trying to find one ever since I turned 16.

Within 2 years 1/2, I've been interviewed at Panera, Claire's, JCPenney's, Chick-Fil-A, and Target, but I never got called back for second interviews. I did manage to call each place to ask about my follow-up interviews, but they all said that they found candidates who they've decided to go with. I've applied to many more places including Gap, Rue21, Forever 21, McDonald's, and more, but none have called me back either.

I do feel like I may have an opportunity at a Publix, the one my boyfriend works at and he talked to the manager about my situation and she wanted to talk to me. I went in, she was very nice, and she put my name on the list and I may get an interview soon, I hope. There's a Goodwill Job Center nearby (they hold job fairs every Thursday), I feel like that's my last resort if all else fails. I'm trying to keep my hopes up about my situation, but it gets very frustrating. I don't have friends who live close enough to recommend me to their jobs since they live like two cities away.

I would like some advice, if not, I wanna know if anyone here has had a similar experience or is going through a similar experience right now. Thank you &lt;3",10Feb2019,1

518,"Hello all, so one of my classes uses the Mcgraw Hill Learnsmart and Connect to turn in assignments. The code for this is a couple hundred dollars and as a result I put off buying it for a couple of weeks until I had the money. I was aware this meant missing a couple assignments and had no expectations of getting credit for late assignments. I figured I could do the other 80 percent of the hw and still come out okay in the class overall. The problem is once i got the code and tried to register to do the remaining online assignments that have not been due yet it said the reigstration period was closed. I was embarassed and scared to email my prof but finally worked up the courage to do so. My prof responded saying that all college students struggle with money and thats not an acceptable excuse. She does not want to open the course to let me do the assignments that are not due yet or to let me use the access code i bought. Ive been attending class and doing all the non online hw i just am now at a loss of what to do. I'm embarassed and it is really messing with my depression and anxiety disorder. I've been seeing my doctor and trying new meds but i feel like im slipping again. Even emailing her was really hard for me and so the callous response was devasting. Any suggestions? I just want the same opportunity to turn in the assignments that aren't due yet. I would drop the class and take a W but as I said money right now is really tight and i'd rather not waste hundreds when I know i could pass the class if given the chance. ",10Feb2019,1

I know my family are screwing around with my head they are slipping a little since they dont have the time or energy. But they are still not done.

My brother harbors resentment towards me for things i did as a child and honestly i do blame my parents some because im sure my brother avoided saying anything because he was always getting in trouble. 

Anyhow relating to people is what gets me here. I know my brother rembered these things i did and was out to get me back. But i was good at catching most of it. 


Until he started acting like a brother the inviting me to do things the camping and concerts seemed harmless but was not. Knowing my dads plans to throw me out and my mothers stance that she wont have it they figured ""hey if we can make him wait til she dies then we win.""  


its where i am at. She has bad health and they know they are getting close to their long awaited goal and are watching me specially now to make sure i dont get away. Getting me distracted with alcohol, i tried to quit drugs numerous times only to be hasseled and pressured until i caved. 

They really want this and its sickening, who tries that hard at anything let alone to sabotage somebody. But i refuse. Honestly if i dont get out this time then i would rather die.

Its looking less likely that i am going to get out from this. What i needed was to know what they are doing when i was young enough and get taken away by child protective services but they were good at hiding it. 
When i had bruises it was easy for my father to say i  was faking or over reacting or that he didnt leave any. 

I was scared but was able to deal with it, it made me stronger. But now i am believing he had malicious intent, if my brother were to blame me for everything that happened to him then my dad would pick sides.



When they do cruel things they have the usual excuse, either ""i dont remember saying/doing that"" or ""hes just trying to teach you a lesson"", or ""oh hes just bored"" 
Same excuses over and over, i am out numbered and fear for myself.

Sure i get threatened and it gets physical like pushing and hes put his arm over my throat, but Mostly mental mind games, threatening to call the police on me, throw me out, have the police make me leave, etc.

And when i actually get depressed they do things that work and lift my spirits , but its because im a strong person, not that it doesent bother me. They see it the opposite, that im putting on a role. Im letting the things that depresses a Normal human that can feel things depress me you are all wrong for saying im beating myself up. I know you make fun of me and make jokes about me because of how low you can beat me.

Their is no lesson in any of this. If im not learning anything then their is no lesson to be learned. They cant explain to me even what im supposed to be learning so its for their pleasure. 

When i started to figure things out they pushed me back to the way i was and have been making jokes ever since.

We were together 10 years before she passed from cancer, and almost three years later, I'm in the same place mentally as I was at 20.  I'm not sure why, but some part of me thought her death would move me to fix my own issues.

Primarily, my ingrained fear of failure.  I'm not sure where it came from, but it's been with me most of my life.  I struggled in some subjects in High School, but excelled at others with minimal effort.  In university, I was great my first year (with minimal effort), and ended up just not participating towards the end of my sophomore year.  In one semester and one summer session, I was dismissed academically.

I know I've suffered from depression since about 17; It was formally diagnosed at 20, and went untreated until two months ago (I started therapy, ended up in the ER's psychiatric ward, and am about to see a clinical psychologist).

The one thing I feel I can trace my 15 year-bout with depression, my complete lack of an identity, and my lack of any kind of personal success (with the exception of slogging through tech companies and now being a software engineer) is my intense fear of failure.

Has anyone tried to face their deeply ingrained fear of failure?  I'm desperate to change, I must change before things get any worse.  Thank you all

524,"I’m in an awkward situation at work with a colleague. Bit of background: when I first started this person was very hostile towards me making rude comments. At one point it was escalated to HR. The comment he made was that I was stupid, to another work colleague. In the meeting he denied he ever made the comment, however apologised to me if I ‘think’  he said that. Following the meeting he was nice to me, nothing inappropriate had been said until recently. 

Fast forward a few months later, I’ve been friendly to this person and making general chit chat, no issues. 

About a month ago I receive a passive aggressive email from him, asking me to join him for food after work. I politely declined stating that I need to collect my daughter from work. He responded ‘I get it, I wouldn’t want to eat with me either’. I found the exchange awkward however disregarded it. I didn’t want to cause anymore problems at work. 

On Friday I received an email from him complementing my appearance. I’m awkward with complements in general and brushed it off. 

The situation made me feel uncomfortable so I discussed it with management. My response from management is that I am ‘misinterpreting what he means’ and that he is ‘just being friendly’. This has made me feel like my concerns with the situation have been disregarded and not taken seriously. I was advised to send an email asking that he keep his emails ‘professional’. Before I could manage to send my email- I received another one from him stating that I am ‘hot and skinny’. I responded to him stating ‘I appreciate the complement however this is not an appropriate work conversation, see you next week’ 

I have not received a response from him yet however I am absolutely dreading returning to work this morning. 

My partner is frustrated with the situation and wants to come to my office telling him to back off, because management aren’t doing anything. It’s stressing me out to the point that I’m now looking for a new job. I don’t go to work to get hit on, or wear inappropriate clothing etc. I haven’t encouraged this person in any way, and treat him equally friendly as I do with all work colleagues. 

My question is, have I actually ‘misinterpreted’ what this person is sending me to be inappropriate when it isn’t. Or is it actually inappropriate and my manager didn’t handle to situation correctly? ",10Feb2019,1
525,"I know this is a lot but there’s a TL:DR at the end of you don’t have time to read it

16M
I’ve had a crush on a girl for about two years and I fell for her really really hard,I think about her very timely mind goes to autopilot and that’s constantly every day but there are a lot of issues that I haven’t told anyone about 

Let’s start of with the basics
We’re both the same age (her birthday is 2 months before mine)
I figure we’re about the same level of attractiveness but I feel like she has some serious body image issues that I just wish I could help her with (I have my own issues but I don’t let them get to me and hide them behind a “full of myself” personality)
She’s incredibly smart and imo the most beautiful girl I’ve ever met (though I sadly I know others would disagree) I’m told I’m smart regularly but rarely ever feel it and as I’m falling behind in classes it annoys me that people think I’m failing on purpose but that’s beside the point
I told her best friends and one of my friends (who  would become my best friend 2 years later) that I like her and that encouraged me to ask her out,long story short it ends with her avoiding me when I told her I had to tell her something and essentially running off,I gave up before I told her

Years later we had become really great friends and me,her (let’s call her Mary) and my friend (let’s call him Leo) walked home together every day and we were there for her when her friends were being the bitches they are 
Anyway on day when me,mary,leo and a couple others were walking home and I made the mistake of telling Leo that I had something to tell him in private right in front of her and she demanded to know what we were keeping from her,I obviously had to refuse which made her sad which hurt all the more
Later on when we were alone I told Leo that I still really liked her and he told me to go for it,which I did a few days later
She seemed happy and surprised that anyone liked her but I made the mistake of not getting a definitive answer and the next day when I tried to talk to her she ran off and said she wanted to be alone and told me to go away,later that day she said something along the lines of being happier as friends though I forgot the details,I shrugged it off and said it was fine since I’m not an asshole and things were fine but after a while it seemed like she was running out as soon as classes finished (some people assumed we were dating since we always went together) and she stopped coming up to me to talk and hang out and we kinda drifted apart to acquaintances again

Anyway a while back (early Jan) Leo told me that she was constantly complaint about me behind my back  before school (I live to far to go with them while all my other friends go together) and she seemed to quietly resent me and ignore me when i tried to talk to her
After a while Leo got fed up and stopped talking to her and ignoring her only then did she ask me why we were ignoring her
I said I wasn’t the one ignoring her,she then goes on to explain that she thought I over exaggerated a lot and some other things that I told kaleem that she didn’t believe and thought i was lying about,she ended it with going back and forth about whether she was sorry or not until o said I forgive her and she refused to let me since she thought I should be mad and went on about how she misses us being good friends .
I stand by and say I do forgive her and I’m not bad until she gives up and things return to relative normal

Now rather recently I’ve been through more drama with her friends that involved if friend A (Cheryl) wasn’t asked out in 2018 friend B (Lacey) and May would have to ask a boy out 
Lo and behold they weren’t asked out so May and Lacey had to ask someone out 
Lacey asked me whether she should try to persuade May to ask me out since she knows I like her I did I wasn’t bothered since a date didn’t mean anything and I pretty much gave up since trying after being shut down is a tad pathetic imo
She tried and one day Lacey Cheryl May and few others were round a corner talking until May comes out and asks me to lie for her and tell people that she asked me out I say ok because I like her so much that I wouldn’t want her to something she wouldn’t want to do even if I wanted her to 

Lacey goes crazy and every time I see her she asks me if she’s the bet person ever and if I’m so happy and that irony really hurt me more than anything
I told Leo cause he’s my best friend and I trusted him not to tell anyone since I asked him not to but a few days later one of mates tells me that Leo told him,Lacey and Cheryl that she didn’t actually ask me out even though he hates both of them so there was no motive for him other than making me seem bad to May and making May ask someone else out for the dare 
I forget about it since I can’t hold a grudge to save my life and I move on
The best day Lacey says something like she’s sorry for 2 seconds and I brush it off and carry on walking

I get vibes from Leo and mays interactions that don’t bode well with me even after I saw him spamming messages to her asking her to go to the park alone or some other shit with no reply he’s still adamant that he has no interest in her
It hurts since I’ve helped him with some girl trouble and it feels like he’s lying to me 
I’m all seriousness I feel like I might end my life if it turns out they’re lying to me about this (I know it’s dramatic but I’ve got other issues I’m not talking about here that play a factor)


TL:DR 
I get a feeling that my friends are lying to me about the their feelings and it’s splitting my head in two(I’ve just realised this is kinda hard to sum up,sorry 

If there’s anyone more experienced with this than me seeing this 
Please help 

I posted this yesterday but it wasn’t finished so I’m reposting the finished one

Any help is greatly appreciated and if you need any more info I’m happy to help

I went to the itemized list in my bill, saw the lab charges as expected, but then saw I was charged almost $1500 for ""emergency room"".

Other than running labs and my doctor telling me to go see my specialist, they provided no actual medical intervention.  I likely won't qualify for financial assistance, but I have a ton of medical bills piling up with more coming as a result of getting my stupid medical issue fixed (surgery coming up, recent scans, etc.) and I just can't pay it right now.

The last couple of weeks i just can't be motivated to get high notes and go to next year i simply don't care anymore 
If the teacher says something to me i will end up ignoring him and just socialize with other people bcs i don't really care about school anyway

My home situation isn't that good also 
my mother keeps yelling at me what to do every 5 min
I will end up cursing at her and slamming my door and just ignoring her till she stop yelling at me

It feels like there is nothing to life for my notes are fucked up, my home situation is fucked up its just feel like there is nothing to reach in life anymore

My best friend died last Wednesday in Germany. He had left the United States because he didn’t feel “safe” here..he had listed me as an emergency contact on his passport and because he put a fake number for his mother I had to tell her the news. My dilemma is that he hated his family. He was running away from past trauma and abuse, running away from his sisters death that happened only six months ago (which he believes was in some way his step fathers fault because he was supplying the heroin to her) when I say he hated them..he fucking hated them. They have started a gofundme because the expense is so high to get his body returned, even cremated is like $4000. Part of me says yes, donate because it’s the right thing to do to help them..but then the other side of me is saying hell no because he wanted nothing to do with them anyways. I’m just torn honestly.

540,"This is my first ever post on here and I don’t know what else to do about this situation. I really want to help but I don’t know what to do.

One of my close friends (I’ll call her Maddy), has a Dad with issues (from what I hear from her). It’s a really complicated story and I’ll try my best to explain.

I first became close friends with Maddy in 7th grade. It wasn’t until the beginning of this school year she started talking about her family to my friend group and I. At first, we didn’t think it was too awful. But, as we all started to get progressively closer, ranting about even are darkest family secrets that no one else knew about, did we learn the truth. 

We also started to go over to her house for sleepovers because her parents were the only ones that allowed them all the time. They let us cuss, blast music, play Cards Against Humanity, etc. (I promise we did nothing illegal). Her dad seemed to be really nice whenever we all came over. He’d play CAH with us, talk about stuff, teach us how to do self defense, etc. He only really seemed to be talkative and have strong opinions (for example: he hates every single liberal...). 

Every time I go over there, I realize more and more about what is actually going on. I’ve became aware of things I wouldn’t have before. 

Like how he compliments all of us girls (says we’re beautiful, deserve better..) but doesn’t have anything nice to ever say about his own daughters. He touches us quite often - helping us move into a different defense position, feeling our muscles, hugs us, pats our backs, etc. That might just be me being paranoid (My Dad’s a cop, I’m usually paying attention to stuff I don’t trust.) but I didn’t think anything about him doing that until Maddy texted us one day saying she found a “Twin incest porn” on his computer with a child pornography ad on the side. I have no proof whatsoever that what she claimed she saw was real but I believe her because she is a very close friend of mine. 

There are tons of more stories but I don’t want this to be much longer (for your guy’s sake. By the way, thanks for taking time to read this) so I’ll only make the next few short.

My now girlfriend, used to go over to hang around with Maddy’s sister all the time (she moved to a neighboring town). She talks about how he used to be so kind to her but because she came there frequently, he just gave up. She told me a story of when he yelled at Maddy and her sister for something small (I can’t remember but it was about not wiping down the table or something similar). He proceeded to grab a new coffee creamer and open the cap, then throw it so it went everywhere. He said that his wife had to clean it up when she got home from her long nursing shift. Maddy and her sister cleaned it up because they didn’t want their mom to. He’s done this multiple times, with coffee grounds, milk, etc. She’s also said that when doing the older sister’s makeup, her dad came in and called her a slut. He said that my girlfriend was dictating her and that she shouldn’t hang around her anymore.

He also threatened to all of his kids that he was going to leave and never come back a few weeks ago. 

Also a few weeks ago, he claimed he was leaving to go to a coworkers house. They checked  Life360 (tracking app) and it was a totally strange address. Maddy showed her mom and said that she was visibly upset but didn’t say anything.

Earlier today, Maddy told me her dad had ruined half of their living room floor, some curtains, movies, a blanket, a new PlayStation controller and thrown many other things.

541,"Hello, reddit.

I have a hard time distinguishing between the platonic affection I feel for a friend and attraction. He has been there for me through a lot of heavy stuff and it was reciprocated. Due to the weird and careless nature of the things we shared – really similar to what I’d share to a girl friend – and not the casual approach I would take when it came to a man I was interested in, this entire situation feels really odd for me. I’m pretty much emotionally naked in front of him and although I felt safe when I thought of him as a friend only, I don’t feel like that anymore. All of a sudden I became concerned about how I came off as odd or weird.

I had decided to take a break from texting him every day a while ago for two reasons. Clarifying my feelings and hopefully dissipating the tension I felt when talking to him. I don’t feel comfortable anymore, I can’t help but filter my thoughts to the point where I say a lot of things without any substance to sound neutral and I don’t share much with him anymore. As expected, this is ruining everything. I assume the vibe he gets is that I am not concerned with him and our friendship anymore. That’s what I would feel too. 

I did pretty great during that time we didn’t talk, however, after a few weeks I missed him really much and felt sad, so I texted him. As soon as we started talking again though, the history repeated itself.

I am again confused. I stopped talking to him because my brain shuts down when I talk to him. This is a very healthy friendship for me and to be frank, I haven’t had a friendship that lasted for so long for years. So apart from the natural attachment that came with it, I don’t want to lose these things either.

Also, even if I put aside the awkwardness, I think continuing to be in contact with him would solidify and grow whatever intrusive non-friendship feelings are there.

I don’t like to take into consideration the idea of us talking it out, because I, for one, don’t know any friendship that continued going well after developing into a one sided love both knew about. He never seemed to have any romantic interest in me.

I would appreciate any piece of advice you have. Thank you.",10Feb2019,1

544,"Need relationship advice &amp; i'm using fake names for this but anyways backstory ------ i've been dating my boyfriend ""Chad"" for almost 9 months now but before this i always had a tiny thing for my friend ""Adam"". Us 3 have been friends for years and nothing has happened between myself and Adam. Until recently I haven't thought much about it and the only reason i am now is because lately Adam has started to do a few weird things... Tell me if this isn't weird but Adam came over one afternoon like he normally does but when i walked away, he started talking to MY BOYFRIEND about me???! i wasn't there to hear what exactly happened but once he went home, my boyfriend was annoyed and started getting frustrated while he was explaining what happened.  apparently Adam was saying he wanted to be with me but realised what he said and who he said it to so he tried to save it quickly by saying he just wants a loyal girl like me not me exactly. That was the first incident which got me thinking... After that, on a saturday night Adam had a group of our friends drinking at his house. We had a good time but throughout the night i noticed different things, 1st thing is Adam raps really good and i noticed in his freestyles that he'd put my name in it or something to do with me... and when i stopped listening to his song, he'd yell my name to get my attention then tell me to listen. I didn't think much about it, maybe he just wanted me to listen to his song? But after midnight, we turned the music down and just talked to each other. The topic Horoscopes came up and Astrology, We both realised me and Adam are both virgos but my boyfriend Chad is a leo. Our other friend googled astrology websites to read out our own sign and also to compare two astrology signs together in a relationship. Obviously because me and Chad are together they red out our signs together and it said we basically aren't supposed to work out but if we do it's because my calm sign calms down the fire sign ( which is leo ). After our signs got red out, Adam jumped up to say he wanted to hear Virgo and Virgo together.. This might sound weird but the whole time it felt like me and him were the only people in the room and i can just stare into his eyes all night..... this situation is really messed up for me and i have no idea what to do... i'm a loyal girl and i've been brought up the right way about cheating and love but i don't know if i should end it with Chad and go for Adam? or do i just stay with Chad and forget about Adam? It sounds messed up in my own head because normally i'd stay with Chad because i do love him but i can't get Adam out of my mind and i think he feels the same way....

We're recently married and the sex has just stopped. I'm no longer interested because it's so boring. I've talked to my husband about being adventurous... But he refuses. 
He refuses to go down on me because eating a woman out is ""gross and unnatural"". He doesn't like using the vibrator I bought on me because it's ""weird"" and he ""should be enough for me"".

Also, I do not want kids ever. I feel constantly pressured by his family and he won't tell them to stop. Every family event it's ""when are you gonna have kids?"" ""Are you pregnant yet???"" ""I WANT A GRANDBABY"" ""When you have kids you're going to ____"". ""Your body will change in this way very soon!""

556,"Hi AskReddit, I've been having some really conflicted thoughts on this guy I've been talking to. I'll try to keep the story short. 

Around a year ago, I (22F) met him (21M) on a dating app and we hit it off instantly. I've been single for a while and was looking for something more meaningful than just sex, but he had just got out of a bad relationship and wasn't looking for the same thing. He was clear about it and since I liked him so much, I decided to settle with just hooking up every now and then anyways. Despite this, we'd always talk about stuff and got to know each other better, and I couldn't help feeling that there was a chance for something better. One of the challenges of seeing him is that he lived a few hours  away and it wasn't really easy to go see him all the time.  He was pretty open to me about some of the stuff he was going through, personal things, and I really appreciated that. Unfortunately, he was having a bunch of problems (seeing a therapist) dealing with his life in general, and he slowly but surely he ghosted me. It started off as ignoring my snaps, weeks without texting, and eventually he deleted me off snapchat. From that point I knew it was over. But still, it hurt because he ghosted me without saying anything. It really hurt me but I kind of understood that he was going through some shit, so I let it go. Didn't send any mean text or tried to contact him after that. 

Fast forward 6 months later he texts me again out of the blue and I couldn't help but respond. I was kind of over him but not really. He apologized for ghosting me and said that I was a really good person and he did me wrong. So i forgave him. Things kind of fired up between us again, (Snapchat, texting, whatever) **but** i'm in a position right now where i'm not 100% sure of entering any relationship, since there are other things that have come up which I want to address in my life first. Right now him and i are keeping it friendly, but we have talked about hooking up and how we are definitely interested in that. 

So my question is, is it worth keeping him around? The optimist in me hopes that maybe one day, when seeing each other is easier, that dating will be easier. I know at the moment he isn't ready to date or do something serious either, but maybe it'll change? The realist in me tells me that he's gonna ghost me again and I'm going to have to deal with all these shitty feelings. This has really been taxing on me to think about and I'd like some outside advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: a guy who i clicked with and developed feelings for ghosted me big time. he contacted me again 6 months later looking to ignite a friendship with occasional benefits. I really want to date him. but i dont' know if keeping him around is healthy and will necessarily lead to the outcome I want. To describe myself, i have my shit together for a 22 year old girl but he kind of doesn't and is currently working on that. so there is the whole we're in different places right now argument to be made.

560,"Trying to keep this short. My best friend of 10 years slowly but surely phased me out of her life and I don't know how to get over it even after years. We were amazingly close. She was my soulmate, confidant, best friend. I was willing to bleed for her and thought it was mutual. 

Over time though, she started to seem kind of distant and uninterested. It sort of escalated when she told me she couldn't stand it when I communicated with other people. I thought that was silly; she was aware of being my best friend and I really didn't understand the jealousy at all. She even insulted me, but I tried to keep the peace and apologized (knowing I did nothing wrong, but still). We had very superficial conversations from then on, if she even responded to me, even though I kept trying to bring us back to our usual awesome friendship. Without much success. 

She became more and more toxic. Her negative habits and the daily drama drained my energy. It got to a point where our friendship was causing me more pain than good. I tried to reach out several times, but the result was always disappointing. Then I gradually noticed she wasn't liking anything on my FB page anymore and had even unfollowed me. My birthday came and went, she didn't reach out. 

I spent a long time wishing and praying for her to come back into my life. Two years, in fact. Another birthday came and went, and she sent me a ""Happy fucking birthday"" message. Nothing more. I think my heart finally broke at that. Crying, I went straight to FB, deleted her from my friends list and removed her contact from my mobile phone. That was one year ago. I haven't heard from her since.

While I know I made the best decision for us both in ending a friendship that had already been crumbling, it broke my heart and left me devastated at the same time. I guess the worst part is not knowing what I did wrong, and the lack of answers. 

I wish to have incredible people in my life again, someday. The hard part is believing that will happen, as I have lost all hope in genuine, loyal friendship. I believe there are only a few people out there left who value more important things like friendship and love over pride and ego. I'm married to a wonderful man, but I miss having a close friend. I've always been a giver and lover by nature and seek deep connection, but now I feel like most people aren't worth investing time in. I miss having somebody to laugh with and having rants, discuss ideas and thoughts, somebody who gets excited for the things you love without judging you... Simply put, I feel incredibly lonely. I'm trying to heal and move on, but I feel like it's not going to happen any time soon.

My father wasn't really there the first 14 years of my life while he always was. We went to football matches together and he'd always be making fun of the referee or tell a funny story about the interns at work.
But that's over. We cremated him and burried him   a week ago. He left a son and his wife on whom he cheated (the affair didn't work out, might be a reason). From what the police told us he planned it out on the 4th. He gratulated me for my birthday and told me he'd owe me.

She asked me a couple years back about my finances. I told her a number that wasn't too high. She, amazingly doesn't have much debt and had been very open with this.
Last year on taxes, our state refund was taken because I owe money to the university. Again, I lied. I told her I owe a tenth of what I actually owe. Since then I've set up a payment plan with the collections agency. I feel it's taken care of. I should have told her then. I didn't, it just didn't cross my mind at the time. The past few months I've wanted to tell her but haven't, making excuses for holidays and her birthday. Now it's tax time again and I need to tell her but again I'm making excuses for Valentine's day. She wants to do it now and I need to tell her. This is all eating me up and i don't know how to tell her. I'm also scared of how she'll take it, if she'll leave or what.

582,"All my life I’ve struggled with choking under pressure and it’s really starting to get to me. I was on a varsity sports team in high school because I had talent but was rarely put off of the bench because I would choke. I can’t enjoy competitive video games with my friends because even if I have practiced well on my own, I choke when I am needed.

Even in day to day life, if a stressful situation occurs my brain shuts down and I can’t solve something that would be a cake walk without the added pressure or time limit. 

The worst part is, even though it’s rare, I have had moments of clarity. Being in a competitive environment and my brain goes into an almost trace-like zen mode where I do everything correctly. But this happens too few and far between.

585,"My parents were married for 68 years. 6 years ago my mother had a mitral valve failure and recovered but ever since has pretty severe anterograde amnesia. She can’t easily make new memories but can recall events of the past without much problem. My father was physically strong and had a sharp mind until he passed one year ago. They were very independent and my father handled most of the household matters and only started needing help in his last few months.  This involved my husband and I driving ~30 minutes every day to talk to them and help them with things. He really appreciated the company and also often expressed concern about my mother’s memory problems. 


After he passed, my mother by herself has nowhere near the same independence. We still make the 30 minute drive every day (often an hour due to traffic) and both work full time. We bring her food and groceries and manage her medication because there’s no way she could handle that alone. There are sometimes arguments because the pill container that we fill is still full when we get there and she insists that she already took her medications and refilled the container. This is highly unlikely as she also claims to go for walks around the neighborhood and shovel snow but is very deconditioned and becomes short of breath easily since she stopped doing her stationary bike after my father passed. Her state is not dementia but just really significant memory impairment. She always claims “I’ve been doing pretty good on my own since your father passed” and when we try to remind her that we visit every day and provide all her food and manage her medications she doesn’t remember and denies this. I do my best with her activities of daily living but there’s some things she absolutely won’t budge on like taking a shower. The best I can do is have my hairdresser wash her hair. 


We’ve both independently been making this drive for a year and a half now since my husband and I work at different places every day and it’s becoming exhausting. Her family loves her very much and it would clearly be best if she would move in with us for her own safety but she absolutely refuses and believes she’s truly independent. You can’t talk to her about moving because she yells and becomes upset. I don’t know what to do. ",10Feb2019,1

I’m (24 ff)in a marriage with a man(25m) I’ve known for almost 10 years . We’ve been married for 2 years and have 3 kids. 

At first , we had a great relationship when we were younger, but I believe we stayed together out of comfort , atleast I did, and going through so much together over time made it more difficult to leave for me.

He’s had a history of emotionally abusive tendencies when he gets mad, like calling me b—, c—, idiot, etc....he has also broken things of mine and punched walls and doors . I do have some emotional problems that have led to our arguments but he always takes it to the next level by doing things that emotionally hurt me or scare me .

He is seeing a counselor, now but I just don’t even want to try to work things out anymore . I’m not in love with him, I think he is a bitter and miserable man , and I’m not attracted to him emotionally or physically anymore.

How do I leave a toxic marriage with our young children involved and no money saved up? How do I tell him ? I don’t have family members to help me . I know there are resources for child support once I file a petition for custody , but what can I do until then to prepare ?

As the title says, I broke up with my girlfriend 2 days ago. We met while I was living in another country and we became really close friends over time - once I had to leave to go back home we decided to be more than friends and try keep our relationship going until we would reunite. So during this last month of being back home, things haven't been too great for me (I lived abroad for a 9 months in a completely different culture), everything feels weird and I don't have the same connection with family members as a I once did (my mother and I used to be close but now I feel like she's just another person to me).

As someone who get close to people easily, I felt like my girlfriend was my best friend and I was really comfortable around her but once I got home, my feelings for her started to lessen over time. She would ask me if she needs to worry about x girl if I bring up a girl I know in a conversation. She would argue with me about random things and then apologize (I wasn't too phased by it because she was having big mood swings due to not being on the pill anymore), at the end of these arguments she would ask if I was sick of her and wanted to break up, I felt I was losing feelings for her after every one of these fights and along with the stresses of being back home (my old relationships not being the same, looking for work) but yet I still cared for a lot as a person.

Intimacy always felt very awkward between us but everything else felt great. We could just be together all the time and not feel bored or awkward. I decided to end it because, it felt unfair to her for me to pretend everything was fine. During the breakup she was crying for 10 ish minutes on the call, saying how I'm an asshole and that I don't even seem to care that I'm breaking up with her (like im taking out trash). I was really upset because I was losing my best friend (one of my only friends as of now). A few hours later she sent me a letter she had written to give me on valentines day and she told me never to message her again.

I really miss her as a person and not having her in my life makes me really sad. I feel really alone without her. Did I do the right thing? I'm trying to not think about it too much and just putting my time and effort into my side projects (programming) and running a lot, just to exhaust myself.

Im struggling to fall asleep and when I do, I sleep for 14 hours, my appetite is also pretty low compared to what it usually is.

 people ask me why i don't and my brain comes up with endless excuses to mask the fact that i have no clue why i cant. its exactly the same with school too. i'm really falling behind with school, i got kicked out of a couple schools because i couldn't push myself to work and just messed about. now i'm in a shitty school that teaches me year 6-8 work and i'm in year 11 with GCSE's coming up in 3 months and i cant push myself to revise, i have so many people trying to help me with it and teach me as much as they can but i just come up with more excuses to avoid doing any revision.

— 
Since I have been working and going to school... life has been hectic. I am doing so much. I haven’t been making time for friends, partying, etc. Now, let me be clear from the start... I AM socially active... at work, at school (clubs, class, etc.) so it’s not like I am alone 24/7.

I have made a commitment to myself to start bodybuilding while focusing on school and work. I have been telling myself that sacrificing my social life (and I say that super loosely) is going to get me in a great situation down the road (stable and better job, apartment, confident in myself physically, etc.) and then I can start focusing on friendships, partying, etc. 

I even am going as far as not looking for a relationship... which is a HUGE step for me because I am a hopeless romantic. 

I am telling myself this because I have been cheated on by guys, ghosted, stood up, etc. 

But even with all of this said, I am STOKED for my future. Is this weird? Is this okay? Has anyone put friends on hold to get their life on track? 

Thank you.

597,"Long post because I don't know how to tell a straightforward story.

So I'm [18f].  2ish years ago I sought out to get formally diagnosed with ADHD even though I was already pretty sure I had it. I wanted to see if medication could maybe help me. After I did the tests and stuff they told me I had ADHD, no surprise there, but that I also had an anxiety disorder. At first I was sort of mad because I didn't come for a GAD diagnosis, I came to be diagnosed with ADHD. I felt like I worried about the same as everyone else and even if I did worry more than normal, I didn't want to accept that because then I'd feel like it was my fault. I already felt like I was broken because of the ADHD I didn't want something added onto that. Well anyway, I ended up reflecting on it because if there were enough symptoms to be assuredly diagnosed, then it was prob a sign that something was wrong. The conclusion I came to and the point where I'm currently at is that I'm constantly in a state of fear that it impacts my quality of life and I would like to fix it if possible. I've thought about it a lot so I know it's normal to feel anxiety in stressful situations, but it seems like I'm always close to a breaking point even when nothing is going on. Like when something even slighty stressful happens, it seems like I go from 0-100 real quick (lol) but it's just because I'm so used to being at 99 that I've learned to act normal/ like I'm at 0.  I don't want to come to the conclusion that it's just the way I am and life is just gonna be a constant uphill battle against anxious tendencies. I hate feeling like I'm fragile and that the people close to me have to feel like they need to walk on eggshells around me. That's why I want to analyze two things that happened in the past that I've assumed were the causes of why I'm like this so I have some hope that I can reverse it. 

First memory was when I was in 5th grade (10-11y/o). It's silly but I had been obsessed with this boy for about a year and a half and was rejected by him multiple times. It's not his fault, but I gradually began to feel like something was wrong with me. One day, somehow I had embarrassed myself on the playground, and later that night I laid awake in bed cringing about it. I was getting pretty upset about it like 'why am I always so embarrassing, what's wrong with me' until I had a really clear thought: 'I just need to think about everything before I do it and then I'll never embarrass myself again.' It didn't work lol I was still impulsive and said/did embarrassing things all the time, except from that point on, I was distinctly hyper-aware of every social interaction I had.  

Second memory isn't just one memory, it was more of a period of time in my life. My older sister is 4ish years older than me and I'd say when I was 11-12 (she would be 15-16, start of high school) she started getting into drugs. About a year later my house became hell after my parents found out all that had been going on with her. To make a long story short, she wasn't herself and did horrible things that put my parents under huge amounts of stress that lasted about 3-4 years. I was powerless to change anything that was happening, my parents and even my sister tried to protect me by not telling me what exactly was going on but I always saw/heard it anyway so I was inevitably affected by it. I don't like to feel like a victim about it so I don't want dwell on it but at the same time I don't want to undersell how terrible it was to live like that. I felt like there wasn't any room for me to  breathe because I didn't think my parents could handle anything more (and they really couldn't at the time). 

From both of these things I think I can see how they affect my way of thinking now. The first memory i feel like established a pattern of thinking that leads me to believe that there's something about me that when people get to know me, they get tired of me or start to resent me. If that's true then I'd like to fix that too, but at the moment it makes me afraid of getting too close to people. The second memory I feel like caused me to always be in 'crisis mode' for a lack of a better word. There was a pattern to my sister's behavior (I learned later that it was the cycle of abuse) that I was able to recognize from pretty early on. I could anticipate when shit was about to hit the fan, like how you can sometimes sense a storm before it happens. The anticipation/ dread of something happening never really went away, it just became the way I function. 

All of this backstory is prob unimportant and my symptoms are prob more simple than I think, but I don't want my parents to have to pay for therapy for me or anything (I already feel guilty about the cost of getting a diagnosis and medication, if I knew about the price beforehand I wouldve never done it) so this all is pretty much me venting to the void. 

What I want to know is if anybody has had a similar issue and figured out a way to undo this way of thinking. Should I do the like daily self esteem exercises or like the positive affirmation things? Do those actually work? It just feels like that I've been this way for a majority of my life that it's just become a part of my personality. I recognize now that the things I feel on a daily basis aren't normal, or rather I don't want them to be normal, but I get overwhelmed trying to think of a way to fix it.

Okay so all my loans are under two different income based payment plans. They refused to put this one loan under income based payment plan because it was in a grace-period. The loan required $150 payment each month which I was unable to keep up with. I asked them to put it in a payment plan like the other loans and Navient told me that since the loan was in a grace period, it could not be placed under a payment plan until after sometime post graduation (when it comes out of grace) But as soon as the loan came out of the grace period; navient put it into default and sent me settlement e-mails. When I called them back they denied ever saying the loan was in grace-period and demanded that I now proceed with the default procedure of the loan. They kept bouncing me around department each refusing to tell me why they took the loan from grace period straight to default without anything in between (income based repayment).

He consistently claimed that he cared about me and the other day said that he may want to ""be with me for the long term"" which I couldn't understand why, since we don't talk much.

 Two years ago (around the end of 2016) I had to cut ties with a close friend because he admitted to being... creepy when it comes to younger people and has also been accused of forcing himself onto another friend of ours. There was a police investigation about this but it was closed because the friend who was the victim hadn't spoken up soon enough. Me, being a stupid 14 year old  at the time, decided to speak to him to hear his side of the story but soon realised that was a mistake due to his strange behaviour. My parents found out and were not happy that I'd spoke to him again, understandably, and that was that. 

Well around mid last year he was continuously trying to contact me again, to the point where I had enough and wanted to find some real evidence of his harassing behaviour so that I could save it and possibly report him. I didnt even need to do much work as he was getting rather explicit to the point where I told him to leave me alone and never contact me again. 

Well around September or so of last year, a mutual friend of ours who I hadn't spoke to in a while messaged me asking if I had kissed him because he was telling him that i had... this is disgusting because i have never even THOUGHT about that, especially with such a creepy person anyway. I was furious about this but didnt think of taking any further action because what could happen really? He obviously isnt scared of authority if he still continues to act this way after an investigation had been centered around him. 
 
Well, about December time he found me again on the only social media I had left, and messaged me saying that he needed to talk urgently to apologise. I ignored and have since deleted this social media. Well, tonight he had requested to follow my sisters account and this has just not settled well, I cannot continue to live knowing that his weird behaviour continues. I unfortunately dont have the receipts saved anymore, i have since had another phone. So I cant risk taking legal action knowing that there isnt much evidence anymore. I just dont know what to do. Why cant he just move on?

608,"I learned something about myself recently.

I tend to drive people into irrationality and anger when having an argument. I stay overly calm and factual. Most people I argued with react with irrational, unfactual or even insultive statements. And I am trying to figure out why that happens.
I think it‘s because I seek the feeling of domination, when I notice that the other one loses his temper. Although I see how that is destructive and not helping situations in the long run. I ask myself why I do this and how I can influence my behavior in such situations. 

Do you have input or answers for my questions?

609,"Hi reddit , I would REALLY appreciate any replies to this as I’m in a a really difficult situation , some back story - I’m an 18 year old girl I work in a bar , on very bad wages with okay tips . I hate the people I work with. I stream video games in my spare time and hope to make it a full time job . 
I want to quit my job and pursue my dream to be a streamer but I’m so scared . I feel like I should wait but this job also takes so much energy out of me . Do I take a leap of faith or wait till I make money on stream to leave ? ",10Feb2019,1

613,"I’m currently a senior in high school, with no job, who dogsits for a close friend on occasion. It’s usually for about half the day, 8 hours or so, sometimes less. Right now, I’m being paid $35/day for in-home sitting. 

My Mom got really upset today when she realized how much I was getting, and started telling me how I’m being taken advantage of and that no one would ever accept such little pay. 

However, I have a mutual friend that used to dogsit before me. We both received the same pay for the same care, as the dog usually only needs to be fed once and walked once. The dog doesn’t do much. He’s a sweet, but sleepy, lapdog. 

The family has treated me great, as I’m basically given free reign of their house. They buy food for me to eat, although everything in the kitchen is a choice as well, allow me to binge shows on their TV, have any mutual friends over, etc. In my time at their home, I’m really only doing an hour of work - the rest of my time I’m doing whatever I’d normally do at my house. 

However, as I am super inexperienced and have never had a job before, I can’t help but wonder if I am being taken advantage of. I never thought the pay was unfair for the work, but my Mom is insisting I either stop dogsitting or move my rate up to $50/day. 

That being said, am I being paid unfairly? Or is my Mom overreacting? ",10Feb2019,1
