0,"*still in shock by the situation but hopefully i make sense.  Any advice is appreciated* 

My little sister is currently with her grandmother because the cops and cps were called on my parents. I [23] wasn’t there because I haven’t lived with them for around 7 years now due to them abusing me mentally and physically, when I turned 18 I left. My sis is 17 now and she was beat, hit in the face, drugged up steps by her hair ect. She’s safe for now, but the parents still have full custody and cps agent was a co-worker with one of my parents previously at our local Dss. 
No arrest was made.
Parent 1 is trying to put sis in juvy due to her calling the cops and embarrassing them.
Please help with any advice possible. I’m so confused on what to do..",01Apr2019,3
1,"I knowingly broke a rule in my college lab. I put something back in its place myself. But we are supposed to ask one of the workers to do it. It's just small and not dangerous supplies. There were a few others who had been doing this too. Most of the lab workers don't care but I got caught by the one that did care. I didn't think it was a big deal but the next day it was locked and they cracked down on the rule. 

I know I was stupid for knowingly breaking the rule and I feel stupid for it. Just because others were doing it doesn't give me an excuse. 

I'm really scared this will affect my grade in the class, or that I'll get a talking to or get in some sort of trouble. Maybe even fail the class for knowingly breaking a rule?? I don't know if I was complained about in particular or if it was just a general complaint since many had been doing it. But the complaint went to my teacher, the head of the lab. 

 I feel like this is stupid but I'm scared and can't  stop thinking about it and regretting my decision. Any advice on what I should do? Do I just have to wait it out and see in class? Any thoughts on if I'll get it trouble? Not sure what I'm looking for, just needed to talk about it somewhere...",01Apr2019,1

6,"I’ve been with my partner for 4 months now and at first, I was so happy with them and I really saw our relationship going somewhere. Since were both young and have large families and hectic lives, we only get to see each other a couple times a month. I don’t want to say that the relationship feels forced because we get along very well and I really enjoy spending time with them, but sometimes it seems like not much effort is being put into it. I don’t want to break up with them because I feel like this is an issue that can be fixed, but I feel like I’m not truly getting anything out of this relationship. I definitely care about my partner a hell of a lot, but I don’t feel as excited as I did a few months ago about being in a relationship.

I feel like it’s also important to mention that we don’t spend a lot of time alone and when we do, it’s often out in public because we live in households where we it’s often inconvenient to have someone over often.

8,"I live at home with my mom, brother(15) and myself(17). My parents got divorced when I was very young but we were a tight knit close family and I am very close with my dad. My mom of course over the years has had 3 boyfriends on and off the most extended being Scott who she dated for 3 years. He was like a step father to me and their breakup was really hard on me and my brother. My family is all Greek and food is a staple of our household me and my brother are both very athletic and eat a ton my moms cooking has always been something I've loved and never failed at filling me up but since her new boyfriend NOTHING has been the same.

I guess we're all guilty of changing who we are at least a little bit for our significant other and I see now when you're older it's no different. With my moms first boyfriend it was country music... something I now look back on and laugh since country music is something my family makes fun of (no offense to anyone who likes country) and seeing my mom start to like it was unsettling but it was whatever. With my moms next boyfriend Scott things changed in very good ways. My mom cooked more and Scott was also a phenomenal cook which made family dinners something I strongly looked forward to over the years. He would often take my brothers sides in arguments and would challenge my mom (always in a respectful way) when she was acting crazy. With my moms current boyfriend everything has changed. 

My moms new boyfriend is someone who I seriously don't like. For starters he's the biggest baby I've ever met and can't even watch a death scene in a movie that wasn't even that horrific. I'm convinced I'm more of a man then he is. What bothers me most is how when my mom first met him she expressed the same disgust for him that me and my brother have. She talked about how much of a baby he was and how he always complained but unfortunately his mom died and my mom decided to be friends with him. In her own words she said ""only friends nothing more"" and I held her to that. Until one day this man is sitting in my living room watching TV which made me heated. Slowly things escalated and now they are dating. 

I need to help my mom see that this man is not someone who should be in ANY of our lives. I believe my mom is starting to experience ""empty nest syndrome"" because even my brother at 15 is very independent and my mom is just looking to take care of someone. I can't talk to my dad about any of this because he hates my mom and I have nowhere else to turn I feel like I'm losing my mom and it's crushing me. She's started to use these herbal remedies and weird recipes that don't even fill me up. She's fully invested in this guy and I dont know what to do. It's caused so much turmoil within myself I've started to lash out at my friends which I hate. I hate this feeling and I hate losing my mom.",01Apr2019,1
9,"Hi, obvious throwaway, need help with some super embarrassing tiny white dots all over my penis from the scar from my circumcision (performed when I was a baby) up.

[https://imgur.com/x8rSkxj](https://imgur.com/x8rSkxj)

Sorry for the poor quality, the quality dropped when transferring, may take another when I get a chance.

The white dots appeared initially semi-regularly during puberty around age 12/13 all over my skin, notably on my right wrist near the vein and around my bellybutton. It also appeared around my penis at some point. I was concerned at the time but did nothing, and ultimately all the white bumps disappeared. Except on my penis. They cover the whole shaft and the head (not that noticeable on head) and are most noticeable when I am flaccid. I am darkish skinned and so they are very visible There must be 100-200 of them total. When I am erect pretty much all of them on the head and on the top (facing me) half of the shaft disappear, the bumps become redder and my skin as well and they blend in making them super not noticeable at all. The spots have not been getting any better or worst for the past 7 years or so since they first came up. They only exist exactly from my scar upward. On the sides and 100% especially at the bottom they're still visible and embarrassing, which has caused me to deter the few sexual advances towards me in the past. Now that I'm in college and going to parties frequently, I have to deal with this.

I'm planning to see a dermatologist, but it's super embarrassing so I'd love a solution without them or at the very least I'd like to know what they are. They don't stick out really, not enough to cut them or anything. I have attempted to use a skin lightener to perhaps lighten the skin around it, and used it so diligently my skin peeled off after a couple weeks a couple years back. It was looking good prior, but after the peel the skin was raw and the same under.

I've looked in PPP, which I don't think these are though they look very similar, and Fordyce spots, which also look kinda similar but I'm pretty sure are definitely distinct. I'd think they're PPP except they're everywhere, not limited to the head (actually much worst on the shaft not bad on the head)

Thanks!",01Apr2019,1

13,"Hi reddit. First post here and I’m pretty nervous and well, scared to be honest. 

I just need some other people to weigh in on something I’ve been reflecting a lot about. 

Earlier this year I transferred to a new high school. I’m involved with JROTC, and I’m somewhat conservative (important later)

I joined a lot of teams, and met a lot of new people, which was great, but one girl particularly stood out to me. We met during a Raider competition, which is sort of like an endurance race with military/cadet themed events. 

We exchanged numbers originally to share documents that were too annoying to send over the third party messaging service the majority of our school uses. 

It was a slow burn at first, just chatting to each other once or twice every few days, but as we realized we shared interests and both of us have cute dogs we like to share pictures of, the texts escalated to once or twice a day, often just to check in with each other on how life was and how school was going. 

I began developing feelings for her, slowly at first and then head over heels. We talked a lot over text, and after school, (seeing as we were on teams together). 

One day it was pretty chilly outside, and we were practicing drill, which meant twirling heavy metal rifles and such. I noticed that she didn’t have a jacket of any sort, and was just wearing a light t-shirt. She was shivering visibly and rubbing her arms. 

I immediately took off my sweatshirt and gave it to her, and she accepted hesitantly, then looked warm and happy after a while. Later she thanked me and handed me back my sweatshirt when we went inside again. 

Her friends were teasing her about the sweatshirt thing, me liking her etc.

We both blew it off, ignoring everyone, but I know people kept it going. 

Around November, I asked her to the military ball, which is a big event that typically happens in February. I got her favorite candy and drink, waited until we were alone after school, then asked her. 

She said yes, thanked me for the gifts, and that was that. 

We still texted each other quite often, and still had fun, with multiple inside jokes and the like. We also began to share some hard things at that point, her sharing how she felt left out of some JROTC groups, and me sharing how I felt about my classmates. 

Things progressed well, we texted each other a lot during our Thanksgiving breaks, and she shared more, mainly about her family, and I shared more about mine as well. 

Life went on, I met her parents, and I even spent the night at their ranch out in the country. It was a lot of fun, but her older brother and his friends kept me from seeing her a whole ton, and she seemed to do her own thing while I was there. 

Her parents were and are always warm to me and very friendly, starting conversations at nearly every sporting event, social event, or other times they saw me. 

She was very warm, very friendly, conversational even. 

Then everything took a massive turn for the worse.  

It started with being left on “Read” messages. Small, I know, and not worth stressing over, so I didn’t stress over it. Then, she stopped liking (specifically) my posts on social media. Then she stopped texting me altogether, and even in real life she was distant and would look right through me, almost as if I just didn’t exist. If I initiated a conversation it would be shut down, with a kind but very very vague or quiet statement I couldn’t respond to.

Ex. “Hey! How’s your day going?”

“Eh, decent.”

Stuff like that. 

This whole change happened over Christmas break, where we had literally no face to face interaction with each other, and I know I didn’t have any contact with literally anybody from school. 

Less than 22 days. 

I asked her if I did anything wrong, and apologized if I did and somehow forgot,  she said “no, you’re fine, I’m just busy with [sport].”

But it obviously wasn’t just that. 

I got her some candy and wrote her a letter for Valentine’s Day, hand delivered it at lunch. 

The letter basically was me telling her I admired and respected her kindness, perseverance, and her personality. I also asked her to be my Valentine, but it was one line and was not an emphasized feeling throughout the note. 

I got a text later that evening from her telling me that she values our friendship and.. “appreciated me understanding that she is not ready for anything more than that right now.” 

Long story short, I took her to mil ball, she grouped with her friends, and just deserted the table. When she left the main hall, her mom followed her, and a couple minutes later she returned to the table with some of her friends and sat down for the ceremonies, but she was dead silent to me, only talking or responding to her friends. 

The funny thing is she willingly took my arm when I offered it to her, she willingly danced, and didn’t complain or anything when we had to take pictures. At the halfway mark of the ball, when people were allowed to leave at free will, she gathered her group of friends and prepared to leave to go hang out. I walked up to her, said goodnight and thanks for coming, hugged her, and she thanked me for taking her. 

after she left with her friends, her mom hugged me, thanked me for being “sweet” to her, than left also. I was left slightly confused, holding my uniform jacket and a drink as the partner dancing started, and my partner left the ball. 

It’s the day after, and I’m having mood swings ranging from 

“You’re pathetic, why didn’t you talk to her more during the ball?! It’s your fault you weren’t interesting enough for her to stay at your table!”

To

“You did a great job. You did everything you could as a friend, and gave her space to do her thing instead of clinging.”

 Now I’m stuck. I’m still ignored on social media, her parents and siblings still like me. 

I’m having trouble starting conversation with her in real life, and I’m feeling confused, and not entirely sure what I should do. 

I don’t want to date her, but I like her so much it actually physically hurts. She’s one in a million, and... yeah. 

I’m at the end of my tether emotionally, and as much as I want to just cut ties and pretend it never happened, I like her too much and I’m friendly and still in contact with her siblings and parents. 

What the actual hell do I do now?

17,"y family found out my step father has cancer. I feel like I have no where to go with my life now.  I currently rent from my parents I had hopes of moving out in the next year or two if my health remained stable. Now I feel like my future is gone. I don't know if my step father will have the house paid off before the cancer gets worse, my other issues is my mother requires a lot of medication and periodic surgery. I feel like starting my own life is gone I fear my future is going to be spent working to keep my mother from being homeless and covering her medication. My goal of getting out on my own and starting a family of my own seems gone now. 

The second thing I'm looking for advice on is how to make human connections as an adult? I feel sort of trapped with no one to talk to about any of this. My mother is stressed out enough by this I don't want to add to it and he acts like he wants to ignore the problem. Outside of my parents I have basically no human interaction. 

I haven't had a friend for several years. I've lived most of the past few years with the motto ""loneliness is the secret to happiness."" This idea seems to be crumbling in the last few months. Connecting with old friends is not possible. One was involved with borderline illegal activity and I had to end the friendship the other friend murdered someone. 

Getting together with co-works at my job won't work. I work remotely in a job that requires little interaction and basically no supervision. I can go weeks without interacting with anyone at work aside from maybe a short email. We are also all spread across the country. 

I've tried to find activities to attend and meet people in my local area but I live in a somewhat rural area. Most of the events in our local paper are religious or for children. I've found some things in the city but they are usually an hour or more away.

18,"I've recently come to the realization that the friendships I've had for the past decade or more of my life are no longer even friendships. I barely talk to the people who I used to spend my life with. I mean, once every couple of weeks and nothing very deep. I've never been someone with a big circle of fiends, maybe 3-4 close friends at a time. I also tend to grow distant from my friends when in a relationship, and I got married about 2 years ago.

 I thought I was feeling shame/guilt/loss for my current situation, but now I think maybe it's just society's pressure to have friends that has me feeling that way? I am 27, happily married, a home owner, and comfortable with money. Currently taking time to save/travel before my husband and I truly settle down and have kids. I fear that I can't relate to people my age. They're all looking for love or working on their careers or trying to find themselves or being a carpool parent or hustling to afford rent. Aside from this friend problem, I really have no problems, nothing to vent or relate about. The idea of getting drunk and staying out late like I did just a few years ago is very unappealing now, but so is getting coffee in the morning or doing yoga or getting brunch. Socializing feels like a task, I have one good friend who I enjoy talking to but everyone else I keep up with is just out of the fear of being isolated.

Are social networks making me feel shame for something I truly don't care about right now? I have to admit, seeing past friends post pictures with tons of other friends gives me a little pang of shame. My husband also has a LOT of friends, which makes me feel like a reject for having only 1 or 2. In the future when we do have children, I hope to know the neighbors wherever we move and the other moms at school and form friendships with people who have things in common with me, people to 'do life with'. Right now, I feel like there is no one that is on the same page as me enough to truly do life with me, besides my husband. Is it okay for me to let go of these negative feelings about my lack of friends until I'm at a more relatable place in life? Should I suck it up and keep trying to make new friends/stay connected to people i've drifted from even though the socializing part is a pain?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Suddenly realized I've drifted very far away from all of my friends and we are now different people. I want friends who can relate to me in the future, but socializing currently feels like an unnecessary burden. Is it okay to stop holding onto these friendships/trying to make new friends? Why do I feel shame about having no friends when I don't really want any at the moment? Is it the influence of social media and comparing myself to others? Should I suck it up and keep looking for friends that can relate to me now so that I don't become isolated?",01Apr2019,3

* My parents are doing poorly financially and emotionally and I fear that I have to start preparing to be their caretaker
* My own mental health is not great, but I do not have any social support system and certainly don't have the money for therapy, so I'm just stuck going around in circles in my own head

&amp;#x200B;

About a year and a half ago, I decided to pursue a MS degree immediately after finishing my undergraduate degree. I spent about a year building up credits and experience in my field at the cost of a $30,000 private loan on top of the \~$60,000 I already borrowed for undergrad. I ended up transferring universities and essentially had to start over on my graduate degree to the tune of another $20,000 a year in federal loans (assuming I can continue to qualify for financial aid, which we'll get to in a minute). This move also included moving across the country  with nothing but my car, clothes, textbooks, and the $200 left in my bank account after paying my rental deposit. I currently live in a very rural area, and my brother lives a few hours away in a major city (in college as well). I share a 4br/1ba house with three other ""young professional"" women - we rarely interact. I often feel that I can't use the common spaces because one of my ""more established"" roommates is using them (this is my own issue, not theirs, clearly).

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently working full time (between 35 and 50 hours a week) at a fast food restaurant while being registered for a full-time MS degree program, and have been since I moved here. I am not making nearly enough money, but I literally don't have the time to work any more. I'm already MONTHS behind in my classwork because I have so little time to devote to homework or projects and am really struggling to concentrate and complete tasks when I do have time. I'm really good at spending hours staring into space and panicking about money, though. During college, I worked part time for my university - just enough to pay my rent, but not enough to build up any significant savings. 

&amp;#x200B;

My family has never been able to offer any financial or emotional support to either my brother or me. I have been continually struggling to get my job to understand that I cannot work any more hours even if I desperately need the money, cannot stay hours after my shift is supposed to end because other workers did not show up (or management timed breaks poorly and need me to ""cover"" for someone going on break), and cannot come in for additional shifts without at least a day's notice. For example, I requested today off WEEKS ago because I had a weekend class - my manager texted me asking why I did not show up for my shift and when we sorted things out still asked me to come in to close tonight (not my normal shift, mind you). I have not been able to find a different job, however, largely because of the odd hours my class schedule demands. I've sent in more than sixty resumes (minimum wage/laborer jobs only) and have gotten THREE call-backs in eight months.

&amp;#x200B;

In November, I made the mistake of telling my brother that I would be willing to move in with him (moving to his city) and provide the deposit on an apartment so that he would be able to leave his current ""bad-roommate"" situation. At the time, I did have the savings for a deposit. Since then, several unexpected expenses came up AND I made some really poor financial choices and no longer have anywhere close to the money required to pay first, last, deposit, and brokers fees on an apartment in a major city. My car is also extremely old and has nearly 300,000 miles on it and I am worried that it would not survive a weekly commute from the city to my university for classes - I do not have the money to both lease or buy a new (new to me) car AND move.

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER, my brother has been struggling with his mental health for years and was recently hospitalized in relation to his mental health. While he insists that statements he made were taken out of context and he was hospitalized forcefully and incorrectly, he has also shared with me a number of concerning thoughts over the years that still give me pause. In fact, several days before this incident, I had stayed up with him on the phone for hours listening to some very concerning ideas. He does not have the money to see a therapist and no longer trusts his school's clinic - I am the only person he talks to. I don't know how I can say that I don't want to move in with him because of petty financial reasons when he is depending on me to get him out of a bad situation and hopefully provide some emotional support. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are also very concerning. They've had many hardships and are not bad people, but they aren't doing well. They - especially my mother - often relied on me to be their emotional support and often mediate conflicts between them  or between our immediate family and our extended family. They are barely supporting themselves on a single minimum-wage income and a disability income. They have extremely strained relationships with our extended family for a laundry list of reasons including abuse/neglect. They've also always been a little ""nutty,"" believing in conspiracy theories, aliens, etc. but they've recently begun to take this to an extreme and have said things that make me truly believe they are both feeding into each other's paranoia/delusions about the world around them. They are incredibly isolated and have no personal relationships, having pushed everyone away for a variety of reasons. Growing up, they were extremely critical of people and would ALWAYS nitpick my (or my brother's friends), talking about their appearance or their attitudes or their beliefs and this really damaged our ability to socialize (I think I got more of this than my brother did). They are only getting worse and refuse to seek outside help and I fear that I'm going to have to become their financial support or caretaker very soon (though they insist that things are fine and this is not something I should worry about). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have also struggled with my own mental health for a long time. I have never been good at making friends and have nothing more than casual acquaintances from work or classes, so I don't have anyone to talk through small life details with and I think they snowball into \^this (thanks, anxiety). I also feel like I have talked about my own emotions too much to my family - particularly my brother - and can't stand the thought of making things about me any more. I have tried to reach out to professors/mentors about my financial situation and seek advice since it is directly affecting my classes, but I have received very cold or dismissive responses (which makes sense - everyone has a sob story). As much as I love what I am studying and want nothing more than to continue, I fear that I will be dismissed from the program after this semester and I don't know how to prepare for the financial nightmare that will cause in addition to the disappointment. 

&amp;#x200B;

As an added plus, I have gained about forty pounds in the past few months (I was already slightly overweight, now I'm 5'4"" and 160lbs and it's not healthy fat, let me tell you). I'm struggling with overeating in a way I never have before, even though I am extremely careful about my diet and nutrition and near-obsessively track my food using cronometer/myfitnesspal. My hair has gotten super dry and I'm pretty sure it's breaking off (cool), my skin is a mess of cystic acne like nothing I've ever experienced, and my nails are brittle and flaky and disgusting. Can stress/anxiety/depression do this to a person or could there be something legitimately wrong with my health beyond just my inability to stop eating when I should?

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what to do or where to start, and I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to or seek advice from. How do I approach my graduate professors in a constructive way so that I can continue with school? How do I make the right decision when it comes to moving in with my brother? How do I work enough and still stand up for my boundaries?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you're my brother, sorry I couldn't be honest. I'm a shitty person who uses the internet for validation.",01Apr2019,1
24,"Hi I’m new to fitness and r/fitness removed my post so I thought I would post here.

Been working out now for about a month and was wondering if anyone had any advice.

Stats:
Male
Age:30
Weight: 245lbs
Height : 5’9


Routine: I have been doing 35 Minutes on the elliptical daily on the 5th level of intensity and finish at about 2.5 miles in that time.
Weights wise I lift every other day and when I lift I do 5x5 bench at 135 lbs
5x5 squat at 135 lbs
5x5 deadlift/barbell row at 135lbs

Diet wise it’s not great I’m not drinking anything but water and trying to stay good on food but I work about 65 hours a week  and sometimes slip with a rice type dish or something not great. I’ve lost maybe five pounds since I started and want to get to 200-210 by July so I have a couple questions.

A.) does anyone have any tips that could help
B.)  am I being unrealistic or could I get to this weight by July?
C) could anyone help with food suggestions and or a meal plan.

Lastly thank you all for the advice in advance, really excited to get this fitness journey done right and figured all of you could help!",01Apr2019,0
25,"First and foremost, I'm sorry if the formatting of this post is weird, it's my first time ever posting on Reddit.

I'm posting this on a throwaway for private reasons.

To clear some things up, I'm 19 and currently attending a community college as a full time student. I don't know what to do anymore, my family and I have been struggling with earning enough money and trying to get by for quite some time now. Most of my high school years were spent waking up at 3 am, going to school and getting picked up by my parents right after school was over in order to get home ""early"" and not catch any traffic. It is my first year in college and I am still doing this with my father and younger brother (he's 16). Due to this, it was almost impossible for me to get a job in my late high school years as my family only had access to one car, and the area (neighborhood) where I live in mexico is limited with opportunities and not very safe at all. Also, I want to clear up that I am aware of the fact that I am not the only student crossing the border everyday to go to school, there are probably hundreds if not more. The point of this post is a reach out for help, for advice anything. I've struggled with anxiety, depression almost my whole life and have recently began to have suicidal thoughts and feel as I am becoming a burden to my family by not doing much despite being a full time student. My father is a painter and has had trouble being able to find a job recently and my mother is unable to work due to a spinal injury and having had breast cancer in the past (she is cancer free now). I don't know how much longer I can keep up with the routine and I feel trapped, like I am in a constant loop. I personally feel like my father has fallen into a state of depression and won't admit it. He has fallen into a slump and will sometimes go days without showering and has recently spent a lot of his time in bed now. It breaks my heart to see them like this and I really don't know what else to do at this point, I feel lost and alone. Also, not a single one of my friends knows the truth about where I live and what I do, nobody, not even the people I have called my closest friends. I've contemplated telling them, but I always end up keeping it to myself.

I don't want anyone to think that I am posting this for sympathy, I am genuinely looking out for some help, advice, anything at this point. I will definitely be out job searching for once, but I don't know were to start or how to start since I only have a high school diploma. I really just needed a place to vent for once, because I feel like I've kept this buried all up inside of me for far too long.

Some questions that I do have:  
1. I'm currently majoring in Computer science (Cyber Security), but it might take me around 3-4 full years to transfer to a UC/CSU since I have a ways to go with prerequisites and math. My grades are surprisingly looking great, but then again it is only my second semester, should I stick with this plan or do something else? I genuinely am interested in my major, but I am not sure if I can afford to stay for THAT long, especially with the current situation I am dealing with. Would it be worth it to stay?

2. What are some jobs that I can get as a 19 year old college student with only a high school diploma. Are there any good ways to make cash online?

3. What are some things that I can learn or do NOW that can better my future self or boost my income for the later years.

Also once again, I really apologize if this post was a mess. I'm doing everything I possibly can to find some help and advice. I know that it will not be easy for me, I know I might struggle a bit, but I need a change, I need something, anything. To those who read this, thank you.",01Apr2019,1
26,"Hey all, I’m so nervous right now and honestly just need some confirmation and advice from others so here goes. 

For background, I’m a curious teenage guy who decided to try an online webcam, I met this really awesome person and long story short it turned in to something kinda..well, inappropriate. 

Unexpectedly, our connection was interrupted and suddenly I was on cam, with my junk showing, with a clearly underage individual who acknowledged me as I was scrambling trying to disconnect. I was then met with a “you are banned for 14 days” message, but was prompted to unban myself for $15? 

Could I be tracked and legally punished for this? Note, I had an account made but my username was only “guest” or something like that.

28, I met a girl who I am going to marry. She is my soulmate and the love of my life. She is 24. When she was 12 she was walking her dog and a group of guys tied her dog up. They then proceeded to force her to perform oral sex on all of them.  We have been together for 6 months and she just told me this now. She is obviously still troubled by it . She showed me there Facebook names and I wrote them all down.  What would you guys do in my position? ,01Apr2019,1
30,"Hey there, I'll start this story last weekend.
On my boyfriend was visiting from out of town the next day, and I was talking to a friend about how I hoped my roommate would be out, because last time my boyfriend came she stayed in our room and we had to leave to have any sort of conversation as she was studying. This upset me because our mutual friend was there, who has her own room next door, and they did not go to her room while I had a guest. 

My friend encouraged me to just ask her if we could have some time alone, and so the night before he came I asked my roommate for an hour alone so we could talk. (This was not necessarily to cover up anything sexual, we are having a hard time finding out how to move forward in our relationship and needed to talk face-to-face.) Also, her boyfriend was in town and had a hotel, so I thought this was not a problem.

Today, I remembered that I needed to interview and record a family member for a class. Since I needed to have the phone on speaker to record, I asked if I could have 45 min in the room. I considered common spaces, and I do that for most other phone calls or any time I am studying past 11, but it was daytime and they would have been busy. 

We parted ways for about 15 minutes, and she came back to the room, packed up her backpack, and then told me that she would appreciate more warning as ""this has happened twice."" She also said she would have preferred I went to the library. I told her that I did not know you could talk (especially in a 20+ minute phone call) in the library, which is true as I never have studied there. I immediately offered to go there, but she said no and walked out. I apologized several times in the room and once over text, which she did not reply to

I own the fact that I could have asked her far in advance, as I knew about this interview for a week. That is my fault. However, I really had no idea that you could talk in the library, and I definitely would have gone there if I knew! I thought I had essentially no other option but my car, and if I had known that about the library, I would've gone there.

So I am hiding in the bathroom after work, and I am just looking for some thoughts about what to do when I get back in. I realize that I may seem to be overreacting, and I guess if it seems that way, I'm a bit of a doormat, so if she was as upset as I would have to be to say something, I feel horrible.

I have been working 28hours per week all month, and she has a lot of time alone in the room. I also worked today for four hours right after my interview, so I am not sure why this bothered her so much.",01Apr2019,1
31,"This is an interesting one. Since I can remember I have abhorred the sound made by people chewing food with their mouth open in a messy manner. Unfortunately my family are all specialists in the art of mouth breathing, none of them are able to eat in decent fashion. As a child I remember scolding my younger brothers who would regularly smack their lips as they ate dinner and being told of by my mother for being rude to them. I can remember being bothered by this at the time, but I don't remember ever being driven mad by it. My father had always been an obnoxious eater, and I always tried to avoid him while he was eating. When I was younger I typically did not eat too many meals with him because of his work schedule but a couple years ago he got a new job that allowed him to eat dinner with us at least a couple times a week. In the beginning I endured, I ate quickly and got out of there because his loud smacking sounds would induce anxiety and a mild rage (I believe the exact condition I have is called Misophonia). But as of late I am beginning to realize that I don't think I can take it anymore. He can't eat or drink without me slowly beginning to see red and get an impulsive desire to chuck my plate against the side of the wall and whip my cup out of the dining room window. I have told my . mom about the immense anxiety I get when he eats around me, but I am yet to bring it up with him. Considering the type of guy he is I don't think he would take the information very well. The other thing there is to consider is that my father suffered a mild to severe head injury around the time he got his new job and my theory, without knowing whether it has any basis in truth, is that there is some sort of correlation between his injury and deeply aggravating noises. The other thing to keep in mind is that he is a verrrry heavy mouth breather and this is made apparent just by being around him. Any and all though are welcomed. Thanks!

TL;DR: My dad eats with his mouth open and smacks his lips and I have some sort of irrational mental condition that sends me into mild fits of anxiety and rage when he does this.

38,"I [M17] recently just deleted my best friend's [M18] number and removed him from social media. This is the second time I have seriously cut contact with him, the last happening in October, and we didn't reconnect until January. 

This week has been emotional. I have BPD. I am getting treatment and it is pretty well controlled, all things considered. I do have a few emotional triggers that I ask him to be aware of. He said he understood and would be courteous of them.

He isn't. Repeatedly. And I don't know why he does this. If I say that what he does hurts me, he continues to do it. He acts like a dick. It hurts immensely and I don't understand. He Never apologizes. It hurts really bad and I just don't understand why he acts like that towards me.

We had a very bad falling out last summer/fall, he became verbally abusive and would make me cry almost every day. Cutting him off was the best and worst thing I ever did. It took me months to get over him, only to come back. He promised he was better, that he wouldn't be mean to me anymore. I really did believe him for a little while.

I do have my own emotional and mental health issues. I am always not the most stable person. But I am in therapy and I am miles better from where i used to be. It just seems like nothing I do stops him from acting that way towards me and it hurts badly. He never seems to feel that guilty for it.

I know i probably sound like an idiot, and a million people are screaming at their screens wondering why I don't just cut him off for good, and I don't blame them. I know it's what i should do, for both of us, since we obviously don't mean well. It's just hard and I can't help but blame myself for not being better. For not being different.

39,"Hey everyone, thanks in advance for reading.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to keep it short. I work in a hotel. We recently had our old (equally bad as current) GM quit for a new job in another state, and they were replaced by the at-the-time front-desk supervisor, who had recently approved of a new person to hire to train to replace them, not as a supervisor but just as a front-desk agent.

The new front-desk agent was okay at first, but when the old GM officially left and the new GM assumed power, this front-desk agent started screwing up hardcore.

Checking in guests into dirty rooms, failing to complete the daily checklist (or even beginning it) before the next shift arrives, stealing from coworkers, lying to coworkers about other coworkers and being caught in it, forgetting information, letting their s/o behind the counter, GOING THROUGH OUR DUMPSTER SEARCHING FOR VALUABLES, installing programs on the computers without permission, having the wrong amount of money in the drawer at the end of the shift, charging guests incorrectly or comping charges without authorization, the whole shebang. Oh, and they put up the christmas tree on christmas day. like what the hell. had to put it back up by themselves

They received numerous complaints from coworkers as well as guests, and nothing would ever be done about it. Then the drug use became more apparent. Slurring words, unable to stay still for even a few seconds. Can't shut up. Bright red skin-picking marks on their face. The GM has told me personally that they know all the signs of a meth addict and the front desk agent definitely is one.

Finally HR and the GM had a 2-on-one meeting to discuss a drug test, and they somehow got out of the drug test. I was told a story about what went down but now I'm aware I was lied to by the GM. (turns out they lie about just about everything they talk about)

Meanwhile the GM is becoming too comfortable in their position and failing to take care of big problems such as being understaffed. Then one day someone called in on a busy day, which lead to someone quitting, which lead to the GM being called and saying they're too busy to do anything (which is basically all the time) which lead to the OWNERS being called, and they were able to make some decisions and authorize some overtime to get the day over with.

We got fed up with the GM and went to speak with the owners about them (open door policy), citing terrible things we know the GM has done such as an affair with a guest, snapchatting sexual pictures of themselves to a subordinate (possibly reciprocated as said subordinate denied it later when asked, even though they told us directly about it), stealing time before being put on salary, and smoking pot in a room of the hotel with they're 3-year old in the room. They then had a meeting with the GM in which they denied everything (days later admitted to smoking in the room) and was told to not approach any employees about it.

The GM immediately approached every employee about it.

The owners told them to either apologize for harassing the employees or lose their job. So they apologized at a work function and that's the end of that. 

The GM promised a specific coworker to be put on day shift and that they would be promoted to front desk supervisor, and now the drug-using coworker from earlier in the post has been promoted to that position, even though the one who was promised the position has years of seniority over them and is objectively better at the job. This has lead us to the theory that the front-desk agent is the GM's drug dealer and the GM is protecting the front desk agent's job at all costs in exchange for either a discount or free pills. (more on the pills in just a bit)

The highest level of authority is the owners, and they want us to tell them when things like this are going on, and they assure us they believe everything we told them, but the GM is still here.

We employees are under the belief now that the GM is on pills, and we learned (as the GM told one of us **directly**, who shared with the rest of us) that they (the GM) actually did at one point in the past temporarily lose custody of their child because of, to quote, ""weed and pills."" Also because they are becoming increasingly fidgety, as the owners pointed out to us. along with weight loss, and they were already hella skinny.

We have been to HR over many, many different things in the past, and they (one person) never, ever handle anything appropriately, if at all. They tend to go to the GM and give names when they try to explain whatever the problem may be, which is not okay with us because the GM treats different people unfairly compared to others. And HR tends to side heavily with management regardless of the context.

So HR won't help, the GM is corrupt, the owners are too forgiving and will not stop giving second chances (gave the last GM dozens of chances, and they only left because of a new job)

We are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with our jobs and just don't know what can be done. Which is especially awful for me because I actually love my job! 

&amp;#x200B;

So realistically, what can we do in this situation? to get rid of one or either of them? Or what would you do? Feel free to PM if brand specifics could be helpful. I can't put the hotel name here, of course.

When my coworker left, I took over everything and have basically kept his role alive and functioning at the same rate it was at when he was here. I took alot of pride in the fact that we werent held back by the fact that he was gone. 

I spoke to my business mentor (a stakeholder in the business) and she believed I was worth 20K more then what I was earning, and that there was a huge chance that I would get it. I got myself really amped up, really pumped. I practiced what I was going to say, how I was going to say it and how I would have some pride and be strong. 

I said what I needed to say, and I was denied; basically saying that everything I've done isnt above and beyond and is just what a good employee should do.

43,"Hi all, I know this is really long and most probably won't read all the way through. I have a summary at the bottom. I would seriously appreciate any help I could get. Thanks so much in advance!

I don’t know which study abroad program to choose and commit to.I am not sure what to do and I don’t have very much time at all to decide. I’m faced with three option, all with pros and cons. 

First, I can go to London through CIEE, which is a program provider. This option is the cheapest and it’s in my dream city. The courses offered are very annoying in the sense that I’m not sure about the schedule yet, and I don’t know if the courses abroad all will necessarily fulfill requirements back home (most will but maybe one wont). But despite that, the courses will be a lot easier because they will be taught in a style that I am used to back home. The biggest benefit of CIEE is definitely cost. I am not rich at all, and study abroad is extremely expensive for me. The biggest con is that this program isn’t at a university. The CIEE courses are at “global institutes” which are just small classrooms with only other American ciee students. This is truly the only thing holding me back about this program. I really want the “uni” experience, but I’m afraid I won’t get it. I want to experience freshers and interactions with local students, which I know I’ll miss out on if I go with CIEE. Also, I won’t get the same breaks as uni students do. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe typical unis have a break before exams. I would love to have that break to travel and such, but with CIEE, I’ll only have a week off. All in all, if money was no issue, I would not go with CIEE. 

My second option is University of Manchester. This option is slightly more expensive (about 2k more) and far more independent, but it does have that university aspect that I want. Manchester seems very student oriented and I think I will enjoy my time there. Of course, I’d rather be in London, but Manchester doesn’t seem like a bad second option. The only issue with Manchester, besides the price, is that it will likely hurt my gpa. My study abroad advisor told me it’s very rare to get higher than a B in courses at Manchester. I have a 4.0 right now, so obviously I would lose that. But in terms of quality of life while abroad, I definitely think Manchester wins out of all my options because student life seems really great.

My last option is to study abroad through ISA, another program provider, at the University of Westminster. This truly seems like a perfect option. I still have the support of a provider (ISA) like I would if I went with CIEE, but I’m still at a university like I would be if I went to UoM. In terms of location, it’s also the perfect option. Then again, it’s the option I’ve researched the least because I’ve just truly considered it a very short while ago. Although it seems perfect, there’s still a couple issues. First, the cost. This program would be about 2k more than UoM and 4k more than CIEE, pretty much an entire semester’s tuition (and those are just added fees on top of the tuition). I just genuinely don’t know that I could afford this option (all my estimated costs have already had all possible scholarships factored into them). I could of course go into debt, but I’m not even sure where I would get the loans from (I already factored in pre-approved loans into all my costs as well). Second, from what I have read, University of Westminster isn’t a great school. It ranks very low, but since I’m not earning a degree from there, I’m not sure if that really matters. 

TL; DR: I’m having trouble deciding on a study abroad program. I could go with CIEE to London, University of Manchester, or University of Westminster with ISA.

Pros of going abroad with CIEE London: cost (this is the cheapest option), it’s in London (my dream city), the courses probably will not hurt my GPA

Cons of going abroad with CIEE London: not at an actual university (I will miss out on the “uni” experience) and I will likely have to take a course that won’t go towards any requirements

Pros of Manchester: I will get to be at a university, the city is very student-oriented

Cons of Manchester: My GPA will more than likely decrease, it’s not my dream city (London)

Pros of Westminster: I will get to be at a university, I will get to be in London

48,"Hi. My boyfriend is a very driven person, and he pushed himself very very hard in classes. He’s really smart, but gets very stressed as a lot of his self esteem is related to his success in academics. I’m working on helping him become more confident in his identity, so that’s not really the problem. The problem is that he constantly sacrificed sleep to stay up studying. He’s ahead in all of his classes, and will study for a test I know he’ll ace for 6 hours. He stays up as late as 4 in the morning. It’s gotten to the point where we drifts off to sleep when we are hanging out in the afternoon, since he’s having 5 or less hours. When I tell him he needs to sleep, he just brushes it off with humor like “I’ll sleep when I’m dead.” I know that sleep deprivation worsens grades, and I’ve told him such, but he won’t listen. How do I try to help him take better care of himself? I know it’s not my responsibility, but as his girlfriend I want to help encourage him and support him to take better care of himself. How do I do that? If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thanks! ",01Apr2019,1

When the school year began she ended getting a boyfriend, in the processes i fell in love with her and she also had a guy friend who she had been best friends with for a long time. She ended up getting a crush on me for a little bit and i was the happiest ever i felt and then it came crashing down when she broke up with her boyfriend and told me she loves me and all of that.

We talk every day and text on weekends but there’s 2 problems. She’s dating a shitty guy(whom she comes to me to vent about all the time) and also we work together so double oof. 

I’m not a home wrecker but I did admit it to her. There was no real changes other than me wanting to get her tickets to a show for her bday and she had to decline and said “if you didn’t have feelings for me I’d absolutely go but since you do it wouldn’t be fair to my boyfriend”. I understand that.

53,"So, I’ve been working at this restaurant for a little over two years now. I originally started in the dish-room and have been moved to the kitchen. About a year in both. Well, I’m in a winter sport -basketball- and therefore I wasn’t working during the week and only Saturdays. I asked someone higher up at work if when basketball got done, I would be able to continue my normal schedule and get my hours back. They said “of course, you are seniority here, it will be no problem.” Well after a month of not being in a sport I was still only working one day a week and that just wouldn’t cut it. I told them I would like me hours back otherwise I’m going to start looking somewhere else to work. They gave me 2 days a week -I normally worked 4-5 days- and I said once more that I would need some more hours. They finally gave me my 4 days back but the schedule for next month I’m barley working again. I asked what the reason was for and they explained “Well so-n-so said that they needed more hours so we just cut yours down to do so.” I get other people need hours and whatnot, but why cut all my hours down and not a little from everyone. I love everyone I work with but it’s very unfair how I’m the only one that gets cut. I’m not sure if I should just deal with it or start looking for another job...

57,"Backstory: I have a 50 pound mixed breed dog. He was a rescue, which included getting neutered super late in his life. Which means, he has a fully developed scrotum. When he was neutered, they didn’t take all of his scrotum skin, so it just sags all goofy like between his legs. (He has his purse, just not the jewels)

Today: I have some friends over, we are socializing before dinner and my dog walks by me... and I do a thing. Everyone is taken a back and surprised that I did it. We had a huge debate about it, the result of which is this post, for the world to tell us if I should be ashamed of myself. 

The event: I treat his saggy skin as a normal none sexual part of his body. Just like someone might grab a tail, leg, or ear when they play keep away with their dog. It’s not a sexual body part in my opinion anymore. So I was playing with him and tugged on his empty sac. This is something I do when I play with him. He plays too, he tries to keep away from me. I try to tap his head, or yank his tail or tug the skin. He tries to play bite me before I do. Simple game. 

Shall I feel ashamed of myself? Reddit lords, let me know. ",01Apr2019,1
58,"So a little bit of back information: 

My roommate \[21F\] has had this dog since she moved into the house last summer. We (the other roommates \[21-23F\]) approved of her getting a dog since she said she would take really good care of him and all that jazz. At first everything was fine she bathed him regularly and treated the dog very well. She got into a relationship with a guy who had the same type of dog and they were always at the dog park and it was nice to see both her and the dog super happy. But then around December they broke up and a month later she starts dating this new guy who I'm assuming doesn't have the same interest in dogs as the last boyfriend. Ever since she started dating this new guy the dog has consistently had accidents in the house and is left at the house for us (the other roommates) to take care of. During this time I did keep in mind that she does have a job she works Thurs-Sun almost all day but I noticed instead of coming home from work to take care of the dog she would go to new boyfriends house instead. We made the lose agreement that while she was at work I would let him outside when I was home but I felt like she was starting to take advantage of that. I did reach out to her about the dog having accidents in the house and how she needs to do something about it and she was nothing but rude to me and claimed that I was neglecting the dog. That led us to get into a fight with us just going back and forth of me saying how he's not my responsibility and her saying I just need to take him out more. A couple more accidents happened in the house and another one of my roommates got involved and basically told her she needs to take care of it or we will. 

It has been almost a month since we had that discussion and I am very concerned about the dog. She will take the dog to her boyfriends house for a day / a day and a half at a time but then just drop him back at our house. She took all her stuff out of the bathroom and spends most of the week at her boyfriends, only coming home for 15 minutes during the day. There hasn't been any food in the dogs bowl so I'm guessing that to solve the accidents problem she just doesn't feed him? I've personally bought him food in the past when she told me he had been feeding him sugar cookies (not dog cookies) for the past two days. I really don't want to have to buy him food again because I know she will take advantage of me doing that and that's money I do not want to spend especially considering that it's not my dog. 

Today: 

She dropped the dog off at our house around 6pm yesterday and didn't come home until 1pm today. Her and her boyfriend came in for maybe 10 minutes and I'm guessing fed him some peanut butter since there was a spoon with peanut butter on it left in the sink. There is no dog food in the house and there hasn't been in a couple weeks. I rarely have to let him out to go to the bathroom since he's not eating. She does fill his water bowl up most days. There haven't been any accidents in the house which is what makes me think he isn't eating. Also, today one of my roommates friends was petting him and noticed that he has what looks like a puncture wound on his back. I've reached out to her today about the possibility of him needing to eat and the wound we found. She has not replied and I just feel so bad for this poor dog. He deserves so much better than this. 

I've reached the point where I just do not know what to do or how to handle this. We as the roommates have reached out to our landlord and he basically just told us to call the SPCA but I'm extremely hesitant to do so. I've been trying to just mind my own business in this situation since I can't really talk to the roommate about it and expect her to be rational about it. 

I just texted her and asked if he needed to be fed or anything to see what she would say and she said she fed him at 1pm today but that confuses me since there's no dog food in the house. I also mentioned the puncture wound and she said he broke and hurt himself on a mirror and it was a scab. 

I'm very tired of him just being left at the house for us to take care of when he is not our responsibility to fed/walk/let out (except for when she's at work but that's never been a problem). And when I say he was having accidents in the house I meant while she wasn't at work because when she does work that's when I or another roommate would let him out without a problem. I just feel like she is taking advantage of us the roommates doing her a favor while at work and she just assumes now that we will be home to let him out 24/7. Advice please!!!",01Apr2019,2
59,"I’m going to very vague because now I know they’re on reddit. I posted on a subreddit that’s meant for giving people advice, about an issue I was having in my relationship with my SO and 2 other people that my SO works with. It was very personal and I mostly needed somewhere to vent and to get advice and I never planned on sharing my feelings (or the post) with my SO for reasons that I won’t explain here. (Long story short, I got some great advice and it helped me figure some things out about myself and it didn’t ever need to be shared with my SO.) 

Someone that my SO works with apparently frequents that subreddit DAILY. This individual screenshotted EVERYTHING I posted (including every single comment) and brought it to the boss of the company which led to a meeting where all people the post was about (including my SO) were pulled into the office and made to read everything. There are a lot of details I’m leaving out but this was an incredibly awkward and humiliating experience for everyone involved (especially me!!!). 

So I need advice on how to handle this situation. This individual needlessly shared all of this personal private information with the people it was about and made things incredibly uncomfortable for everyone, and it even threatened my SOs job. This post had nothing to do with the job itself and only to do with a few people employed at said job. It was totally unnecessary for this individual to share the posts let alone BRING IT TO THE BOSS and I feel like they only did it to get an  “in” with the boss. I looked through this persons comment history after I found their account (yes I’m 110% sure it’s their account) and they are constantly giving people advice in that thread. So they understand what the community is for and that anonymity is VERY important. Regarding my post, it was extremely obvious that I never wanted my SO to read it. Me and my SO even almost broke up because of the stress this situation caused. 

I’m angry and humiliated! It’s like all of your private thoughts being read out loud for everyone to hear and you can’t stop it. I know that you shouldn’t put stuff online that you don’t want anybody to find but I even had created a throwaway account and used fake names and they still figured it out. I found some comments on this persons account that are pretty inappropriate and part of me wants to screenshot it and send it to the boss because they also frequently comment on the companies subreddit, as an employee. This is also someone I have to work with occasionally (we have different bosses) and it’s affecting my job as well. 

What do I do?!

66,"My mom, my dad, my husband, and myself were all sitting at dinner at my parent’s house when suddenly my mom started to choke. We all stopped for a moment and I asked if she was choking and she nodded yes. My dad, husband, and I are all CPR and first aid certified. I immediately was the one to jump up and spring into action. I got behind her and attempted the Heimlich maneuver. I remembered as I was doing it and through my adrenaline rush that I had to have hand over hand, thrust upwards, and slightly bend her over. I was behind her dining chair so I had her lean forward more to get some more leverage. My dad was in front of her ready to do a finger swipe if necessary and to switch with me if I needed. I had my husband go to call an ambulance just in case. After what felt like minutes (it was probably under 30 seconds) whatever food was lodged in her throat worked it’s way up and I guess she then swallowed it because it wasn’t spit up. After she caught her breath and cleared her throat more, she was just fine. 

At this point I’m shaking in response to it all, my dad is holding her hands, and I took one of my Xanax (I have an anxiety disorder). Even though I did everything I could and did end up helping her dislodge the food from her trachea, I can’t stop feeling like there’s more I could have done. Maybe I could have done a better job or followed all the steps perfectly. Maybe I should have thrusted harder or had her stand up.

67,"I’d like to think this started about 5 years ago when I first got my phone, I’ve always been very socially awkward so around people I started using my phone, pretending to do something on it to combat said awkwardness. The issue didn’t really start to get bad until I started feeling very alone in my 10th grade year and decided I would try and find a website to document my thoughts while also attempting to communicate with people. This led me to experience project (which is no longer around). Here I would make posts about how I felt, it was how I relieved myself and on the way I ended up meeting of whom I could relate to. I Began to consider these my friends and prioritized talking to them over being in touch with any sort of reality. I must say these were people in their late 20s, 30s, and 40s. I craved learning about the experiences of others and due to being so socially inept, I cut myself off from everyone. This eventually led to me only focusing on this website and these people and I let things such as my personal hygiene and academics go down the drain. When my mom found out, she was livid and immediately took my phone away, but I still continued to use this as much as I could behind her back. I would do my homework in the living room right in front of her, with one tab open to the assignment and the other open to this website. I never got better, I just got better at hiding. It was around the time that this website shut down that I got a boyfriend and my addiction shifted from the website to talking to him. Again I would do this all behind my mom’s back from emailing him, to Skyping him and neglecting my work at the same time. Eventually, I found reddit and it once more became the website to fill my loneliness and where I could actually get my voice out. It has now become my current source of addiction alongside communicating with my boyfriend hours on end. This has actually gotten really bad, I’ve found myself in the same loop as I did three years prior. I neglect my personal hygiene, I don’t go out and socialize, I’m completely neglecting schoolwork, and I barely eat anymore. It’s gotten to the point where if I know I’m exhausted I still try and stay online because I don’t want to get off. I’m extremely bad at explaining this but I believe this to be just as serious and dwterimental as if I was addicted to something else.

68,"im going to start this off with a disclaimer. im not sure yet if i am or not. im in a terrible state right now and frankly where i currently am in life may not be the best situation to add a child into the mix and im aware of that. but a lot can change in 9 months. times are just hard now.

i (20F) have known my boyfriend for 3 years, it's kind of unclear when we got together but we are in a committed relationship for a long time now. he's going to school out of state now but his parents live here. i actually recently moved back from out of state too. not to go into much detail about my current situation but it could use an improvement.  im not in college, my roommate kicked me out, i don't have a great job. so obviously i cannot support a baby at the moment. i used to do pretty well for myself. now i don't have much going for me thanks to a shitty economy, having to crash on my dad's couch and my avoidant personality disorder preventing me from being proactive. 

but the question is not should i have a baby. i can answer that for myself and the answer is it's complicated but i believe most parents rarely have the timing right. if i am pregnant i am 85% (??) sure i will not terminate it.

what i am asking is, what will his parents think, if it turns out that i am? they are lovely people and i know they like me a lot. i've met them several times, see them once in a while, have lunch with them, etc. even had them over for dinner at my mom's apartment recently while my boyfriend was back home for spring break. i met them recently but already they feel like family.

his parents are very wealthy. not millionaires, but im talking comfortably upper class. i am not by any means a gold digger or looking for this potential baby to be a ticket out. im smarter than that. i don't want or expect to be 100% supported by his folks. even if it appears like that i promise that is not the case and i know they wouldn't assume that of me. my boyfriend, (same age and 3/4 done with two undergrad degrees) has responsibility in the matter too.

when it comes down to it, i would love to have a baby. was i actively trying to get pregnant? ehhhh. were we being careful? kinda. he didn't ask. didn't wear a rubber. i used some contraceptive a few times but not all. if it turns out im not pregnant i might be disappointed initially but i know that in retrospect, waiting may have been the best choice. he is so busy with school and not as mature as i am. but again, abortion is not a choice im comfortable making. 

so, if i get the positive test in a week, what the fuck do i do? his mom will be the first one i tell. what will she say? what will his parents do? am i on my own? i'd be a kick ass single mom if i am, but i'd be broke as shit. if i'm not, and they offer their support, my boyfriend might resent me and our baby.

Throughout the school year my child who is in sixth grade has had this relationship with this other kid who is emotionally abusive. It’s been going on for two years now. Sometimes my child is feeling so upset about it that they don’t even want to go to school. 

However for some reason my child keeps going back and being friends with the abuser again. The abuser apologizes and says whatever and they’re okay again. They’re kids okay I get things aren’t perfect but how many second chances do you give? 

So my child told me they were excited to go to school tomorrow. I said “why cause so and so isn’t being a little bitch anymore?” Little did I know my child was still connected to fortnight (I know I know smh) and the kid may have heard me say it because they were in the same server. 

I immediately made my child shut off the game. I instantly felt regret. I’m worried I may have made my child’s last six weeks of school a living hell.

73,"(TLDR at the bottom)

I’ve pretty much known for my entire life that I wasn’t necessarily made in a typical way, per se. My parents couldn’t conceive so my mom had someone’s eggs donated to her, thus resulting in me. I’ve always kind of assumed that I’d inherited things from my mom (even though that seems dumb in hindsight). After doing more research, I’ve confirmed that I don’t carry any genetic material from her even though she carried me in her womb. 

With that said, I think I want to know who donated her eggs to my parents. This is for a couple of reasons:

1. I want to know what shit I’m genetically susceptible to, because I’m considering having kids someday and I wanna know if there’s anything in my genes that could potentially lead to some risks. 

2. I don’t look like either of my parents. I’ve always kind of felt separated from them, maybe because of the lack of resemblance. (My personality also clashes a bit with the rest of my family, leading to a lot of arguments). I honestly want to know that I look or act similarly to somebody so that I can finally feel that connection. I don’t need to be close to her or anything, I just want to sit down and have a cup of coffee with her. Or maybe just look at her face and finally see parts of myself reflected back. 

3. My own curiosity, to put it simply. I want to know more about my biological ancestry, even if she wants nothing to do with me. 

My parents have been pretty vague when I’ve mentioned it in the past so I don’t think they’ll be willing to discuss it again. I’m not sure if they even know the donor or anything about her. I’m not sure if she has records with ancestry sites or 23andme either and frankly, I can’t afford that shit. At least not yet. 

I’m just wondering if I should try looking for her. Should I save up for some kind of DNA test? Or should I just let it go?

(Side-note: I love both of my parents very much and would never try to replace them. My mother is the one who raised me, and genetics won’t change that.) 

What should I do?

TLDR: My parents had eggs donated to them in order to have me, and they aren’t willing to give any information about the donor (if they even have any). I would love some guidance, because I’m really curious about my ancestry. ",01Apr2019,0
75,"Hi everyone, I (M 17) am having trouble dealing with my anger issues, often times I just feel angry out of nowhere, even though if you were to ask any of my close friends about this, they'd probably deny it . I also had a few panic attacks in the past 2 years. 
There was this person I was interested in, at the time I wouldn't dare start a conversation with'em simply because I am not like that, I told my close friend about him and how I was interested in him, his advice was for me to message him on Facebook and so I did, reluctantly might I add.
We started chatting and we were getting along quite well even though we never spoke in school, we mostly avoided eye contact, this went on for about a month and a half, one day I asked him, ""hey whats up?"", and he never wrote back. From that point on I ceased all contact with that person, even though we went to the same school. I started having panic attacks when I saw him speaking to one of my other close friends and I rushed out of that situation without making a scene.
I decided to post here today because I saw somebody retweet his profile picture and am still having a hard time dealing with it, I'm not looking for advice on how to approach and talk to him, I am just looking for a way out of feeling like this everytime I see him",01Apr2019,1

78,"My family is riddled with personality disorders and my whole life I’ve been compared to other kids, insulted, and taken for granted.

My worth was in my grades and whether or not I did what my parents wanted. 
My parents were never proud. In fact the only things I remember the times when my dad actually showed up to my recitals/events was how disappointed and embarrassed he was when I messed up no matter how small the mistake.

Usually they didn’t even think I would succeed (which I almost always did). My mom uninvited everyone to my graduation because she didn’t think I’d graduate. She also sabotaged my first two jobs because she didn’t want me working after bullying me for not having a job the moment I turned 16. 

My schools forced me to get therapy and of course my parents weren’t happy and ruined that too. They made me look like I was the problem and I only wanted therapy for attention. My therapists don’t even call me back to this day.

I loved to sing and dance and participated in multiple sports when I was younger but now all I do is cry smoke drugs and plot to move out before I’m driven nuts.
As a result of not being aware of my parents treatment towards me being inappropriate, I attracted friends that feed off of me being insecure and I cut them off now I’m lonely and only have acquaintances that I’m scared to get close to.

I also feel really jealous of those with a better upbringing and supportive parents (including other girls in my family that my family praised at the expense of me being put down/compared to them)

80,"Okay, hi, I'm kinda of spiraling down and losing my sanity aha

I've never talked to anyone about any of this (maybe vaguely to my mom but pFffF she just tells me to toughen up + I only have a few friends that I could maybe talk to, but at this point they're annoyed with me... so hello reddit) 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in a relationship with someone for over a year (almost 2 years in a few months) and we're only 16, in high school. Don't get me wrong, he's seriously one of the best boyfriends that anyone could ask for. He's sensitive, caring, handsome and just what a lot of people look for. We rarely fight or disagree on anything, we're really really alike. I think. I honestly can't tell if I give up a part of myself sometimes when I talk to him but anYWAYS 

Sometimes I forget that he's only 16 and that I'm me (really problematic) but he wants to commit to a life with me and all this other stuff. Which at first sounds great and all but

1) We're really young, so much can happen and that makes me anxious (and he doesn't seem to take into account most of my anxieties unless it makes him feel like shit, so I've got that going for me) 

2) He ""listens"" to me, but I genuinely feel like he doesn't know me. Like I'm really into a lot of different things and anytime I mention them he goes ""yeah..."" and moves on to whatever he wants to say. Which, hey, whatever that's fine. 90% of the things I say aren't interesting but fewihbiuqfiuh2 (That sounded so edgy, you have permission to murder me at anytime for this horrid structure of a story.)

3) I might be slightly resentful towards him because he talks so badly about himself, but when I really got to know beyond the tip of the iceberg, he said he knows deep down he's not actually all the things he says he is. But I uh- I take so much time and emotion to respond to them and try to reassure him and it feels like a waste? If he actually struggled with confidence I'd get it but AHH I don't know man

4) this one is kinda wild and makes me want to drown myself like a lot but... I don't know if it's because I'm being an absolute clown (actually yes, I am being an absolute clown) but I've had dreams about cheating on other people. I KNOW. I'm an incredibly awful person. Despite having this perfect relationship, I wake up almost every night like ""yo what"" and get the WORST feeling in my stomach. I don't know if this means: a) my dreams are sHoWiNg mY tRuE dEsiRes and I'm just like my dad (yikes a whole other can of worms) or b) I'm being paranoid and I'm just unsatisfied in my relationship or how I feel like I'm missing out? 

&amp;#x200B;

I love studying relationships, learning those dynamics, why we make certain decisions- but it's so hard for me to work on my own personal stuff. I feel like a terrible person, and I as much as I really do love this dude, I feel like I'm holding him back, or vise versa. It's weird. I figured insecurity and identity are my biggest issues. It probably has nothing to do with him and me just being problematic, and well... ah me. I overthink everything. 

(One small thing that bothers me is that... he doesn't write. Like, at all. Barely in texts, not very well when it comes to papers or letters or just... I don't know. That's a really weird thing for me. When I read whatever he writes, I don't feel like there's a voice or personality behind it. Yeah, that's a condescending thing to say... but for me, uh personally, I love just reading someone else's personality with what they write. That's weird? Yeah. That's weird. But to break up with him over this would be actual insanity I don't even know why I'm mentioning this I'm so sleep deprived)

&amp;#x200B;

And before anyone tries to say: ""just break up, it's just highschool"" let me just uhhhh: 

a) again, I love this dude, and I've gotten really close to his family (like insanely close) it'd be so weird if that just stopped being a thing fehuwhefhwejfknwkj My point is that we're so involved and admired as a couple, that IF we were to break up, that would just... suck. 

b) I don't want to throw something again because I'm just really self destructive- let's say I do get into another relationship, then what? I'll be happy? I already am happy... kinda. I don't know. Maybe I'm bipolar. Yeah. Uh. All I know is that I just AH when I think about all of this. 

c) he's really accepting of me. The mistakes I make, the annoying things I am, and the way I look. He never ever guilt trips me or anything of that sort (trust me, I'd know by now) In fact, he thinks I'm this amazing person. But I feel like that's just because he doesn't genuinely know me or even like me- he just feels comfortable with me and wants someone to hold onto because he also happens to be scared about the future. I don't want to be that person. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

OKAY in conclusion I'm a really bad person and really don't want to be apart of the group of kids who just don't take highschool relationships seriously- I get it, we're young. But I feel like you should really appreciate the person and the relationship you build with them. Not just because, oh, you wanna date someone. The dude I'm talking about happens to feel the same way about that kind of thing, which works out well for me. Kind of. Because now I'm all weird. I don't know.

83,"My son will be 5 at the end of the summer. His biological father (who never signed the birth certificate nor ever even stepped for into the hospital the entire time we were there) was just a friend who caught me at a vulnerable time. We decided to become more like a family once we realized I was pregnant. We both make good money; even when I was on bed rest, he brought in enough to support us all including rent close to $2000/month. So that security was another aspect that had me convinced ""everything was gonna be alright"". A few months before my delivery we started distancing ourselves. Before my son was 4 weeks old, I moved back with my parents and was seeing someone else. I'm still with that someone else today, and *our* son knows him as ""daddy"".

Fast forward 4 years; bio-father has seen my son maybe 20 times, less than 2hrs each time, and spends the time arguing with me or trying to convince me that we need to move back in and 've a ""real family"". He's never once shown a genuine interest in the child, he always has ulterior motives, he's aggressive, he's irresponsible, he leaves marijuana and firearms out in the open or in unsafe places. 

I've made every attempt to start/keep a relationship between them, but I can't honestly say they've ever developed one. Bio-father always just cuts it short or focuses his attention and energy on me. While I'm trying to supervise a toddler getting into dirty clothes, weed, alcohol, ammunition, wide open porch doors... sometimes I really think he's oblivious to the extent of supervision children need. This guy left the front door open once and my dog got out and killed by a ups truck. So that thought is always in the back of my head too when he's suggesting we come over and ""help fix his jeep"" or some off the wall activity absolutely not suitable for a 2-4 year old. 

Bio-father has another child (10yrs old) who he never sees at all, only because he has no interest. The mother begs him, but he's just over it. Idk how his mind works. But, for some reason, he insists on staying in my life. My son cares for him, but I've contributed to keeping bio-father in his life, but I wouldn't say my son loves him. I've asked my son if he wants to go out with his dad alone or goto his house alone and it terrified him. Bio-father has threatened my son with ""oh you don't want to see me? I'll just go see (other son's name here)"".. 

I don't want this to goto court, just for my own anxieties, but it's possible it'll end up there. Unless I'm lucky enough for bio-father to give up on this child like he did with his last. My son has a father figure who has taught him everything he knows. It's a sticky situation, but I can honestly affirm I am not being biased or spiteful. I want what's best for my child, and I don't think being alone with his bio-father is in his best intrest.

He was kind, caring, listened to all my rants, faithful, and trusting, but I broke up because I felt like our conversations were always so bland. I connect through meaningful conversations, and I didn't feel like he really provided that. I grew bored of the relationship and stopped feeling attracted to him, even though he was the person I trusted the most and the one I turned to for everything. He loved me a lot, but I didn't feel like it was right to continue being in a relationship in which I didn't love the other person. In retrospect, the conversation aspect is not a dealbreaker for me in a relationship, so now I feel like I just took him for granted and didn't appreciate him for who he is. I think I was just in a relationship rut and could've worked out of it, but at the time, I thought I lost all feelings for him. I can't beg him to take me back now because he's in a new relationship, and I totally respect that. However, I just can't stop blaming myself and waking up sad each morning.

87,"a trigger warning for r*pe &amp; sexual assualt

disclaimer; my boyfriend is sitting right next to me as i make this post &amp; is moderating. he doesnt have a reddit but wanted unbiased advice. this is kinda long so i thank anyone who sticks with me &amp; has advice. 

backstory; so my bf regularly talks, and moves in his sleep. it's not every night, but it's often enough to where it's not a surprise when it happens. usually when he's sleep walking it's to turn off the air, get water, put our dogs away, ect... and it's common for him to never ever remember when he does these things despite how elaborate these actions are. when he talks, once again he never remembers, but it's usually very simple sentences and he's able to hold minimal conversation. 

okay, so last night we had his family over. they usually dont come by because they live in a different country and they aren't rich. his mother was looking through family photos they took when he was at the age of 6-14, and when people ask him about when photos were taken or where he was at he just kinda doesn't really remember. we go to bed and he's visibly distraught over the photos. i confront him about it and he just shrugs and says ""you know how i feel about my family"" (his father was abusive until his death).

so i let it go since his family was here &amp; i didnt want him to remember shitty things. then in the middle of the night he just shakes me awake and calls my name. i wake up and ask him what's wrong and he told me that someone touched him inappropriately when he was younger. he's visibly upset, but after a few minutes of him crying he goes back to sleep. 

i deicide to confront him about it in the morning, then decide to do it later tonight when his family wasnt there. i tell him about what happened that night and he kinda freaks out. he's crying and he's holding me and he tells me he really doesnt remember saying that or him ever being touched inappropriately. he tells me he's terrified because he doesn't remember a lot of his childhood, and he isn't too sure if it's a dream or not. 

tldr; my boyfriend wakes me up and tells me he's been molested, and then doesn't remember the molestation or waking me up.

So, a few years ago, I dated this girl. She and I dated for a month or so, and I really didn’t like her all that much, but I felt pressured into going out with her since she was my friend at the time. After we broke up, we didn’t speak for a few months, and then we became friends again. 
 
Let’s refer to her as Renée or R, for short. R and I have a long history of being friends, but she always seems like she wants something more out of our relationship. I don’t. I can also tell she’s a bit of manipulator, plus she often makes herself the victim in every situation she’s in. She was medically diagnosed with anxiety, and she uses this to her advantage and tries to excuse her shitty behavior/guilt tripping. The other day, she posted about texting one of those suicide hotlines on her Instagram story. Then, the slide after that was: “thanks to the SEVEN people who checked on me.” 

she also, posts about how she has a “crush” on someone. It’s me. She told me in December, and when I let her down easy, she was nice about it, but continued to post on her ig story about how “my crush will never like me!!” and “I have a crush on someone :((“. Now, her ig story the other day had something about her crush on it again, right after she posted some, let’s just say, creepy comments on one of my selfies I had just posted. The comments were along the lines of: 
-YES MAMA
-😩🥵💞❤️
-😭💞🤧😩
-😍😍😍😍
let’s just say, it kinda creeped me out. Also, I have a girlfriend (R doesn’t know this) and it makes me uncomfortable for someone else to be commenting that on my pictures while I’m in a relationship with someone I care about a lot. 

I’ve thought about ending our friendship, but I know she’d make a big deal and it’d be hard to avoid her, because we share some classes together. I really need a way to let her down easy and tell her I don’t want to be friends with her if she’s gonna continue to do weird stuff. ",01Apr2019,1

We gave a guy over the phone my brother's bank account, social security number, address, name, DL number. Everything but the deed to his house. Tomorrow morning (Monday) my brother starts a brand new job and he can't do anything other than call the bank in the morning. What can he do to further protect himself? 

Story-time. 
I will try to be brief, if you would like any details I will do my best to respond specifically. Today my brother and I were trying to get him signed up for insurance and got a phone call from someone claiming to be with ""healthcare marketplace"" to help us find the right insurance. He gave us all the answers we wanted to hear; within budget, help with medicine payment, ppo, mental health services, everything we wanted. We had so many distractions at the time, we hardly noticed the red flags (never asked about income, never asked how long my brother wanted to be insured for), and after the call we were told to expect our confirmation email, and wait to be contacted tomorrow by a representative to help walk him through sign up. We figured it was Sunday so that seemed likely and hung up feeling great that we finally had him on the path to wellness! However, upon inspection of the email I became suspicious. It was personally written (not from a business or on letterhead, no trademark) and all the information was incredibly general (listed his name, policy start date, some random member number, and next to plan it only said BCBS IHC Plan w/ Transamerica Insurance. I'm no expert obviously, but Google, Transamerica, and Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) all agreed that sounded like a bogus policy. So I called the guy back, who was very professional, and asked some more info (full name, his company's name, their 3rd party disclosure policies, etc.) and then asked to cancel the policy. He said he was sorry to hear that and I would see a confirmation email soon. Of course this never showed and the line was never answered again. 

Guys, I've never asked Reddit for anything (check, but this acct is baby-new, my old one got locked out) but my brother is the last person who deserves this, please let me know if you have any insight here. He starts a new job tomorrow Monday morning and all he can do is make a quick call to the bank to close his account until he gets off work. What steps can he take to help protect himself- besides listening to me!!

Also, if you have any tips on acquiring health insurance for mental disabilities/ mental healthcare in Tennessee (US) it is also very appreciated, as he is still uninsured. 

Thank you /r/",01Apr2019,1
101,"I have been with someone with 6 years and got engaged to them in October. We have been together since we were 16 and 17. All has been good, but as time goes on I feel like I depend on them more than I love them. I mean I love them but I’m not madly in love with them. I could see myself waking up some day and question everything. And now an old coworker that became a friend moved back into town after some time. We’ve caught up and talked quite a bit. And for some reason, we just have this unspoken connection. We don’t acknowledge it and we both know what we want. I could 100% see a future with them and I feel for them. They are all I think about. I can’t tell if it’s just because it’s new or what the deal is. But I’m truly conflicted because I have cared and loved the one I’m with for years and we are supposed to get married in November. But I feel like I might like something amazing slip through my fingers with the one I can’t shake. I feel so much and like a terrible person. I don’t know what I should do. I’ve never been so conflicted before, any advice? ",01Apr2019,0
102,"So I have a few friends from my hometown but we are rarely able to visit them and they are very rarely able to visit us. The most recent gap between our visits was literally 2 years. I'm 15 so i'm not able to drive long distance yet and these people are such awesome friends. Recently they visited us and we had so much fun, but we only spent 2 days together. It felt like an eternity, but ever since that visit ended and they drove back up to their home state, I have just felt this crushing sadness and feeling of hopelessness. I just feel that a lot can change in 2 years and i'm not sure when ill next see them or if ill ever see them again at all. I'm just so lost, sad, and confused. Every time I think about the visit I get lonely and bored for the next few hours and it feels like a part of me has died. I just need help coping. I have been told be happy that it happened, not sad that it ended, but that only makes it worse because i think about all the awesome things we did and how long it takes between visits and how I don't have much contact with them.",01Apr2019,1
103,"I was horrified when I found out that one of my previous coworkers was involved in child pornography and subsequently got arrested for it. I shared the news with a friend who doesn’t know him but I was taken aback by her response. She said that “it’s nothing because I don’t know which crime he was charged with.” 

Um it’s all over the news so how the fuck can I not know what my previous coworker was charged with??

She defended herself saying that “we don’t know his (the suspect) side of the story.” What story could the suspect possibly come up to defend his actions? There’s absolutely no excuse for what he did and he deserves to be in prison. Cops have apparently found evidence in his house so there’s no way we can argue with that.

I have been friend with her for about 2 years but I think I should end this friendship. Or am I being dramatic?? ",01Apr2019,2

107,"I’m 18f and I’m kind of afraid of dogs. don’t have a full-blown phobia of dogs, but a lot of types of dogs really scare me. My brain pre-judges every dog I encounter, generally dividing them into 3 levels of scariness. Level 1 dogs aren’t a threat at all. Our family golden retriever is a level 1. Level 2 is a dog I’d like to avoid, but I can tolerate for a little while if absolutely necessary. The vast majority of dogs are level 2. Level 3 is a dog I will avoid at all costs. These are usually big, growly ones that could easily kill me if they tried. 

Anyway. My parents, whom I live with, are planning on adopting another dog. They really like golden retrievers, so I figured they’d get a golden, which is great because those are almost always level 1 for me. But my mom just showed me a picture of a dog she’s thinking of adopting. The dog is a Rottweiler, which is at least a level 2 for me. I think I’d have a really difficult time living in the same house as that dog. 

The problem is, I’ve never mentioned this fear to my parents. The only dog I’ve had to spend much time with lately is our sweet old level 1 dog, so the fact that I don’t like most dogs has never really come up. They know I’m more of a cat person, but this takes it a step further than that. I don’t know how they’d react to finding out I genuinely don’t tolerate some dogs.

We both work at a lab and we both ended up being invited to go to a couple of bars for the past two nights.

So I adopted this cat two days ago from a shelter locally. They say she's 2 years 9 months but I really doubt that. She's kinda small both in fat and bone her tail is still slim like a kitten, I think she's closer to 2 years or a little less. Now that she's adjusted and stop hiding her little issues are coming out. 

She comes off as a very shy cat , and she is  But she hates to be alone. So problem number one. She cries constantly. She meows when she's alone or if she's two feet from me. She will meow laying at my feet. She's got food clean litter everything, she just cries all the time. 

Second she's a shameless food begger. I'm sure it's from her past home but I don't have any information on her past home. They said she was taken by the court but not why , unfortunately.  So this cat isn't a lap cat but she will literally climb my shoulder to sit on my head anything to get close to the people food. I've had pets that beg before but nothing like this, it's insane.

I don't know what to do. I need any tips or advice anyone has to offer on how to help change or adjust these habits my new cat has. Any help, suggestions anything will help, thanks.",01Apr2019,1

Me and my best friend both like the same guy. She made the first move, and he said that he didn't like her, but wouldn't mind a no-commitment fwb arrangement. They did that for a while, and during that time I was still trying to make a move on him. He also said to my friend that he wouldn't mind having a similar fwb relationship with me, although at the time he didn't know I was interested in him. I was just told by my friend that they are actually going to try dating, because he's actually become really interested in her.

I am really crushed, but I love both of them so much that I'm not angry with either of them. The question I have is whether or not I should tell him that I like him now, even though they just started dating.

121,"We are all in our freshman year of college, so none of us knew each other a year ago. At the beginning of the school year, we all met each other and quickly became really good friends. A little bit into the quarter, they began dating. He was always a bit strange, but we never really thought much of it. We go to a religiously affiliated college (which may be necessary information) and he was always weirdly forward about his thoughts about sex. He was a virgin, and often mentioned to her about wanting to lose his virginity. They eventually broke up mid January, and for about a week or so, things seemed fine. Then, at the end on January, my best friend got blackout drunk and he decided to follow her to her dorm and proceeded to rape her. 

The next day, she woke up and realized what had happened. She texted him asking why he thought that was the best way he should lose his virginity. Their conversation mostly revolved around him losing his virginity, not the fact that he raped her. That conversation contains evidence of him admitting to doing it, and there are many witnesses that saw him follow her that night, so there's no way he didn't do it. 

A few more days later, he called her and proceeded to say that it didn't really matter and that ""life goes on."" 

My best friend attempted suicide 3 times in February while he continued living his life, and now has a new girlfriend. 

The school has been investigating the situation, but nothing has happened since she told them over a month ago.

I just don't know what to do. I see the way he's living vs the way my best friend has been and its fucked up. She doesn't deserve that. 

I see him all the time. He knows I know. He avoids me, even when I look him dead in his eyes. I could easily ruin his life right now. I could post his picture with all the same information I have here and then he'd finally feel the repercussions. I could (and most likely will) tell his new girlfriend about what he's done. But should I? Would it be libel/slander? Is it up to me?

I'd appreciate any/all feedback. I'm just very lost and angry right now. 

TL;DR: Best friend was raped by someone who used to be my friend. Nothing has happened to him yet. Should I take it into my own hands?

127,"I have had social anxiety since I was 12 and I'm now 16, and even though I have done counseling for 2 years I still have waves of sadness that come over me every month or so. I think my anxiety stems from the fact that I was homeschooled from grade 1-6 but I don't blame my parents for it. In 7th grade I went to my first day of real school but I can't remember much about it all I remember is that I was frozen and scared. After a week I got used to it and it became fun and it was easier to work and I was getting good grades and it all seemed good other than the fact that I opted out of all public speaking like presentations and such. But then grade 8 started and I went to my first year of highschool and the first day of school I was scared again but not nearly as much and the first semester went fairly smoothly. In second semester is where things took a turn. I had trouble focusing and my anxiety was starting to get so much worse so I didn't end up going to the last 2 months of school that year. Luckily I somehow passed all my classes still. The next year in grade 9 I started homeschooling and it couldn't have been worse. Sure I wasn't feeling anxious but I was in the house all day I never talked to anyone outside my family, I never left the house, and it became hard to do school because of all the distractions around me so I only passed 2 subjects. In grade 10 things started looking better. My mom found this school in my area where they have condensed courses and only a handful of students in each class and is over laid back without deadlines no public speeches. The first semester was amazing I didn't feel anxious after the first day and I did all my school from the last year and got good grades too, but in second semester it all started again. I lost all motivation to do school and I ended the school year with 2 grade 10 subjects that I didn't finish. Luckily they let me start where I left off last year for grade 11, but this is around the time I started feeling less anxious and more depressed. I'm currently in 11th grade and I haven't completed or even started a single subject in grade 11. I am still working on grade 10 social studies that I got halfway through last semester and grade 10 math. I don't know why I have no will to do anything but I think I just feel useless and like a loser because I really only have 1 friend and we don't see each other on person all that often and my social anxiety stops me from meeting new people and I don't know what to do. I don't have a job and I don't know what I want to do with my life because I don't have any real passions or hobbies or talents and I'm always too lazy and quick to give up when things get hard. I really want to meet knew people and make new friends and get a job to support myself because I don't want to be a burden to my parents my whole life but I don't know what to do. And especially in the last few days I have been feeling really sad and scared that I may never find love. I have never had a girlfriend or even really talked to girls not because I am afraid but I felt like in highschool the girls didn't want to talk to me because I lacked confidence and charisma and I was so anxious that I never made any moves on people and I don't even think there was anyone I even had a crush on. I am a sucker for romance shows and manga so I have always wanted to experience love but as my life goes on and I get more and more behind in school and I keep getting more and more anxious I don't know what to do with myself and I don't know how I can fix this and I don't know how to hold a job or what job I want or what career I want to have down the line and I just feel like I'm worthless and have nothing and I never will. I want to make friends I want to find something I'm passionate about and I want to find someone I love but everytime I try to make something I always find a way to mess it up and I feel so lost and that I will always be alone and that I can never be happy. 

Sorry this was such a mess im sure there are tons of grammar mistakes I made but I can't stop crying and its hard to focus. Over the last 2 years I started to read a little and I have such a respect for authors and maybe would like to write myself but I'd probably be no good at it since I suck at everything else and I wouldn't even know what to write about or how to build a story and its not like that's a very reliable career choice so I don't know.

From that experience I accumulated a lot of credit card debt because my ex would take all my cash from my ssi disability checks for drugs and that was all I had for various living expenses so I relied on credit cards. We broke up a year ago and I began stripping to pay for my habit and pay off the $3000 credit card debt.  After I got clean I was able to save up a decent amount of cash, enough to pay all my debts and enroll myself in community college as well as save for a place of my own. 

Fall of 2018 I was financially ahead and had a few grand in savings. First it was car problems, expensive, but manageable.  A few tickets and accidents as well. Then just one thing after another. So much stuff keeps happening and financially I was being drained. I became overly stressed, so stressed i lost 25 lbs And got a kidney infection. That sent me into a manic episode and I made a lot of risky financial decisions. Now I’m $20,000 in debt and I lost my license for 3 months. I live in a rural area and I don’t have a job. Someone paid for a lawyer for me and I owe them $3000, they’ve been trying to get me to pay them back but I have $12 in coins to my name.  I also owe the state and court a few grand as well.

I don’t know what my options are to fix this. I can spend $30-35 to Uber 15  minutes to the nearest restaurant to get a serving job because I’m not qualified for anything else. I’ve heard there are some work from opportunities. I kind of just rather kill myself though. 

I was working in a restaurant serving and also dancing but was fired from both due to an unrelated injury that made both jobs too 
difficult and was replaced immediately. I also have unpaid medical bills and ambulance expenses from an overdose a year ago. 

I’m 26, I have a kid. Dads an addict (not the same ex). If I didnt have her I certainly wouldn’t be here anymore.  My parents have custody anyway. 

What the fuck do I do. My credits already fucked it goes down every week. I can’t get a loan. Believe it or not, when I’m not manic I am great with money and very responsible, an entirely different person. It’s almost like a toddler gets behind the wheel inside my brain and starts making decisions for me while my consciousness goes to sleep for a few months.

132,"The title says it all. Here's my story. 

I'm in eight grade now, so naturally, I was in seventh gradeast year. I live in New York so that means students apply to high schools, and we get accepted based on our seventh grade report cards. I got eighties and a few nineties last year, but for math, my grades were in the seventies. Yeah, I'm one of those kids who hates math (basically everyone). 

I have no zoned high school, so I can only apply. For anyone who doesn't know what a zoned high school is, it means you live in the area around it so you can get in no matter what. I applied to New Utretch as my top choice because they are one of the rare schools that don't ask for 90+ grades. 

I didn't do my research when I applied, so I didn't know what New Utretch was like. Just that it's close and it accepts grades like mine. (Cough cough math) 

I got my acceptance into it though, and now that I'm doing my research, I'm pretty upset. 

Turns out the other kids in my school got into it too, which isn't uncommon, but a lot of the kids that get really low grades got into it. A few really good students with great grades got into it though, so I'm genuinely confused on the school's standards. 

I checked out reviews online of the school, only the recent ones, and they were good. They said the teachers were nice, plenty of activities to choose from, etc. They didn't say anything bad about the neighborhood either. 

However, there are students with only 70s getting into this school and over a population of 3000 in the school. And there were some articles about a senior student who brought a gun into school. So this means, the higher chance of a school shooting. According to the article, he was caught and gave the gun in, but what if people in the future do bring guns, and they don't get caught?

Only problem is my coach, who's been coaching me since age 8. I haven't told him and today is my last lesson. I didn't attend the most recent one because I had a school assesment task that I had to attend so when I turn up I'll have to explain that to him, but at the end of the lesson I guess I'll have to say something. 

The problem is for the past entire year of coaching I've absolutely despised it. It's 2 hours a week and its gruelling work. I dread every Monday that I have to go and play tennis. I'm good at concealing it and he's told my parents I seem like I love the sport and I'm always well behaved. I simply don't know what to say to my coach. He is male, about 60 years of age and has older, conservative values. He gets angry reasonably easy but has never completely blown his top at me. I had a friend who as he was walking out the door said ""This is my last lesson"". My coach said ""Why?"" He simply said ""I'm too lazy"". My coach just laughed and let him go. Should I try something like that or something else?

 1. They won't give you cash back but instead deposit the money in your Amazon Pay Balance but that of mine has been suspended because of inactivity (?)

2. They would return the money in your bank account but for that, the bank account should be yours not your father's

3. Also, you can't return it because you need to pass 2FA first which I can't do because the SIM card I used for 2FA is now lost and wouldn't be back until a few weeks.

140,"It’s 2009........teenage me fell for a co-worker. She went down to Florida to visit family and it was during this time I realized I had feelings toward her. She comes back and I ask her out. She tells me “oh I don’t think it’s a good idea. We are a big family here at “insert job name””  and than the back and forth debating goes on until she winds up telling me she had a bf. We stop talking and I eventually find a new job do to hours cuts. Fast forward to 2013 and I end up coming back to the job. I found out she still works there and is now dating a co-worker who also smokes btw (which she always claimed was a deal breaker) 🧐.  Fast forward again to 2016 and I end up leaving again. She leaves and within the last 6 months her bf leaves.  We are in 2019 right? It’s nearly 10 years and I still care for her the same as I did then. I think about her a lot, I’ve had a few pretty surreal dreams and certain songs come on and I just get lost. I feel like I’m holding on (mentally) to someone that doesn’t give a shit for me at all. I feel like I have a hard time opening up to other women because I guess I’m afraid that if I do find someone she’ll just pop up in my life again.  Truth is that a part of me is upset I never got my chance to show her what I could give her and another part of me just wants to know why not just tell me about the bf from the get go? I keep going back and forth about reaching out to her via text to see if I can finally get some closure. I just figured I’d come to you strangers and see what happens. Should I even bother trying to get answers? All I want is honesty from her so that I can move on. I apologize to this length of this post but I’m trying to be as open as possible.

142,"Hey reddit, this is a long one, so hang with me.

Just for reference, I’m a yougin’ in high school, freshman year.
I am aware that puberty is a bitch.

So there is a girl I like. The problem with me asking her out is that she has been one of my best friends for 5 years now, and if I ask her out, well, it would end the friendship if she said no, and if she said yes, we would just break up a week later. I am sick to my stomach sometimes at night thinking about her. Recently, she left my school. The year before she left my school had a trip with the entire 8th grade, prior to this trip, thought 8th I had been kind of concealing my feeling from myself, not wanting to admit to myself that I liked her. Finally, about half way through 8th grade, I slowly admitted it to MYSELF, that I liked her. I don’t know how long I have internalized that, but I finally admitted to myself. Anyway, back the the field trip, we had 2 days about at this place. That’s when I began to start really liking her. As soon as my roommate went into the shower I just began bawling my eyes out, that it was her last year at the school, I just felt like I couldn’t take it. Summer begins.

Over summer I begin freaking out more, and more, and more. I have tried to force myself not to like her. I really wish I didn’t, but honestly, I would probably take a bullet for her. I have lost so much sleep because of this. I have tried to force myself to like other girls, but that hasn’t worked. As a measure of see how much I like her , ever night before I go to bed I would wiser to myself, “I love you [name inserted here]” ten times over. I didn’t admit this crush to any of my friends that would have contact with her. I went to a camp over the summer which was nice where I was able to tell everyone about her. I knew no one their would ever meet her. They encouraged me to ask her out, but then I mentioned that she was one of my best friends, that of which I don’t have many, and they all turned off the idea of me asking her out. I honestly dunno what I should do. I am kind of lost. If anyone has any advice on this or any previous experience with dating friends, feel free to say anything.
Thanks for listening.

Edit/addition:
I’ve been thinking about this since I posted it, (about 30 minutes ago) it’s weird,I’ve never really shared this anywhere.
Anyway,
Currently I am a straight dude, she (I don’t even know) is gender fluid, and Pan sexual. Imma be totally real, I don’t know what gender fluid means, I’m a dumb kid.  I’m aware what it is to be pan. Thinking about it, I’m kinda stressed because i have been out to lunch with her, and i don’t know if she considered that a date, I do that with a lot of my friends, go out into town to get lunch, I’ve been to the movies with her, but that time she invited a bunch of friends and I was the only one who showed up, our parents were in the rows behind us. I really hate myself for liking her. I really do. I just want to know how to stop liking her or anything. I can’t say how long I’ve liked her, around 6th or 7th grade, she had a boyfriend she met online, i encouraged them to break up when their relationship got bumpy, I think that was mostly because I was protective of her. On the bus back from our school trip, we sat together, not talking, as she stared out the window, and I had thoughts shooting around my mind of how to entertain her, these were our last minutes as classmates, then suddenly I thought of her as my girlfriend for a second, and I instantly hated myself and began pinching myself to tell my mind to stfu. I think what I’m really afraid of though is losing her, as our last years of middle school came to a close, I really remembered what I was missing as a friend, in 5th to 6th grade summer, and 6th into 7th, we Skyped sometimes more than once a day, now, it’s discord, and it’s sometimes less than once a week that we will call, sure. The DMs are non existent now. And I feel lost. We don’t message each other in group chats that much, but I think that hearing a voice, rather than reading text, is better. I don’t remember the last time that we had a 1 to 1 video call, it’s mostly just been group calls, and slowly after everyone files out, it might just be me and her. I have told myself to say something in these moments, but all my mind puts to action is me just saying, “got to go!” And then hanging up quickly. I dunno. I feel lost, and I am lost.

Today I went on a drive to a convention with my crush and another friend (same age, trans). I hinted at my liking her multiple times, just to fuck around with myself, kind of like inflicting self harm. I was talking about a random topic that I missed and I said, “You know, I never realized what I had until it was gone”. She didn’t catch on. On the drive back I had the same feeling that I had previously, as we were quite, and I thought how to entertain her, and I did it again, I thought of her as my girlfriend, instantly reverting to silencing myself for the rest of the two hour drive.",01Apr2019,2

&amp;#x200B;

I ruminate on the past a lot even as I try every day to be present focused. I am wondering if my hallucinations of the past are due to my psychosis.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I had a roommate who was a weed addict who threatened to beat me up at 5:30 in the morning because I told him to either turn down the volume or go in the living room and said that since I'm ""his bitch"" I will not tell on him. He was a lot stronger than me. I could tell he was going to follow through with the threat so I told him I stayed in bed for a minute like he said and then threw the covers on him and flicked him off and told him housing will not listen to him if I tell them about this. He said that housing would actually listen to him and that his right to play video games and have fun was just as important as my health needs. I argued with him and when he wasn't going to hold me down anymore, I told on him and I think one day he just disappeared from housing.

&amp;#x200B;

In another scenario, a guy who I talked to freshman year took advantage of me and stole my medication. He kept telling me he wanted to use my autism to get a weed card and that weed was good for me. I told my doctor this and my parents agreed he was trying to take advantage of me. One time he chased me around that year and continually poked me and I had to keep slapping his arms out of the way as I was running from him. I told on him too and he also got in trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

One guy who pretended to be my friend actually poked me and bothered me about giving him my belongings and I made a deal with him since he also was having me buy him stuff that I could give him ONE thing that I selected and then NEVER ASK AGAIN. I did this and he then continued to poke me all of the way through a movie I was watching that day in theaters on my birthday. We soon stopped being friends and I only saw him once after that but since then never again.

How do I kick myself out with $100 in my bank account and not go homeless? Because my life hasn't necessarily prepared me for this inevitability. I don't need to move out immediately, but I need a plan. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've never been a great student, but I've definitely blown it this semester. That, not-great mental health, and a desire to move out of my parent's house have caused me to retreat into my head and fixate on some vague big decision I must need to make. Everything feels inevitable, and my parents don't really know that anything is going on out of the ordinary. All I really do is mope around, listen to music, and find any excuse to get out of the house. I \*will\* have to confront my parents about it, and it's going to suck, but I figure I ought to have some sort of plan figured out to ease their disappointment.  

&amp;#x200B;

For what it's worth, I was studying animation, and I'm an okay artist and video editor. Nothing out of my shallow skill set feels particularly useful for my current situation. I have good friends, but I'm not really sure if I have any I could move in with at the moment.

151,"(tl;dr: This is a shitshow and I'm trying to make sense of it.)

This is a long one, so buckle up.

I spent my early twenties making poor decisions that I'm now trying to rectify in my late twenties. I took out loans and went to a for-profit school to get my degree (because I wanted to avoid math classes) that ended up being sued for promising job placements/specific income. I honestly didn't even have an interest in my major, everyone just kept telling me to ""go get the piece of paper"", so I just picked something and went with it. The school closed immediately after I graduated. I now have a degree in ""Digital Communications"" that is essentially worthless, and I honestly can't say I really even learned anything while obtaining my bachelors.

I landed what I thought was a content writer position a month later. I was living in California and I moved to Los Angeles knowing I didn't like the LA area, but I did it anyway. The job was with a ""startup"" that was really just a subsection of an umbrella corporation, and they had me do a whole month of writing before there was nothing left that needed to be written and then stuck me with a bunch of e-commerce responsibilities. The company was ""I can't believe you haven't been sued"" bad, and I watched dozens of employees come and go over two years as I sat and stared at my screen doing absolutely mindless work. I was extremely sad and self-conscious. Life was literally just going through the motions and I knew I needed a change.

This is when I decided I would move to Seattle. I loved the green and the lakes, and my sister had just moved there with her husband. The move didn't go as I had planned (told one too many people at my job about my plans and it got around to the executives who then fired me because I was ""disloyal"" for planning to leave them), but as of seven months ago I made it out here.

I thought this was the step I needed to take to change my life, but it has been anything but.

I've spent the past six months sending out resumes every single day of the week. It's literally all I do. I have yet to find a job. I tried to find writing jobs, but without any real writing work experience to show aside from product descriptions from my last job...no one is even remotely interested. I've met with every recruiting company within travel distance for me. I've applied to all kinds of management positions, as my job ended up heavily in management because I was the senior-most employee, and not any bites. I don't even want to do these jobs...I'm just trying to find income at this point, and I can 100% see myself falling into the same ""going through the motions"" life with these jobs. Last week I was made my first job offer for an extremely low-paying position, but it was immediately rescinded because there's a bunch of false info under my name when you run a non-accredited background check (my real background check comes up clean aside from two speeding tickets). I now know it was illegal for them to use a non-accredited site, but that's a whole separate issue.

I honestly don't know where to go from here. I've sent out over a thousand resumes/applications/letters of interest and no one is biting. I'm clearly not competitive enough for this environment, and the first google results of my school name resulting in lawsuit/fraud articles doesn't help either. I'm fucking miserable here. I thought I'd be making friends and meeting new people by now (especially considering the amount of work I've put in to the application process) but I'm just sitting at home all day in a house that my parents are paying to rent the room I stay in. I miss my friends so fucking much, and the fact that they all moved in to a house together in San Diego with an extra room is killing me inside to know I could be there.

At this point I feel like I need to completely restart my path and go back to school, but how? My for-profit degree is non-transferable to an actual college, and I won't be approved for student loans to get another bachelors. Even if I did have the money, I have absolutely no idea what I'd want to go back to school for. Even if I returned to California, lived with my friends, and figured out how to pay for school.....I have no clue what to study. I've taken aptitude tests, read multiple career path/self-help books, and if anything I'm more conflicted and confused than I've ever been. This is the first time in my life where the thought of not waking up in the morning fills me with a sense of relief. I feel like I'm out of options.

How do I figure out if I should move back to San Diego? How do I make sense of my life and pick the right career path for myself? I am fucking lost.

154,"I’m going to very vague because now I know they’re on reddit. I posted on a subreddit that’s meant for giving people advice, about an issue I was having in my relationship with my SO and 2 other people that my SO works with. It was very personal and I mostly needed somewhere to vent and to get advice and I never planned on sharing my feelings (or the post) with my SO for reasons that I won’t explain here. (Long story short, I got some great advice and it helped me figure some things out about myself and it didn’t ever need to be shared with my SO.) 

Someone that my SO works with apparently frequents that subreddit DAILY. This individual screenshotted EVERYTHING I posted (including every single comment) and brought it to the boss of the company which led to a meeting where all people the post was about (including my SO) were pulled into the office and made to read everything. There are a lot of details I’m leaving out but this was an incredibly awkward and humiliating experience for everyone involved (especially me!!!). 

So I need advice on how to handle this situation. This individual needlessly shared all of this personal private information with the people it was about and made things incredibly uncomfortable for everyone, and it even threatened my SOs job. This post had nothing to do with the job itself and only to do with a few people employed at said job. It was totally unnecessary for this individual to share the posts let alone BRING IT TO THE BOSS and I feel like they only did it to get an  “in” with the boss. I looked through this persons comment history after I found their account (yes I’m 110% sure it’s their account) and they are constantly giving people advice in that thread. So they understand what the community is for and that anonymity is VERY important. Regarding my post, it was extremely obvious that I never wanted my SO to read it. Me and my SO even almost broke up because of the stress this situation caused. 

I’m angry and humiliated! It’s like all of your private thoughts being read out loud for everyone to hear and you can’t stop it. I know that you shouldn’t put stuff online that you don’t want anybody to find but I even had created a throwaway account and used fake names and they still figured it out. I found some comments on this persons account that are pretty inappropriate and part of me wants to screenshot it and send it to the boss because they also frequently comment on the companies subreddit, as an employee. This is also someone I have to work with occasionally (we have different bosses) and it’s affecting my job as well.

She really cares for me and I love her, but at the same time I can’t stand her and sometimes I just wish I could live on my own. Im sure this isn’t an uncommon problem, But I’ll get into more detail.

I live with my mom in a small two room apartment. My dad works overseas and I only see him maybe 2 months a year (he’s the only one that keeps me sane). My mom’s personality is something that I’ve always disliked. She’s quick to anger, irrational in almost every situation, and lacks any sort of common sense. We argue almost everyday for the most unnecessary things and it’s gotten to the point where I am annoyed by her presence and just want pure distance. I feel really bad for feeling this way because she is my mother and I wish I could have a solid relationship with her, but it’s been this way for the longest time now. 

Like I mentioned before, we live in a tiny two-room apartment which makes it impossible to find my own space away from her. She’s always wherever I am, and I never feel comfortable at home when she’s around. She’s always talking on her phone 24/7 on speaker with the loudest voice, whilst playing music on her speakers. And she constantly invites her friends over to our house and this can go up to 6 people. Even though I have a small room, I don’t feel like locking myself in my room all day. I feel no sense of personal space and freedom at home and my mom’s personality and actions combined make me want to bang my head against a wall everyday. And i’m sure you might be wondering if I’ve talked to her about this. I have hundreds of times, literally. My mom is not the type that inputs information well, it goes in one ear and out the other. No matter how many times I try to talk to my mother, she always lashes out at me. And during the  rare occurrence where she listens, she forgets about it the next day and it’s like our conversation never happened. It is straight up impossible to get her to change.

I’ve tried to deal with this for a LONG time now, but I’m starting to give up. A solution for me would be a bigger living space like an actual house, where I can have some physical space away from my mom, but this is impossible with our current financial situation. Im really self dependent and I handle most of my things on my own (Food, money, house management etc.)  So I wish I could move out and live on my own, but I know thats not an option for me at the moment for obvious reasons (being 17). I just want to run away and live my own life. Once again, in no way am I trying to say my mother is a bad mother, or that I hate her. It’s just very difficult for me to be in the presence of my mother anymore, I want her out of my life. Any help on this matter is much appreciated!

I play a lot music and write my own songs that I feel have a good message and would love for people to hear them but I can't justify putting time into that to develop it because the chances of success and true income is so low. 

I guess I just always wanted to be a part of something bigger than myself that has the potential of helping people or even just making lives a little bit better. But as of right now I just feel like this goal Ive worked so hard towards is not the right way to achieve that.  I know there are other ways and I have a good skillset to do SOMETHING but I honestly just don't know what that something is. 

  
Its funny how on the outside everyone thinks I am well composed and am working towards something great, but on the inside I am falling apart and am questioning every second of it. 

  
I know this is kind of a shit show of a post but I had to say it somewhere. If anyone has ever been through this or has some suggestions anything would be appreciated.

163,"I don’t know what kind of advice I’m looking for, maybe if someone had the same experience and could lend some input

Things were going great with my wife and I absolutely loved her until I found inappropriate conversations with other guys which spanned from the time we were exclusively dating, to getting engaged, and after marriage. I didn’t find any evidence of her physically cheating but at this point I really don’t care. This enough is grounds for divorce, but what got me was that she completely lied even when I confronted her about the truth and didn’t admit until I kept pestering her about it (one of the convos I saw with my own eyes, explained that I did, and she still denied it almost to the point where I was close to doubting what I saw). I’m a very honest guy, and lying is another ground for divorce- I hate when people lie forget about when they’re supposed to be on your team 

This sounds like an easy decision to divorce but it’s not. We have a young child together. I’ve grown up in a very broken and physically abusive home, have lived in a women’s shelter for abused women throughout a couple years of my childhood and suffered through my parents breaking up and getting back together 4 different times as a kid (which has been used against me by the way when she told me that she wished our child didn’t grow up fucked up like me). I’m not physically abusive myself, especially given my experience, but I don’t want my child growing up like I did and it’s seriously holding me back

I’m depressed knowing that I’m living in a “sham” marriage, my “wife” is miserable because I’ve made my feelings very clear to her that I don’t give a crap about her (like I said I’m very honest) and I honestly feel stuck


I would never regret my child, ever, and I’m happy that for my past with my wife knowing that my child came from it but I feel terrible at her parent option right now - either seeing her parents together hating each other or having to live her whole childhood in 2 separate homes",01Apr2019,1

Talking about how he constantly ignored me, seemed to not care about me (and also wouldn’t let me be there for him), as well as how he talked to other girls right in front of me. I struggle with mental health (I don’t want to go into too much detail but it’s rather serious) and when I’d try talking to him about it all he said was that sucks or when I’d try to give updates on improvement he’d say “cool.” It kinda really hurt how uninterested he was. Yet he could be on the phone for hours with my best friend talking about her problems. So I reached out on three separate occasions trying to explain how I felt. I’d get cut off. He’d apologize saying he’s trying to change but he’d immediately go back to the same routine. I was tired of it. With a couple of friends giving me advice and cheering me on, I called him. I waited a bit as he ignored me (he was in the middle of playing a video game) and told him I didn’t think it was working out and atm everything kinda sucked. I recommend staying friends. He said yeah and nothing else so I hung up. Now three days later I can’t stop thinking about it. As uninterested as he was and even though there was days I felt like shit (excuse my language) because of him I missed him. We’d been friends for two years. He made me laugh and smile.

I need advice on talking to a girl. (I'm a guy)


I went on a big vacation this past week with about four different families. I ended up hanging out with this girl that's in one of the families the entire time and we seemed to get along really well. I want to spend more time with her, (kinda want her to be my gf), but I don't know if she feels the same. There are a couple of drawbacks though. I'm 16 and she's 14, we go to different schools (but we still live pretty close to each other), and our parents work together. Idk if I should ask her out or not but I think I want to because I haven't stopped thinking about her. I have also never had a girlfriend so I don't really know how this stuff goes. 


When we got home from vacation I texted her saying that I had a lot of fun hanging out with her and that we should go the the mall sometime. (This was big for me because I don't normally text girls. Not to flex but I am a lot more smooth irl.) She texted back saying that she had fun too and that we should do something. This made me almost shit my pants. 


We did get along really well but idk if she likes me as much as I like her. 


Idk if I should try to hang out with her for a while and be friends, or if I should come right out and say I like her.

173,"Throwaway for my own privacy and my relative's.

&amp;#x200B;

Today while browsing, I came across a post that clearly came from my younger cousin (keeping details sparse for privacy's sake, but I'm 100% certain it is their account). I'm from a large family that's regularly in touch with ""distant"" relatives, so we're quite familiar with everyone and messaging/chatting isn't out of the ordinary.

Out of curiosity I looked at her account (I know, snooping is bad, shame on me) and found out from a couple of posts that she became pregnant unexpectedly a few months back and had an abortion. From post history, it seems that her boyfriend was the only one that knew, and they broke up around a month later. Other comments suggested that she didn't want their families to find out.

My question is: should I do anything? Should I reach out to her with support? Leave the situation alone to preserve her privacy? Share support through an anonymous comment?

Our family is generally pretty progressive, so I doubt she'd be worried about stigma from her folks, but if she was worried about sharing with them it seems like she'd rather nobody knew about the situation. If I were in her place, I almost definitely would prefer nobody knew, but she's always been more of an extrovert and a ""sharer"" than I am. We aren't close, but I'm not sure whether that would make talking more or less appealing (if I were in that situation, I'd probably rather talk to more of a stranger). Since I'm usually quiet and unemotional, I just don't know what would be helpful for most people - hence seeking out advice here. I just am worried about her dealing with all of this on her own, and I'm wondering if it would be helpful for her to have family - with a bit of removal - to talk to.

&amp;#x200B;

Other context: We live in different parts of the country, so this would likely be solely text/calling/email. She's about a year younger than me, both in our early 20s. Our relationship isn't very close and has sometimes been strained in the past, mostly due to differences in personality. I don't know that I'd be the best person to talk to, but I want to respect her privacy and certainly won't share with anyone else who could probably relate more. I've considered commenting anonymously to offer to talk, just to provide support in some form. As of right now I'm leaning towards keeping quiet and being more supportive generally the next time I see her. Any thoughts and advice would be appreciated, and if I'm just being nosy and if reaching out is rude/ridiculous, please let me know!",01Apr2019,1

175,"I am a college student living in a house with 3 other girls. It’s a duplex so another 4 girls live below us. We moved in last summer and it’s a nice, family neighborhood in a small city. The only strange house in the neighborhood is the one right next door to my house. I always noticed the house had very bad peeling paint and overgrown plants all around the yard. I just figured no one lived there and it was abandoned.

Our houses are close together and both have pretty big windows, so we can see through each other’s windows pretty. I was relaxing on my porch soon after moving in when I was frightened seeing something moving in the window. I looked and there was a teenage girl walking around the house. I also noticed that the inside of the house had furniture stacked and scattered around.

We learned that a man owns the house and he drives a 10 foot moving truck with graffiti all over it. He often parks his truck in front of our house which annoys us because he doesn’t have a parking permit on the window of his truck, so he takes up 2 of our spaces without a permit and gets away with it. 

A few months ago the girls who live below us told us that they used to fight with him a lot (they’ve lived there several years). They told us they think he leads a human trafficking ring and that he’s yelled racist threats at them before.

Once when walking home I noticed two people walking out of the house. It was a young, white girl wearing a crop top and short shorts, and looked around the ages 18-23. I also noticed an older, African american man, in an all brown uniform, who looked around 25-30 years old. They walked out of the house and down the street, and didn’t really say anything to each other. I noticed the truck was parked at the end of the street and they met our neighbor there to talk.

I was really curious and scared, so when I caught myself staring. I went straight inside my house so they didn’t see me. I don’t really know what happened to those 2 people since.

Every now and then I notice a light on inside or see my neighbor on the street. But other than that I have no evidence of him doing anything suspicious. 

I don’t know if I am overreacting or if his behavior actually is alarming, so I don’t really know what to do. I’m nervous because the city I live in sees the most sex trafficking in the whole state.

176,"One of my best friends recently got dumped by his girlfriend of 5 years. Took me and several of our friends by surprise, as they seemed so well. I know that they might have been hiding something as couples sometimes do but still, to use they seemed okay.

He is honestly one of the nicest people I know. Goes out of his way to help people, everyone loves him, never even cusses, just a all around nice dude. I’ve never even heard him shit talk someone, outside of complaining about work.

He seemed fine for about a month after they broke up. He didn’t really want to go into detail and we all respected that. The only time you could tell he was a little upset or depressed is when he would just stare off into space sometimes. We’ve been a support group for him through it all and if you asked me yesterday, I would have said he was okay.

Then, I ran into his ex today. I asked how she was and she kinda looked around and asked if I had heard from him lately. I said yeah since we talk all the time, but he didn’t seem different.

She told me he has been calling her at night. I thought it was kinda sad at first but then she told me more about it. He calls her from different numbers.

And when she answers, he just says her name over and over again, in a mocking way. 

Then he just laughs. Like an unhinged crazy person laugh. It’s clearly him, and I know that it’s his voice.

Just listening to one of the recordings she has, it made my blood kinda cold. Just the way he sounded, the way he yells her name like he knows something she doesn’t, before just laughing his ass off is scary as hell. Not even a good laugh, just a laugh you’d hear from someone who’s about to kill you.

I told her I’d try to talk to him and she thanked me. She was genuinely distressed. 

She said she never knows when it’s him, because he changes the number and the caller ID shows someone else on her phone. People from her contacts.

I’ve looked into doing that after she talked to me and it’s pretty fucking easy. Plenty of services online that do it.

181,"All of us are 20 years old, and except for P, all of us are women. We talk through Discord only. Most of us are emotional abuse survivors. He definitely does not have a personality disorder, but he is very self centered; probably from living with his NPD father. I have severe ADHD, and I ran out of medication, so please ask if I need to clarify something. I have a quick summary just in case...

(Summary: P cannot handle criticism. He focuses on the tone too much, and he just talks about how he wants to die every time we criticize him. He brings up how none of his other friends agree with us, and how they tell him to look for new friends. None of us want to drop him. I do not think he is a lost cause, and if he was in this position with us, he would never drop us. We have a group chat to vent about him, so that probably helps.)

P is extremely defensive if you criticize him. He claims we just do it the wrong way, but he is like this regardless of how we tell him to shape up. He says, ""I do not actually plan my day around being your personal inconvenience."" ""I have no weird hidden motives."" Nobody ever suggests that; we just want him to be a better person!

If we point out something specific, he asks his other friends, who he claims befriended him before we met any of us. We met him in college, and he apparently met them in high school through some forum. All we know is that they range from their late 20s to early 60s. He says, ""None of my other friends see me that way."" He says, ""I have no idea what to do when literally everybody I talk to tells me to find new friends. They call me out, too, so I know they are not trying to coddle me or anything.""

A friend's boyfriend exaggerates about P being like the next Hitler, and whenever P messed up, the boyfriend attacks everything about him. If they were not fighting, they bonded like old friends over things like cars and traveling. P cut ties with my friend and her boyfriend eventually when they last fought. He said that when people are ""like that"" to him, it makes him want to die. The boyfriend made some very good points about P, but P just focuses on how the message was delivered. He says, ""None of my other friends would ever act like that to me. We address the problem, I apologize, and we move on."" We do not know these friends, so we have no idea if he is being accurate. He guilts us, too. He asks us why we would want to be around her boyfriend, who is a racist red piller, and who makes him want to die along with intimidating us into never disagreeing with him. He has a good point, but we cannot criticize the boyfriend without his girlfriend no longer talking to us. She has no other friends, and her family neglects her.

He says things like, ""When I criticize people, I try this method and that method."" The methods he suggests are, in our opinion, too coddling. If we bring that up, he says, ""Psychologists literally recommend them."" He suggests things like ""compliment sandwiches"" instead of just being objective about it.

If we have to vent, he does not care. He just talks about something else, or he vents about what his shitty father did that day. He does respond, but he has no emotion about it. If my dog died, the rest of us would be devastated. He would say, ""She was the goofiest thing. I am sorry for your loss."" He never reacts to anything with emotion. He just keeps his emotions, and he just tells you that is how he was raised.

My friends say, ""I feel irritated with him, too, when he acts out, but both of you are being dramatic.""

We do not want to drop him completely. We just stop talking to him for a few days, and he usually takes the hint. If you remember the episode where everybody leaves Bikini Bottom for No Spongebob Day, that is basically it.",01Apr2019,1

Last Wednesday, I found out that my mother has been dating a former classmate of mine from high school.  She she says they are talking about getting married and possibly even having a baby or two together.  

I am still numb from the news.  I had no idea.  My mom has been divorced since I was in middle school.  She never dated anyone and as far as I knew, never had interest in anybody.  The person she is dating in 22 years old and I am 21.  We went to the same school, even had a few classes together.  He graduated only one year before I did.  I wouldn’t say I was really ‘friends’ with him, but we hung out with the same group of guys, so I would say we were more acquaintances.  

My mother says they first met at a party we had at my house in January of 2015 (my junior year, his senior year). I distinctly remember the party she speaks of, but I had no idea anything happened and quite honestly, I don’t even remember him being there.  I’ll admit, we were all drinking and she was drinking too but she is not the type to go flaunting herself around when she’s drunk. 

She says he came onto her and they flirted a bit.  They exchanged phone numbers but she had assumed that would be the end of it.  A few weeks later, he texted her.  I won’t go into all the details because this will go on and on but basically, he kept pursuing her and they eventually began secretly having sex when me and my sister weren’t home.

He went off to college only 50 miles from home, so the sex continued, though not as often.  It was at this point she says they both realized they wanted to be more than fuck buddies.  She doesn’t remember exactly when the relationship became ‘official’ but she says it’s been well over two years.  

I’ve been away at university for the past 2.5 years and for the first time since high school, I’m returning home this summer.  This is why she told me about him.  He will be living with us over the summer and sleeping in the same bed with my mother.  She couldn’t hide it anymore.  I was so shocked about her announcement when she called that I don’t even think I really reacted.  She texted me today asking me if I was ok.  I told her I’d call sometime this week.  

At this point, I don’t even really want to come home for the summer.  It’s going to be the worst thing ever.  I have so many emotions.  I’m angry, I’m shocked, I’m worried, etc.  What do I do?  At some point I’m going to have to talk to the guy.  What do I say to him.  What do I say to my mom when I have the opportunity to seriously talk about it with her?

She has stated multiple times that if she were to tell her parents about our relationship, they would definitely not approve of me because they don't believe Catholics are the same as Christians. Her parents expected her to find the perfect Christian boy while she's at college, but she found a Catholic, and she's too afraid to tell her parents. My parents are unaware that I have a SO, just because I'd prefer to keep it a secret for now, but I'd be open with telling them if they asked. I want to personally talk to her father or mother and just tell them everything: how we've been dating, our religious differences, what she's had to deal with, but she's said no every time because she's frightened of the repercussions. I have told her that there are many couples with way bigger differences in religious belief (e.x: George and Amal Clooney) but still got married because their love was stronger than their differences. I'm doing my best to comfort her, and I would do anything to keep her happy through this hard time. We love each other so much, but everything would be perfect had this problem not been so persistent.

194,I’m gona get straight to the point I have turned down 2 out of my league girls on a junior and one a senior got a freshman girl. I like her and she has like the best personality ever and she’s so fun to talk to. I know the age difference isn’t that much but it is when your in highschool and it’s even more weird when she’s 15 and can’t even drive to your house. And everyone just assumes I’m talking to her to rail her because she’s the stereotypical big titty fat ass freshman how can I get over the age ,01Apr2019,1
195,"Look this is a looong story with a whole year’s worth of details. The super super short version: 

There was a girl that I like and we ended up becoming really close friends. So I decided to asked her out since it seemed she’d be ok with me asking her. Also it was obvious she already knew I liked her. But she actually got really upset over the whole situation and ended up not texting me for two months and said she wants nothing to do with me. But according to her brother and my sister, she’s not mad at me no more but I still haven’t heard anything from her.

Now from that information, you might think that she’s the one that should apologize to me for being so rude. And I agree. I really don’t think I did anything to her to where I have to apologize. Thing is, this girl is never going to apologize. This is a person who feels like she can’t do wrong. And I don’t want to act like I didn’t do anything. I did put her in an uncomfortable situation and I should’ve waited for the right time to tell her in person rather over text. But honestly that’s still nothing to apologize over. But I feel like I have to say sorry because I don’t think our friendship will ever be the same if I don’t apologize. Because in her mind, I did do her wrong even though it’s pretty obvious I didn’t do anything technically wrong. And who knows, maybe she’ll apologize to me if I say sorry first. I’m doing this for our own friendship. Not for my own personal gain or to get something out of her. Like I said I’ve heard from two people that she’s not mad at me and is actually doing a lot better. 

Any thoughts?",01Apr2019,1
196," 

I'm going to try and keep this simple and sweet. I currently attend the Air Force Academy in Colorado. I came here because 1. I want to be a senator 2. I want to be an astronaut 3. I want to change the world.

I'm in the middle of my freshman year and quite simply, I'm depressed. I have two family members in my life, an alcoholic father and a drug addicted grandmother. For years, I assisted them. I bought our family car, I paid rent sometimes, I paid off tickets for them all while balancing school, work, sports, and working on my private pilot license. Well, college came around and quite simply this was the best option because it was prestigious and free. However, I am depressed here and have been since my very first day. I've waited it out, as per the advice of many, and waited for basic training to end, waited to the end of the first semester, made it through ""recognition"" where basically freshman become human again, and I just came back from spring break. I've always felt that I can do more than be in the military, even though being in the military is a noble profession. I don't believe I'm needed in the military right now and I can do much more while enjoy my life outside. Yes, I could finish off the semester which ends in two months but honestly I think it would be more beneficial to get out into the world, experiment with different professions, and find my one true passion. On top of this, I feel as if I have an obligation to humanity to get out in the world and not continue to play a part of the ""who has the bigger dick"" in our current military influenced political sphere. I have so many passions that just don't line up with the academy and at the end of the day, I just know that I don't want to do the mandatory 12 years of the Air Force after graduation. That's too much time being restricted to one path of life.

Leaving, I would first go on a trip internationally. Reflect on the world we live in and what I think I can best help with. Then I would go back home and basically work my ass off during the summer to save a lot of money to fund my future endeavor at my state school for a semester. I would also be able to help my grandmother who is about to become homeless (tonight). She's old and can't take care of herself. All of the signs point to me staying at the academy because it's a good school, paid tuition, but it's just not what I want to do with the next 12 years of my life. I have scholarships at home which would pay for my school so I'm not really worried about that. I also have a great support circle at home with friends that would guide me through life.

Anywho, I know I hate my life here in the military and can leave right now with no consequences. I know I don't want to do the 12 years after graduation because the one thing you don't get back in life is time, and although it would be bad ass to fly jets for a living, I think I would be doing the world a disservice. I'm not quite sure of the exact path I will take leaving, but I know I have a million interests and believe that I can benefit the world by exploring it. It's not like I've just been thinking about this for the past week, it's been this entire year.",01Apr2019,2

I worked at two other places since high school, but the problem is that my boss at one place was my grandma and my mother-in-law at the other. 

My best friend was my co-worker at my first job, so maybe I can include her, but that’s only 1/3.

I don’t understand this I didn’t push for us to get together she did. I didn’t push for sex she did. This whole thing set me back and I don’t get it. Was being honest a bad move? Should I have just let things progress naturally back? Did me admitting i still love her push her away? I don’t get it I like straight honesty and i feel like I’m not getting it.

My question is what can I do to help him stay and stay straight this time? It’s his second time living with me trying to get clean the last time lasted a month before he left which confused me because I did everything I made sure he had cigarettes my house is always stocked with food and I always have power and water it’s not like the places he’s use to I had all of his old  friends know and they messaged him telling him how proud they was and once they see he’s getting a little bit better they can hang out again (we have been let down and got our hopes up too may time) he had a for sure job we was just waiting for the call but he still left he told my grandma it was boring here. This time I need insight on how to go about things I gave him money and he bought Suboxone which I don’t mind if it helps with his withdrawals I can have him visibly sick and ill in front of my child and he seems to be more motivated this time but I know that I shouldn’t get my hopes up but I know I already have all I can think about is him leaving and how much I don’t want him to and I find myself trying to entertain him so he isn’t bored because it is boring here I mean it’s me and my husband and our son and we don’t have activeness/chaos he’s use too anyways maybes that’s to mush information I’m just trying to give a little insight. So what can I do as his sister to help him and keep him and how much of the suboxone should he be taking to not feel sick because I’m dealing them out to him (he took half of one at 8Pm and he said it should last to morning) I’m lost although I was a addict I was addicted to prescription medication and I never got addicted to the lifestyle he did and the people he did I was what I would call a functional addict or a housewife addict so I don’t have no experience with heroin/meth withdrawls and how to help. ,01Apr2019,1
207,"During my stressful first-year of university one of my coping mechanisms is to play one of the sports I loved my whole life - soccer (football as my family would call it). I'm a pretty solid player and was respected by my peers at home and have always had a passion for the game. I decided to take up recreational drop-in soccer to de-stress and do what I love as a break from school.

However, the people that attend this activity are a large clique of overly competitive people that are audacious and at times impolite. I'm very introverted and don't have many friends coming from a small city and don't really relate to them (I'm often silent and don't really have anything to say to them) so I think it makes me an easy target.

I've been experiencing bullying as I've been treated differently than typical clique members.  I am scolded or yelled at if I make a mistake, while if it's thier friends they laugh it off or forgive each other. I am also purposely fouled (kicked, elbowed, hurt intentionally without trying to play the ball) and no one sees anything wrong with it unless they are a part of thier friend group. I also overheard them talking badly about me saying I was horrible and wondering why I even play the sport.

This also has actually made me play worse as I am playing in an environment where I'm scared and nervous, making it unenjoyable in its entirety. I have issues with depression and self-image so It's pretty upsetting one of the things I loved and used as a coping method has become destructive. After this dissapointment I've decided to take up running as nobody can harass me there; however I do want to play soccer but just not in a negative environment where I'm not respected and worsen my performance and mental health.

212,"Buckle up, this is quite the read. 


So i’ve been in college for almost 2 semesters now, and have been living with the same 2 roomates. We’ll call them “J” and “C”, respectively. I’ve almost never had any issues them throughout my college career. In fact, we hang out on the daily. I’ve known C since highschool, and me and him get along pretty well. (We’re both asians, so we got that in common i guess). And i’ve met J in college, and he’s one of the coolest people i’ve ever met. Although, he can be annoying since he will literally hit on any girl that walks by him. But it’s a good, funny kind of annoying. He would flirt with some of me and C’s mutual friends, and although it was definetley awkward at first, we gotten used to it and he joined our growing friend group. And man, college was getting fun.

But just recently me and J had our first “roomate disagreement”? I guess that’s what you would call it. See, it’s the day before April fools day, so you know im going to try to prank him. Funny enough, he’s got the same idea. But his idea of a prank vastly differs from mine. See, he thought it would be funny if he went ahead and had a whole buffet worth of food on my bed, and try to eat it all. (If it sounds weird, that’s because it was). Now, since the beginning of the first semester, I have been adament about anyone touching my bed. There’s no particular reason for it, I mean, it’s not like im a clean freak or anything. My side of the room is a mess. but still, I didn’t want anyone touching my bed. And especially no food either, since we were dealing with an ant problem at the time. But knowing J, this is something he would do. Plus he sent pictures of him eating food on my bed, which had actually turned out to be fake, which i still believed at the time. Along with that, he also sent texts saying that “I’m about to break something that’s very expensive”. Seeing as how he was seemingly already on my bed, coupled with the fact that I left my ipad, sunglasses, and infinity gauntlet on my desk top, (please don’t ask why i have an infiity gauntlet), I belived him. I was getting concerned. That concern turned into worry.

Panicking, I told him that he had better be joking. He just went along with it, only adding to my frustration. I must’ve texted him a hundred times, trying to give him as many chances to tell me that he was only joking. This is when I started getting angry, and I have a short temper, admittingly. Finally, I rushed back to my dorm from main campus just to be sure that none of my belongings were touched. While on my way I was repeatedly texting him that if sny of my stuff was touched or broken, All of his soccer balls would go straight out of the window. ( he is a soccer player). Finally, When I walked in, all he did was smirk and laugh at me. To me, that was a face saying “you’re too late”. I started yelling, saying “what the you fucking do” and “did you touch my shit”. All he said was april fools. To me, that was him admitting yes, but to him, he was actually saying “no, i did not, april fools”. At that point, I was so angry that i kicked over his basket full of soccer balls and stormed out of the room. I said “ I told you I was not playing” as i did during our text conversation. Slamming the door, I returned to where I was with my friends, explaining to them about the whole situation. After some time cooling off, I realized that I had overreacted, and that when I got back I would promptly apologize. When me and C returned to the room, J was waiting for me, and all of the soccer balls were still on the floor. He immediately started argueing, to which i had begun too. (poor C, now that i think about it he was the third wheel to this whole fiasco). He was obviously angry about the soccer balls, and I was angry that he threatened to do anything to my belongings. When he had asked why i would get angry over a seemingly small thing, I finally broke into tears, explaining that all of my belongings were not my own, that before my mom divorced my dad, he had given me many of the things that I had kept in my room. And when J had threatened to do anything to those belongings, I had lost my mind since those would be the last things that I would have had before my parent’s divorce. (So dramatic, I know).When J heard me explain that, we finally stopped argueing. 

We both acknowledged our faults in the situation, him saying that he shouldnt have joked about that and me overreacting and causing the mess. we even hugged it out, and I agreed to clean up the mess. 

After that I thought we would be good, just like always. I thought we would go back to being our old goofy selves, talking smack to eachother and making jokes. But after the situation died down, he said this;

“ I think im going to chill from now on.”

“What do you mean?” I said.

“ I think that it’s best that i probably just keep to myself and stop hanging out with y’all.”

There was this moment of silence that hit the room. I didn’t know what to say.
then, he said,

“ Look, we’re cool now, but i don’t mean just with you, i mean everyone. I dont fit in with y’all anyways” (J referring to our friend group)

“ Listen, i get if you don’t want to hang with me anymore. But I shouldn’t be the reason that you stop hanging out with everyone else.”

Looking back, J was in a weird state within our friendgroup. He would occasionally hang out with us, but he was always sort of a loose end. He would leave in the middle of movies leaving the rest of us behind, and i never had a second thought about it. We came to see one of his soccer games, and it was fun. He never joined our groupchat, and i found that to be weird. and sometimes he would outright annoy us with his constant “guess what, chicken butt jokes”. But I’ve always considered him within the friend group. But I guess he never seen it that way. 
J was the kind of person that loves and needs the spotlight in a conversation. If he doesn’t control or initiate the conversation, he would always be on his phone, rarely contributing. Unless he was the center of the situation, he wasn’t apart of the situation. I don’t think that he ever considered himself apart of us, which i never thought about. 

Now, here comes the part where I ask you guys for advice. (this is my first time on reddit btw). I love J, hes one of my closest friends. But after our fight, things just aren’t the same anymore. And seeing as how we’ve already registered to room with eachother again next year, Is there anything I can do to fix the situation? I hate the way we left the situation. But I don’t know what to do or say.

213,"TL:DR is the title pretty much.

Alright, story time. My best friend's father left her family when she was relatively young. He was a drunken, abusive piece of shit though, so good riddance. She currently lives with her mother and sister. We're both Juniors in High School at this point. 

Well, her mother tried to get back into dating. The mom isn't the type to sit alone. She's gotta have someone. And she found a man, I guess. Her new boyfriend constantly yells at my friend's mother and puts her down. Well, about a week ago, my friend (just referred to as M from here on out) stood up for her mother, calling him out for always verbally abusing her. 

He didn't like that. They got in a shouting match, her mother got involved, M eventually just left the house with her sister while they yelled at each other. 

Her mother and the guy's relationship has been patchy, to say the least, since then. They've been arguing a lot. And my friend's mother is blaming it all on M. She thinks it's M's fault that they have issues.

Just today, her mother came in her room and screamed at her. A lot. Blaming her for everything, insulting her. It's awful. I've just been talking with her since then but she hasn't stopped crying.

What the fuck do I do? This is really out of character for her mother as well, please don't jump on the ""abusive household she needs to call child services and ditch her entire family"" train that reddit loves to use. That's not good advice. Right now I'm just trying my best to be there for her, but when she goes to another High School and lives kinda far, it's tough. ",01Apr2019,1

Ahh. Okay, even just sitting down to write this kind of makes me anxious, so I'll try to stick with some facts/statements about myself and what I'm looking for as I usually have so many thoughts in my head that I tend to just get long-winded because I want to make sure I get my point across and set people up for success when responding to me/I don't want people to judge me or misinterpret what I'm saying. &lt;&lt; Case in point \[insert eye roll\]

&amp;#x200B;

1. Still new to Reddit (as a regular) so I'm trying to cover all my bases as I'm a terrible millennial when it comes to keeping up with current trends/phrases/apps/etc. 
2. See above as reference to mild (self diagnosed) anxiety and fear of judgment, short history of self harm (approximately 3 years, starting when I was 16), and before that a history of sexual abuse in my childhood -- which is something I've put away for a long time but need to unbox and actually figure out &lt;&lt;&lt; writing/thinking about that freaks me the F out
   1. I've been working on building new healthy habits, and I've quit smoking, started exercising, eating healthy, started journaling sporadically etc. since January (NOT New Year resolution related, thank you very much)
3. I've been married for a few years and marriage is NOT easy
4. I'm good at getting emotional, but that doesn't always translate to actually sharing what I'm feeling deep inside. And that, I think, is a huge part of the problem. I get emotional and I THINK I've expressed myself, gotten it off my chest, etc. 

.

So I'm basically here and want to participate in some of the other subs (cause there are some awesome and helpful ones), so I can finally share some things I need to get out. I sometimes struggle to figure out what I'm actually feeling, whether or not it's valid or worth sharing (really with anyone, but my family and friend IRL), and how exactly to get my point across. A lot of times I  wonder if I'm just overreacting or overthinking when it comes to conversation, so then I question what my true feelings are, and whether they're worth explaining (will the other person understand?)

 Then, I struggle with the comparison game -- this is so hard for me (and others cause human nature) to avoid, because we constantly compare ourselves and we hear other people's thoughts and stories and think our problems are insignificant. I think I've gotten into a bad habit of brushing things off/not thinking about certain things (usually small I think) that hurt, to the point where I might trick myself into thinking that I'm fine. That my history and experiences aren't really that big of a deal, other people go through WAY worse, and I just need to put a smile on and forget about the bad stuff. I DO have a lot of good in my life and I am a healthy, financially stable-ish, somewhat happy person with a decent support system. But I do get depressed and anxious, and I stuff things, and I think I need to address some of my history, and my issues with my relationships, and figure out where I'm going with my life, and who I want in it. And that's hard so guess what, I like to avoid it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, to end, I guess I'm looking for advice on how to effectively evaluate my own feelings and desires, how to initiate that with friends and family so I can ask for help when I'm anxious and feeling depressed. Again, I'd still like to look for a therapist to help me work through some of the more difficult tasks (the sexual abuse/issues and sharing/working through my emotions), but I also think posting on here more will be a great outlet, even if no one responds. So I also want to work on how to put my feelings down on paper (post), so advice on how to actually put my thoughts together and open up on here would also be welcome. Also, don't let this post fool you - it took me forever to write/rewrite/reread and it's only organized because I have analytical influences.

216,"Hey guys this is my first time posting anything like this about my personal issues on reddit, so bear with me if I ramble on about things. This'll be long but I kinda feel like I'm out of options for my life and it's getting real hard to wake up every day so I want to lay it all out there. Anyways, I am a 19 year old kid who has been pretty well off for most of my life.

However, for as long as I can remember I have had pretty rough anxiety problems most likely stemming from emotional abuse throughout middle school and not being sure if my parents were ever in love with each other. They would constantly fight and my father would berate me over any small mistake I would make. This eventually led to physical punishments for these mistakes that I sometimes have recurring nightmares about. This also has turned me into somewhat of a compulsive liar as I had to lie to get out of being hit or cut off from my few friends for months at a time. I waited to seek professional help for these problems for a long time as I always brushed panic attacks and general anxiety off as nerves. During the latter half of high school I was finally officially diagnosed with general anxiety disorder after finding nothing wrong with my heart after 10+ tests. I then bounced from therapist to therapist as my parents would insist on coming to therapy with me and sit in on every session.

Much to my dismay my parents placed me in private schooling from middle school all the way through high school. I would constantly mention how difficult it was to keep up and how inferior I felt to my peers but it always fell on deaf ears. I believe I resent my parents quite a lot for how they treated me growing up and I shouldn't, but it's incredibly hard not to at least blame them in part for my problems today.

All that being said, I still love my parents and they have done a lot for me over the years. Also, most of the problems I have today I can acknowledge as my own fault. But fast forward to my senior year of high school and I am applying to universities as I fully believe you need a degree to be successful. I got into only 1 of the 8 or so I applied to with my poor GPA and decent ACT scores, but I was over the moon. I finally started to make real friends and even started to date a girl I liked a lot. During this time I was the happiest I recall ever being. The time then came to leave for university and I was still dating said girl. So it's now a couple months into university and I haven't made any real connections and said girl breaks up with me in kind of a harsh fashion, saying some things that still replay in my head a lot, and digging at my insecurities. After this, going to class and finding the motivation to do anything besides work out here and there was incredibly difficult. My grades proceeded to suffer as I couldn't be asked to do anything besides cry and I sat alone in my room most of every single day as my roommate got kicked out first semester. I then broke my ankle riding my bike to class one day so I was completely isolated and I couldn't even do the one thing that made me happy at the time. So I started self medicating with weed, so much so that I would be high most of the day every day. During this time I felt so incredibly low and hopeless that I regret to say I attempted to end my own life. Clearly I couldn't stay in an environment like that so I decided to transfer back to a community college back home and live with my parents again.

Since then I have been seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist who has me on a combo of medications, but they don't seem to be doing much. Community college hasn't been going much better as I currently have mostly D's and living with my parents hasn't changed much since my childhood. That being said, the physical threats have stopped since I have been boxing and adding muscle to my body. However I can tell my parents aren't proud of me at all, and that's been really hard to get over. I feel incredibly guilty for being in my financial position and squandering it because I'm not smart enough. All I want is to be able to go to a 4 year university and have a college experience. To be able to get away from my parents. These things have caused me to feel more motivated to work hard in school than ever before. But it feels like I have messed my chances of that happening all up before my life has even began. Will I ever be able to live the life I want? Do I have any options going forward at the moment? Fortunately money isn't a problem concerning most schools I could go to. I feel like the only track to happiness for me is at university, but I probably can't get there :( I guess I'm not 100% sure what I'm asking but thank you if you read this far.

TL;DR: I have had depression and anxiety for most of my life, and it feels like no matter what I do or try I end up worse, not better. I want to do one more final leap of faith for school and hopefully potentially apply to a university asap to get away from my not so good home life. However, my current grades are awful and my high school grades are only just barely better. What is the fastest way towards me moving out of my house and starting my life?",01Apr2019,1
217,"Hi there. First time reaching out to Reddit because my brother recommended it to me. Two years after college, I started feeling that I stagnated personally and it was a really rough time for me tbh. I didn’t know it was that difficult making friends outside of college and within the two years, I barely had any social interactions, other than coworkers at work. At first, I didn’t know the social impact of not really hanging out with people and having daily conversations. At first, I was like “oh, I guess I should start appreciating the quite life,” but I guess it affected me as a person. 

Recently, I went through a really rough heartbreak with my closest friend and I didn’t know what to do. I never felt this alone and it was so difficult to not talk to anyone about it (since he was the one I usually talk to when things got rough). Eventually, I ended up talking to my brother and cousin a few weeks ago and came out to them because I couldn’t handle the stress. They were really supported about it, but I don’t know, things kinda got worse after that. My mom got an inkling about me being gay, but she wasn’t like 100% (I haven’t told her yet). I told her I got into a bad fight with my friend and she’s like “uhhh, why are you so upset about your friend?” She asked if I liked my friend and I didn’t respond. After that, every time I called her, she would always throw in “hey, try to find a girlfriend” or “you know, just try to be normal” and I would be really upset about it and end the call. It’s difficult for me to be reminded every day and honestly, I’m also not really comfortable with myself and I haven’t really accepted myself. Like people tell me “oh, you’re a really compassionate and nice person,” but it’s weird because I always thought good things happen to good people idk... I guess the other thing due to my lack of social interactions, I kinda forgot how to communicate with people so it’s been rough trying to talk to people because I kinda come off the wrong way. It’s been super stressful, but I’m trying to find ways to practice mindfulness, meet new people and making friends, and improve mental wellness and communication skills. I felt like I found out so much about myself within the last month, but I kinda need some direction on how to overcome this hurdle. I know everyone’s journey is different, but it’s hard not being able to have that social support. It feels like I don’t really have a foundation anymore and I’m really questioning everything about myself.",01Apr2019,1

219,"This past weekend, I was visiting my girlfriend at her college. We had a good weekend, other than one incident. She is in a sorority, and in passing she had mentioned that one of her sorority sisters (a white girl) was exclusively into black guys. I didn’t care at the time, but the next day she wanted us to eat lunch with this sister. I staunchly refused, just saying I didn’t like her, but not saying the real reason, which is her sexual preferences. My personal opinion is that if a girl of any race decides to romantically involve herself with guys of another race, the guys of her race are fools to even show her courtesy. This applies across the board, especially to Asian women, who are notoriously hateful towards men of their own race, but for me this also applies to white women who decide that they hate their own. What do you think? (Saying that racism is inherently bad/it shouldn’t matter/“fuck you insecure white people” isn’t an argument). ",01Apr2019,0
220,"I have two friends who were a couple until yesterday. Let's call them A and B. I met B first, but ended up being closer to A.

They've been having relationship problems for a while. I always thought they could work it out, specially after one specific incident (B found out A downloaded a hookup app, they talked about it and everything turned out okay). However, A seemed more distraught than usual in the last couple weeks and started isolating himself.

Due to A's isolation and my crappy routine, we didn't talk properly for some time. I decided to message him yesterday, but it didn't go as I expected: apparently A feels like I'm the one who isolated myself and he's upset about my neutral position regarding his relationship with B ( I'm deathly afraid of ruining couples, therefore I avoid interfering when possible). 

I felt hurt when A said this to me and ended up being harsh – one of the things I answered was that it was obvious that he already decided what to do about the relationship, he just didn't have the courage to go through it. A few hours later, A sent me the following message: ""B and I broke up"".

To be honest, I truly believe my observation was correct – I just don't think it was appropriate. Now I'm worried that I'm the one who pushed this relationship to the end. So, I really need some honesty: did I contribute to the break up? Should I apologize to A? Or am I being over-dramatic? (I've been going through a hard time, which sometimes makes it hard to regulate my emotions).

I can't talk about it with other people and appreciate the existence of this space. Thank you.",01Apr2019,1

222,"2 weeks ago, the clubs that we are in at school went to the Bahamas for a senior trip during spring break. During that trip I fell for a girl I had a crush on in 6th grade, but my obsession for another girl had made me forget about her throughout all these years. Just seeing her laugh during the trip and on the plane ride home made me feel so emotional because she looked so happy. 

My goal is to ask her out on a date before we graduate. And if things go well, I might even ask her out to prom. The only issue is that we’ve never had a 1 on 1 conversation before. As a matter of fact, we aren’t even friends, only slightly acquainted. I don’t fear rejection, I’m just concerned whether or not she will think I’m weird if I ask her out on a date out fo the blue. That’s the only thing keeping myself from asking her. We only have about 2 months before we graduate and I know I’m the only one responsible for allowing the days to pass by.

223," Hey guys. So I’m 19, female, &amp; 5’10. For the past 9 months or so, I’ve suffered from extreme weight changes. Considering that my weight can fluctuate from 120-170 pounds within a matter of weeks, I’m assuming that most of this weight is due to water retention. I eat healthy, count my calories, and workout a couple times a week...but the water weight is only getting worse. In fact, ever since the beginning of March, I’ve only been in the 150-170 range which is quite alarming since those are quite extreme numbers for me. The worst part is that now it actually appears that I’ve gained 15-20 legitimate pounds aesthetically speaking. 

According to my doctors, I’m extremely healthy but the last major region that I need to get checked specifically is my thyroid. However, there are no thyroid issues whatsoever in my family and I just had a blood test three months ago &amp; nothing came up. Along with the weight changes, my symptoms include frequent &amp; heavier periods, extreme fatigue, paralyzing depression, tingly numb feet, and sensitivity to temperature (I’m either freezing or sweating up a storm). I don’t know what to do because it feels like I have no control over my body.

226,"I’m sorry if this is all thrown all over the place, but I’m just going to say what’s on my mind. 

So I struggle with anxiety. Main anxiety that is giving me issues recently ( the older I get the harder it is ) is social anxiety. It’s really hard for me to be apart of certain situations. I do not like greeting people what’s so ever. I can sometimes ask for things, but in certain situations it’s difficult. 

For example ; I’ve been with my bf for 2.5 years. I’ve been around his family for the same amount of time. I’m pretty comfortable with them - i would say, but when it comes to having to ask them for things I get really shy and nervous. ( I start crying ) 

I also feel like people are always judging me. I know the world doesn’t revolve around me, but sometimes if I see people whispering right after I do something or just directly looking at me then whispering it literally makes think of every move I made within the last like 5 minutes. 

I would say if I feel like a person is shy around me I adapt a different persona &amp; I come across as more outgoing and happy not worried about a thing, but in reality my mind is having 5 different conversations worrying about so many things. 

I thought that I was able to control my anxiety in some sense, but I feel like I’m losing the battle socially. I don’t know what to do, and I know I don’t wana take medicine — I just wanna be worry free.

We have a friend we put up with who Pete eventually cut off because this friend kept insulting him, so he does have good points. (We put up with that friend because he is dating our other friend.

I was born and raised in Bangladesh, and moved to Canada when I was seven. We moved for the hopes of a better life, back In Bangladesh we were a decently rich family but that all changed. 

More background, my mom had a brain tumour three years ago and it was said she wasn’t going to make it, thankfully after lots of time and medical bills she survived but is not able to work as she has no feeling in one side of her body.

My dad and mom were an arranged marriage and hate eachother, I love my mom and my sister but my dad oh boy. He is the worst human I have ever met. He abuses me and my sister, doesn’t allow us to go anywhere, yells at us for no reason and abuses my disabled mother, he’s the proud owner of three failed companies and just lost his drivers licence because of his multiple consecutive tickets.

232,"Right now I'm a Junior in High school. If I could name one thing that is on my mind 24/7, it'd have to be music. Music history, music theory, playing my violin and guitar, challenging myself to learn pieces that I would've deemed impossible. I spend my free time transposing for different instruments, transposing by ear from my favorite pieces of music, whether it be Jazz, Classical, Rock, etc. I push myself to learn the circle of fifths, mastering each scale, every diatonic triad for each key, mastering different arpeggiations for those scales and etc. I try to pick up whatever book I can get my hands on relating to music composition, history, etc. To keep it simple, if there was one thing I want to pursue in my life, it is music. Whether it be music composition, performance, research, it could be labelled as a near fanatic love for music. However my parents have always looked down upon this interest and often will chastise me for shirking a practical future if I keep up this interest for music. While I do understand their concerns of my financial security in the future, whether I'll even have a job, and etc,  I'd wish they'd understand that I care for this deeply and I am willing to make sacrifices to make it possible. My parents instead want me to pursue a career in software engineering or some other job in that field. I don't particularly hate software, in fact I have a interest in that as well, it's just not what I really want in life. There's no musicians in the family, just lawyers, doctors, engineers and such and such, so there's no mutual feeling of the love I have for music. whenever I try to explain about what I've read recently, they always steer the conversation to how I'm preparing for college and my scholarships and my standardized tests (ACT and the SAT). I don't resent them for being involved in my future, and I do have a pretty good handle on that, it's just I want to shift my career path to something I want and not something someone told me to do.

244,"To make a long story short, my (~70 year old) father decided that he loves the way ozone smells after a thunder storm.  He went and bought an ozone generating machine for himself.

I'm extremely sensitive to ozone myself, and it makes me feel sickly enough to vomit in pretty low quantities.  He's running this thing at levels that are (in my estimation) absolutely unsafe for humans to be breathing, in the same room as him.

One thing about my father is that he is a terribly stubborn person.  Once he makes up his mind about something, nothing will change it.  I was surprised that I actually got him to read an article on the [EPA's website](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/ozone-generators-are-sold-air-cleaners) about the dangers of these things several months ago, and he stopped using it for a while.

Recently he's begun using it again, on a high setting, in his bedroom.  His bedroom isn't terribly large, and he sleeps with his door closed and with his two pets (two small dogs) with him.

I'm at my wit's end.  I believe that it's making him sick, but he's using it as if it were something that could *cure* his current sickness.  I'm worried he'll actually die from breathing such high concentrations of pure ozone, but at the same time, what in the world can I say to him that would make him care?

If my entire life being his offspring is enough of an example for it, anything I say to him about this will simply set his ""fuck you, I do what I want"" switch off, and he'll double down.

We are looking to sell out the majority of the venue but people today, especially kids around my age, don't seem to care as much about local music as people used to. I REALLY REALLY don't want to play to a half empty venue. We are willing to spend whatever money necessary to promote this. Since the show is in June I am fully prepared to market this non-stop. The thing is, I am a little lost on how to do so. That is where I need your help. What would draw you to make you want to go to a rock show for a  non ""world famous band"". Is there any specific wording I should use or imagery on posters and other promotions? Also how much would you be willing to pay for an event like this? I really don't care who is in the audience as long as we can share our music. Everything helps, no matter how small. Thanks everyone and ROCK ON 🤘",01Apr2019,1

256,"I am a junior in high school and found out the Junior/Senior prom is coming up for my school.

My friends were planning on going..

I didn’t really plan on going but than I started to talk to this girl again that I knew already way back in middle school. 

Me and this girl were very close back in the day. We hung out all the time and like we did a ton of stuff together. We would sometimes take it up a notch but it was rare. We would talk all the time and it was just like the perfect friendship But as you know, most of these friendships tend to literally disappear when you get to high school and it did. 

When I started talking to her again and we started to get caught up. She told me she broke up with her boyfriend and she didn’t have anyone to go with to prom. She also asked me if I was going to prom to which I replied no. Later when we texted we both said we like missed each other and all that. Just an overall nice conversation 

As we kept talking and talking again. The thought of me asking her to prom kept crossing my mind. She’s really cute, I said why not and I thought to myself it would be the perfect opportunity. Like we would have a good time and be in a good group. I didn’t want to rush things though and so I decided I would talk to her a little bit more and than ask later. 

After a few days of talking, I wanted to let her friend (who I know very well) know about  me asking her to prom and what I wanted to do and what was on my mind about the whole thing. Just to like let someone close to me and her know....

I talk to her (the friend) about it and than she tells me that the girl got back together with her boyfriend. 

Immediately after she said that, I instantly felt shamed and depressed. Everything that was on my mind about prom and all that just gone.

I became sad.... I knew that I was the one kid not going and that knowing how great the night would’ve been made me even sadder because I knew it was all make believe now. I do not know what to do now, I do I move on from this?",01Apr2019,1

263,"So this has a lot of small parts in it but I’ll try to be as concise as possible. So at the start of the relationship we had every day together pretty much, and there’s no other problem in the relationship we get along perfectly fine and are happy every time we’re together. But a lot of things happened to change that. So one, she developed a lot of depression that made her hard to be around so I went from maybe 5 days a week with her to 3. Plus every time we have sex (that she’s asks me to have) she then gets mad at me after because she gets scared that she’s pregnant (we use birth control, protection, and pull out). Then (we’re juniors in High School) my dog “bit” her and her mom freaked out and said she can’t ever be at my house again. So our availability to see her was cut in half because now we can only see each other when I can go to her house. Then my friend Q was abused by his uncle (he has no parents) and forced out of home so I took him in so I got less time with her. Then I got hired like 3 days ago because I have a lot of liabilities like car insurance and a fat ass traffic ticket I need to get taken care of. So now we literally only get time in school to hang out. She ignored me in our English class and when I asked her what was wrong exploded on me saying we don’t get any time and she feels like I’m not even important to her. I love her and wish we could have all the time in the world (I told her this). I don’t think we’ll even be able to see each other outside of school for probably a week and a half. I don’t know if I should still keep trying to keep her happy or just let her go free to be with someone who can be there for her. This dilemma is keeping me up at night.

272,"I recently had an antibiotic resistant highly contagious illness. After approximately 7 weeks, my blood work showed that the bacterial infection was gone. According to our policy, we have 10 days of annual sick leave and 10 days of annual vacation days. In case of major illness, the employer can grant an extension of sick leave after the employee has used all of the sick and vacation days. I first started my employment as part time (20 hours/week), but was working 30-40 hours/week. I was told to ‘bank’ these extra hours for later use. After working there for several months, my employer saw how much I was working and changed me to full time (30 hours/week was agreed upon). I have an autoimmune disorder (which my employer was aware of) and was concerned that I may not be able to continue working the 40 hours/week that I had been working and didn’t want to obligate myself to more than 30. Over the next 8-9 months, I would still work extra hours and I would bank those hours. I loved my job and wasn’t a stickler about writing these extra hours down. For example, if I worked 15 minutes over, I wasn’t worried about documenting it, but I would when it was 5-10 extra hours. I know I shorted myself, but I wasn’t really concerned about it. 
When I got sick, I had no what I was about to be in for in terms of the length of time I would be off. During this time, I was running a fever of 100-104 degrees. There were a few times that I’d feel a little better and I’d go into the office to check on things and see if there was anything I needed to do. My employer had a new baby and was furious that I had come in and potentially exposed her so I assured her that I wouldn’t come back in until my fever was completely gone. My work was divided up with other employees and she said that everything was being handled. We didn’t talk on a daily basis, but I would text her after doctor appointments to let her know what was going on. After about 4 weeks, I asked her if she wanted me to take a leave of absence because I knew that I’d used my sick, vacation, and some of my banked hours. She told me not to worry about it and that we’d talk about it when I returned to work. I continued to go to the doctor and was prescribed more antibiotics meanwhile I still continued to have a high fever. After multiple rounds of antibiotics, my blood work finally showed that the infection was gone, but I still exhibited symptoms and a lower grade fever (around 100) for another week or so. During this time, I lost 20 pounds because I had no appetite and was unable to eat more than a few bites a day (just enough to avoid taking my antibiotics on an empty stomach). I was extremely weak from being in the bed for 6-7 weeks. I took probiotics for the duration of my illness to try to avoid having stomach issues. After I’d had a couple of days without running fever, I went into the office and tried to work a few hours. I was weaker than I realized though. I started trying to eat so I could regain my strength, but that caused me to have severe stomach cramping that would last for hours. Again, I let her know what was going on. 
Last week, I was finally able to go back to work. Friday was payday and she told me that if I had any hours, I could turn them in. I was somewhat taken aback and asked her if she wanted me to use my banked hours. She asked how many I had so I went to get my timesheets and they were gone. Completely gone. A year’s worth of documentation of banked hours were gone. Since I’d been gone, she and another employer had gone all through my desk which wasn’t a big deal because I didn’t have anything to hide and I know she had to get things I was working on from it. I’m very particular about my desk though and knew exactly where my timesheets were. 
I was paid for the 4 weeks of sick and vacation days, but that’s it. I lost a month’s pay because my timesheets have disappeared. She has found documents that were with them, but claims not to have seen my timesheets. I don’t believe that she is lying, but I do believe that another employee may have gotten them. I’m just at a loss and have no idea what to do. 

TL:DR I was paid for sick and vacation time but not my banked hours. No proof of those hours because they have disappeared from my office. ",01Apr2019,1

We've been together for over 2 years now and I\[19M\] completely trust her.

On this project, my gf met a lot of new people, and then there was one portugese guy\[19M\].

Since they were in Belgium, they went out to get a beer or something to drink quite often at nights with their friends.

My gf was talking about snapchat with her friends when this portugese guy went and asked for her snapchat.

She gave him her snapchat and they started snapping. They did this for about 4 or 5 days before she told me about the guy.

When she told me, he had already become her #1 friend, and since I snap a lot to her, they had to snap a lot more than she did with me

When I asked her, she told me that the guy only replied to her snaps with pictures that were empty. They also played a game in snapchat, football or something, thats why he is her #1 snapchatter

I didn't believe her, and I think they talked a lot more than ""empty snap replies"", especially because she was out for drinks quite often.

I was also suspicious because he had asked for my girlfriends instagram, which she gave him. But she accepted his follow request on the last day, when the guy left. (I think she did so he couldn't see our pictures we have together on instagram)

I told her I'm not pleased with this, and I want her to remove him from snapchat. That's because I think if the situation was the other way around, she would ask for the same thing and be furious

She told me that he's just a friend and she doesn't snap privately with him, that she only snaps to him when she sends a snap to everyone, and that she is not obligated to remove him.

And

281,"My gf of almost 3 years broke up with me recently. (3 weeks ago) . And I can't help but be mad at how relationships can be . There's bad ones  and then there's  some like this one that I can't wrap my head around . She had just turned 21 when I first met her and I was 23 . Although there wasn't much of an age difference , I had been through so much and felt like I was much older . Nonetheless she was very mature and is the most authentic,  driven , and caring person I've ever met . 

Anyway,  4 1/2 years ago I was getting out of the most toxic relationship I had ever been in . And For one year after the break up I avoided girls COMPLETELY ( Except friends of course ) . That whole year i mostly spent doing alot of self reflection . Mostly about what went wrong and what I can learn from it . So one random day I meet this girl and to be honest  my first impression of her was nothing really special . We had mutual friends and we all started hanging out more often . She was very serious but also had a  really dorky side to her . Which I liked . I was on my toes one second,  thinking "" is she mad or upset about something "" and then I was laughing with her the next . I found her very interesting and caught myself thinking about her more than I wanted to . The more I talked to her  the more drawned I became and I began to  realize that I REALLY liked this girl . I felt I had nothing to lose so I decided to tell her how I felt . Her response was dry so I felt pretty dumb . But we continued to hang out anyway . She said she didn't want a relationship but often we held hands and hugged and eventually had our first kiss . 😬 Then finally one day , mid conversation she cuts me off and asks me to be her boyfriend . ( Yes she asked me lol ) she confessed that she liked me since she met me but was scared to because she'd been hurt in the past . For that reason it was difficult at first dealing with her trust issues but I completely understood her situation and I was crazy about her!  😩 in a good way tho lol nothing was gonna gonna scare me away and I appreciated EVERYTHING about  her ! Also after all the stuff I learned from previous relationships , I was ready to commit 100 percent ! Mentally , emotionally, and physically! 
It took a few months  but it was worth it . I finally gained her trust 🙏 . Other than everyday life struggles and arguments here and there things were great . It felt so good finding someone who matched your effort and then some . I became very attached to her and had never cared about someone so much ! Then after almost 3 years of being together she leaves me. 💔😔 just like that she was gone !  I was and still am very devastated . It went from talking every day , to not even being able to ask  how her day is .  At times I feel sick to the point  where I can't even eat . After a few days of not talking she finally was ready to talk about what happened . She said over time certain things started making her feel distant which led to her being unhappy . Although she had mentioned what those things were in the past , I tried SO HARD to fix them and then  I realized how oblivious  people can be starting with me  . That being said,  Now I see that  I  couldn't do anything about it because I was blind to the problem to begin with  which made it impossible to find a solution !  .   It wasn't until the grieving after the break up that I was able to understand  from a different perspective . I'm not sure if it's because I was trying to think ""logical"" when presented with a problem before, compared to now where its pure emotion . There was things that I thought I was doing right and  then there's Things I couldn't possibly be aware of due to my up bringing . as a kid and being a boy in my family certain things weren't instilled . For example : how to be affectionate . Every time she was upset about something or just feeling down id respond with something so basic like "" I know how you feel , things will get better "" .😑 Looking back I'm just angry at myself and   I swear on anything it's not that I didn't care or anything like that . But that's what I always heard growing up so I didn't see a problem with it  .  Then there was other problems like her falling Behind in school because of me . She ALWAYS wanted to be with me which I was ok with until I realized it was my fault she was falling behind in school . I felt so guilty that whenever she had to do homework or study I told her it would be best to do it at home or school .  She took it as me pushing her away or me wanting to avoid her . Although it sounds childish it's not her fault either 😔 She is just as blind as I was and it just breaks my heart that it got to the point where all those little misunderstandings became one big one and made her not wanna be with me anymore . 

And I  know time will help me heal but words can't express how I feel right now and how miss her so much💔😢 I'm having such a hard time letting her go . I think it's because I don't even have a reason to move on.  She didn't lie , cheat , or anything like that . In the end, I realized whether u try to do good or bad it doesn't guarantee a happily ever after .   It was all just one big misunderstanding that I had have no control over ... #LoveSucks 😒",01Apr2019,1
282,"Hey,
So last friday i went with my mom for her routine checkup, and this girl happened to recognize me. We actually had met before while in college and i think we’ve good chemistry. She was there taking a family member (i think), so we only had like a minute talk before she left. Yesterday, i searched her name on IG and followed her. I still havent reached her via IM, just followed.

If i decide to invite her out, then there’s a problem... i do not have a car. What can i do in this situation? It seems like a deal breaker to me. ",01Apr2019,2
283,"Hello, I'm Violet. I've been through a lot in life, and I understand others have too. I'm extremely self aware. Sometimes overly. But I'm literally to the point in life that it's too physically difficult to get out. I understand I need to go to doctors, I'm a very very patient person, but it's physically hard to get up and out and around to existing. I've had horrid lows in life of not existing, but never to the point where I have no one to talk to. I genuinely understand people are busy, I feel like I'm being whiny, but I genuinely can't interact, maybe I'm emotionally drained? I don't know, the feeling is genuinely nauseating. Anyways, I'm not lazy, I WANT so bad to get up, move around, take care of myself. I just have like a black hole sucking my body down.  Like, I can (sorry if I say like a lot, I know that gets on some people's nerves) function at night, which is so weird. I've been forcing myself to function in the dY time, because I'm trying to get most right for my kids, but I just can't do what I need to do or what I want to do. I genuinely could make a living online, which I full heartly want to and have a small chance, a good small chance. I'm not trying to brag, I've genuinely started seeing that I can at least do some good with drawing singing, cosplaying. Like, I could be able to something for others and myself for once. I've lived a life, fully giving myself to and for others, I've never given to myself, unless I had money and could buy small things like piercings or hair dye or shitty make up, but I genuinely could do things that make others happy, but also make me happy, and making people happy, seeing people wanting to make their own channels to share who they all really are with eachother and not be judged. I just can't. I don't know why. I don't know if it's second guessing, I don't know if it's some type of fear. I don't get why I don't exist at all. I've been on the internet since I was about 10 years old, and as put going as I used to be, I was more active, when I wanted to do something, I did it. Now, K don't know, maybe it was years of being in controlling relationships. I don't know. I understand I need therapy, I genuinely do, I just have an extremely hard time moving, getting up. A lot of times, pain doesn't help, but I could get up and moving, I just don't know how. I'm so literally stuck, the same things happen every day and I don't know why my body forces me back into a cycle of being more energetic at night, I've tried many many many times to set myself straight, I've had jobs before, which I genuinely was a good worker, I was just anxious about messing up or getting in trouble or yelled at, but now, I can't get up. I want to build myself up so I can be better for my kids, but I can't get up. It hurts so much, admitting to that, but I need to admit to my faults. I'm sorry if this sounds ranty or that it shouldn't even be here, I'm just so stuck, I know what needs to be done, but I don't know how to get myself up, I don't know if it's all emotional or mental or I don't know.. I miss being happy, cheerful, up and moving, alive,  I just don't know how to get myself physically started, I know I need to make appointments, I just have to do everything on everyone else's time and it stresses me out even more when I have less time to make it to my appointment, is my baby gonna get mad or not (I get more anxious with loud crying, not anger anxious, I just break down and cry if it's constant) or the waiting room, like, I get impatient with the doctors sometimes, not other people being helped, but when it seems like they just sit and do nothing in between patients. Again, I'm sorry if this sounds like a diary, I don't talk to many people and when I try to join communities, I get too shy and worried that I won't be liked by anyone at all. I get that not everyone's gonna like me, but I'm genuinely scared of not having interaction, but I genuinely can't interact anymore. I get that years of traumatic experiences are gonna cause some issues, and I'm fully aware that I need to go to therapy. I live in a shotty small town. People around here could care less about emotional issues. So it's hard for me to trust a lot of people in the therapy region around here. I've had 2 or 3 around here, which is probably more than half that are around, and they'd always try to tell me how I felt, when I was straight telling them to their face how I felt. They'd say I felt way different from what I told them I felt, but they wouldn't ever listen to what I say to them. I'm sorry I keep making this drag on and on I just don't want to continue being non-existent.... I want to do go for my kids and myself. Anyone have any advice on how to get yourself up?.... Lol...

286,"## I recently got a massage which was in the buff. No big deal, I've heard massages are often naked. I'm new to massages and have been getting back into shape recently after an accident so I thought it'd be therapeutic. I don't know how these things go. The masseur I found by some classified ad was a masseur. He also got nude. He had asked politely if I wanted him to and I said sure why not, great. We're both totally comfortable with that and it made me feel more comfortable. We are both gay males, knew that, and are open about that.

&amp;#x200B;

Summary:

He gave me a strict great massage for 90% of it. He was visibly mostly erect about 75% of the time during the massage. I was too for a majority of the time especially being touched. Long story short, we didn't have sex, there was no penetration, but after it was pretty clear I was aroused and also okay and comfortable with what he was doing, he ended up kissing my neck and stroking me to release which I didn't ask for but was pleasantly surprised. It did seem all the pleasure was being provided towards me, but I would be open to mutual stuff and pleasing him in more ways at the same time. But don't know how to or how to make that known.

&amp;#x200B;

More details:

During the massage, this guy did position his privates so it was at a good viewing angle to my face, like inches away as I stared up at him when face up or staring at which face down looking towards the side. While admiring it for about half a minute with him knowing I was, he then would naturally but suddenly move away to work on my legs. Makes sense, he's giving a massage and moving onto different body parts. Most of it was strictly a standard massage, except as mentioned he was at least semi-erect or erect for most of it. He'd trace his fingertips across my inner thighs, b-lls and c-ck, during when he was massaging my upper legs, finally touching it for long stretches while I got turned on. He told me afterwards I have a great package down there. It was mutual. I was able to touch him but only for a few minutes at a time and then he would move to continue the massage at another part of my body, being the professional that he was.

Occasionally as he massaged me, his hard privates would touch my back, legs, or hands where it was encouraged to touch, but his hard appendage would not touch my face, neck, or anything blatantly ""right there"" in my face so to speak except when I was lying on my back and he was standing above me letting me admire it.

Towards the last part of the massage after he'd done the whole body, he knew I was aroused and he knew I was into him to since I had brushed my hand against his c-ck in a way he knew I was excited. When I touched him he would get harder and become fully erect. But this result could be just arousal through any touch, right, absent of attraction on his part? Also towards the end, he started to kiss my neck all over, then quick kisses on my lips but he would stop after only a bit--and there was no tongue.

He didn't do full on kisses, didn't exchange oral, either of us, and as mentioned we didn't have sexual intercourse. He did eventually bring out more slippery lotion and stroked me off as he kissed my neck and I released. But he did go pretty far. As in he used his hands to squeeze my nipples, stroke my body, mock f-cked me but with zero penetration, and even brushed his lips barely one millimeter at the tip of my cock--but as mentioned no penetration of any orifices.

It was these heavy teases, also letting me stroke him directly for moderate periods--even with a drop of pre-c-m oozing out just a tiny bit, but then he'd move away suddenly so I couldn't reach his c-ck anymore, and he'd get back to strictly massaging another part of my body, or eventually stroking me off towards release. Although it was sexy, it felt one-sided (him towards me).

What I'm confused about is whether he wants to do more mutually. He's clearly at least mostly aroused most of the time. He does things to me fully (no sex though). It seems one sided because he pulls away and he doesn't allow reciprocation on him. He does leave pretty instantaneously and doesn't stay to chit chat. That seems to me a sign he doesn't want to really pursue anything other than the massage ""session"".

&amp;#x200B;

Question:

Simply, is he wanting more mutual stuff between me and him? (It doesn't seem like from what I've said, eh?)

Is he just stroking my privates to give me release and going through what would I guess be mock ""motions"" (no full out making out, no full out me pleasuring him, no penetration anywhere) because he wants a repeat client who'll come back? I mean, guys do get aroused by almost anything brushing up against them, right?

Or is he actually interested in reciprocal touching and he's hesitant because he doesn't know I really want to please him and he just concludes I want to be pleased?

Basically how do I know without putting him in an uncomfortable position? Do I text him beforehand and ask? Do I bring it up right then and there next time, which would put him right on the spot?",01Apr2019,0
287,"My Gf and I have been together for roughly 4 years, Im 22 she’s 20, after talking about it multiple times we’ve agreed to wait until she ready to be intimate with me (any kind of overtly sexual contact), Being in love with her then and just as much if not more so now I agreed. As time went on with us being together she admits to me that she’s not sexually attracted to me even though she does truly love and care about me just as much as I love and care about her. 

I do truly love and am very attracted to her. The most we have done is sexting ( including sending pics of each other) and kissing but after  roughly 4 years I can’t help but get deeply depressed over the lack of intimacy. 

After she told me how she really felt we did break up for a little while after that, her choice, but we remained great friends. How we acted around each other and with how we still felt about each other we get back together, me asking and confirming if we where and her saying yes and agreeing.

292,"Is my nephew a psychopath?

I'm not sure where to begin with this one but here it goes. 

I have a nephew, lets call him Lee. Lee's mental state has been deteriorating for a few years now due to drugs and several mental break downs. Lee is 23 years old, by relation he is my nephew, but we grew up more like brothers as we are only 2 years apart in age. We did absolutely everything together. We got our first dogs together, saw each other every single day, we caused mischief together and eventually as the years went by, we drifted apart. 
At the age of 19 he went off to university in order to study for a law degree. He is a pretty clever guy, as you can imagine. During his time at university he got very heavily involved in taking and dealing drugs. He had a run in with the law due to an extremely violent outburst in which he assaulted a person and then returned to the scene carrying a baseball and kitchen knife shouting that he wanted to “take any cunt on that would have it” (in the middle of a crowded city centre). He wasn’t imprisoned for this. 

As the years went on, he grew distant from us (his immediate family) and even more so from his mother. He developed a very deep-rooted hatred for his mother as he blamed her for a terrible childhood in which he suffered abuse and neglect. His father was never consistently present in his or his sister’s lives and would come and go as he wished. There was never a moment that went by that I didn’t wish that my nephew and niece could come and stay with me and my parents. As much as I love my sister, she was an abusive drunk in her younger days and would beat her children, destroy their Christmas present, emotionally abuse them, put them down and just generally make them feel unsafe and unloved. My nephew also saw my father sexually assaulting his mother when they were both drunk and she was unconscious. I’ll never forget the look in his eyes when he turned up at our door with his sister and told us what he had witnessed. He was barely 9 and his sister was even younger. 
I feel that this event was a major turning point in his development, and that he has somewhat supressed the trauma that he experienced. His hatred for my father developed when my nephew was in his very early 20’s. He threatened to kill him etc…. A few years later my father died of a heart attack in the living room. I’ll never forget the call from my mother that morning whilst I was on my way to work. 
As time passed me and my mother, brother and sister concluded that perhaps Lee, was schizophrenic just as his father was. This made sense as he had some extremely bizarre fixations and ideas about life. We had urged him to get treatment, but he refused to believe that he had a problem at all. Instead, he said that “he was god, and the king of his bloodline”. 

As it turns out, he had been kicked out of university because of his attendance and he was living in a student accommodation all alone because all his peers had completed their degrees and returned home. His landlord had contacted his mother and informed her that he needed to leave the premises as he was threatening two young first year girls that had just moved into the property. He had threatened them with a knife, eaten all their food, banged their door repeatedly throughout the night and early hours of the morning and put cigarettes out in front of their bedroom doors. 

Eventually we convinced him to return home as we all decided it was best for him and he could get the treatment that he needed and perhaps being around his family would help him emotionally with whatever it was he was going through. After he returned home, he was normal. I spoke to him on the phone and my mother said that he seemed like he was back to his old self again which was such lovely news to hear. He actually asked me if it would be okay for him to come stay with me, my partner and our children for his birthday (we live a very long way away, in Scotland) Naturally, I said no, due to his previous behaviour and I honestly feared for my family’s safety. The strangest thing is that he was messaging my partner on facebook as if he knew her, he has never met her, and he was dropping hints into the conversation every other message about wanting to come here for his birthday, he was desperate, but why? Maybe he just wanted to meet our children, have some comforting people around him? No, I fear the truth is much, much darker than that. 

About a week after this, he begins making threats towards his mother, telling her that he will burn her alive, like a roasting pig. He told her that she needed to be reincarnated for what he had done to him as a child and that he was the devil and god in one person. He told her that he wanted to kill her in the best way possible, and on a drive across town he told her that he was going to give her a necklace 5 days before he kills her. Everybody just brushes it off as empty threats, none the less, the police are called and they take statements and tell my sister that if he threatens her again they will have to arrest him….The next day a parcel arrives at my sister’s house addressed to my nephew (he is living there) My sister opens the parcel and finds a small silver necklace and 90lb recurve bow with 7 arrows. My sister freaks the fuck out, leaves the house taking my niece and the bow and arrow with her. (Nephew is fast asleep in bed at this point.) She goes to my mums, calls the police on him, he is arrested promptly and taken into custody. The police take the situation very seriously, as you would expect. After he is taken away, my sister returns to the house to search his belongings. In his wallet she finds a detailed execution plan. It stated about the preferred time of day that he would like to kill her, the brand of cigarette he would like to smoke after doing it, how he would do it, what he would need to carry the plan out and a playlist of music he would listen to whilst doing it. This was taken in as evidence. He is now facing intent to murder charges and is facing 7 – 10 years in prison potentially. 

What terrifies me the most is that he begged my partner to come and stay here for his birthday. Who knows what was going through his mind? 

My question to anyone reading this is, do you think he is a psychopath or has antisocial personality disorder? Is there anything that can be done for him or is he just a black hole? A lost cause? Deep down I was hoping that perhaps he was unwell, and that he could be treated, but his plan seemed so coherent I have a hard time believing that he is really truly mentally ill.

298,"So when I was in seventh grade my mom woke me and my older brother up at like four in the morning and told us that she wouldn’t be coming home that night. She was going to go stay at our friends house because her and dad were having a bit of a “rough patch” but they would work it out. Me and my brother were confused and scared, obviously, but continued our day and tried not to think about it. My mom stayed at the friends house for a little over a month, and then moved onto a hotel. Eventually finding a house to rent. 
My dad did not want to get a divorce. He bought almost all the furniture for her house, let her keep a house key and come and go as often as she needed/wanted. He was putting forth a lot of effort into fixing what was happening, but it seemed really one sided. 
One day my mom was over for dinner and my brother and dad made steaks. My mom and dad went out into the garage to smoke real quick and then they were going to join us and we were going to eat dinner together. They ended up staying out there for three plus hours and me and my brother just ate by ourselves. 
My grades were slipping, no that’s not the right word, my grades were plummeting. I used to be an A B student but now was struggling to make a high D. I remember I had three missing homework sheets in my math class and I took an old one from weeks before and copied it three times and turned it in. My teacher, not being an absolute idiot, called me out and pulled me into the hall. She asked me why I didn’t just do it right and I told her I can’t focus at home. She asked why and I told her about my parents. She opened up to me about her parents messy divorce and gave me an extension and let me sit in the hall for a bit before returning to class 
Then eighth grade rolled around and my dad sat me and my brother down and told us he was going to divorce our mom and we would have to choose who we wanted to live with. I remember going to my room and just sobbing for what felt like hours because at this time I didn’t know who did what or what the hell was even going on. My dad ended up not going through with it until later that year, but that really shook me up still. Then one lovely fateful night my mom was over because I needed to get something for my Xbox from my dads. 
I don’t remember why but I was mad about something and wanted to stay so I was going extra slow. I got it and went into the garage to get my mom to let her know I was ready. She wasn’t in there so I went into the back yard and heard yelling coming from the camper. I walked over to it and I heard my dad yelling about some guy. I opened the door and my mom was in my dads face yelling that she loved him BLA BLA BLA. I ran back inside and cried in my room until I heard a commotion in the garage 
I opened the door to find my dad making my mom give him the house key and telling her to leave. 
Later that week my dad, a army vet who never showed any emotion, was driving me home from school and he just broke down. Had to pull over the car so we wouldn’t crash kind of break down. Eventually I picked up on things. My mom was cheating on my dad with a guy named Matthew. She had met him in Vegas when her and her best friend(my best friends mom) went for another friends birthday. She gave him her number and thus sent the tiny snowball of bullshit down the snow covered mountain. 
I don’t remember much up until my granny passed, on January sixth 2017.  And then my parents got the divorce finalized on January 20th. My birthday is the 23rd of January so that helped a bunch. It was around this time that I started losing my appetite. I was always hungry but couldn’t eat. I felt like I would do something wrong and inconvenience someone around me by eating too much so I told everyone I wasn’t hungry. I lost like 60 lbs and told everyone I was on a diet. I realized what I was getting myself into and eased myself back into a regular diet, but I started self harming too. (Woo edgy teen time) I was never good with blood so I never cut, I gave myself eraser burns and would pinch little holes in my arms. Sporadically enough that it didn’t look too intentional. The burns however were very noticeable. 
I have one big scar on my hand from it and 7 or 8 on my ankle. 
I got fought and was put into therapy, who made me sigh a contract saying I wouldn’t kill my self. I know that therapy helped/helps a lot of people but the advice I got just caused more problems. So I convinced my parents I was ok and I could stop seeing her. My mom stared having her boyfriend fly into town and she would fly to his house. He lived in Michigan and were in Arizona. My dad was paying her child support 300 a month, and she said she would give me and my brother 50 dollars every month, but she never did. (Which I mean I’m not upset about not getting money. It’s the empty promise.)  instead she bought and booked plane tickets for her and her boyfriend. Ninth grade is here and its almost over now. 
My brother found out I was still cutting and came into my room and yelled at me. He berated me for hurting my mom and my family by doing this to myself. My mom was trying to get him to calm down but he was beyond mad. He pushed her off him and she fell. He was grabbing my neck and holding my head on my bed, nothing painful just to pin me down because I was trying to leave. He has no memory of this now. He got so mad at me he walked out into the living room and punched a hole in the wall and broke his hand. woot woot. Enter me trying to leave and walk to my dads house giving my mother a panic attack because I just rock don’t I :). My mom was hysterical trying to drive him to the hospital and my dad came and picked me up and met her there. My dad always has a gun in his car and he took it out because I was having a panic attack and wouldn’t stop crying and he thought I would shoot my self. HE THOUGHT I WOULD SHOOT MYSELF.  He proceeds to berate me the same way my brother did and I get to go make sure my brothers ok. Next day was our vacation to Mississippi to visit family so everything was hectic. My brother got a cast and never got any punishment for what he did. :)) 

My brother was fed up with my moms boyfriend and gave her a list. If she did the things on the list he would stay, if not she was going to my dads full time. The list was dumb stuff like you need to treat me as an adult BLA BLA BLA regular I’m 16 and this is angst bs. But the last thing said I don’t want your boyfriend in my or my sisters life and she said she couldn’t do that. So my brother left. My mom literally fell on the ground crying once he left and I had to console her. At the time I was 14. I didn’t even process what was happening until later that week and I broke down at school and my dean had to pull me out of a panic attack during lunch. I still saw my brother but god damn that hurt. It felt like he was leaving me too. Leaving me to deal with everything on my own. 

Then my mom decided she was going to leave me too and move to Michigan. Of course she dosent see it as leaving me but that’s exactly what she’s doing. She’s leaving me to be with her boyfriend. My grand ma and grandpa on my moms side came to help us pack my mom was taking a moving truck and her boy toy was going to help her move. Not two days after she left my dad comes home from work and tells me and my brother that we need to talk. He sat us down and told us that our grandpa had passed in his sleep the night before. The one who was JUST here And seemed to be in PERFECT HEALTH. I’m 15 now and I’m staring to fall into old habits again and I just don’t know what to do anymore   I feel like I can’t even cry. When I cry I feel so pathetic because there’s so many people who have it so much worse than I do. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about this dumb shit because that just judge me or they change the subject. Idk I just feel alone and I’m just getting more depressed by the day. It’s so hard to do anything social anymore I just want to stay home. My room is the only place I’m comfortable and now my dad wants to move too. I just need to process everything that’s happened these last few years but it’s not slowing down. It’s getting worse and worse and it won’t stop. I jut wish it would stop. I just need it to stop. I don’t know what to do anymore it just keeps getting worse. ",01Apr2019,2
299,"To try and keep this post short - I used to work in a technical role for a year but got burned out and wanted to persue another non-technical passion of mine - I moved continents alone - alas it didn't work out as I wanted but I was happy I tried it. When I came back, I tried to go back to my trade but after a 1/2 interviews realised my skills had gotten a bit weak. So I've spent 1/2 months creating small projects (to show recruiters/employers)  thus improving my skills to the point they are better than before / I've learned a couple new ones, but now I've gotten to the point where I don't even answer the phone from recruiters/HR , when my phone rings, I immediately start sweating and get insanely anxious while I watch my phone ring (not answering it).

One week I'm insanely motivated on the project I'm working on but then I'll watch a video of a guy explaining something he built and feel very inferior to the point where it seems anything I do will be inferior to him or people like him - I try reason with myself by saying he developed those skills over a long period of time with effort / hes a freakish outlier who is a quick learner - but this doesn't help me most days.

If I miss one of my daily runs, my mood dives even lower. I try to do lists to try and plan my day. I try and step away from my work once a week  (usually by myself). by going on a hike / outing to a museum/somewhere I like. 

Even though I do these things, everything else feels like so much effort. Getting out of bed,  socializing(I often have to neck 2/3 shots just to get my mood up),  learning new things.  One week I'll be crazy positive and motivated but then suddenly I'll become sad and lose the joy in whatever I was doing.

So what do I do? I do most of the things i've read about on the internet, daily exercise, a good diet, enough sleep (too much sometimes) and have done them consistently for a long time but it still feels like living is on hard-mode mentally.",01Apr2019,1

303,"My family and I are originally from the US, but we have lived outside the country for most of my life. (I’m not angry about it, it’s been one of the best experiences I’ve ever had. Just in case anyone gets confused.) Anyway, we have to travel back to the US this year because me and my two older brothers have to go to college. We won’t be getting back into the US until June 10th, and the semester at our respective college starts on August 23rd. 

This is quite the situation. We only have about a month to get jobs to scrape together what little money we can to pay for the tuition. It probably won’t be enough, but we won’t know for sure until our college tell us what the price will be. Currently, we just lack the necessary information.

On top of this, I will still be a minor for my first 2 semesters at college. My parents are going to have to sign custody over to my Uncle and Aunt who live in the area, just so I can get the help I need in case a medical emergency occurs. 

I’m extremely stressed about this whole situation. I’m losing sleep at night because I can’t stop thinking about it. I don’t want to take out a loan, because I will have no way to pay it off, and I’d like to avoid debt. I’m scared to death. I literally have no idea what to do.

306,"Me (F31) and boyfriend (m31) have been together for 8 years, living together for 7. Moved around to different places and always got along.
We have the same interests, enjoy the same things. I do prefer being more social than he does, at times. Although also very much enjoy being at home.

I have always called him my best friend. 

There's been issues since the start (no relationship is perfect, I understand that); at the beginning he was addicted to porn so could never get it up, which made me spiral into a very dark place about my self image (I was already battling that without the sex thing). I found that heart breaking as is was still early on in the relationship, the time it's usually hot and heavy.

He never does anything nice for my birthday and I had to make sure to request he buys me a present. I'm not a materialistic person, he could make me something and I'd be fine with that, I just like getting treated special on those days.

Anniversaries are always planned by me. 

As are any dates or special occasions.

My biggest issue with him is he says he will do all these things and never follows through.

Financially he has depended on me a lot.

By year 4 I got incredibly drunk and blacked out. I was hanging out with a guy and have no recollection of what happened. I am almost sure nothing bad, but not 100%

I went to therapy for alcoholism. The therapist asked my bf to come for a session. He explained that it's not the alcohol it's the relationship. We/I never went back.

Year 5, again, I went out and got drunk with friends. Didn't reply to his text messages but this time a guy kissed me.

I whole heartedly regretted it and we moved forward.

Alcohol is my issue - although everything else has lead me feeling dissatisfied.

More recently, past several months, I have been speaking more about marriage and how I want those things. At the start he didn't necessarily agree (he told me the other day he now does).

The sex now is non existent and I never get head (a complaint raised numerous times).

I have been trying to work on myself and wanting to make sure should anything happen I won't do anything stupid.

However. I now have a crush on someone - I get the whole new and exciting thing and understand this will complicate things further. Moreover, the crush has explained they too have feelings and there's a chance it could evolve into something, should my bf and I break up.

A week ago I went out drinking with him and friends, nothing happened as he's very respectful but I didn't reply to bf text messages and got home late


The next day bf left for a week so we can figure out what we want.

We are half way through the break.

He wants to work on himself and the relationship (but I have heard this before)... 

He is not a bad guy at all, he is wonderful, and I love him.

I just don't know if I am in love with anymore.

Before the new person came along I would daydream of others and dates and how life would be on my own. It's scary. I like love and being in relationships. 

But apart of me feels like this relationship is not necessarily the best (we drink 3 to 4 times a week, smoke pot daily and don't eat well).

I feel stuck.

I just want to make the right choice.

I feel like a part of me wants to be alone, stay friends with the new person and bf and not rush anything and work on myself.

But 8 years is a long time - am I turning my back or have we organically reached this point due to ongoing issues.

Sorry this is so long.

Any advice?

307,"My (19F) mother (47) does everything for my 13 year old brother. By that i mean she treats him like he is 7 years old, and she has treated him like this as soon as i can remember. But before that she was just overprotective over him, and it was normal since he was young. But now he is 13 (soon 14) and it has started to get weird, and in my opinion this is not good for a 13 year old that needs to start learning how to take care of himself.  

For example, he never has to clean up after himself because my mother does everything for him. As soon as he wakes up in the morning he has breakfast on the table and my mom makes his bed as he eats his breakfast. After that he just leaves the table, and my mom goes and picks it up and washes the plates etc. this is just an example, but it’s like that for every meal. If my brother is hungry he just says “i’m hungry” and my mom starts making sandwiches for him. I think i’ve seen him make food for himself 2 or 3 times a year.  

When he spills something, my mom cleans it up and so on and so on...  

When i was 13, i was cooking for myself, making my own breakfast, and my parents always made me was my own dishes and stuff like that.  My mom has always been very protective over my brother and spoiled him, always taking his side and doing everything for him. My mom loves my brother a lot, and i know my mom loves me too but because of her behavior towards him i’ve always felt like she favorited him a bit. I think it’s also because he is still young and her last child. This has also gotten a lot worse since my brother got depression after he got diabetes, and he is currently out of school since almost a year. So our family situation is very difficult right now, and i understand why my mom wants to care for him so much in this way. I’ve tried talking to her and said “i don’t think it’s good that you do so much for him, he needs to learn how to start taking care of things himself” and she always agrees with me, but it never changes.  

Obviously this isn’t going to mess him up for life or anything like that, but i believe that this situation is unhealthy for my brother. Especially because of his depression, i believe it would be good for him to start building confidence by doing stuff for himself more.  

Is this unhealthy for him? How can i explain to my mom that her behavior is unhealthy for my brother? ",01Apr2019,3
308,"Hi reddit! I'm a newbie but I have an issue that is pressing on me. My brother is hopefully going to be released from prison in the next year or so 🤞 I feel an urgency to start preparing to help him build a foundation for his new life, but I'm unsure of what is most helpful and doable from this far out. Some background- I'm unsure if he will be moving into his own apartment through the help of others or if he will choose to stay with his gf. So I might be preparing to fill a space with basic necessities or maybe not. Some things I've considered doing are:

-Digitizing his important documents that I have in my possession so that he'll always have accessible copies 
-Putting together photo albums 
-Stockpiling socks, tanks, any necessities 
-Saving up money to buy gift cards to grocery stores
-Collecting resources on job searches/ other reintegration materials

&gt;migrant family all alone in a first world country far from home with no real support

&gt; 2 younger brothers and parents

Nobody gets along. Parents are divorced and still live together purely due to financial reasons and that it's the only way to pay off the house for us kids to grow up and have as a platform. 

My 2 younger brothers drive my parents mad. Like not in the typical few tantrums and mum's upset. Like, straight up ignore/defy every single thing told to them, and use painful words when talking back. (they 13 and 15). They are heavily addicted to their videogames and gadgets to the point where they're failing school because of it. Zero talents or interests or career prospects whatsoever which adds a heck of a lot of stress to my parents, as friends in similar situations all have excelling kids. And there's absolutely no way of controlling them, they're completely rogue and have a deep hatred for each other, not typical sibling rivalry but so bad neither one can have friends over because they will be humiliated non stop. 

All my time at home goes in listening to arguments or settling 'im right he's wrong' debates either between my parents, brothers, or all. My parents work opposing shifts so they hardly have to see each other , but a big root cause is my brothers , I seriously don't know what to do, there isn't an ounce of happiness in this place and it's been getting worse. 
How can I get them to give up the games? To actually listen to just 1 thing they're told to do? At this rate they'll be held back in school and have no direction/aspirations. 

I've spent countless hours trying to be understanding and explaining things to them, it has no effect they tell me to get lost and go back on their game/Instagram. Do I need a more hammer and dynamite approach? I'm so lost.

320," 

My boyfriend and I, both in our mid 20s are together for four years. There has been an issue with a female co worker of his for over two years. He hang out at her house in secret 1.5 yrs ago, I found out much later. He claims nothing happens. They still work together and text sometimes, but less frequent. He swears he won't hang out with her - she has send inappropriate texts and such.

We live together in our own house. I leave every monday morning to another city and come back tuesday morning for work issues. This means he is alone for 24 hours.

This tuesday morning 10am I got out of the bus and saw that girl walking to the bus. We live in a small craphole place, with nothing to do. We have a supermarket, a bakery, one tiny clothing store and that is it. This girl lives in another city, works in another city and studies in another city. I know she has NO friends or family in our town, because she mentioned it earlier to my boyfriend. (""You are the only one I know that wants to live in that crap place!"")

What was her reason to be there, so early in the morning? I came home and my boyfriend was in bed asleep, with the window and curtains open. He always sleeps with the window and curtains closed.

I confronted and he said she was not there and has never been to our house. Then I decided to check his internet history. Yes, fellow redditors, I know this is wrong but I do NOT want a rant about this.

So I saw that the evening before he watched some netflix on his tablet until 11PM. After that, things get weird. He watched youtube on his mobile from 11.00 to 11.19 PM. This is odd, because I am with this guy for 4 years and he NEVER watches youtube on his phone when he is inside the house. He always only does this when he is in the bus, outside or whatever. However no busses drove at that moment so that can't be true. After 23.19 there was no signs of activity anymore on his phone, tablet or computer. He set up an alarm clock at 22.59 PM.

The first next activity was next day 08.04 am when he put off his alarm clock, and then 08.30 on Whatsapp.

He has a car that he shares with his mom. Wednesday we got into the car and he said; Mom keeps asking bout the car and drives my fuel till its empty. And I said; no she didn't asked for the car for at least 2 weeks why you bring this up? He just said oh it bothers me.

He kept bringing up this girl 2 or 3 times. ""I don't think it was her, I think you saw it wrong. Probably can't be her"" blah blah.

He got angry and sad when I asked him if he cheated and he denied all and called me paranoid. Ever since, nearly a week, my boyfriend acts distant and avoids sex.

322,"Hello, I’m 18F and a freshmen at a university majoring in computer science. 

School in general has been really rough for me- I barely graduated from high school. Since middle school, my grades have been plummeting due to low motivation from depression. I’m not sure, I just know that around 7th grade I started becoming really moody and sad about things since I didn’t have any friends and I didn’t get along with my family.
My parents divorced when I was 6, and I mainly lived with my mother. But our relationship has been very rocky. It’s not that she doesn’t care about me, we just can’t see eye to eye on things and it’s difficult for us to understand each other. She is always misunderstanding me and comparing me to others... but I think that is pretty normal for parents. It just hurts a lot that she can’t understand things like anxiety and depression. I just feel lonely and my only family is just never really *there* to support me. I had a lot of bitter feelings in the past because everyone else seemingly had perfect families and lives but I think I’ve come to terms with things. 
Anyways, I’ve been wanting to drop out from university or at LEAST just take a break from it. I failed all my classes first semester and I told my mom that I did not want to go back to school next semester (this semester) because I didn’t think I would do well and it would just be a waste of money. But she told me to at least try once more so I complied and went back to school. I’m trying, I really am, but it’s just so difficult to go to class and do well when I’m so demotivated. Some days I feel so tired and exhausted I can’t even get out of bed. My mom always says I’m not trying hard enough. She called me a few days ago and started yelling at me and I couldn’t talk to her properly since i started crying really hard. She wouldn’t back down so I hung up on her. She then sent me a text that read “everyone is struggling. you are not special” I know that everyone has their own struggles... But that doesn’t invalidate my suffering, does it? I told her in the past, I want to find a job and work for a while and spend some time to think about what I want to do. But she always says that I won’t be able to live if I don’t go to university, and that minimum wage jobs won’t be enough. I really don’t know what to do. I’m so stressed and sad and unhappy with myself. Everything feels so difficult. I feel like I can’t do anything because of my mom. I know she wants me to graduate from university and get a good job to support myself. I know she just wants the best for me. But the way she talks to me is so painful and it feels like she doesn’t care about my mental health and happiness. I wish I could go to school and do well, but it just feels impossible as I am right now. 

I’m sorry for the long wall of text. I’m bad at writing. ",01Apr2019,1
323,"How should I feel about my boyfriend continuing to shit talk me to his ex secretly when he promised he wouldn’t even talk to her at all. He is so sweet and kind to me and pushes me to be my best but tells his ex this shit. 

He said I make him feel like the boss because he can mentor me in life cause I need help. Cause I listen to him and don’t question him hardly. Cause I go with the flow with what he wants. They dated for seven years. He said he feels superior to me intelligence wise and career wise. 

He said she is too smart, too quick, and challenges him too much physically, emotionally, and intellectually. He tells her I have emotional problems and need someone there cause I’m fragile. That he’s giving me a shot and if we don’t workout (which he told her he doesn’t think we will) at least he made me a better person. He told her his life is perfect except his relationship with me causes him angst at times. 

She’s super independent and travels alone and works out and has a good job and is a fitness model in addition to being a doctor and she was a college athlete and was an honors student. I just slid by in school, hate working out, and got a job in sales.

I snooped on his phone cause she kept calling him and realized a few things after reading their convos and our talks about her in the past. 

 I think he made his ex into a dependent person and she ended up getting fed up with it and left him when she realized she could be a complete and independent person on her own.

Yeah. Apparently when they met she had just moved to their city and had no friends. She only had him to hangout with for a few years while she stayed at home and went to community college which he was embarrassed to tell people about. He wouldn’t hang with her family and made excuses to leave because they made him feel weird. They only hung with his family and she loved them so she abandoned hers for his because he never seemed excited to be with her family. She then went to a top university and found a close group of friends and he alienated himself from her. She then became a much better person and was involved in her school, picked up extra jobs (he never worked in college), did her AND his schoolwork so he could pass, and she graduated as an honors student from a top 30 university and got a job with a promising future and made more money than him. He cheated and blamed her for her being too controlling which is why he said he cheated but begged for her back when the new girl left him. He used to prevent her from leaving the house when they fought and also would stalk her location on her phone when they broke up so he could creep on what she was doing and would even secretly hide at places and watch her do stuff when she hung with her friends. She said she wishes she could record their convos because he always denied what he said previously if it didn’t currently benefit him and apologized for her feelings instead of his actions that caused those feelings. She thought all this shitty behavior was due to him being young. 

He now tells her he admires her independence and how she always tries to be her best yet says he loves how I make him feel he is the man cause I am inferior in all ways compared to her and don’t really fight back and I do as he says. He also says he isn’t excited about our future together but is giving me a chance. We have dated 1 year 

He once told her that he can have his pick of the litter cause “i am a college athlete, I have a nice car, live in a high rise, and owns a company (he works for his moms company)”

Also, why won’t he date her if she’s that cool and wants to date him. She feels she ruined the relationship and learned to just submit to what he says because if not he will deny everything she says and make her feel she is crazy and is the problem so therefore she thinks she causes him to act in certain ways and if she was better he would treat her better. 

WHY WONT HE LEAVE ME IF HE THINKS SO POORLY OF ME ? He is so nice to my face and has never said any of this to my face. He always supports me and encourages me to be my best. But he told her I’m the only source of angst in his life. That he’s going to figure out where our relationship should go soon. That he’s not optimistic about our future, yet he told her the same damn thing about a year ago and look. We’re still dating. I think he’s just trying to prevent her from having a nervous breakdown. 

Edit: I reached out to the ex today and literally he would tell her she was so annoying and stressful and was ruining his life so she said okay bye then and he would get so mad and say why is that your default response to issues we have? And she told him it’s because he didn’t seem happy and she wasn’t going to make someone he with her. And he would get upset and ask her to not leave when he literally just told her he was miserable with her

**TLDR: boyfriend shit talks me to ex and said he’s giving me a shot a year ago. He continues to date me but still goes behind my back at times to respond to his exes messages. He refuses to date ex while dating me. He praises ex for qualities she has and says he wished I was like that but then tells his ex he likes me because he can improve my life and I make him feel like the man cause I’m hot and pretty.**

324,"I (17F) am going to be graduating high school this year, and I don’t plan on going to university right away as I was planning on working for a year and saving up, even though my parents are offering to pay for everything, every person who I’ve talked to that has graduated university told me how much working has helped them, not just in financial independence but their personalities grew and they became more confident and disciplined and whatnot. 

None of my siblings had a job before graduating university, and I look at them, all in their mid/late twenties and they’re still almost completely dependent on my parents for everything and I really don’t want to end up like that. None of them can maintain a stable job as they can’t differentiate between what are normal work circumstances and what aren’t, they skip work a lot, and are just overall very irresponsible due to lack of experience. 

I don’t want that for myself, but I’m still underage and my dad doesn’t want me to get a job before i get a college degree. Whenever I bring it up he asks in a very gross and condescending tone: “So do you want to work as a waitress? or cashier?” And I can’t, for the life of me, understand what the fuck is so wrong about that? He keeps saying that if I need money I can go to him but it’s not entirely about money. He also quickly changes the subject whenever I bring it up and gets noticeably irritated about it. He’s constantly complaining about how irresponsible my family members are (which is obviously because of the way he raised them) and I’ve told him all of this before but he just won’t listen to me. 

It’s very frustrating and I don’t know what to do or how to go about it. What can I do to convince him to get a job? 

TLDR; Dad doesn’t want me to get a job as long as I don’t have a college degree, the same thing happened to my siblings and now they’re irresponsible fucks and I don’t want to end up like them. How do I change his mind? ",01Apr2019,0
325,"Hi guys, it's my first post asking for advice like this. 
There's a lot so 

TLDR: Dog is severely dumb, old, and needs help all the time at home. Mother who isn't involved got a mid life crisis great Dane puppy that destroys house and tramples old dog. Dementia ridden grandma gives poisonous food to dogs. I can't leave house without old dog needing my help. Please help.

CONTEXT:

I have a 17 year old dog that is my everything. I treat him like my baby and I cling to him like my best friend. He always runs around excited everytime I get home. 

I just started him on pain meds about a month ago after he really needed them because he'd be screaming at night in pain. (He sounds like a human. He screams. He is a beagle. Fellow beagle owners understand.)  I have to give them to him every 12 hours. He still loves walks and car adventures which I don't take him out on very much anymore because it tires him out. 

 My maxy boy is perfect and I love him every which way. He is the sweetest dog you've ever met gaurenteed but his great personality comes with being a bit... Dumb. Really dumb. Like unable to know other dogs hate him, bumping in to people if they stop walking, injuring himself for things because he doesn't realize the danger, etc. My whole life with him he's been a problem child dog. Going to the vet for bizarre things like drinking bleach... (Yes he survived somehow), tripping on rocks, drinking BBQ cleaner, etc. The best way I could describe his intelligence is that if he were to walk in to a dog house he would know how to get out because he wouldnt know to just turn around or walk backwards. I've had 5 dogs and worked with dogs and by far he is the dumbest dog I've ever met. Very sweet, wouldn't hurt a butterfly, toy or anything, adorable, but very dumb. 

PROBLEM:

Now that he is 17 it's like his dumbness was aided by cataracts and deafness. He lays down in really peculiar spots, in twisted up ways which forces me to help him move out of danger and uncomfort. When he gets spooked he goes full fledged four legged split and it can simply be that he didn't see me behind him walking around the house and me brushing up against him slightly freaks him out.  I have to help him up in this situation as well. 

Lately he's been getting stuck in the doggy door, falling down my back yard steps without attempting to walk down them, doing it repeatedly because I think he forgets he went outside originally to go potty in the first place so he does this never ending loop of climbing back up the stairs, in the house, out the house, fall down stairs forget why outside, repeat.  

SITUATION THAT IM STUCK IN:

I'm a young girl in college with a boyfriend. I want a life. I struggled a lot with suicidal thoughts and depression issues caused by a mental disorder that I have and this dog really is one of the reasons I'm still here because I'm literally all he has. I have to get home to give him meds, I have to be home to make sure he isn't stuck somewhere from falling down and being goofy. I have to constantly pick him back up and help him out. 

I love him but every time I leave the house all I do is worry about him and it's often reasonable because every time I get home there's something wrong. He's stuck somewhere, he is screaming for me to get home cuzz he developed this crazy separation anxiety, he is acting weird etc. 

I live with my parents, my brother, and my dementia ridden grandma. My mother lives in our garage, where as my gma lives upstairs causing issues to my dog as well. My bro never leaves his room and acts like the dogs (yes I said dogs) are barely there. 

I can't get help with this. My mom decided randomly to get a great Dane puppy and I've been trying to give it a life. She takes him on walks like once a week but basically she leaves him at home to cause destruction. This dog tramples my 17 year old dog adding to the problems.

My dementia ridden grandma who really should be watched by a care taker often tries to give the dogs chocolate, grapes and other poisonous things as well. Not to mention everytime the dogs have any indication of a personality she reads in to it too much and starts doing weird stuff like walking outside to ""see what it is they are upset about"" or closing the door on them outside and locking them out for no reason other than ""they wanted outside.""  

Every time I leave the house I get messages that my dog is on the brink of death (when he isn't) and when I'm home my family often says insensitive things. 

I'm stuck with my my home situation. There's no out. 

ADVICE: 

I ask for ways anyone might know how I can lessen the stress of taking care of my dog. I can't afford a sitter and nor would my family let a random person in the house. 

Where could I look for hints on how to potty train him for indoor potty time so he could stop falling down the stairs at least. Has anyone been a similar situation caring for a special needs pet and was incapable of leaving the house because of it? 

I WILL NOT PUT HIM DOWN.
He has a will to live, can walk, doesn't poo/pee himself, can eat on his own etc. 

I WILL NOT REHOME HIM.
I am all he's known. And he is extremely special to me. I love him so much and he loves me almost too much. He cries when I leave for just 5 minutes to put trash out on curb. I can't give this dog to anyone else. If I was capable of such a thing than I'd be heartless.

336,"Hi guys,

I’m 29 and I’ve grown up with big dogs.  My last dog passed away from cancer in 2012.  He was a German Shepherd.  Since then I’ve lived vicariously through other people’s dogs, until the time I’m able to get my own again.

In January I made a mistake.  I approached a dog I didn’t know at a friends place (after being told it was friendly) and it growled and tried to bite me.  The dog was massive (Great Dane).  I was not bitten, and the dog was restrained and removed for the duration of my visit.  Honestly I should have known better than to approach it, that’s on me.  But it’s left me with a bit of a problem.

I now find myself afraid of big dogs.

I didn’t realise the issue until a few weeks ago when we got a new housemate.  She has two big bitzer dogs who are lovely.  Unfortunately I went away for two weeks for business and when I got home I couldn’t get in my yard as they were guarding it and didn’t recognise me.  My partner had to let me in.  Since then they have recognised me as a friend and been very sweet but my anxiety spikes when I see them.  For context, both dogs are quite large and when I sit on the ground their standing head height is equal to my head height.

I really, really want to get over this anxiety and love and care for these dogs (whether or not I “own” them is irrelevant) but I currently can’t go outside without being extremely nervous.  I can’t even feed them breakfast or dinner without assistance.  I know that animals are sensitive and I’m pretty sure that the dogs have picked up on my nervousness and that that is probably detrimental to the relationship I’m trying to have with them.

My partner and housemate say it’s just going to take time, but I was wondering if anybody had any ideas on how I can actively overcome this fear I suddenly have?  I’ve always been a dog lover, and I grew up with big dogs, so I’m heartbroken that I now get anxiety spikes when I try and interact with any dog bigger than a corgi in size.

338,"I'm [18M] about to finish school, finals are in a few months and recently I've been thinking about what to do later in life a lot. And finally I came out with a few different options.

1st one is going straight for a profession (car mechanic) because I like cars and enjoy being around them, that's the most practical one after which I can easily find a job and start working.

2nd option is going to study philosophy. Why? Because it's simply interesting and I think thats valuable experience even though it's not considered very useful. And after finishing the course, going for car mechanic profession or maybe something else I could discover while studying. Also would look for a part-time job while studying to have some money for myself as the bracelet work (talking about it in 3rd option) is becoming a bit boring and I want something new.

3rd option is to take a gap year, find a full-time job, save up some money and travel. I've never travelled further than 300km from my home country, as our family isn't really loaded with money. We live fine, just holidays abroad aren't a thing we can easily afford. I'm working in my free time, making bracelets which are sold on Etsy, so I make some money for myself and not being such a burden for my parents, I saved up for a car, can afford lunches and going out with little help from my parents.  So I think gap year would allow me to find a normal job which would let me afford to travel to a few different countries and experience something really new for me. After the gap year I'd probably go to university and study something I'd feel like studying at that time. Maybe I'd discover a new passion, who knows? 
BUT in my country after you become 19years old there is a chance that you can get invited into army forces for 9 months which is compulsory. And i feel like it could ruin the whole gap year if I get invited and postpone every plan.

341,"My situation now is that I'm currently roughly 8 months after graduating highschool, unemployed and have a way to go to university in summer. I took a gap year you could say... I only took it because of my personal issues I have and somehow hoped that I would figure myself out by the time I will go to university. I think it's been 3-4 years since I've been battling with depression and anxietie (I'm 20 now). I think that's what it is that I'm fighting with... I isolate myself from world and peers whenever possible, I'm hopeless as if I'm 50 and all my chances and hopes are gone, I'm misanthropic, I have low self esteem and I had pretty much given up on life to the point that the only things that I do are the things that I'm forced to do by others, I wouldn't say I'm sucidical but I feel as if I've been betrayed by people and world around me and now I'm disappointed and I just wish I wouldn't have been born in the first place because this life is way overrated anyways...

I think that's only couple of the biggest of my issues, just to give a bit perspective in the headspace I'm in. 

Besides successfully completing my admission to university this (gap) year I had also in my plan to get a job - not as much for the money as for the experience. You could say that I believe it can be therapeutic to me - either getting me back to being ""normal"" or at least keeping me from getting even deeper down my spiral (or both at the same time). 

I never had a real job or even summer job like most of my peers. When I was 14 I picked up filmmaking as sort of my passion and since then I always had few ""gigs"" here and there which almost always payed better than any summer job could, not saying how much fun was it for me back then. 
And I think also small factor is that I think I've never been ""high maintenance"" for myself so I always had pretty good reserves in my bank account that would last me year or two while my peers can burn through them in 2-3 months. 

You can imagine that since I have no real expertise or experience yet - job offers are very limited and most of them are not the most pleasant (factory worker, car wash employee, construction worker, etc...).
Now I'm ready to take a job offer I got recently and up until this point I thought of this plan of ""therapeutic work"" only as a good step forward - that somehow through this rather unpleasant wake up call and leap of faith I will get mentally better. I will learn what real hardship is, I will be humbled, I will learn discipline, and so on and so forth... Trial through fire you could say. 
But around a week ago I was surprised when my father instead of approval or praise told me that I'm doing a huge mistake. 
When he was my age he did the same thing before going to university and he told me that there is nothing to learn from this ""experiment "" and  I will only waste my precious time of youth. He told me that the last thing I need is to be locked up in the factory for most of the spring and summer with some asshole behind my back telling me even when I can go to the bathroom. 
Now is the time that if I can I shouldn't be tasting the tougher tastes of life because there will be plenty enough of those in the future. 
From his point of view - people take these jobs only because they have to because of money and are willing and able to stay in them because that's how far their thinking, imagination, vision and satisfaction is able to reach (which is completely okay). 

Basically he said that if I need to make an income I should just stick to my filmmaking gigs as I've always done and if I want a lesson there is nowhere to be found in taking a dreadful job ""just because"". 

And this surprised me because that's not the opinion I would attach to my dad who is pretty much a ""man's man"". 

This opinion versus my opinion since then put me in a predicament - maybe I'm making a mistake and I will just waste my time and hate my life even more after 5 months of working in factory, but my father doesn't know my psychological situation and if I will continue this disorderly lifestyle I will just continue to spiral down into the abyss. But than again, I lived ""orderly"" when I was in Highschool but it didn't help a bit with my struggles... All I wanted was to be at home, alone in my room. 
Now I'm doing exactly that and to be honest that is pretty much how far my ambition goes right now, 

I hope I explained myself somewhat clearly - of what is my situation and what I mean by ""real job"".

The results are rumored to be out in a week and I'm not able to concentrate on anything else. I daydream/worry about the outcome and have knots in stomach. I also constantly feel sick and have trouble breathing whenever I think about the results. I usually deal with result anxiety by being around family but this time I'm living alone is a far away city with no friends and many project deadlines. Also, I know that I have to focus on other things and there's nothing I can do but it's easier said than done. Posting on this subreddit is an attempt to find some help. If someone who has been in a similar situation can share some advice on how to deal with it, it would be really helpful. Thanks! ",01Apr2019,1

So  there is this girl my SO was really obsessed with to the point where he  had a spank bank folder filled with photos he downloaded from her  social media. There was a lot of denial and lies on his part about her, a  lot of covering up his obsession with her, etc. They were just  acquaintances, no real cheating occurred, but it really hurt me and  being reminded of her still hurts. He has blocked her everywhere now,  except for Spotify. There is really no way to block on Spotify.

She has no idea he was obsessed with her. As far as she knows, they were only friends. I don't even know if  she noticed he blocked her everywhere. He did it about a year ago and  she is STILL following him on spotify. I want to ask her to unfollow  him, but I don't know how to go about it. I don't want to tell her that  my SO was obsessed with her and I made him block her and neither of us  ever want to see anything about her ever again.

346,"So I'm livid.  The car rental clerk basically took my credit card and said he was applying a 260 euro damage deposit which would be refunded, I asked for a receipt, and he said there was none b/c it was a deposit.  So I've now learned that I was refunded 90 euros which was the fuel deposit and that's it.

I emailed their customer support - and they're not doing anything.  So my options are the following:

1) File compliant with Expedia that their vendor scammed me: GoldCar/InterRent Malaga

2) File dispute with credit card 

3) File Complaint with European Car Rental Conciliation Service 

4) Write a ton of reviews online.

347,"So to add context, I am 21 y/o and I've experienced a lot of problems with anxiety and depression up till this point. I'm currently enrolled on a 1 year course that gives me what I'd need to go on to university. I've attended college numerous times now and had to pull out due to concerns over making my health worse. I feel left behind because of this, like I should be so far along the path but I'm still at the beginning. I've always chosen creatively focused subjects and that's both a benefit and a hindrance to myself as I love being creative but haven't got the self esteem to be happy with what I've created.

So to cut to the chase, I'm getting to a point again with my current course where I'm hitting that emotional wall. I find it incredibly difficult to motivate myself to attend but I manage at the moment. I often get there and then leave on a break because it's just too much. I do just sit there in silence though as I find it hard to ask for help. I don't know why, I'm not afraid of them saying no, I think it's more that I'm trying too hard to power through alone.

But yeah,
TLDR; previous struggles with depression, anxiety and motivation have held me back before. This I want it to be different.

350,"For good measure I am a female in high school.

So there is this girl who I met at a performance at school. She seemed to instantly take a liking to me and since then has been making me uncomfortable with not very subtle flirting and close proximity. She seems to follow me around when she can despite being a grade above me, and texts me over. I’ll make her alias “Nicole”.

Nicole has severe anxiety. Really, really severe anxiety. She gets panic attacks really quickly (I’ve witnessed one of hers before, it was one of the worst I’ve seen). 

I’ve already told Nicole that I disliked her flirting and that I probably will say no if she were to ask me out but she’s constantly trying to win me over anyways and I have no clue what to do. 

She texts me very often and I don’t usually reply. She tries to guilt trip me into calling her but I don’t really want to.

We went to the movies once (before I realized she liked me) and she took pictures of me. I’ve asked her to delete them but I’m not sure if she has. 

Nicole also constantly talks about her family situation. Everything we talk about eventually leads to her father being ill. It’s not helping me mentally either, but I don’t want to hurt her so I always listen.

I’m worried that rejecting her so soon will hurt her (she mentioned that she doesn’t want a “no” ‘right now’ whatever that means) but I really don’t like her and I don’t think I ever will.

Is there anyway to stop her without hurting her too much and causing drama?

Im so grateful for my family and everything they have done for me. words cant express how much i love them and how much it breaks my heart how things have come to be. I didnt have much friends growing up as i was bullied in elementary school and middle school by pretty much most of the students and the teachers mostly treated me like garbage. I often found myself alone with my thoughts throughout school. I started acting up a lot with my family and i let out my frustration from school on my younger brother which is the worst thing i could’ve done to him. He barely speaks to me anymore and its been years since ive had a decent conversation with him. I lost all academic motivation so I didn’t complete any school work which birthed more problems with my parents.  besides the on going dilemma with my brother, my parents and I were always arguing as i was the problem child. Since i have social phobia it makes it hard for me to open up to people  because i fear that ill be rejected or made fun of again. It sounds like im being a pussy i know but when people tell you that you’re a worthless piece of shit at a young age every day it tends to stick.  So i feel thats what i became.. a loser.

One time, she was not active, again, and the guy had asked her out on a public discord server. When she did not respond, this guy got pissed. He then texted her about it and she politely declined, because she already had a crush on another guy. This guy got pissed, he started calling her really offensive words, something a 13 year old girl should not be called. If that wasn’t enough, at school, this guy has started to cat-call, stalk, harass and bully her. If I still lived in the city with her, I would do everything I could, but I don’t.

367,"**TLDR:  
Im currently browsing an online supermarket to buy some groceries for a struggling family, but i have no idea what i should buy. What are some essentials i should include? (As a guy, someone said sanitary pads which i never thought about)**  

**Background:**  
Im from a western country and a little bit above average income wise. During my trip to indonesia and malaysia last christmas for holiday i met some friends and with one whom i still talk to every day in indonesia. Shes a math teacher for little kids so obviously likes kids. 

Recently she sent me some pictures of her family and a bunch of kids. One of the kids has a sad story, my friends sister talked to this little girl (7 years) selling tissue packets on a train station and over the course of a couple weeks they got to know this girl and her family. (Initially she didnt buy anything from her as scams happen a lot as well.) They visit the poor family house and asked the kids mother for permission to let this kid join their family gathering to play with the other kids and have a sleepover. 

In non of the pictures this poor kid was smiling while all the other kids have a big smile. My friend told me this kid said she was so happy to sleep in a bed (they sleep on a mat with her siblings at home). Apparently her dad died in an accident and her mother is taking care of 3 kids and their aunt who has cancer. This is a lot of work so this little girl has to help financially by selling tissue packets and makes about 3 euro (3,40 usd) a day which my friends sister now buys them all as the kid didnt accept just money. 

My friend told me she was planning to buy a bed together with her sister for the family and i wanted to chip in. However i dont think it works since their house is very small. This planted the idea of me helping them as well. I dont want to give them money since they didnt accept it in first place and ive heard bad things about giving just money. 

The next best thing is helping them out with groceries, its easy (communication) for me to order online and deliver them to my friend who will give it to the family. Now im browsing the supermarket online and i dont even know what to get them. They dont have a fridge so that rules that out. Im thinking of getting them groceries about once every 2 weeks but depends on how often my friend visits them. 

As for comparison, their rent is 50 euro (56 usd) a month, a mcdonalds meal is 2,81 euro  (3.16 usd) and in my country 8,00 euro (9 usd). 

So my question would be, what should i put in my grocery list for them?",01Apr2019,1

370,"Hi! The title might be a little misleading, but I'm going to explain the issue as good as I can.

Sorry if the text is a little all over the place. I didn't write it at one go. I'll be happy to answer any questions in the comments.

So as of 2014, a person with Proficiency in English degree, could teach English in private sectors, without the need to hold a university degree. A Proficiency of English degree is the highest degree of English obtained in Greece (other than the university one), and it's obtained through exams, and I am the holder of one.

English has always been my passion; It's without a doubt my native tongue (even though I wasn't raised in Greece, a country were English isnt't the main spoken language, so any grammar mistakes in the text are direct translations from Greek), and everyone used to tell me that if I tried hard enough I would become a great English teacher one day.

Thing is, I chose the wrong orientation in school, and somehow I landed a department in computer engineering. While I quite enjoy it, I can tell that it's not my true call.

In 2015, the government changed to the current one, and a year later, the teaching permits you were given with the Proficiency degree were ruled out as ""inadequate"" by the Ministry of Education, and since I was only 16 the year I obtained my degree, I never got the chance to sign up for a teaching permit. Now only the holders of a university degree are allowed to teach in both private and public sectors, while people with a Proficiency degree are seemed as useless by the public eye.

That couldn't be further from the truth.

A Proficiency of English is obtained through exams as I mentioned above; Exams that are difficult and demand years of preparation beforehand. While university degrees are majorly important, and there is no way to argue with that, for people like me, that are not able to sign up for the department of English Language and Literature, there is a lot of injustice for people who want to teach but cannot due to their high school orientation. From my orientation (Economics and Informatics), I can't get in to a different orientation school (in this case, Humanities and Law).

The past couple of months, I have been trying to find a loophole, like obtaining a TEFL, only to find out that even TEFLs are nothing here.

Private education is also a no-go for me, as I'm already studying in another town, so my family's budget is quite low at the moment.

He prescribed me an SSRI when it was clear it had negative effect on me, yet he’s not willing to try another type because “he won’t prescribe me addictive meds”. I don’t know what to do, the only time he has been useful when I exclusively asked him to up my antidepressant dosage (a dopamine reuptake inhibitor) and he obliged.

He’s not a good psychiatrist, or so I think. He hasn’t called me for over a month now, even though I asked him time and time again to check it there’s anything about my anxiety, but there’s nothing. I can’t contact him myself, so I need to wait for the phone call. Now, I know that you might tell me to get another psychiatrist, but I can’t afford a private one, this one works at the hospital so I pay less per visit (even though it’s still around half of my pay (I work part time and am in high school) strictly for one visit), but I can’t change one, so seems like I’m stuck with him. 

My anxiety has worsened since my antidepressants dose was upped, but I can’t stop taking it, since it does help me with my depression. My diagnosis aside from depression and generalised anxiety disorder is social anxiety and PTSD. 

The anxiety has taken a toll on my school performance, as I am unable to present in front of the class, and even if I am, I will end up having a mental breakdown over it beforehand. My anxiety is the biggest problem I have after depression. It makes me unable to socialise normally and I don’t feel comfortable at home, so I rarely leave my room. I just want it to get better and I couldn’t care less about the medication being addictive or not, I’d take being a functional addict over an anxious mess any day.

378,"Hey everyone, sorry for this long and messy post 

Basically I’m studying at uni and living in a dorm room with 2 other girls, one of whom is a very close friend (let’s call her F). Note, this friends works in a popular club and is good friends with her coworkers. About 2-3 weeks ago, she asked me and my other roommate whether one of her male coworkers (let’s call him C) could stay in our room for the night because he had lost his key to his own room (he studies at a different university quite far away from ours). My other roommate (B) and I understood the situation and were perfectly happy to let him stay the night. 

However, one night turned into 2, then into 3, and to this day he is still sleeping in our “living room” on the spare mattress.  F and C regularly invite one of their other coworkers to hang out in the room and smoke (cigarettes and pot), which makes the room smell and which can potentially land all of us in a lot of trouble if we get caught because we are studying abroad in a country which has extremely strict (death penalty-strict) drug laws and could get us deported and expelled from university. 

Furthermore, although F and C are close friends, C makes absolutely no effort to talk or be friendly either B or myself, or any of my other friends who sometimes hang out in my room. Whenever F and I and the rest of our friendship group make plans, he always tags along but never talks to anyone and sits there the entire time on his phone, which none of us appreciate. 

When he’s in the house (most of the time), he tends to order loads of food and leaves the trash all over our living room. He also uses our bathroom and makes a mess, used up all our shampoo/conditioner and didn’t offer to replace it, doesn’t have his own toothbrush and has only 2 changes of clothes (reminder that he has been here nearly 3 weeks). 

C and F have had (loud) sex multiple times on the mattress in the living room, which is now stained and which I no longer want to touch. Although F, myself and one other girl (R) are a very close-knit group of friends, F no longer hangs out with just the 2 of us and instead spends time with C and their other coworkers. R (who is close friends with B) slept over one night when I was out and asked F if they could spend the night together just hanging out &amp; sleep together in the same bed (which they used to do often) and once R fell asleep, F moved to the mattress to sleep with C which R was understandably bitter about. 

B and I have run out of patience and want him out, understandably, since it is our room and we are entitled to our privacy and have a say as to who stays and who doesn’t. 

I want to confront F but there are several things to consider: 
 a) F and C are very close and if I ask F to kick him out, she will be very bitter and hold a grudge
 b) I will be living with her for another year next year and I’m nervous this will make things very awkward
 c) She never listens to me because she’s very stubborn and doesn’t really take me seriously

380,"Hi Reddit, 

I am feeling really anxious about my situation in life right now, and I need some advice. I'm 26, female, and I graduated from a graduate program last year.  I moved back in with my parents and struggled to become gainfully employed for about 8-9 months. I've finally landed a job that's somewhat related to my degree, but it's in my home town. 

**The trouble is, I don't want to stay here**. The city is dull, conservative (a problem if you are not conservative), and I want out. For awhile, I was fantasizing about moving across the country to a more vibrant city, but it feels a bit risky... I have almost 40k of debt (not a huge problem for a Canadian because the govt is forgiving but something to consider), almost no relevant job experience, and I don't speak the languages of the places I am interested in moving to. HOWEVER I work remotely (different from the job I landed recently) and could move anywhere with an income while I find a job related to my degree. My degree is ""international,"" so I could potentially find international organizations to work for in a major city. 

**I also know for sure that I don't want to settle down in my hometown**, so it feels like a waste of time to stay here at my age, if I don't plan to stay here for good. I want to meet someone and build a relationship, but I don't see myself doing that in this city. I would only be staying here for personal finance and career purposes, and that feels like a mistake... but then so does moving somewhere by myself without career prospects and a lot of debt.

**I'm torn between following my dreams and being sensible.** 

Should I move to a different city (Montreal or Berlin)? I could expand my horizons, grow, and put down roots somewhere that I'm fond of. OR should I stay in my hometown, live with my parents, pay off debt and build work experience before making the move? **I will absolutely move eventually, the question is whether I should do it now or in a year or so.** 

Basically this is a question of time, because I feel like I want to ""start"" my life now, meet someone, make friends in a city that I like. I feel like by staying, I'm wasting valuable time in my youth that I could be using to reach my non-financial and career-related goals (which are more important to me). By leaving, I'm risking my career and financial security.

Which option should I pursue?

**TL;DR: 26 F trying to decide between moving away from hometown and staying for another year. Single, master's degree, 40k debt, job lined up in hometown, but hate hometown, itching to set down roots somewhere else.**

Would really appreciate any help or insight, particularly from older and wiser redditors...

I see couples that can’t go a single day without telling each other this. His actions do show that he loves me, he does things and goes out of his way and really really cares about me, but he can’t say those words.

I’ve been really patient about it but I have an internal fear that I’m spending all this time and have fallen so deeply in love with someone only to find out years later that they don’t feel the same and they never did. It’s an insecurity that is beginning to fester into a fear/anxiety. 

It hurts me, it really does, I feel rejected all the time, I feel like I’ve had this beautiful relationship for 7 months that means a lot more to me than it does to him.

386,"Sorry for the long background first..

I used to be able to smoke pot everyday all day if I wanted. It helped me relax, and enjoy myself more. 

But a little while back, near the end of my individual use of pot, I had the worst panic attack I’ve ever had. Out of the blue. For a while I didn’t know what was going on, because that “bad trip” had shaken me for days after. 
Whenever I’d try to smoke again it put me well worse into a horrible daily dissociation. 

I can’t smoke pot (THC, at least that I know of. I’ve been too scared to try CBD) and I know that pot eventually triggered depersonalization and derealization for me. 
I’d say it’s been a few years now I haven’t smoked how I used to. And I’m still affected by depersonalization/derealization. 
Sure it may has gotten “easier” to deal with. But I still can often times find myself feeling like I’m somewhere else. Or just not real. 

Realizing now how dependent I sort of was with pot. 
I’ve missed getting high A LOT. 
I’ve used pain killers for a buzz and I used to drink really hard. Tho I’m not proud. 
My boyfriend smokes pot all day, and it really makes me itch to get high again. 
And I’ve found that sobriety is boring, or uncomfortable, or I’m horribly nervous anyway. 

I think once in a video someone was talking about DP and pot usage and they said something like 
“If you let your buddy drive your car, and he crashes it, you probably shouldn’t let him drive it again” 

I know pot works differently for everyone. But since I react this way, am I really unable to smoke pot again, and use it like I used to? ",01Apr2019,1

389,"A few months back, my best friend had an abortion. She went to court to get an approval for it since she couldn’t get her parents’ approval because they are extremely against abortion. We managed to do all of this without them finding out and everything went smoothly. 

Recently, she had her phone taken away because her parents went through her texts and found out about it. The reason I’m worried about it is because her father is a diagnosed sociopath and is emotionally abusive. He’s an alcoholic and does drugs (according to my friend). Her parents kicked her out of the house and I haven’t heard from her since Friday. One of her friends told me that her dad came to pick her up and took her back home, so I don’t know what he’s done with her. 

I texted her last night, thinking she got her phone back, and her dad responded instead. To basically sum it up, he said he is going to speak to his attorney and see what legal actions can be taken against all parties involved (AKA me and probably the boy who got her pregnant). I’m not too worried about having anything happen to me because getting an abortion is legal AND we got court approval for this exact reason. 

I’m really worried about her and her mental health and safety. She’s very depressed and anxious and I can’t even be there for her when she needs me the most because I have no way of getting in touch with her. I’m planning on talking to social services at my school whenever I get the opportunity to see what can be done. I cannot talk to my parents about this because they’re also really against abortion — they don’t even know I took her to get it. However, they do know she’s been kicked out and they’re more than happy to let her stay with us for a few days.

393,"So basically the premise is in the topic title.... PM english is not my first language. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I read a book when I was 14 about physics I loved physics. I loved the stories the implications and I understood (I think) what the true beauty is about it. I excelled at school in math and physics (and biology) and had a perfect score when I ended high school in Math. However I doubted really strongly that I could do physics, because in my head people who studied physics were probably way smarter then me. I also I didn't want to be seen as a nerd (bad motivation I know). My parents also pressured me into not doing physics and I choose my second idea: medicine. 

I like medicine also a lot and I have been a doctor for some years. I love my job, love learning about the body and cracking cases. I dont really like the stressful job times and it can be quite physical demanding. 

During my medicine studies I tried doing some physics courses and the first time I did an exam in a physics course I was shaking in happiness (I was 22 I think). I really tried doing physics next to medicine, but my internships already started and I had to be in the hospital from 9 to 5. Studying in the evening for medicine AND physics was too much. I let go of physics.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now financially in a good situation. Physics is still nagging in my head. People often say I should join medicine and physics love by become nuclear medicine physicist, but I just want to do theoretical physics. I know it sounds bad, but only theoretical physics is my main interest. I like all physics, but I want to truly understand the principles. I love teaching as well and would like to become a teacher on a university. 

&amp;#x200B;

However... if I now stop working and start studying physics I will throw away my medicine career. At the point I am now I should choose for a medical specialty, do a PhD or start profilering more in my career. If I quit now I will pass this point. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second problem is that in my country they don't allow you to study a second study if you finished your first. Well they allow you but at truly insane rates. I don't have the money for that, and I don't want to go extremely in debt for the study because I am afraid I can't pay it off in the future (because job uncertainty as a theoretical physicist). The option is that I go study 500 km away in a different country where they allow second studies for really low prices, I can easily pay that for a couple of years without working. This will be very difficult for my girflriend, who is still studying in my place, she cant transfer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. The most safe and best bet is to stay a doctor and profilare my carreer. I will have less worreis in life. If I stop it is a true gamble, what if after studying phsyics I cant find a job as a theoretical phsyscist. Also I need to emigrate.

394,"My friend got pretty drunk and half an hour ago admitted to me that they drank a bunch of sleeping pills. When asked how much exactly they say they don't remember.   
They were depressed for a while now, however we joke about suicide a lot to deal with suicidal thoughts (I myself tried to overdose before too). However, today was a pretty bad day for them, and I blame myself for leaving them alone, since I had to run some errands. I thought maybe some alone time would be helpful for them, since I know I would want to be left alone when I'm in such state. Probably shouldn't have judged based on myself... Thing is, possible suicide attempt didn't even occur to me, since their suicide attempts happened years ago, but nowadays they did get drunk a few times to deal with horrible days and then went to sleep, and it would be the worst of it. However, today, when I came back, they said they said they took a bunch of pills after drinking alcohol. It's kind of difficult to tell, if they were serious or not, since they sarcastically talk about overdosing a lot. When I asked how much, they backtracked. ""Can't remember. Not that much. It's fine. I don't know. It's not really any strong pills.""  
I'm not sure what to do. I do recognize these words, since I also admitted to someone after trying to overdose the same day. Just tried to tell that, got an angry reaction, backtracked, then woke up next morning unable to get up. So I tried not to overreact, but at the same time, since they talk about that so much I'm not sure if they really did take a lot of sleeping pills, or not.  
At any rate, it's not what matters. No matter how many pills they took, they still took them, I think it is highly likely. I guess I'm just hoping at the back of my mind that it was just their regular doze of sleeping pills, and they're being sarcastic again...  
The problem is, we're in a completely foreign country, heck, I don't even own a phone number to call an ambulance, and I wouldn't be able to communicate properly even if I could call anyone. Finances for hospital are also worrying, and plus I don't want to overreact and make things worse for them, if they really didn't overdose on anything horrible.

395,"I started working at a law office in July, but I'm very familiar with my boss because my mom worked for him for about ten years and he would occasionally pay me in high school to do filing and cleaning for him. He did my mom's divorce from my dad so I've known him since I was about two years old. When I started in July, another girl was here who had been here for not quite a year when I came in. Things were really great at first. We texted constantly, loved each other's presence and got along really great. 

Well, I knew that she didn't have a lot of money because she was working two jobs because her husband refuses to work. They have two teenaged daughters. I began offering to give her rides on my lunch break to run her errands just to save a little bit of gas money for her. She had to take gas money daily to her mother-in-law to go pick her girls up from school, and then take her husband a goody powder.

Turns out I was unknowingly taking her to get suboxone from her mother in law and then taking her to give it to her husband. I knew he was an addict, but she did not disclose to me what we were doing. I am in the process of getting my social work license. My husband is a cop. Had we been caught, this would have fucking ruined both or our careers.

I bought all of her children’s Christmas gifts (about $400 worth) because she was broke and I had a little extra. Her husband claimed that I just wanted something from her and she told me that her children hated about half of the gifts. Complained because a $50 sweater I bought her daughter wasn't the right shade of gray. She never paid me back for the gift we bought for our boss for Christmas despite the fact that she got $7000 back for her tax refund and it was only $20 that she owed me. I never asked to be paid back for the Christmas situation and I never would, because I try to partake in a charitable act every Christmas season. She is constantly poor mouthing because she has no money because her husband refuses to work and I would give her ten dollars here and there to help her, despite the fact that she makes more money than I do (fortunately, my husband works so technically I guess together we make more money, but still). Turns out she really has no money because she is funding his suboxone addiction. In January, she had a miscarriage and I tried to be extremely supportive because I have had two miscarriages of my own and I know that it is a difficult time. All I got was being shut out and even being snapped at when I tried to give her advice on maybe receiving some mental health treatment, because she constantly jokes about death and suicide. She knows that I suffer from Bipolar type 2 and made several comments about me being on ""brain candy"" which I finally called her out on. I then apologized for getting upset about it, but things have been very different since then.

All this with the suboxone just happened two weeks ago. Now she treats me like I'm the villain because I told her I couldn't give her rides anymore. She and I are the only two employees in the attorney's office that we work for and I have to deal with this until I'm done with school next year. I have told her of the risk she is taking and the situation she put me in, but she doesn't understand the gravity of the situation... At all. I'm a lot more pissed than I'm letting on and I'm not sure if I should let my boss know that she is, essentially, running drugs for her husband. In addition to that, she has the two daughters and I almost feel obligated to report the drug activity to child protective services because of my almost degree in social work. I don't want to ruin her life.... I just want her to understand the gravity of the situation. Am I being too involved?

The cops said that this was ridiculous and couldn't do anything to me but she doesn't understand that. We have gotten into physical fights where she will hit me and i will defend myself and hit her back and there have been times where she has taken my house keys from me and kicked me out of my house in 10 degree weather. My dad is paying for the rent and my parents have bought and paid for everything so i guess she basically owns me. I have made around 3k from working over the summer but she took that money from me saying that i owe her for everything she has done for me. Recently, she has said that she will go to family court and evict me and has even followed me from class to class to make sure I attend. This is playing an immense toll to my mental health and the police have said that I can get her arrested and have a restraining order placed so that she cannot come to campus but when I told her she said ""don't worry I have ways to get you back"". That scared the shit out of me because she is capable of doing anything. I am 20 years old, should i get her arrested?",01Apr2019,3
409,"I’m in my mid-twenties and just graduated college a few months ago. That’s all well and good, but the last couple years were really rough in the mental health department, and honestly, I’m still having lots of trouble. I’ve always been a fairly driven person with hopes and dreams that I worked hard for. I applied and got into a couple wonderful internships and won a few awards while in school, but I cannot for the life of me even apply for a job now. I feel like I’m paralyzed in life and that I’m losing myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I started seeing a therapist a couple years ago because I have trouble connecting with people and making friends. I have never even gone on a date before. She diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, and perfectionism. I’m also dealing with lots of negative self-talk and intense self-criticism. I constantly call myself a “loser” and a “worthless piece of shit.” During my last few semesters of school and during my internships, I always felt like I was letting my mentors down and disappointing them. This has been extremely difficult for me because I look up to my mentors and respect them so much. They are amazing people.

&amp;#x200B;

I never completely finished my honors thesis, and have been meaning to get it done, but it’s just so hard to overcome my mental barriers. My therapist says that my mentors are not disappointed in me, I just feel that way because of my extreme self-criticism. Even if that’s true though, I just can’t shake the feeling that they are disappointed in me and that I failed them. I’ve written a few thank you letters that I should’ve sent to them many months ago, but again, I’m having trouble even doing that. I feel like there’s nothing that I could ever say or do that would ever repay them for all the kindness they showed me or all of the knowledge they shared with me. I feel like I’m not worthy to have them as a part of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

By sheer luck, I’ve been accepted into a couple friend groups within the last year, and they have been my only solace. When I’m with them, I don’t feel like a loser or a disappointment. I don’t think about my future or past. I’m just there enjoying being with them. I haven’t told them about any of this of course. I’m a relatively quiet, reserved, and socially awkward person and often feel like I don’t deserve to be in their company, and that they could ditch me at any moment. But I appreciate each and every one of them so damn much. I don’t know what I would do without them. For the past while, the only time I’ve been happy is when I’m with them.

&amp;#x200B;

So since I’ve graduated, I’ve been unemployed and living with my parents. I spend my days reading reddit posts, researching interests online, and listening to music. I wait in despair until the next opportunity arises to spend time with my friends and be happy. I feel so pathetic and that I’m a burden. I’m ashamed that I’m not able to overcome this. Every time I think I’ve hit the lowest low, I fall deeper.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I feel paralyzed in life and don’t know what to do or how to move forward. I need to apply for jobs, but I’m just having so much trouble doing so. I feel like such a disappointment and a loser.",01Apr2019,3

Since then I've been working a home health aide job that doesn't pay shit and I maybe work a solid 13 hrs a week. I have no skills at all. I'm not good at anything, and believe me I've tried so many things just to look stupid. I had friends but being the only one without kids makes shit kinda awkward. I dont have the same conversations or mindsets as them at all. The guy im with is just hot headed as fuck.

I'm lost, and don't know how to pick myself up. I've applied for over 200 jobs just between last year and this year and I'm using Obama phones just to do that. Our toan has no public transportation.

A little less than a month ago I got a DUI. Had to spend the night in jail. It sucked. 
And then, about a week ago, I totaled my car while driving drunk. Cops showed up, and had to spend the night in jail again. Now I’m on probation.

He told me to get the fuck out of the house. I’m now at my friends house living there. I have no car, and practically no way to get to work except a bus that is a hell of a long walk to get to.

414,"I had financed a 2014 whiteToyota Corolla S two years ago. It was a terrible financial decision in the long run. I had gotten laid off 9 months after getting the car. I still owe about 11,900 dollars on the car. It has about 71,120 miles. I had gotten it at about 50k miles. I can not afford the car, and all this money I’m pouring into the car takes away from the opportunity to move out or make payments for other bills since the car payments and insurance alone is too much in itself (not including car taxes, etc.). The only way I can get rid of the car is if the entire balance of the car is paid off. Otherwise, if I don’t make any payments or I give it up the bank takes back the car, sell it for whatever it can be worth and then I still have to pay the remaining balance. When I had gotten the car, I had great credit so they financed it at a low rate. Meaning, the bank isn’t willing to change the payment plans now because of how low I got it when I initially got the car. I’m stuck.

I’ve been in excruciating pain for at least a month. I’m on tramadol for the pain, so sorry if I’m a little fuzzy.  My insurance will only cover tooth extractions which breaks my heart. My teeth are so nice looking but five molars need root canals or an extraction. 

I scheduled to have them all extracted one a week for a month, but OF COURSE my insurance has a one month lapse and I cannot have work done until MAY.  The pain is so bad I was trying to hurt myself, and my roommate took me to the er. They are not dentists there obviously, so they just prescribed me tramadol and told me to get to a dentist soon as possible. This was very out of character for me but the pain can be a 10/10. 

I’m on antibiotics for the infection, but I’m wondering how bad the infection is getting. Possibly related to the infection, I’ve only peed a few times in the past two days and have chills and a fever.   I broke down and scheduled an appointment today. I’m planning on paying out of pocket for at least one of them to be extracted. 

My main question is...Should I have more extracted?? I will be maxing out my cards if I have more than one pulled, and as a women in her 20’s this is SO devastating. Should I wait for the rest until May when they are covered by insurance?? I’ll scared to look in the mirror if I do all five at once, but I don’t want to die from sepsis or some blood infection over vanity. I don’t have long to decide 😬 (and then I need to try to get partial dentures as well 😭)   This whole thing is a nightmare, and I just want to know anyone’s opinion on… Any of this?

As the title says, im homeschooled. 

Ive been homeschooled since third grade. Im now a senior. [17, F]

A ton of life changing events have happened in the last six months, resulting in me moving 900 miles away from my home, and living with other people.

Anyways, 

I started making a friend, and things went a bit further than ""friends"", really quickly. This friend then broke things off, and is now ghosting me. 

I was finally building confidence in talking to people, as I was the one who took control of that situation and asked for his info, etc. So this really took a massive blow to all of that. I was so excited and proud of myself for reaching out to other people.

Now, im left by myself again, really upset and struggling. 

I dont know where to go from here. 

I have apps like yubo and spotafriend but I feel like nothing will come from that. 

I just.. dont know where to go, or how to start. 
Due to life things thats been happening over the past 6 months, i still have no ID or liscence. I cant get a job without an I.D and as of now, it looks like thats a ways-a-way. 

Im interning at an art studio, but there really arent many other people there, and I cant go really anywhere else as the location is convenient. 

Im in the Charleston area, so theres definitely plenty of things to do, but, I just dont know how to start, and I feel like its weird or creepy to just walk up to someone and be like ""Hey!"" Is it not?

Ive joined art classes before, but again, nothing really comes from them, or the people arent my age. 

All in all, im at a loss. 

Im desperate at this point, really. 

Any advice would genuinely be amazing.

418,"Thing is, I had this crush on this girl who was important to me in my life, but she does not see me
the same way nor would I want her to. To her, I’m just one of those guys from high school who was funny and interesting to talk to. However, the way I see it, the moments I spent with her were some of the best in my life and probably among the most important to. At a time when everyone else alienated me, she was the one who was willing to talk to me with much more respect than everyone else did and even helped me become one of the popular kids in high school. Despite any conflict I had with her, she was still able to talk to me when most people would just say nothing instead.

Now, even two years of not seeing her, I still think about her everyday and even visit her profiles very often too. She doesn’t even live near me either anymore. I go to a business school in New York City while she’s attending a dentistry program in Florida. Trying to contact or make convo with her always seems really out of place as we do not have common interests or goals.

420,"So on 3/20 I and my girlfriend (let's call her Jamie) broke up (I was the one who did it). And in those ten days, I went through a couple of people, no one made me feel loved like she did. And I realized why, when I was growing up whenever I would go to my mom and say something like, ""mom, look!"" she would say something like, ""I'm busy, leave me alone"" but when I would go to my dad and say the same thing the would look and be amazed, and that is how I need to be hurt and loved at the same time to feel loved. (It's a scientific study, and the conclusion is something like this, ""if you don't like a person, its because they don't torture you in the way for you to feel loved""). And I realized this and left the person I started dating because I wasn't feeling love, she was head over heels with me and I just didn't feel anything. And I went back to Jamie, after some talking and convincing she took me back (this was on 3/26). It was great, all the feelings came flooding back, I missed her, so so much. However, there was this friend... (let's call him Chris) a dude from Atlanta, and she was always glued to her phone, talking to Chris. Then it was just Chris this Chris that, always glued to her phone. Not to mention, she took some really seductive pictures (not nudes, but like a sexy mirror pic showing her legs off). Furthermore, last night she didn't want to take a shower with me, and I wake up this morning, and something in my head tells me she was showering with someone else, I ask her about it and nevertheless, she said yeah she was on call with fucking Chris ""just talking and laughing at memes"" in the fucking shower?!? Yeah right. I just don't know how I feel about this. I also have problems with paranoia, I'm so used to people leaving that I'm 24/7 freaking out that she will leave me because she is the last thing I have, and if I bring it up and ask her for something like a screenshot she says no because I'm being ""nosy"".

Everything in my life has gone wrong and not a single good thing has ever happened to me.  Studied two university degrees in IT and business and most recently studied a Diploma of Nursing to be a qualified EN. 

But of course that diploma seems to have been a waste of time since apparently graduate nurses can't find work and a big part of it is because my Australia's government has imported a horde of foreign nurses from Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and South East Asia. Grads are going to England in a attempt to find work.

Here's a another thing I absolutely hate nursing when I studied it. On every single practical I went on I was overly stressed and miserable. I only stuck with it due a hope I would  find something I enjoyed about it. That also I led to believe it was possible to make a reliable career out it. 

Another thing I have never had a GF, not once has a woman ever shown any form of interest  I of course have  my height to thank for this since my height of 5'3"" marks me as a genetic dead end. The only advantage I would have in relationship with a girl at my age with my lack of experience. Is that I would know she is settling and to be not surprised when she cheats and just accept it when it happens.

As employment desperately trying to find work. But I know at my age and that fact I'm white male it is working against me. Plus there is the halo effect meaning my height means I'm  automatically seen as incompetent

428,"Hi reddit, so I started living with my flatmate(fm/he) in September when I moved here to carry on my second year of uni. I found him through my girlfriend as we all study the same course in the same year and she lived here the year prior. Recently he's been causing tensions between myself, my girlfriend (gf) and her friend (f). fm hasn't had a girlfriend ever and was kinda desperate, now gf and f are both christians and go to church every Sunday, I go with them because I find it interesting and enjoy talking witht the pople there. One Sunday we thought we'd invite fm to be kind since he was on his own and then I said I'd cook dinner for the 4 of us (we used to take it in turns between the flats for who would cook). 

From this point things started getting weird. He would start talking more to f and being overly friendly to her while being more hostile to me and gf, little things at first like refusing to help make tea or wash up, leaving his washing in the washing machine, etc, but played it off as forgetfulness when I brought it up. Anyway just before Xmas he confessed his ""love"" to f when gf was about to drive me and f and herself home for the holidays. f told him that shes not into him and that because her parents are quite strict and orthadox they wouldn't permit such a relationship with a ""non-believer"". Fro here we agreed that only me and gf will cook together to give some space between fm and f as well as deciding to nolonger split the shoppng with f as he ate most of the food I bought on his own that I got to eat, so I would spend more than him.

From here he began  getting weird, he would go round to the girls flat unannounced to spend time with f, wait around at uni for her, message her often and buy her gifts. He also preceeded to confess his love 3 more times each time with her saying she didnt want a relationship with him. I tried to have a conversation with him about the situation which only made things worse. He hordes the cooking utensials, refuses to clean the flat or help, locks me out when I go to work and keeps me up most nights (I start work at 4am btw), he runs to the shower everytime before me causing me to have to get up earlier to play out the game, while keeping up his old habits. Additionally as we work on a group project in uni together he does very little on that. f has also been getting it rough with him guilt tripping her in to coming over for tea with him, inviting himself over to theirs for tea, getting irritable and stroppy when she is revising for exams (she does a different subject to f, gf and myself) which only amplifies the effects.

f continues to tell him she doesnt like him but he continues to pull his stunts. The difficult thing is the three of us (me, gf and f) have planned a trip abroad this September and he caught wind of it on one of his unnanounced visits while we were discussing flights and invited himself. As a consequence he is trying to take over, dictating what we are to do, where to go, what hotels I have to book, how we are splitting the cost of things i.e. because his insurance cost more than ours we should pay more on transport, splitting meals evenly regardless of what we order and worst of all the sleeping arrangements, in which he gets the best room and f ""can share if she wants"". 

We want to tell him hes off the trip and that non of us like him. And make sure he doesnt harass f any more. But he doesnt get the message about f and I dont want to piss him off as I still have to share a house with him for a year and a half!

I have consistently been a second choice friend since elementary school. The only times I ever talk to or hang out with people are at school and even then its only when I'm pretty much the only one around. I have actually hung out with friends once this year and three times over the past few, and I am made painfully aware of this on a weekly almost daily basis when I see snaps and stories of friends hanging out together. I used to try and initiate stuff, for just about all of freshman year I'd always suggest things to do and try and text friends but every attempt I made failed and I just gave up. Now I'm at a point where I'm just so socially out of practice that I can only hold conversations about school stuff in person and am just totally unaware about how to text with people. I don't feel like I have any way I can approach anyone about this because then I would not know if any invitation or conversation was because they wanted me around or because they pity me. I don't have any close relationship at all so their is no adult I can talk to about this. I go to an all boys school with small class sizes so its not like I could just make new friends because everything is already established, and its not like I could make friends with people who live around me because I live in a secluded suburb that is 99% elementary school aged kids.

After that things went downhill pretty quick, I began using for personal use ( but would write down what I used to remind myself to pay her back). Apparently I racked on 1500$ without keeping track, and she’s now cancelled the card and is in the process of getting a return on the money. 

 I guess the advice I need is deciding on weather I should be a adult and fess up to my wrong doing &amp; be truthful to her or see how it plays out and if I’ll need to say anything at all.  ",01Apr2019,1
437,"I have a very difficult relationship with my parents - this is even more so true with my mom. The difficulty with my dad is mainly how much he backs up my mom even when she's wrong. There have been so many issues and arguments over the years that when I think about writing it all down, I feel extremely overwhelmed and exhausted. My mom always had a bit of a difficult personality - stubborn, controlling, and always thought she was right about everything, but there was some kind of a boundary. At least once things cooled off she could be reasoned with. She is not a bad person. She is a very loving, giving, creative and compassionate person in many ways. I truly believe that she thinks she always tries to do what's best for me and my sister and our family, but over the past few years things have gotten SIGNIFICANTLY worse. Stubbornness turned to complete lack of respect. She just does not listen to us whatsoever. A lot of the arguments are about my 2 year old daughter and how I want certain things to be done when she's around my daughter. She literally tells me that she doesn't care what I think (those exact words) and that she knows better. It's come to a point where I started threatening that I will not bring my daughter around anymore. My mom can get extremely emotional... and sometimes over things that make no sense. She will start hysterically crying when I tell her she can't come over because I have plans and I won't move plans around for her. She basically starts hysterically crying no matter what. At first I would sit there and calm her down and try to make things better, but now it's more annoying than anything. I feel like I'm being emotionally manipulated and I can't tell if she's doing it on purpose or not.   
The main reason why I feel like it's not on purpose is because I've seem her have strong emotional outbursts over things that have nothing to do with me. We recently lost my grandmother who was basically my mom's best friend. All of this has been happening for a few years so before my grandmother passed away, but both my sister and I feel as though my grandma knew how to keep my mom somewhat calmer. My grandma has told me in the past that my mom would mention very depressive thoughts. I don't think she ever straight out expressed suicidal thoughts, but she would say things like ""No one would care if I wasn't here. No one loves me."" My sister and I have tried many times to get her to go see a therapist and she even did it one time and said it was uncomfortable and she won't do it again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is an important part of this whole thing. My mom has had two mini-strokes in the past few years. She's had chronic hypertension since her early 20s. This led her to speak with a neurologist. The neurologist did an MRI  and I don't know all the details but he basically told my mom that her brain seems like it has aged significantly past her own age. I have no idea what that means exactly but it doesn't sound good. He wanted her to come back for more tests and to talk things over, but she got scared and never went back again. I've tried many times to get her to go back and get checked out and even made an appointment with a different neurologist and she simply didn't go. She's refusing to face the facts that something might be wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the advice that I need here is, how do you get someone to realize that something isn't mentally okay with them and they might need some help? Be it a therapist, neurologist, I don't know. I just know something is not right. Sometimes her emotional responses to pretty mundane situations are what I would think would be considered a manic state. I've never had to deal with something like this before so I could be wrong. But I know enough to know it scares me. I'm not looking for a medical diagnosis, just a way to get my mom to seek some professional, medical help. Thank you in advance!",01Apr2019,1

He has a therapist he sees often and HR knows he is in benzo withdrawal.

439,"So here’s the situation (please take the time to read, I’m desperate): 

A while back I got an app which was supposed to connect me to native language speakers to help me learn their language. A lot of people message me, and the convo usually dies quickly so I never take it seriously, but this one time, I met a guy who was willing to teach me the language I was learning, and usually when I’m talking to people on there I try to keep it professional and not personal, but this one guy really seemed to want to be friends. So now time skip to a couple of weeks after, I have him on iMessage and we text a lot. Rarely about language. I’ve become okay with the fact that he’s a friend, and I do enjoy talking to him, but lately, I’ve realized something is wrong. A couple days ago he asked me if I had a boyfriend, and I was lowkey having a mental breakdown because I’ve had similar situation like this one that haven’t really ended up too well, and so I told him I did, and he got really angry. Making me feel guilty, telling me he won’t talk to me anymore, etc.. and at first I didn’t really think much about it and just told him I was joking and forgot about it, mostly because I didn’t really take our relationship seriously. He was just some guy, thirsty for a gf probably. He mentioned that he felt really jealous and angry. I mentioned that I was in a conversation with a guy and he told me to stop. and now, sometimes almost demands that I show him affection. Asking me things like “you do like talking to me right? Say it please”. And like I said, I didn’t think much of it so I obliged, and he seemed super happy and fluttery after I did. just recently he started to send me personalized pictures of him, of drawings, of his work place, etc.. and now, he had just sent me a picture of a drawing that said my name in bold letters that he hung up on his wall. That’s when I started to realize this was more serious than I thought. He sent me a text telling me that I’m his everything, followed by a paragraph talking about how he’s never been this close to anyone before. We’ve never even met, and he acts like we’re in a relationship. I’ve never once told him that I share mutual feeling. Ive also never told him that i would go to his country but he acts like I am, and constantly tells me that he’s exited and he’s already planning for the day I come, and when I told him I don’t think I’m going, he told me that he would come to me then. I’ve tried to discourage it but he won’t stop acting this way. I know I can just block him but I don’t think that’s a good idea considering his feelings towards me, I feel that it would affect him a lot. He’s too emotionally connected to me, so who knows what he might do if I did do that. Please help. ",01Apr2019,2
440,"Throwaway account d/t D(ear)H knows my actual Reddit. 

NSFW due to some of the graphic nature of post. Maybe not, but better safe then deleted. 

TLDR: I am having pain during sex while pregnant. I need help finding different ways to help me out. Before you comment thought, please read for context. 

Okay, so I’ve never had pain during sex. Ever. For nine years, it’s been great with DH. Any position is fine and we are perfectly matched in the sizing/fitting of genitalia. I’m not looking for a medical diagnosis (that’s for the bot overlord). 

I’m 21 weeks pregnant and last night was one of the worst nights of my life in the sex arena with DH. We utilize many different positions usually but we usually start missionary. Even a few weeks ago, we did this and I had no problem. But now it hurts. I figure it’s due to the added pressure of tiny baby and my uterus and all that. But other positions were hurting too. I felt turned on, there was foreplay etc. We were doing all the things to cater to my body and such. And I had to stop. By then, DH was upset and left because he thought I wasn’t into it. Which I was, but libido tanks a little while pregnant. 

I felt terrible. I still do. I want DH to be satisfied because my libido was close to nil for a long time (aka first trimester). I was sobbing because I felt so bad. And the other day I caught my body in the mirror before I got into the shower. I was very fit pre baby. I’m gaining the appropriate amount of weight, but I don’t recognize myself. I don’t feel sexy or attractive at all. So this doesn’t help in the bedroom at all. 

I guess I’m curious if there are other pregnant ladies or parents or husbands who this has happened to and what was done to help. I want to continue to have sex with my husband. We love each other so much and I don’t want him to think that this is the way it’s going to be post baby. I’m very dedicated to my husband and my marriage. I have these destructive thoughts about him not finding me attractive anymore or seeing someone else, which is totally bogus. 

Please note: I understand that my body is changing. I understand that things are different inside my body. I really do. Please don’t comment that “well dear, you need to adjust what you do.” I know this. What I’m looking for is help doing it. Other peoples experiences. 

Also I’m sure that this belongs in more specific subs, but to hit as many people as possible, I put this here.

443,"A little bit of background...

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger all I wanted to do was study classical piano, though I wasn't good enough to make a living as a performer.  In college, I realized I would probably have to be a university professor in order to make decent money, as there aren't too many other options.  Fast forward today, I have a Master's Degree and have been accepted to some Doctoral Piano Performance programs, although with no teaching assistantships or funding of any kind. I'm now beginning to rethink the trajectory of my career.

&amp;#x200B;

The market for music professors is apparently shrinking, and jobs are extremely competitive.  Although I believe myself to be competent, skilled, and musically knowledgeable, I feel the road to professorship is an uphill battle.  I don't want to spend the next 5+ years first as a student, teaching piano to children who have no desire to learn to barely make ends meet and spend the remainder of my free time practicing piano, then as a person with advanced degrees but lacking experience to make me employable.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized this isn't the life I want for myself.  I don't want to stay on this long and difficult path just for a university professor's salary (which I might not get until my late 30's, which I might have to move across the country to, and then that could all be lost of I dont end up tenured).  Although I was never a hard worker before college, I have always been told I'm intelligent, scored highly on all standardized testing, part of gifted children's programs in elementary school etc.  So I want to enter a new field.  One where I won't be living paycheck to paycheck in a 1 bedroom apartment well into my thirties.  I am ready to work my ass off, but I have basically zero relevant experiences.  Here's what I've done for work in my life:

&amp;#x200B;

Ski Instructor, Summer Camp Counselor, Barista, Restaurant Cook, Delivery Driver, Cashier, Piano Instructor.

&amp;#x200B;

I no longer want to do what I love because I don't see it as a viable option, and I'm ready to learn to love anything I have to do.  I pride myself in the ability to find interest in even the most mundane activities.  Right now, I'm looking for cheap cities to live in and just applying for any and all jobs that I think might take me, even if I appear unqualified. I'm currently living on the east coast of the US and need to get out of here. I won't be able to move until the fall, but I'm hoping to have employment set up by then because I really can't afford to be out of work for too long.  By the way, I have no debt thanks to family money, but I am trying to be cut off and just make my way alone (mutual decision). 25 years old, by the way.

446,"So my sister (12F) was put in a group project with three other girls. Let’s call them A,B and C. 

They had to bake some stuff to bring to school and raise money for something. My sister did the most work, ABC came to our house and left a mess, left the project for my sister to bring to school, and paid 10$ each. My sister paid 24$. Thus, the other girls owe her $3.30 each.  However, they’re refusing to pay her back and I’ve seen the text messages and they’ve even been insulting her by calling her a fucking bitch, etc because she expected them to pay her back what they owe. They’re so stupid they think since they paid “30$ and my sister put in $24 that she owes ABC $14” like what the fuck is math? The total was $54 my sister put in 24 (which I paid for anyways) and they put in $10 ea. Therefore my sister paid $14 more and divided by four it splits to $3.30 ea which is what they should all pay my sister.

What am I supposed to do here? I told my sister that I would come to her bus stop in the morning and deal with these girls before school when I’m off work and set them straight.

449,"So, in short, I lead a fairly interesting life that has so far led to me ‘dying’ twice (once was hypothermia where my heart rate became undetectable and once was a drowning requiring CPR); I’ve been held at gunpoint 3 times, and not so bad but I’ve sustained a minor brain injury (doctors disagreed whether it was an extremely severe concussion or a considerably minor brain injury).

As a result of the above - and arguably the cause - I “live pretty fast”. My work and hobbies all entail climbing, kayaking, lots of global travel etc. When I’m not working or adventuring I drink a lot, party a lot, have a lot of sex with a lot of partners and do a lot of stimulating drugs (much more of a coke and MDMA man than a weed smoker etc).

I started looking for the job as soon as it became legally possible. Meantime, I was happy to have an international contract (name it ""marketing consulting on the contract basis"") which helped us to survive during the first year.All the time I had an idea of pretty bright future in my mind (and that's the reason why we wanted to move to the US). I was sure that my eight years of experience in marketing (including over three years of management) made me a good start for the American career. However, it's been a year since then and I am still looking for a job. I applied for hundreds of positions, had a dozen of interview maximum, but still...

After my contract had ended, I had to look for any job and ended with a warehouse worker. Minimum wage, 60 h/week, no sick days, no vacations. I suppose it's almost a zero chance to find a professional job with my foreign education and experience.

I was considering apply in college majoring in accounting (since it's almost impossible to compete in marketing) and pursuing a CPA, which means a huge expense and who knows what chance of being employed with a fair salary. On the other hand, recently I learned that one of the major carriers hire drivers who get around $100k/y after two years, having a union, sick days, paid vacations and insurance.

(new Reddit account because my friends from school know my real username - I don't want them to know about this)

I'm 16, male.

Just to give some context, I have important public exams in about a month's time, and right now I'm on holiday for a few weeks. These holidays are set out to be used for revision for these exams, as well as a break from school, obviously. However, I'm also enrolled in an online school for math and physics, from which I get some theory and problems to solve each month. I've been heavily behind schedule for this online school, due my own inability to sit down and do the problems properly, in addition to the exam preparation that we've been doing in class at the regular school. Despite that school being one of the most prestigious in the UK, my father takes my efforts for granted (I'm definitely above average at the school), and expects me to be the best (in my year group) in certain subjects such as math.

As the holidays have just begun and I have no longer the escape of school life, my father has more control over me than ever. He can just say ""do this, otherwise I will confiscate your computer/turn off WiFi"". He took my phone two days ago, although I've found it since then (using mobile data right now because internet access is blocked) - I'll replace it when I see him returning back home. He turned off internet to all my devices this morning, because I didn't upload my solutions to the online school soon enough after waking up. He has taken my computer after I alluded to exploiting the neighbor's WiFi network for internet access. Now he's asking me to mop the floor, which I refuse to do since I have nothing left to lose at this point (I'll lose all outside contact if he moves the phone, but I don't think he knows that I know where it is), apart from my Nintendo Switch, which I have learnt to keep well hidden.

I feel like trash. I'll have to submit to my father at some point, unless I want to spend the rest of the holidays with nothing. What should I do? Is this serious enough to call Childline or talk to the therapists that are sometimes available at my school? Sometimes I really want someone to talk to, when I get manipulated into doing something at a moment's notice, like a trained dog. At other times, I still feel like trash but I deal with having to interrupt whatever I'm doing to jump up and obey my father. It's at its worst when he makes me tell him that I'm treated fairly, before he reconnects the internet.

456,"My boyfriend of 2 years just recently lost his grandfather, about 4 days ago to be exact. He asked me that night if he could just be alone and I said that was ok, I know he is grieving. The next day I was taking him to work and i put my hand on his leg. Usually when i do that he takes my hand, but he left me hanging the whole ride, and avoided any physical contact with me the whole day. I took it pretty hard but again I realize he is going through a hard time so I’m allowing space.

However, the past few days he has been ok, and been hugging and kissing me, even cuddling when we sleep. I felt maybe now he is more comfortable with that. But last night after being happy and playing games and such, even hugging and kissing, he told me he wanted to sleep alone and not cuddle. I said that was alright and slept alone, but found it very hard to sleep because of it. He seemed pretty normal, and while I was going to sleep he was on his phone watching videos rather than sleeping. 
It’s been hard on me because I tend to over think and felt kinda useless in the sense that I can’t help him and he doesn’t want me to hold him or love on him. I’ve never really dealt with someone else grieving in this sense either so I’m not sure how to handle it all...
I am feeling insecure and I am scared he is gonna push me away and not want me back...
But I know my feelings kinda don’t matter here because he is grieving so I’m not sure what to do. 

I guess all I’m asking is, if he is grieving, would he not want to cuddle or sleep with his SO at night? I’m worried maybe his grief is making him isolate himself but at the same time he hasn’t wanted to be alone... last time he went out of his way to ask that we not sleep together was when is grandpa passed.
Should I talk to him about it, or should I just try not to worry?
If it is grief, how do I help him, and how do I keep myself from feeling unloved or alone during this hard time as well.

459,"There is a little summary at the end that can give you the gist, if you don't feel like reading what if probably rambling.


I have a roommate that I think is very judgemental, rude, and not very understanding of other people's differences. This roommate always speaks at a low volume and comes off as if he could care less or that what/who he talking to is below him. He is never direct with me when it comes to problems. He on multiple occasions has told me that I have a broken moral compass, what I do is weird, and that I am an asshole.

I would like to state personal beliefs that are likely involved in this issue. When it comes to resolving issues I firmly believe that the one that has the issue should confront the one that doesn't. I don't think that it can't happen the other way around but I am unlikely to do it if I don't like them. I can't act to fix someone's problem unless they tell me, even if I have a strong guess. Though again this is a little flexible, I morally can't take action to fix someone else's problem unless they tell me explicitly what it is. If I am not told the uncertainty in what to do will cause slight panic in me and I will prevent myself from taking any new actions. I don't think things should be done unless that are to increase the ease of actions, meaning, if something doesn't look good, as long as it works well, I don't see any reason to make it look nicer.

Now I would like to state some interactions.

The most recent was when I left cloths on the sink counter (it has two sinks and a large mirror) in the bathroom. I do this because when I wake up tired it is more convenient and easy for me to walk out of my room to get dressed than it is to get my cloths form my room. My room currently isn't the cleanest and due to my roommate's decision(other roommate) to not have a lofted bed, I don't have a crap ton of space besides my cluttered desk and my bed. He decided (the problem roommate) that he would confront me while I was unwinding from the day and filling my empty jugs with water. He had said that what I was doing was inconvenient for everyone else in the house and that he thought it was weird (and on some level he insinuated gross) that I left my cloths on the bathroom counter. The cloths didn't block the sink and there is more than enough room for someone to brush their teeth or comb their hair or do anything else. He doesn't even use the space on the counter, he just doesn't want anything on it. I told him why I did it and he tried to get everyone else in the house to agree that what I was doing was bad. I told him that it is very convenient for me and in no way hinders your routine and I continue to do it. He went on to insult my morals because they didn't follow the same that he had and even called me an asshole after I pointed out that I don't make 50% of the stove mess as he claimed. I usually use the oven, not the stove top. 

He would complain about cleaning but never asks me to clean. He also won't let me leave stuff on the counters. Stuff like my big-ass bag of rise that has an every growing hole that gets bigger the more I pick it up, oatmeal containers, anything that isn't a kitchen utensil he wan't in a cupboard. When these things are placed out they don't take up a lot of room and I am the only one that take time to prepare food on the island and counters so even if I leave stuff out it is still of little hindrance to him but he will continue to find issues with it.

He almost makes a point not to talk to me. When I first moved in I tried to make conversation and talk to my roommates but they never want to talk or make a small a conversation as possible. The longest conversation I had with him was when my brother asked him about his old house and he would brag about how terrible it was. I say hi and goodbye to all of them when I see them leave or enter and when a big break is coming up I ask about their plans because I always want to keep tabs on the people that are immediately around me. But even though I hope these little interactions will result in large ones, they never do.

I should talk to him but I'm not the one with the immediate issue, he has the issues with me so in a reasonable world he should calmly come to me and try to resolve it. I should go to him and talk about this but again, when I do something he doesn't ask me why or try to get my understanding. He will call me names and insult me if I think differently about whats appropriate. I am very worried about confronting him because I don't want to start an issue that would make our relationship more strained and him thinking that their is a set ""moral compass"" that every should strive for makes me think that he isn't the more understanding and open minded.

He is infrequent in approaching me and none of my roommates confront me if I smell, an issue that I struggle with because I don't notice I smell and so many deodorants and perfumes just hurt my nose or give a bad taste in my mouth when I breath them in. 

I can always tough it out, what I plan on doing right now, but I don't think that is the healthiest, but I also don't see any benefit from confronting him.

Summary:
- my roommate doesn't want anything in the common areas that is someone else's and I am more comfortable if I can prevent the clutter of my items and spread them out to areas that don't interfere with peoples activities.
- my roommate doesn't confront me on any issues until that have gone on for a while and he does it angrily. Saying that I am morally out of wack or weird.
- I don't confront my roommate because I don't see a lot of benefit and I get anxious

462,"I’m using an alt account to post this since I have made some friends from reddit. Also I’m very sorry this is so long, I just need some advice. 

I’m 18F and I am very critical of myself. I obsess over how much I weigh and how my face looks. My parents tell me I’m pretty, my sister does, other people do, but I don’t believe them. I obsess over my weight and throughout the day I pinch the fat on my belly or I feel my arms or even my face to see if I’ve gotten bigger or smaller. I no longer go on social media because when I see all those Instagram models or pretty faces it just makes me want to look like them. And I’ve become so picky with what I eat, even if I eat super healthy I freak out inside my head and think I’ve become fatter. If I eat a big meal I will cry and get very mad at myself for eating so much. I know this isn’t healthy. My goal for college is to weigh 110lbs, but no matter what I do, I can’t. 

*side note: for two years I was very autoimmune and gained 40lbs then lost it all and my weight steadied at 110 and now it has risen again to 117. (I’m 5’4) 

*another side note: my thyroid is in the range of normal, but on the low side and my cycle is only 20days... I’m still taking medicine to fix my cycle and I currently have a chronic infection in my sinuses, so I am tired a lot and I’ve been working out minimum 4x a week, but then right after taking a nap or not doing much of any activities for the rest of the day. HOWEVER, this is MUCH MUCH better than how I used to be, so it’s very manageable! 

I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that I’m so scared to be 40lbs overweight again and if I can just stay at 110 I’ll be happy and won’t freak out. Or it might be because of my hormones I’m not sure, but it’s very hard for me to lose weight. 

Is there any coping mechanisms I can use so I won’t do this anymore? I know I’m not normal and Im so sorry this was such a long post. ",01Apr2019,1
463,"So I have been doing a fwb benefits with someone for about 4 months now which started as soon as we met. I am F19 and he’s is 20. Things started off great, he had just got out of a relationship in September so he was still not over the whole thing which is understandable. I can’t help but be curious as to if he really does care about me or what. Also if I should bring up the fact that I think there are feelings being thrown around by both of us. I’ve met his family and whenever I see him we hangout with his friends and roommates. When we hangout more then half the time we don’t have sex. I will see him about 2 or more times a week and will spend the night on the weekends. When we go out he will put his arm around me, grab my hand, and kiss me etc. Buying my coffee or food. There is constant exchanging of snapchats and texts throughout each day and he will send me morning texts and ask about my day and so on. He has seen me at my complete worst. I’ve thrown up in front of him and woken up looking like I died and came back to life. I feel like we are practically dating and it definitely would look like that from the outside.
I went on spring break and he kept telling me to be safe and to not party too hard. Telling me he missed me maybe on the second or third day of me being gone. He also said that he was going to take me out to a nice dinner when I got back (he’s sick right now so we haven’t). When I got back he hugged me in a very like affectionate and meaningful way (if that makes any sense). I went over there to hangout with him we just sat in his bed and talked. At some point he said stuff like “ I like you” and stuff along those lines hinting that he cares for me. We ended up having sex and he pretty much admitted that because he likes me more, sex is even better then it was when we first started. He also brought up how we’ve been fucking for about 4 months. Talking about how we met was and how it was very odd practically fate. Both agreeing that we are happy that we continued to text after we met etc. 
I am just curious to see if I should bring things up to him. He’s moving this summer for two months so that’s one of the reasons we kept it fwb. He thought he was going to move to France after this summer but plans changed so he will be back this fall until the summer again. I don’t want to ruin what we have because I really am enjoying it. So that’s why I’m worried to bring things up. But I also can’t deny that I have feelings for him. Also I don’t know if he is ready to commit to me. Especially because his breakup is still pretty fresh and he needs time to get over it. He has told me that when he met me he was still hurt about his ex but he is now over her because of me. Also I think he’s worried that if he and I commit to one another and he’s gone for a few months I’ll cheat on him. (His ex cheated on him a good amount of times) or he just doesn’t want to feel tied down while away which is understandable. The thing is that he has told me he isn’t sleeping with anyone but me and has cut off all of his hoes and I have done the same. I introduced him to one of my friends who’s also a guy at some event we went to this weekend. When I talked to my friend he would just stare at us. I straight up could feel his eyes on me. It seemed very tense when talking to him even when they both talked for a minute. 
In all honesty I just don’t know what my next move should be. I’m not sure if he is waiting for me to say something or not. I haven’t really said to him that I liked him or anything. I gave myself a rule to not say or make a move unless he does because I don’t want to embarrass myself anymore. I’m not worried about getting hurt because I am very good at detaching and moving on from people. Ive never been broken up with I’ve always been the one to cut things off. So what is your opinion on the whole situation? Is me not admitting things to him possibly making him doubt saying anything? I would really just like some insight and light shown on all of this. If anything I’m confused and would just like some clarity from him because the lines that I feel like we’re there are getting blurred and messy. I’m not a guy so I don’t know how they think haha",01Apr2019,2

470,"
Anyways — long story short, my mom has an incredibly rare disease where tumours grow on her nerves(schwannomatosis) and cause her immense pain. She’s developed 6+ in the last eight years(in her arms, legs and neck) and her most recent MRI revealed tumours in her spine. We all knew this was a possibility but it was very surreal when we learned of it. She is the strongest person I know and she recently broke down in front of me in a way I have never seen before. It crushed my heart. This is such a cruel existence.

The treatment for the disease consists of pain management(drugs) and extracting the tumour off the nerve, but is only performed when the pain is unbearable  or there’s a possibility of compressing the nerve, otherwise the chance of damaging the nerve and causing numbness/paralysis is too great.

She’s been through so much in her life and she’s so young at 51 years old. She is in so much pain everyday and I feel so horrible. She’s been bed ridden for years and there’s not much anyone can do. We’re really struggling with the Canadian health care system(it’s not all it’s cracked up to be) and it would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for treatment from a sprecialist in another country. It’s so tough because most doctors haven’t a clue what she’s struggling with, and it only seems as if they know as much as they google. 

 I feel guilt on a day to day basis because I can’t help my own mom when she needs it most. 

Can anyone please share some words of wisdom?

473,"This is going to be a long one.

Help me. 

I get on an online sandbox game and this is where I met a person I've been ""friends"" with for a while. I use the term friends loosely because I only know so much about them. That information just boils down to their name and what general area in the world they live. 

It's fine however. You don't need to know a persons life to just be friends with them online.
I've always felt connected to this person. They are super nice and friendly. I enjoy talking to them. This person knows my face and my voice. And also bits of my life. I share what I want and I'm always careful. 

Well shit took a turn recently. It all started with a joke where I put (let's call her Diana) into a sexual situation she didn't want to be in. But the more we got into it the more we realized we both liked what was happening. I enjoyed controlling her and she liked being controlled. We don't actually ""do"" anything together. I put her with other people. And other things. We are still JUST friends so we have boundaries where we don't want to jeopardize that. 

When it first started and I realized how into it was I instantly wanted to stop. Diana has always been secretive and just want easy going. I didn't want this to become a stress factor. But Diana insisted that it would be fine and we should both see where it goes. So here we are. 

We talk everyday. We tell each other things that get the other turned on in some weird way. It's hard to explain. But we have both stated how emotional it makes us and how it real feels. She does things she would have never considered and I make her do things I would never have wanted to do. It's nice. 

Now everything feels so serious. We go around other people online with this and she's made it clear she wants people to know we aren't fake. That we care about each other and that we do this because we want to. 

She does what I want her to and I compensate her with love and making sure she feels cared for.

It's not like it's hard to care about her. I've been friends with her for a while. But now the deeper I get into it I keep questioning myself what I am doing. Sex isn't just fun to me I've never been a casual person. Even though we aren't actually doing anything like that directly it's still doing something close to. I tell her what turns me on. I describe how I feel. I share my emotions and open my heart when it comes to this. I've actually had to work on the whole sharing thing because I wasn't sharing as much in the beginning and she was having a hard time with it. 

Things have suddenly got difficult lately when I messed up and asked about a small question about her. The real her. It was something so small and something a friend would know about another friend. She told me straight up it was none of my business. 

Now look. Months ago this wouldn't have been a big deal. Like I said you don't have to know everything about a person just to simply be friends with them. I have even made my peace that I would never be an actual friend to this person but a filler when they opened up that computer and got bored. But we aren't just simply friends. We are but I'm also sharing things that are really personal and taking bits of my soul with it. I know NOTHING about this person. Not their age.  Their birthday. Their hobbies. Did they go to school. What books do they read. Their face. Their voice. I know absolutely nothing. It shouldn't bother me because it's suppose to just be fun but I'm so damn confused. She wants real and to feel connected. Great. It's easy for her because I'm an actual fuckin person. I'm real to her. She knows me. 

Even though she feels real to me that's all that I have. I don't have anything else of her. I'm a great way to pass the time and even though I know she would claim otherwise it's essentially the truth. One day she will exit my life and I will have nothing left but a damn feeling of a person who felt real.

I guess what I'm asking here is. Should I just suck it up and continue stretching my emotions thin? I enjoy doing this. She enjoys it. But I hate feeling like someone's way of a good time and only that. Or should I stop this crazy train get the hell off and get as far away from the person who is so stuck on themself they can't look at me and think hey, maybe I should make this person feel as important as they are trying to do for me. (I'm obviously getting angry as I write this)

476,"I've been out of the house for awhile now and since I left things in the rest of the family have not been good. I doubt I would make the situation much different if I was still there, but I don't live there so I can't actively do as much as I'd like. My sister is the issue in the family. She has been for a long time. Quick backstory though is she is not my blood sister. She's my cousin. Her birth mom (my mom's sister) gave birth and she could not take care of the child. Drug addiction, neglect and poor living conditions all played a part. After my sister (we all consider her to be a daughter in my family at this point) was about two years old, it somehow fell on my family to take her in. We've had her for eleven years now. So there's that. We've done our best and my parents still do their best but she has some major issues, stemming from her birth mom. Aside from lack of social development at a young age, she acts just like her bio mom. Uncanny. It's destroying the family. Mostly my dad.

Describing her issues aren't the easiest for me but in the end my dad just can't take it anymore. I don't blame him. She's horrible. I never disliked anyone more than her. My mom ""copes,"" more so just escapes, with weed. She's a fine parent, though, just like my dad. They provide, love as much as they can, take care the family and do whatever they can to make sure my sister, brother and myself have a loving and solid family. But my dad just isn't emotionally able to take it anymore. Mom just wants him to get some drugs prescribed to him to so he can chill out or whatever, but he's tried that multiple times and knows drugs aren't the answer. Besides that won't fix the issue anyway, just make him cope a little better, if that. 

My dad's most preferable option is to send her away. I also think that is the best thing to do. I honestly do not want her in my life or in my family's. He even contemplates moving out himself, but he still wants to live with his wife most importantly and also his other son. What can my family do, assuming my mom is on board, to get her out? They did a thing called BoysTown, I think, for awhile, where a specialist visited the household once or twice a week for a few months to understand the situation. In the end they just said my parents are doing everything that they recommend and couldn't do much more. So that didn't help. Other options? 

tl;dr My dad can't handle living with his ""daughter""(13) anymore. He wants to send her away. How can that be done and if not what's the next best thing close to getting her out of the house?",01Apr2019,1

478,"Pretext: I work in government. Our time off policies are across the board and the same for anyone. The most vacation time that can be accrued is 5 weeks (and that’s generally only for 10+ year employees). I run a program for disabled and elderly transportation. It is my supervisor (who supervises 5 other programs, so doesn’t have his hand in much of any of the programs), myself (40 hour employee) and my receptionist (who is a 38 hour employee and divides her time between my program at 50% and Income Maintenance Consortium). Her responsibilities is to answer my phone line and take requests and deal with the front desk traffic. At this point she answers around 10% of the calls we receive, that means I am answering 80-90 calls a day and writing requests instead of performing my actual job duties and scheduling, grant writing and fiscal end of the program. 

She started with our agency last January 2018, moved to my program in August 2018. Since she has started she has taken a week long vacation in September, a week long vacation in November, a week and a half long vacation in December, a week long vacation in February. Plus every Friday she takes half days. So all together, it has been six weeks of vacation time taken. We are not allowed to accrue comp time due to budget set backs. 

Last week she left on Tuesday (3/26) on what we were told was “medical leave” and we were to respect her privacy, she would be back April 8th.  Over the weekend, through social media, it has come to light that she was in fact in Florida for a wedding on March 30th and is staying a week longer for an extended vacation. 

Our supervisor is unaware we know she is on vacation again. I want to confront him because my work load is getting ridiculously behind and I’m tired of covering her position up front. I’m all for being a team player as I’ve never had issues with the past receptionists and covering their earned vacations, but I feel as if I’m being taken advantage of now, especially as she is working on almost 8 weeks of vacation being used since she started a little over a year ago. She only has 1.5 weeks earned a year. 

Recently I got denied 5/23 and 5/24 off, even though I have more than enough vacation time to use. Normally this wouldn’t bother me, but my brother is getting married on 5/24 and I want to attend his huge wedding I’m standing up in. Along with that, I was denied because my receptionist already requested those days and I need to cover her shift. 

How would you approach this situation? It’s clear the supervisor favors her, and her roll, but this is not okay and I don’t want to quit a job I love and earned because of their unprofessional relationship.

i wonder why he picked me. i look so pathetic in comparison of him. my physical appearance is nothing crazy (i'd give myself a 6, he's a legit 10), i'm not good in bed (was a virgin before him), nor am i very funny or smart, and i doubt my future success in life looking at how i struggle with studying.

we've been together for two month now, and i know he's been very respectful and loyal, but i'm just terrified of the day he'll realize how out of my league he is

he could really get any girl he wants and he picks the loser i am.. i mean, it can only end badly, right?

i'm even starting to think of leaving him myself before i get cheated on or dumped

any thoughts?

489,"So last trimester I had the second part of AP Literature and I wanted to get my grade up to a B(79.5 from a 78.5) on the final. The reason my grade is that low in the first place is because I missed two assignments due to my sickness that my teacher didn't let me turn in late(I was sick on and off all of my winter trimester).

The final is an AP multiple choice exam that's curved based on how everyone else does in the class. My class had a worse curve than the other class because my teacher gave us an exam that was available online and a significant number of my classmates found it. If my classmates didn't cheat and the curve was one or two points more lenient I would have a B in the class.

Given all this information and the extenuating circumstance of sickness, I feel like I deserve a B in the class, so how should I ask my teacher for a grade bump?",01Apr2019,1

491,"TLDR at the bottom. Throwaway for obvious reasons. Both (M18).

So I've been friends with this guy since sophomore year of high school but we really became friends senior year. We both planned to attend the same college so we decided to room together. We kinda had a rough time making friends (lived in a mostly sophomore dorm) so we hung out a lot together. He got on my nerves sometimes but it was mostly good.

One day during the fall semester he asked me to come back to the room and talk. He told me that he was bi. I reassured him and told him that its okay and its going to be fine. He was kinda freaking out so to calm him down I told him that I was bi (I am). After I said that the room shifted. He came over to my bed and we continued talking. He started to get weird and I got the vibe that he wanted to be intimate with me. I explicitly told him I did not want that and kinda moved away from him. We continued talking until he asked me if I ever wondered what its like to kiss a guy. Obviously you can see where this is going. He asked me if I would kiss him. He said it does have to mean anything but he just wanted to see how it felt. I told him no once again but he kept asking me. I had to leave the room as I became uncomfortable.

Five minutes later I submitted a request to change rooms. We tried to act normal but it just wasn't the same. He told me that he didn't mean it about 100 times. After a week I was moved out. I didn't see or talk to him for about 3 months. At the beginning of the spring semester we rekindled our friendship. We both had similar friends so we hung out more, played on an intramural team, etc. Things weren't back to normal but they were good.

A few days ago I played basketball with him and some of our friends. Last night, I got a text from him saying that it was good to be friends again and he did not mean what he said last semester. However, at the end he told me that he is starting to have feelings for me again. He didn't say anything after that and I'm not sure what to do. Any help is appreciated.

TLDR: Friend came onto me when we lived in the same dorm. Our friendship died for about 3 months then got rekindled. He just told me he has feelings for me again.",01Apr2019,1
492,"So a few months ago I (M) found the love of my life (F). Sounds great right? She really is, but comes with a whole set of drama that I want to help with but cant figure out how to.  


So she has 2 kids, and an extremely emotionally abusive/manipulative husband with whom she has been trying to get a divorce. He will not grant it. He makes her cry, feel like committing suicide etc. on a daily basis. So why doesn't she just leave him?  


So my knowledge on the matter may be biased or untrue, this is just what she has told me. They met and all was fine and dandy, he got her pregnant and she didn't want to keep the kid. Understandably, as she was 18 at the time and he was 23(24? older). Long story short he convinces her that they are meant to be and (under his behest) to keep the kid. They also get married somewhere in there. He proceeds to treat her like shit, never help with the kids and sits around playing league of legends all day. She loves the child so much and it is the only source of happiness in her life, so she decides to get another child. She has another one, shitty abusive time the whole way. Made her life a living hell. He moves her across the country away from her family and friends to keep her to himself. He cheats on her, she finally realizes she is done. Asks for divorce, he says no we are working it out blah blah. She continues to ask for a divorce and he wont grant it.   


Now at this point, she is totally financially reliant on him, due to him moving her across the country and making her be a stay at home mom. She met me thru an online dating site. We have been dating for a few months. Admittedly this is not a long time, but she is truly one of the kindest people i have ever met. I wont bore you with the details, but I am committed to helping her. I don't know how, as i cannot move her into my place since my roommate wouldn't allow it (with her having the 2 kids i understand). I am considering working 7 days a week and moving her and her kids away from her abusive ex husband. He is constantly throwing around dates and threatening to move her away to new places/back to their home state etc. I don't know what to do.  


So tl;dr: Trying to get a girl and her 2 kids out of a super abusive household. Anyone been in a similar situation?   


Are there any government programs/legal action we can take to get her out of that house? That is my main priority.",01Apr2019,1
493,"Hi everyone, this is my first post here, so excuse me if I'm not following all the manners. Anyway, I'm 19 and still living with my parents. I will hopefully move out in an year or so, but that's far away. The thing that's really bothering me now is my overprotective parents' nagging, especially dad's. He wouldn't leave me alone about anything, but the most annoying part is that he keeps asking the same questions over and over again, even after I've answered them several times. Worse, he would sometimes skip over my answers and jump to conclusions.
For example, I was diagnosed with asthma last year. Now he keeps asking me every week or so: ""Do you still have that problem? Need to consult the doctor?"" Even though the doctor said that it's not going to go away, it's quite manageable and nothing to worry about; and my answer is always ""No"", he wouldn't stop pestering me. Like my problems will simply go away if someone keeps asking about it. I know he does this because he cares, but it just makes me really irritated.
He also similarly keeps asking about what I do on the internet, and somehow keeps concluding that I'm watching porn all day even after telling him a millionth times that I am not (well, *sometimes* I do, who doesn't? But I was never found with porn by him) and I'm playing games or talking to friends, he wouldn't change his assumption and threaten to throw away the computer. (Actually I've gotten so fed up with it I'm considering throwing away the computer myself just so that he would shut up.)
Well, that's just the two of the worse ones; there's the usual ones involving school and other habits. I know he does this because he's just worried, but asking the same questions over and over after getting answers clearly means he either has absolutely no respect for what I say or he doesn't pay any actual attention to my words. (Or he's losing brain cells, he's around 57; which is scarier). I don't want to hurt his feelings, but he really gets on my nerve this way and I feel really anger-y. I try to minimize our interactions by staying in my room, but he doesn't respect that boundary either. So any advice about how to get him to leave me alone would be welcome.

496,"For the past 7 years my 60 year old father has been diligently taking both gabapentin (300mg) and hydrocodone (325mg, which he cuts in half for his dose). 7 years. Taken together, at the same time, for pain relief. Over that time period he’s had several operations (3 knee replacements, back surgery, carpal tunnel in both hands) and his doctor has had him prescribed to these medications continuously to help with pain. He takes his doses 3 times a day and is asleep more than he is awake. He’s usually up from about 9am-11am, down with his first dose from 11am-2pm, up from 2pm-5pm, down from 5pm-8pm then up until maybe 10pm before he goes to bed for the night. Any plans must be made in the few hours he’s awake, lest he gets very irritable. Yelling, visible anguish and stress ensues when something happens that forces him to be awake for longer without taking his doses. If something wakes him up before he’s ready whilst under the influence of these medicines, he’s very unsteady on his feet up to the point of collapse. There have been times when he’s had to run errands while not completely rested where he’s appeared physically intoxicated to passerby and has nearly fallen down in public spaces. I’m afraid he could seriously get hurt one day from being outside under these conditions.

It seems like his entire life revolves around his “drugging up” (as he calls it) and it’s putting stress on his entire family. He frequently gets into arguments with my mother (63F) who suffers from anxiety and PTSD. I feel awful for her as often he’s too harsh with her over nothing at all and it leaves her in tears. He has his prescriptions filled at two different pharmacies without the knowledge of his doctor so he has somewhat of a stockpile now. He has a work from home job that doesn’t pay much so there have been times when he couldn’t afford his medications and he’s come to me about it. I don’t like giving into this habit of his because I hate what it does to him, but he acts so helpless and speaks in passive aggressive tones just to target me so I have paid for them a couple of times just to keep the peace. My brother has tried many times to schedule dinners or hang outs so he can see his grandchildren but has been yelled at if they’re outside his “wake” times. At this point the invitations have stopped since it seems he’s never available to see his family.

There have been a few times when we have tried to confront him about his medications but he gets angry and insists that he’s not addicted. He’s frustrated with his level of pain and feels at a loss for anything else to do. His doctor has not done much of anything in the way of getting him off these meds when we’ve approached him about it, he’s only reduced the mg (the mgs I’ve listed earlier are his current doses). He has had a spinal stimulator implanted that was supposed to help with his pain but my father insists that it hasn’t.

I honestly don’t know what to do since his doctor isn’t helping us and my father seems too unwilling to give up his meds without a proper replacement. I just don’t want to see this spiral even further as we’ve been noticing his anger getting worse over time and we have to make efforts not to cross him the wrong way. Before anyone asks, he hasn’t become physical and doesn’t have a history of physical abuse.

503,"Hi everyone. Some quick background:

&amp;#x200B;

I have two roommates, one of them has 2 dogs and the other one has a new puppy. We moved together to Chicago in August. I've known my roommates since we were in 5th grade (we are 25 years old now). They are both girls and I am a guy.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, I thought it was a great idea, since we are saving money on rent and we get to spend some time together after being apart for about 4-6 years during college. I work full time and I thought since I am usually not home that often, it shouldn't be a big deal. However, there are many issues that starting popping up over time and I am definitely considering a move. Issues include having to cleanup after the dogs constantly, lack of privacy or personal space and lately, our interests have been very different so not much to talk about or relate to. We also have a cooking and noise curfew in our own apartment because one of the rooms does not close off and you can hear/smell everything, which sucks because I am usually home by 7PM after the gym (curfew is at 8PM).

&amp;#x200B;

I have asked another friend of mine and we were thinking that we could potentially move in together in June or July. This would require me to request to break the lease (our lease ends May 2020). It's a lot of work but honestly I don't think I want to wait any longer.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of asking them what their thoughts are on moving sometime this week, and then bring up that I am considering moving with someone else in a couple of weeks. I wish I could tell them everything at once but I don't want to overwhelm them and have a miserable transition.

&amp;#x200B;

I fear however that if I were to say anything, it would strain my relationship with her or wierd her out. That, and she is currently dating someone else.

   I want nothing more than for her to be happy, and I worry that putting these feelings out there would ruin that. I don't think she would stop talking to me, but we have such an awesome relationship and I would hate myself for ruining it. I don't want to be selfish at the cost of her happiness.

My grandfather passed away on December 2nd 2018, prior to this for my entire life I had been incomparably successful both socially and academically, possessing this unparalleled ambition, charisma and exuding positivity. After my grand-fathers evermore unfortunate passing, this success changed a considerable deal... I attribute it exclusively to one issue, self-diagnosed (and thus not quite axiomatic) Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder. This disorder is ill-understood amongst individuals in the filed of psychology it seems. It essentially provokes this eternal feeling of dreaminess, of simulated presence. At times I observe my hands and observe social interactions without quite feeling there, feeling detached essentially from my environment.

The consequences incurred are self-evident, the extraversion my true self possesses strongly relies on socializing and being in the presence of others, this was the only thing arguably that I wold rejoice in and would thus bring me a great deal of motivation and ambition in that respect. Yet with this disorder I have practically entirely lost my ability to feel present whilst interacting with others and thus feel bored/absent/sad all the time. This, a feeling that has never previously come to me, is particularly difficult to deal with. I have many friends but this issue has lasted 4 months and I feel them progressively moving away from me. It is indeed considerably unfortunate.

I have asked for psychological help and it seems far too slow, thus I am taking more steps under this particular route and hoping it will work nonetheless. I find it incredibly difficult to deal with because I genuinely don't feel like myself nor there and thus, in the absence of both fields, I can do literally nothing about it.

Now, Andy was my schoolmate, and I have known him for some time, but there are several issues with Andy that I find odious. First off, some background about Andy. He started a ""fling"" with my best friend (girl), and they almost even started a relationship, but Andy just became a total snob and wouldn't stop talking about himself narcissitically. He basically started to ignore my best friend too, and she was pretty heartbroken. At this point no one knew he was gay. Second, he's into other people's private lives too much. I will spare you the details, but basically he caused me and my immediate friends circle to lose respect of him, because he won't stop poking his nose into our lives for no good reason. Anyway, he went abroad for studies and that was the end of it, until he came back and starting seeing Ninja.  
  
I wish I had known this, but Ninja casually asked if I knew Andy. I told Ninja that I did, and explained that how he treats people like shit. Ninja lost his shit. Tomorrow Ninja posts a picture with Andy and finally everything clicked, on why Andy didn't date my best friend, why he is into my personal life so much, and why Ninja knows Andy. Of course, next thing is that I get blocked by Ninja, who is mad at me all because I pointed out his boyfriend's scummy ways.  
   
Fast forward now, I see Andy on Grindr and Ninja on Tinder, which immediately made me understand they broke up (no surprise there). Now, Ninja wants to talk again, but I have yet to 'read' the message. What should I do? Should I let bygones be bygones? Because I am still salty for the fact that Ninja basically let go of our friendship for a guy who didn't even give a shit in the end.",01Apr2019,1

532,"Hello Hello.
My parents are currently very unhappy and it really affects me and my younger siblings negatively. 
The problem especially arises with my father. He is an extremely emotionally distant and lonely person, he doesn't have any friends and no contact with his family, all he has is us.
But I truly despise him, he is just as much the cause for my depression and anxiety as the bullying in school. He loves to shout at everything and everyone. He shouted at me for accidentally spilling a glass, making loud noises with my fork, walking to the toilet at night and suprising him, laughing too loud and also if I forgot to clean something. He never showed me any love, all I got was anger and apathy. I envy all the kids that had loving fathers. 
So much to my father. With him being such an uncomfortable person to be around, I never understood how my mom could endure him for 20 years. As it turns out, she can't really!
But she is too nice and forgiving. She ist the most loving person I'll ever meet and as such she also appreciates my father. But it doesn't matter how much she will deny it, this marriage doesn't make anyone in the family. 
My Father is the biggest bray at home, with everyone (even my 7 year old brother!!!) having to be careful around him and my mother heavily depends on her children to make her happy. But that's not how it can work on and on. They need to fix their relationship or let it end.
So here is my actual question; How can I help them ? I've thought of really yelling at my father to make him understand (we did tell him our problems with him a lot of times, but always softly), but I'm extremly scared. It's really an internalized trauma. The other good thing could therapy for both of them individually, but how could I convince them ?
Thanks for reading so far, this also is a vent for me, so please excuse any grammatical errors. 

TLDR: My father is an angry, shouting and lonely person that makes our whole family uncomfortable and in such my mom is really depending on us children too make her happy. That causes a lot of stress for everyone and what my parents need is therapy. How do get them to go?

534," Sorry for the long post, I feel like this needs some back story-

&amp;#x200B;

So three years ago, I became super good friends with a girl I worked with. We were both single and having a great time, and sharing the ups and downs of dating with each other. We texted constantly, and were always supportive of each other. Fast forward a year, we go to Vegas for my 30th birthday and rage, both of us dating dudes that we thought we were in to. After we got back, my guy ended things with me, and she was still on the high of her current guy. A week later I met the man of my dreams, the same day that her current dude  ghosted her. Her first response to me is ""just be careful"" when I told her about how amazing our first few dates had gone, and she seemed genuinely annoyed when him and I had our first night together, which is something we typically shared about together. A few weeks later, she met a guy that seemed great and they started dating seriously. I hoped things would change, but nope. Any time I'd send her a screenshot of the cute shit my new man would send me, she'd just flat out ignore it. My man has a checkered past too, so I'm pretty sure she dislikes him for that alone, no regards to how he treats me or how amazing we are together. So, coming in to 10 months together and we get engaged. I sent her a ring pic, wondering what she'd say, and her response was ""it's just so soon"". We'd been living together for 6 months already, I knew this man was the man I wanted to be with.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we come to the dilemma.... she met a guy 6 months ago that she is crazy about, and actually apologized to me for being so unsupportive in the beginning because she didn't understand that kind of love until she met her current guy. Well, they leave for Paris on Thursday and he's apparently planning on proposing. She never actually told me this BTW, I heard it from a mutual friend, which tells me she already knows what I'd say. My knee jerk reaction is to scream ""HYPOCRITE"", which is awful. Things have been awkward with us the whole two years I've been with my man, and at one point she even thanked me for making the effort to keep the friendship, but I literally feel it fading away and the hypocrisy is just nagging at me. I'm leaning mostly towards sending her a short message explaining myself, then removing her from all social media. I never see her anymore, the two times she's been to the house my man and I bought was so we could watch her dog while she hopped on a plane with new guy.

535," 

My boyfriend and I, both in our mid 20s are together for four years. There has been an issue with a female co worker of his for over two years. He hang out at her house in secret 1.5 yrs ago, I found out much later. He claims nothing happens. They still work together and text sometimes, but less frequent. He swears he won't hang out with her - she has send inappropriate texts and such.

We live together in our own house. I leave every monday morning to another city and come back tuesday morning for work issues. This means he is alone for 24 hours.

This tuesday morning 10am I got out of the bus and saw that girl walking to the bus. We live in a small craphole place, with nothing to do. We have a supermarket, a bakery, one tiny clothing store and that is it. This girl lives in another city, works in another city and studies in another city. I know she has NO friends or family in our town, because she mentioned it earlier to my boyfriend. (""You are the only one I know that wants to live in that crap place!"")

What was her reason to be there, so early in the morning? I came home and my boyfriend was in bed asleep, with the window and curtains open. He always sleeps with the window and curtains closed.

I confronted and he said she was not there and has never been to our house. Then I decided to check his internet history. Yes, fellow redditors, I know this is wrong but I do NOT want a rant about this.

So I saw that the evening before he watched some netflix on his tablet until 11PM. After that, things get weird. He watched youtube on his mobile from 11.00 to 11.19 PM. This is odd, because I am with this guy for 4 years and he NEVER watches youtube on his phone when he is inside the house. He always only does this when he is in the bus, outside or whatever. However no busses drove at that moment so that can't be true. After 23.19 there was no signs of activity anymore on his phone, tablet or computer. He set up an alarm clock at 22.59 PM.

The first next activity was next day 08.04 am when he put off his alarm clock, and then 08.30 on Whatsapp.

He has a car that he shares with his mom. Wednesday we got into the car and he said; Mom keeps asking bout the car and drives my fuel till its empty. And I said; no she didn't asked for the car for at least 2 weeks why you bring this up? He just said oh it bothers me.

He kept bringing up this girl 2 or 3 times. ""I don't think it was her, I think you saw it wrong. Probably can't be her"" blah blah.

He got angry and sad when I asked him if he cheated and he denied all and called me paranoid. Ever since, nearly a week, my boyfriend acts distant and avoids sex. When we talk he says he is disappointed in me and feels like he is together with a private detective. He asked me why I am with him if I dont trust him.",01Apr2019,1
536,"A little backstory. I was hired at an online retailer as a photographer, I was then asked to post my pictures to our company’s social media, made sense because I was the one taking pictures and editing them. Over time my company’s videographer and I had grown the social media into something substantial (over 3 years), at this point in time someone from another department had shown interest in helping build our social media, so my boss decided to basically strip all of our social media duties away and give it to this new person. This person had minimal experience but wanted to learn and grow. Given the resources and help from myself, he was able to continue to grow the social media. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, that person who had been dubbed ‘social media manager’ has left after doing the social media for a little over a year. I approached my CEO and COO about wanting to fill the position and maintain my current position as the photographer. This talk went well and initiated a kind of trial period where I would continue my job as the photographer and try to revamp our social media. 

This is where I need help. It has been 2 weeks since I took over this other job (so now I’m doing the work 2 people used to do) and things are going GREAT. We have a weekly social media meeting where I run over the numbers of how things are going, and outline the new strategies I will be using to continue to grow the numbers. I have been complimented by everyone involved about how great a job I’ve been doing. Now I want to approach my CEO and COO about going from an hourly paid employee to a salary paid employee being compensated for the work of two people. How does one go about doing this? 

I’ve been working at this company for almost 5 years. Thanks in advance for the advice!

538,"Hi, 

I’ve been wondering about this for a while and I can’t tell anyone in my life about it so I’d like to know what some random internet strangers think! So,

1.) I have a vague memory of touching the genitals of my mother’s boyfriend while he was bathing at around age 5, I remember feeling scared/uncomfortable (but this may be a false memory?). 

This was also a man who paid me to call him daddy (not a good parenting tactic!) and was bad to me in other ways (such as entirely ignoring me once my brother was born) 

2.) My mother was a young mother, she drank a lot and abused me (albeit through beating me and neglecting me) herself, I don’t think she would’ve took notice/cared if something had happened. 

3.) My grandmother has mentioned multiple time’s that something bad happened to me when i was young but won’t tell me what. She also said she almost called CPS on my mother more than once. 

4.) I hit puberty quite early (age 9) which I think I once read can be a sign of abuse? I also had an extreme interest in sexual things around that age and younger which I think is weird? (I always went on omegle and that sort of thing — horrendous, I know.) 

5.) I had an eating disorder and a fixation with looking young from age 10 or so, I resented myself for going through puberty so much that I began self harming. This lasted until around a year ago. 

That’s all I can think of right now and sorry for the long post... but does anyone agree? ",01Apr2019,0

Hi  everyone, I'm 22 and about to graduate from my community college with  an associate's in studio arts. Afterwards I would move on to a four year  college to finish. The thing is, I'm having these recurring waves of  feeling... like I've ruined my life. Up to high school I wanted to do  something in medicine, but I realized that I hated school, and going to  college, that I was also completely uninterested in pursuing science.

At  the same time, I have always loved art and I've kept up  drawing/painting the whole time, so eventually I decided to switch my  major to studio arts - and when transferring to a four year school, I  will be double majoring in digital art as well. I'm genuinely excited to  do anything art related, and I think I've become pretty good at it -  showing promise, you know? The thing is, I've been having some stress  related health issues lately, so I thought after graduating I would take  a semester off and start posting my art online, which is something I've  never done before.

But I keep getting  these horrible feelings that I'm ruining my life, or I'll never be able  to support myself financially. That maybe I should have stuck to  studying science, even if I don't enjoy it. It happens in periods of a  couple of days, usually, where I feel like my life is just... over.

543,"(this was originally posted in offmychest but I feel like this sub is a better fit for it)

I'm 20M and I feel like I made some extremely horrible decisions in my life that will follow me forever. 

Starting in middle school, I was constantly whipped to perform well in school, but I always hated it. I performed extremely well in high school and graduated in the top 3% of my class - but I still absolutely fucking hated it, and college proved to be even worse. Lo and behold, the depression I held down caught up to me and now my GPA in college is fucked as a result. Boom, all that hard work in high school was reduced to nothing. I'm a chem major (my gullible ass got roped into the STEM shortage myth - only the T and E folks!), so without a PhD my education will be worth about as much as toilet paper. 

I have almost no good memories because I invested so much time into stressing out for tests. I used to motivate myself by adopting this philosophy of sacrificing my childhood to ensure a happy adulthood, but now it looks like I'm never going to have either.

The problem isn't the major or that the specific school isn't the right fit for me, SCHOOL ITSELF ISN'T A RIGHT FIT FOR ME. Yet my family always shamed me when I voiced my negative opinions during my senior year of high school. Before, they would at least lend me an ear because I at least had the credibility to say something since my parents liked to brag to everyone about me. Now, everyone disrespects me and treats me with condescension, like I have no right to complain because I'm not even performing well. 

The kicker is that my ""friends"" are also most likely delighted about my struggles. I'm sort of the ""verbal punchbag nice guy"" of our group, but academics was literally the only thing I had to hold up my pride against others. Now I don't even have that.

It really hurts when I think about what other great things I could've done if I applied my time spent studying towards something else and how much happier I could've been. It feels like all of my potential and passion has been sucked out of me. I just...don't know how I can justify everything I subjected myself to. It's incredible that all of that shit was for nothing. That's 4 prime years of my life. That's precious. And I sacrificed them for nothing.

Everything relating to academics is just shrouded in extreme toxicity to me. I want out - I don't want the quality of the rest of my life to be determined by what GPA I got in undergrad. I'm trying to cook up a plan to move to a state with a low cost of living where I can live a simple (single!) life by myself with no one to follow me around. I don't give a fuck about city life, weather or other frivolous shit like that. I just want to LIVE, by MYSELF, with no family and no debt, but not while being on some government assistance program. 

My mother and my best friend were angels throughout this whole ordeal, but I'm afraid that keeping those connections is definitely going to mean keeping connections with shitty people that roped me into this rat race and perpetuated my suffering. 

I literally wish to ghost everyone I know and go ""off the grid"", at least with respect to all the people that are currently familiar with me. How do I go about this? What are some good locations with cheap property values? How do I achieve my goal of being financially independent if my degree won't be worth much? ",01Apr2019,4
544,"Somethings been wrong for months now. 

I turned 18 this month, I'm a female with a height of 5'3 weighing around 115lb. I'm white. I live in California. This has lasted maybe 3/4 months and recently has gotten worse. 

Months ago, on a weekend, my stomach felt ""weird"" for about 2 days and on the third day I ended up throwing up and it hurt really bad, after that day my stomach never felt the same. During this time, I was in foster care. I entered foster care in July of 2018. I had my foster parents take me to the doctors because of my stomach. I went to two doctors, both basically felt my stomach and said they don't feel anything wrong, despite me saying it hurts when they press on it. I was living in a really bad place in California so I felt the doctors weren't well educated and I was going to wait until I went home in March to go see a better doctor. Starting February 15 I decided to write down my symptoms everyday because I thought maybe that'd be helpful. I read over them and every single day I've noted that I had a headache. To describe my headaches, it isn't a legit ""headache"" it's like less than a headache. It feels more like my whole Brian just is aching, like how my body aches. Sometimes it does turn into a full headache, but this ""light"" headache or whatever it is stays like all day and I wake up with it. And everyday my stomach was hurting. It would hurt no matter what I ate. To describe my stomach pain, in the mornings it definitely hurts, but throughout the whole day it isn't necessarily painful, it's more annoying and bothersome than anything else. I can't really eat until I'm full anymore because of the fear that I'll end up throwing up. Sometimes just thinking about food makes me nauseous. The people I lived with btw ate a lot of unhealthy food and whenever they went out to get fast food, which was a lot, I told them I didn't want anything. I thought I'd rather be hungry than eat something that's not good for me. I really didn't wanna eat the fast food anyways, thinking about it made my stomach feel gross. Anyways, I went home March 14th since I aged out of foster care. This did make me really really stressed out and worried and sad about everything because my mom doesn't have a job and she told me the electricity will shut off, there's no WiFi so I'm stuck with just my phone, her boyfriend is a schizophrenic which scares me(two days ago they got into a fight and we called the police, he should be gone finally for good), my two little brothers are still in foster care, and my mom also eats just unhealthy crap so what am I gnna eat???? I cried a lot the couple days I was home.  My stomach really started hurting then and I felt really really bad. I went to my cousins for the week, and I had a doctors appointment scheduled for a Thursday, but I went to the hospital two days earlier instead. I didn't think I could last feeling that way for another two days. I literally felt so so bad. All day I was so so so bored, crying because I was so sad and worried, I didn't even know what to do anymore. I literally just wanted to be in a hospital bed where they can take my pain away and take care of me. I had no appetite but I tried eating a little. It was gross. So, I went to the hospital, and I see the doctor and I tell him how my stomach hurts and my head hurts everyday. I feel weak, I was shaking and there's tingling in my hands and arms. I of course told him I barely ate that day, and my situation with being in foster care and my mom and whatnot, and I was crying because for so long I've wanted to just feel normal again. So, he felt my stomach, and said nothing feels wrong. He basically said I felt like that because I didn't eat and it's probably just depression because of what I've been going through. That made me cry even more. I was so afraid of him telling me that. I understand that my emotions can cause physical pain, and I was overhwhlemed with coming back home which probably is why it got so bad, but it's literally been here for months. I wake up with my head and stomach hurting. Every. Day. I told him that. It's like he didn't care. He just said he'll do blood work and I should see a therapist or whatever. The lady missed two tubes of blood since I told her I legit felt like I was going to pass out, I feel like those two tubes of blood could've been important. Well the next day they called and said I need to see a radiologist for X-rays because of something they found in my blood. I have to wait until April 8th. So I went back home and I've been trying to eat stuff. Right now we don't have much food which I have no idea what to do about either. I have plenty of water, but even that's hard to drink(I only will drink water, I don't like anything else). I eat maybe twice in a day now, atleast I try to. But again it's hard when my mom just buys junk food, so what am I supposed to eat? I used to have my Oma to make me food until she died when I was 14, but now I have nothing but frozen food or boxes with instructions. Is eating cup of noodles all day legit better than eating nothing? I feel like if I ate nothing it'd be exactly the same because like what nutritional value would that bring me? I mean jeez there are people who sit and eat McDonald's all day and they're fine???? So does it matter what I even eat? I don't even know. That stresses me out too. Im trying to stay positive I really am, but the past couple days I've woken up feeling so terrible, I mean I woke up today with only 4 hours of sleep and I tried so hard to go back to sleep because I'm so tired, it felt like I was trying for a long time, and I was only trying for an hour? Like my mind couldn't settle or something. It made me cry so much, and I havnt cried that much for about a week because I'm trying to not let my emotions make it worse, but I legit can't sleep now? It's been I believe 3 days in a row that I got 4-5 hours of sleep. My dreams make it worse because they arnt nice ones. Im going back to school tomorrow, im in high school still, and I just hope I'll be able to sleep. I'm hoping so so much that they find something on the xrays, so they can fix me. Because if not then... it's all in my head? If there's nothing physically wrong with me then I'll just live like this forever? I can't do this forever. I can't wake up everyday with my body aching and my head and stomach hurting. All I have to look forward to is those X-rays, hoping they'll find something, and I'm scared they'll say everything's fine. 

I just want to feel normal again. It makes me so  sad.

546,"Some backstory here. I am currently 15 weeks pregnant, I have been with my spouse for 6.5 years. We have been living with his parents for 2 years. We live in his bedroom and there is one bathroom and his dad wakes up at 5am every morning and turns on the blender (we all live on one floor and you can hear EVERYTHING AND EVERY MOVEMENT) and I am already sleep deprived as it is and essentially we are ready to move out yesterday. We are in the process of getting approved for a mortgage and working out some kinks with that. In the meantime we have found a great and affordable basement apartment to rent in so we can still save for a house and live on our own. We are almost in our thirties and my spouse told his parents last night and his mother is really not happy. She expects us to live there for eternity essentially and us all get a house together. His parents are great people and I am thankful they have let us stay with them for the past two years (not for free). However, at this point with a baby coming we are ready to move out, how can we ease the mother into the idea of us getting our own place without rocking the boat?",01Apr2019,1

549,"hello, i was in a long distance relationship, it was going very smooth, everything lovely, we would meet every month or so. Then talks started about marriage, &amp; families got introduced. Her family loves me to death, when marriage talks started she got scared i assumed &amp; said not right now i need time. This is fine, but time turned into a million excuses. &amp; one by one i got rid of the excuses, the last thing was i don’t know if i can leave where i live. So i showed her my bank account &amp; told her you don’t have to, i’ll come &amp; live where you are. If your love is true &amp; everything you say u mean, i’ll move to you. &amp; it still wasn’t a YES. Me &amp; her connect on so many levels, i don’t get why this is happening. She claims to love me &amp; gets so jealous &amp; starts crying if i bring up meeting someone else, but doesn’t want to be with me like that? It makes no sense to me. So i ended it &amp; said i did all i could to end up with you. &amp; you refuse to. Me personally i can’t keep doing this &amp; then one day you just leave, you show no signs of wanting to end up with me other then crying if i say i want out of this. When she talks about the future it’s never about me, it’s about her career &amp; that stuff. She’s not cheating or doing something like that, Is she just really confused, scared &amp; lost? She’s told me she is before??? I think she wants to get married &amp; all like she says, but just not to me, but at the same time she doesn’t want to see me go? it’s kind of like a Selena Gomez &amp; Justin Bieber thing to be honest. I don’t get it. I hope someone can shed some light on this for me.. &amp; if u need anymore information please let me know. Cause this is truly causing me some heartache. ",01Apr2019,3

558,"I’m in my early twenties and I’m a full time college student with two jobs. Before anyone says drop it, or you’re doing too much at once- I know that but I don’t have many other options. I keep messing things up and being absent minded, today my manager asked me if I can work on Wednesday morning and I said yes, completely forgetting I have an appointment that day, in the morning. I’m kind of a pushover and I’m a broke college student who also needs money which is why I said yes right away.

Honestly I can’t stop beating myself up because I make mistakes like this daily and it’s so frustrating. I’m so beyond drained, and I feel like a robot at this point. I forget little things like that and I don’t know how to be patient with myself anymore, or understanding. Honestly I don’t have a very large support system either. It’s just me and I’m very lost and alone. ",01Apr2019,1
559,"Like I said. 
There is no one, at all, that I can honestly say I feel close to. And it sucks, because I CRAVE that close bond, but I just don’t have it and I have no idea how to get it. 
Honestly - I love my family, but I don’t feel close to them. I could walk out of this house, never return and I doubt I’d miss any of them. I hate that. It makes me feel so bad, because I know my parents and my siblings would miss me if I left and I wish I could say the same. I just can’t. 
There was maybe one time, when I was like 12, were I felt close to someone. She was my best friend and I can honestly say I LOVED her (platonically) A good 7 yrs into our friendship she decided to replace me - she would tell me she had to be somewhere then run off to hang with a bunch of other girls, straight up ran away from me, hid from me, etc. 
Idiot me, being 12 and losing my favourite person, handled it really badly. 
I mention that because I think it fucked me right up in the “close friends” section, what with the way little me handled it and how much it hurt. (I don’t think I’m even over it yet after all this time - tears still come up when I think about it too much) I might be wrong, but I thought it’s probably relevant...

Anyway. Yeah. Idk how to be close with anyone but I DESPERATELY want to be. I think it’s connected to an experience younger me had with a close friend at the time, but I might be wrong. Any ways I can get over it/ how to become close with someone?

562,"I started my first big girl job 3 months ago after finishing my education. I don't want to give too much away but I work at a job with patients which requires me to sometimes stay after 5pm until 8pm and sometimes come in early in the morning at 7:30. I have worked some weekends as well, but not often. The nights and early mornings occur at least once, if not twice a week. My hours are 9-5 but sometimes I have to stay past these hours and I was told this when I was first interviewed. My coworkers work hourly, and I am salaried. They tell me all the time to just make up for my extra time by coming in late the next morning, or by asking my boss to add extra days to my vacation time (I only get 10 a year), since I have worked a few weekends. If my coworkers work late one night, they'll make up for it the next day by coming in late or leaving early. They tell me as long as you put in your 9hrs, you're good. I told them I wasn't told any of that yet and I don't feel comfortable asking my boss to leave work early, or arrive late in the morning just to make up for the extra time I put in. They also get paid for overtime and I don't since I'm salaried and not hourly. They told me today that I need to grow a backbone because I've been working nonstop for 2 weeks including this past weekend and now I'm going to be working early mornings and nights 3 times this week. They said I need to speak up because I won't be able to pull 12 hr days forever and it's not fair to me. I agree with them a million percent, but I also feel as though it's not my job to ask to go home, especially since I just started working here 3 months ago. If my boss felt like I could go home, he would have told me by now. I work with him every day and it's not like he never has a chance to bring this up. He knows how much I work and that I'm here early mornings, late nights, and sometimes weekends, he just hasn't offered to make up for my extra hours. My roommate told me it's illegal to make me work 14 days in a row without a day off, but my boyfriend thinks I need to just stick it out since I just started on this job. My boss is super intimidating so I don't want to just ask him straight up. I have another coworker in his 70's who's been here 20 years, salaried like me, and he sometimes comes in early and stays a little later (not as often as me though, not by far), and he never gets to make up for his extra time here, he just deals with it.

I like her, we share a lot in common and she's pretty attractive, but I don't want to go through another relationship again only to have it fail. Honestly I'm afraid of it.

Should I let her go and wait for another opportunity to arise, or just pull a 'fuck it card' and let it happen? Because I have no idea at this point, I'm just afraid of going through another fucking break up that'll destroy me.

569,"Tl;Dr: I (23f) have two sisters (10f and 11f) who still believe in santa, the tooth fairy, and the Easter bunny. 

When they we're little it was always really fun to go all out at christmas time to really make everything magical. I always just assumed they would figure it out for themselves eventually that it was all fake but they never have. In fact they have been kind of solidified in their belief. They think they have seen proof of santa and stuff. 

I think they have gotten too old to still believe but are also too old for my mom to be able to explain in a nice way that it was fake. One sister even confronted my mom around the holidays and said that she would be really upset if it wasn't true. Around 7-8 seems like a good time to sit your kids down and talk with them about this stuff but they seem too stuck in it now. 

Also we are an atheist family and it seems hypocritical to tell them all this stuff about santa and then expect them to not believe in religion. I am also not the parent here and my mom seems happy to just keep letting this go until they figure it out for themselves and are crushed.

572,"&amp;#x200B;

was in high school as a younger boy. She was an older girl. She inserted herself into my life slowly like laughing at my jokes butting into conversations responding to stuff to talk to me or laughing. Asking me to repeat stuff to her then wait for me after class to scare me after we talk. I met her because she laughed long and hard at a bad joke I made then asked me to repeat it to her then after I talked to her waited after class for me to pop out say boo.She began finding any way to talk to me. While talking got red made no eye contact and smiled while hiding her face. Blushed around me. We’d joke around and tease each other a game between us. Her friends acted funny. Her friend pushed me to her. Her friend would ask me to be around them and find any excuse for me to, when her friend sat between us and talked to me and flirted with me she didn't seem to happy had an attitude. She wanted to be next to me and didn't want her friend between us in pictures. We started taking selfies and she'd want me to get close to her for all. She sent me the picture so I could post she would like it then tell me in person. She would approach me with her friend and her friend would just push me to her, if I ignored them or walked away they would follow me and just continue trying to talk to me. She got dressed up and her friend came and got me for a selfie with her. She found any way to talk to me and compliment me. Hover around me and try to talk to me, approaching me with her friends help.When I was minding my own business she would giggle say my name. Do it when I looked at her. Blush when I say hi. She liked a picture with my dad tagged in it to then tell me she likes it, so she can show up on both our notifications. While talking held never ending eye contact and smiled not stopping in silence. I'd break eye contact and she continues standing in front of me staring at me. She found out info about me to tell me. When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said ""Nobody else is as big as you"". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments.

As I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. I saw her at her work and she did that. I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught and the supervisor said something and she was shocked.

Well now we go to the same college she saw me when shes walking into her class and I was leaving that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me shows up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside. Nobody does this and everyone else in her class is not there. Everyone else waits in their car between classes. Her friend acts like I don't exist when she sees me around and only went up to talk to me once. Her friend got a boyfriend and he lived right next door to me, she never said hi or anything.

I am just frustrated and upset in general because she never stops flirting with me in general and does it aggressively and when I ignore just persists and then eventually lashes out at me and does bad stuff. Then has some issue over stuff then lashes out at me. She never stops and just perists, she lashes out has an attitude over something stupid and starts up again. I get uncomfortable and ignore, she gets upset, angry and lashes me out. She showered me with so much attention, flattery and compliments. Selfies but I just can't get space or a break and when I get uncomfortable and ignore her or show negative body language/ response she just throws a fit and lashes out doing bad stuff. She acted like a supporting friend and shows support for stuff but then gets mad and take it away lashing out over that stuff. She just feels like a flirty big sister and using that dynamic to her advantage pushing me around and in a way bullying me. I just feel discouraged because I feel like she is the only female friend I really ever had. Her and her friend. Her friend would find any excuse to be around me and offered me a ride when it's unnecessary. She might know I am autistic because she is known for having a short fuse blowing up at people and she doesn't treat me that way and been extra patient wouldn't care if I interrupted her, ask questions on topics I am fixated with, instantly believe stuff I say take my side on stories when she was upset with me. Gets upset with me and then gets over it. I am just heartbroken because she feels like the best female friend i ever had and will never have someone like her again. The best female friend I had but she bossed me around and kind've abused me and has been for years. I have been hurting for years. I want to be friends but the way she acts makes me not want anything to do with her but I do care about her and love her platonically.

TL;DR

I met a girl when I was younger she did stuff that's impossible to ignore to get my attention. She continued this stuff for years and flirts to the point it is uncomfortable and doesn't stop then has an issue when I get mad or uncomfortable and ignore her and she lashes out. She does things that are impossible to ignore and continues this into college. Showing up 30 minutes early to her class when I am in the class before, and walking by a lot and standing in the door, waiting outside. I have not felt comfortable by how she acts and have been ignoring her.

575," I don't know if this will get buried or if people will just chalk it up to me being a teen, I really hope it's just me going through a phase to be honest.

But anyways, I just feel like ending it all sometimes, it feels like a bout of just depression constantly hiding and then hitting me and it's slowly draining the life out of me. I have several friends, if not, acquaintances that I tend to joke around with, I make the occasional dark joke, they laugh, etc. etc. but I have nobody I feel close to, two of my friends I've known since I was really little but I know that the only reason they tolerate me is because of the tenure and the other's deal with my shit cause they probably think I have autism. I probably do.

My family are all fine, they're not nasty, they don't hate me or dislike my and I want to think I'm close to them but I feel like I'm just draining the life out of them, I feel like I'm just a leech and I just constantly am burning through their energy.

School's not a problem either, I have issues with some classmates, but they mostly leave me alone. I get good grades as well just naturally, I'm good at lots of things but great at nothing but being useless. I'm so confused about my future sometimes as well, if I have one. The subjects I chose to major in where honestly just random with some being based on mildly liking the subject. I have no clue what to do and I've planned on just ending it all maybe once I turn 16.

Most the time I just hope of getting ran over, or something else. I don't want my family to think it's their fault when it happens, I just want to leave. Sometimes I've honestly thought of taking whatever saving I have and hopping on the closest train and just disappearing from their lives. I have the money and I know where the train station is. I know the cost of the fares and how to get to the furthest point from home. I honestly just hate myself and often contemplate just throwing myself off a bridge.

581," Title explains it all, I was bullied on a daily basis all my life because I was quieter than the rest of the people, that made me depressed and more depressed until being depressed was normal to me, I was just used to it and it felt normal after being sick for so long. A few months ago I hit the lowest point of my life, I would go home after school every day and sit in front of my PC all night and play games so I could avoid socializing and avoid the real world. This went on for weeks, months, I would lock my room and play games all fucking day, eat like a pig and not give a fuck about tomorrow. I had lost all motivation to lose weight, make friends, socialize and my grades went to shit. This continued for days until one day I finally asked myself in the mirror ""What the fuck am I doing with my life?"" and after that I decided to go out every day and try to socialize, meet people and even started working at my brother's place. I thought this would change things but it feels the same, I still feel broken and fucked beyond repair, I just can't make friends and I'm just so sick of living alone like this, without friends or someone to love and be loved, when I see couples on the street I get frustrated and tell myself what a loser I am. There are days where I'm not depressed (At least that's what I think) and days where I would 100 percent eat a gun if I had access to one. I don't feel human anymore and I don't think I can live like this for any longer. I really want to have a life, why can't I be like everyone else? Happy, surrounded by friends? I'm fucking trying.

589,"So, the day I have been afraid of for the last 3 years is inching ever closer; graduation day. As of right now, I dont have any real talents or passions (at least none that arent useless in real life) but i cant really expect to do anything without a college degree. 

So far, I've been able to just get by every year somehow and I managed to to be able to get scholarships for college because I'm currently the valedictorian (not really deserved because i dont even have a job and everyone else in my class does) and I have some experience being in the classes that I'm choosing to go to because I've been in an early college program there for some time now.

A lot of people will look at my situation and say ""you have no reason to complain, when I was in high school (insert insane barrier to success) but I still made it anyway"" which doesnt really do anything to help me find what I'm supposed to do next. I just dont really have the drive or moneylust to care that much about making a lot of money or having nice things to chase opportunities that are presented to me that are outside the range of easy obtainability (if that makes sense). Instead, I just end up getting this fear feeling in my chest, similiar to that which is felt when you do something wrong and you know you will get in trouble for it.

So I have these options that I am not taking advantage of and this leads to me really getting mad at myself because for everyone else, this all seems to come naturally to them. They learned how to drive, they have friends, they have a dream/goal, they have talents, they have experience, and then they move on to the next phase of life with relative ease. For me, I'm too incompetent and fearful to really compete.

Hopefully, this makes sense (I have a tendency to jump from thought to thought so it may seem a little incoherent) how would/have you guys dealt with this situation?

590,"Backstory: I (24f) recently went on a date (This past Thursday) with a guy (28). I felt that it went well. We talked for 2 1/5 hours and there were no awkward lulls in the conversation. I can't speak for him but I really enjoyed myself. It seamed to me that the date only came to an end when I saw the time and realized I had to leave to pack for a trip and he only had 30 minutes to get to a social sports game with other friends. As we left, both of us said we enjoyed ourselves.

The timing of this date was odd because we met the night before my week long trip. I followed up the next day with another thank your text and prompt to continue our conversation from the night before. He responded and we continued texting through out the day. I woke up the next morning (Saturday), responded to his last text from the night before and have yet to receive a response.

I completely respect that he simply may not be interested... it happens... but our texting conversation was also going strong. What are your thoughts on shooting him another text about his weekend? Should I wait until closer to the end of my trip and suggest we meet up again? Or is this a lost cause?",01Apr2019,1

593,"So, in February I (26f) was laid off from one of my two jobs (barista) due to shutting down two locations of the local chain. Literally a text message was sent out Sunday night and I was let go Monday morning. My other job is a part-time hair stylist at a corporate salon, in which I have been building my clientele and working really hard but I still don't have enough to support myself yet. I really relied on my second income to help make ends meet.  


I applied for unemployment, but because I have my stylist income I get a fraction of what I made with my barista income, so I'm no longer able to pay for just the basic of living. I'm fortunate enough to have qualified for food stamps, and I make just enough to pay my portion of the rent and that's literally it. I depleted the little I had in savings to help make ends meet.  


I couldn't afford to register my car right away, and of course wound up getting a ticket. I was confident that I would be able to register the car and pay the ticket by the due date, but that doesn't look like it's going to be the case. Of course the obvious answer here is to get rid of the car since I obviously can't afford one, but I'm afraid I'll put myself in an even worse position if I do that because I work across town- the bus is an option but I'm still applying for second jobs and it's not like the bus is gonna be able to take me to a 5:00am shift where I live.  


I also am thinking about transferring to a salon closer to where I live, but I'm afraid I'll be working even less hours AND lose the clientele that I've built where I am now. I already come in to the salon during my off hours to accommodate clients. I asked if it was possible to be put on the schedule for longer days, but we just hired several new girls and there are no hours to give.  


I just don't know what to do or where to go from here. I feel like I'm just barely keeping my head above water to survive, and I have these things that need to be paid for that I just can't. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.

594,"When I was in my junior if college I stopped going to pursue a career in poker. I had a full ride and a 3.3 GPA but was miserable so I left. I was young and naive, didn't grasp yet how much work you have to put in to become a top tier player. I was talented but raw. I know when I dropped out many in my family/friends looked down on me, thought I was throwing away a great opportunity. Some said something, others didn't, but i could always feel it. They didn't see my vision. To be honest it was rough and success didnt come right away. I really needed to get beaten to my knees and humbled. The struggle is what drove me to be more than I previously was, not to mention help from JP, Gary V, etc.

Fast forward a few years and I have put in thousands of hours playing/studying and everything seems to be culminating now. I got 3rd, 10th, 1st. In back to back to back Tournaments all on one buy in. Entry fee ranging from 250-350 and entrants from 300-720. 

 I would like to post on Facebook because those in the poker community have been very supportive of me and it feels great when they rail me all day to see how I'm doing. Honestly I didnt get that from alot of friends and family growing up and it feels great to receive support and respect. 

On the flip side inevitably someone will ask how much I won or similar questions and I feel like I'm flexing because I know that these are significant sums of money. I'm a very reserved person and on some level it feels wrong to post. 

What people gotta understand tho is I don't have anything else. I don't have the experience of graduating college. I don't have co-workers to go drink with. I have a goal that I have put so many hours into and when I get a little success it just feels good to share.

I used to be really good friends with this boy about 4 years ago. we talked a lot and always hung out at school, we havent seen each other in 2 years since he left school. one evening while we were texting, we promised something to each other. I broke that promise just a few days after making it. it was really shitty of me, I have been feeling very guilty since breaking the promise, it has been 4 years. I have been having these urges to text him and tell him everything about it, and to apologise to him even though he doesn't know I broke it. a year after this (so 3 years ago) he confessed that he liked me and asked me to be his girlfriend. I being the stupid teenager I was declined, although I had liked him for years. I also want to apologise to him about this. I liked him, but when I had the opportunity of being with him I got scared and started overthinking. I really regret declining him, I still havent had a bf and im 19.

&amp;#x200B;

the past years after we lost contact I have been getting these urges to text him pouring my heart out to him, apologising for breaking the promise and saying no to him. but I don't know if it would be a smart idea to do so. should I text him? because this has been weighing me down. wouldn't it be weird? we havent talked to each other in 2 years, me texting him would come out of the blue for him. would it hurt him? make him angry? I think of texting him several times a month, and have about 50 notes on my phone of the texts all written out. but I can't bring myself to send them. I am too scared that they will hurt him and he'll think im a bad person. but I also really want to thank him for everything, if he didn't make me make that promise I probably would not be here today.

602,"As my title says, my boyfriend recently leased a room in his apartment to a guy who works at the same company as he does. He thought, well, he works at the same company, must not be crazy or anything, and he seemed nice enough. Pretty soon it became clear that the roommate (let’s call him W), has some issues.

W loves to talk about himself and his sexual exploits. He LOVES to talk about women he’s been with, how much of a man he is, even going so far as to think my boyfriend is weird because he won’t do something just because someone says he’s not “man enough” to do it. His father is extremely homophobic and even told W when my BF invited him on a guy’s weekend that because they weren’t bringing girls they were gay, and wouldn’t let W buy the car he wanted because it is a “woman’s car”.

W is VERY smart in his field and my BF says he’s basically a walking textbook about his field. But he downplays my BFs work even though they are literally at the same level in the company because he always thinks everything he does is more important. He has a very hard time knowing when he is being offensive.

He doesn’t pick up on social cues, the first time I met him which is when I stayed for spring break he proceeded to tell me very personal things about his life and make me very uncomfortable, and he just talks and talks and doesn’t get the hint when you stop engaging and he just keeps talking.

He also is homophobic, I’m guessing his dad ingrained that in him, as he has called a gay person a “faggot” to my boyfriend, and I am bisexual (female, so W would not know this unless it somehow was mentioned). My BF told him not to say that anymore, but he is still very prejudiced against gay people. 

Since he is so technically intelligent and has multiple degrees in his field but has zero social skills and seems to not be able to think for himself as his dad seems to have taught him to be intolerant, I think he may have some degree of mental disability.

I understand that everyone makes mistakes and no one gets it every time. I just feel stressed out, instead of challenged and learning something new. I’ve noticed my ability to retain the information from the class has lessened and it’s probably from the lack of interest after seeing how things really are.

I met a girl some time ago, we really liked eachother and decided to have a relationship togheter, all this thing had a small problem at the beginning. This girl born in 1997 (I'm from 1996) had a very weird and long relationship with her horse instructor and he's from the 1968. Her father is suffering from liver cancer and she might have looked at 17 (when this relationship started with this older man) for a father looking figure. Unfortunately in Italy is not illegal to have this kind of relationships.
She left him because she couldn't handle him anymore: 30 years older, they always had fights, he always wanted sex with her but she didn't want anymore to have that kind of relationship with him, his sons hated him and her since they are about our age, and he had sexchats with transexuals people during this relationship (maybe, but I'm not sure, he even paid prostitutes and such).
She met me and decided to leave him, we had a really beautiful relationship togheter and we had plans for the future to live togheter, never had a single fight always enjoyed what the other was doing, it was really like a fairytale.
Unfortunately she had this horse in his place, gifted by him some years ago to manage to get her in bed so she had to keep seeing him, I wanted to pay to move it somewhere else so she hadn't to see him anymore. But I'm not a jealous person and i don't like to push or force others doing things, so I didn't. He was paying the rent of the horse before and then after some time he said to her she could work as instructor for kids in his riding school. I thought he was just being nice, not noticing it was an excuse to see her more and more.
This girl is really insecure of herself, she has panic attacks and she is very vulnerable. He disguised as a friend and said that the story was over between them. 
At a certain point she decided to break up, saying she didn't feel anything anymore for me and that she had to stay alone. We had plans to live togheter travel togheter and i really loved her and I probably still do so. I was destroyed i couldn't eat or sleep and I'm fortunate to have my father who brought me to his place to stay calm and better, otherwise I would have most likely killed myself or I would have ended up in the hospital because I refused to eat and I couldn't sleep. I know for some people who had even worse problems it might sound like a joke, but i never felt so much sadness and pain in my entire life.
She said we would have been friends still and all those things.. then she started to ignore me hardly, even on my birthday. Then after 14 days i decided to text her and ask why she was ignoring me that way, and she told me she went back to this 51 years old man.
I was angry, very angry and I couldn't understand how. We had some fights via text until one of her bestfriends confessed to me this man kept harassing her for months to leave me, saying the worse things possible about me to her, trying to instill in her doubts about our relationship. He kept texting her and calling her all the time. She told me also that my ex girlfriend was heavilly manipulated by him, I know she was weak to fall for those lies and words, but I can't forgive this man, he's really an horrible human being.
Then yesterday she removed me for instagram (she knows i would have seen that) and then she didn't remove me on facebook so i could see that she's back officially in a relationship with him stating since 2016 wiping me off from existence basically. It sounds like a teenager thing, but it really hurts.
She is frail, very frail and now even angry with me so I can't like talk with her or see her to do anything. She lives with her parents that always disliked him but they are not aware of the relationship with him, and i don't even know if i should try to tell them about this. I don't know what to do, I don't like revenge but if i spread this story people will stop attend to his riding school place. What should I do? I feel like to vomit everytime when i think that he's having sex with her, I really hate him for using a girl with all this problems, destroying an healthful relationship, and ruining my happiness.
Maybe i should have listened her mother when she told me to try to convince her to avoid this dude, but I'm just a really good guy that didn't want to force her in doing something like that, because I trusted her with all myself.
So, now I'm lost, i don't know what to do, I don't feel depressed like before but I'm very sad about all this and I'm preoccupied with her that left all her friends saying that no one understands her and basically getting more and more walled by him, he forbid her to see any friends that are male, and her friends decided not to support her in this awful relationship.
Any suggestion is really appreciated, maybe in 5 years i will laugh hard about all this because it's just crazy, but now I'm really lost on what to do. 
Thanks for reading this long story and I'm sorry for the probably many grammar fails I've done.

It's just like I  kind of learned what people expect from me and so i behave like it in  order for them not to think that somethings wrong.

I  myself believe that i might am kind of psychopathic or depressive. I  generally don't show any emotions and this lead to some pretty awkward  situations in the past when emotions were ""appropriate"" As my parents  suspected that something was wrong i denied everything and further on i  began to act emotions.

The only place  where i get truly emotionally is on my pc in videogames. In casual life i  don't feel like i want to show any feelings. I kind of feel like it  makes me weak and vulnerable. Most of the feelings i have in life  (outside pc) are negative feelings. I started to read books about  psychology, feelings and behavour and self confidence. That helped me  being less introverted and i started to build up a social life. But I  always think about how i only do these social interactions so satisfy  others expectations of me, like my parents or teachers. I can't trust  anybody on my school so i don't want to be friends with any.

611,"Back in 2016 I had a membership with LA Fitness, a few months into my membership my bank transitioned from MasterCard to Visa and I was issued a new debit card. At the time I was a bit irresponsible and since I hardly visited the gym I decided to not update them with my new information. They called me a few times and sent me an email for the next three months stating they had issues with my payment and I needed to update the information, which I ignored. 

Fast forward to 2019 and I’m considering a membership with them, it’s the closest gym in the area and conveniently next to my job. I guess my question is, will they be able to pull this past information? And better yet will I be billed for those months they weren’t able to collect? I was on a month to month plan, and never received anything stating that there were outstanding balances. Nor was I ever sent to collections. 

I tried logging in to my online account to see if there was a balance but it’s inactive. I’m a bit hesitant to call them/email them about this because I don’t want to open up a can of worms, especially if they weren’t even actively monitoring it.

613,"**TLDR:** I (Male, 28) live with 3 roommates. All mutual friends from college. I've had lots of different roommates. I'm an adult. Nothing special is going on in my life. But my one roommate has made me feel progressively more and more unwelcome in my apt until I really don't want to be here anymore. It feels toxic. 

Roommate 1: a friend of mine 

Roommate 2: another friend of mine (guy), who I have lived with before. It was fine then, although he can also be a bit judgy. He moved to NYC for a year and started dating roommate 3 before we all moved in together. 

Roommate 3: another friend of mine - I was the least close with her over the years but always liked her. She's dating Roommate 2 and they share a room. 

**Current situation**

I don't want to make assertions that aren't accurate, but here is my best summary: Roommate 3 is extremely judgemental, emotionally volatile, and on a ""high horse,"" but in a very passive-aggressive way. 

She always has an immediate judgment and opinion on whatever is at hand. It's often anger or outrage - she has determined that she understands the situation best and is an arbiter of morality, and it seems like she thinks her responses are justified. She is extremely political, and makes moralizations about anything and everything (e.g. ""people who don't vote are ruining this country!"" She recently told my friend that she ""approved"" of her boyfriend - no one was asking though). 

She is also a social worker / therapist. I am not sure if that is the result of her personality, the cause of her personality, or something inbetween. Not my business really. But she is constantly projecting ""daddy issues,"" and ""traumatic events"" onto people we know, reality TV characters, and anyone else she can judge. Also, people don't seem to make mistakes - every action she doesn't approve of is coming from some deep-seated psychological event, in her opinion. 

In short, it feels like, if you don't agree with her, you are a bad person. I also don't want to share any information because she ""shoots first and asks questions later"" - she will have an emotional reaction or outburst rather than considering the situation. Even worse, because she's so passive aggressive, sometimes she won't say anything but, but will report back to her bf (also my friend).

It's made me really uncomfortable. I've been spending less and less time in the apartment due to this, and I also took a huge unrelated financial hit in 2018 (self-employed, rough year for my business). I'm totally fine, but just eating more beans and rice and less fancy meals. But roommate 3 started gossiping with roommate 1 that ""I'm anorexic."" Roommate 1 told me that, and it made me so frustrated that I literally just stopped eating at home. I probably shouldn't have done that, but that's what I did.

Roommate 2 - her BF and my friend - has also become increasingly judgemental, angry, and similar to her. I'm no expert, but they seem to be highly codependent and have a hard time functioning without each other.

Anyway, I hate walking in my front door. I stay in my room until she leaves (I realize this is a bad habit and try not to, but it's so uncomfortable). I feel unwelcome in my own apartment. 

**Conclusion**: I don't know why she's like this. It's not my business. I'm sure her life is very difficult. But how do I ""take back"" my ""right"" to feel secure in my own apt? 

Normally, I'd just talk to her. ""Hey - I totally respect that you are entitled to your own feelings, but sometimes I feel uncomfortable when..."" This is how I've always handled roommate issues. It's not rocket science. But I feel like she will just high-horse or gaslight me, and take even more offense, and team up on me with her bf (rapidly becoming not my friend anymore). It feels like she is constantly serving as a therapist to other people, and then unleashes her stress on her personal issues (or random issues) when she's off the clock. Just a guess - not my place to be guessing though. 

Sorry this is confusing. What on earth do I do? ",01Apr2019,4
614,"So. I'm currently 16 and a first year in high school. Essentislly this means I'm still a kid who doesn't know shit about anything. That also means I don't always make the best decisions, and I'd like to improve on that.
    So the *HUGE* and *HEAVY* load I'm carrying right now is that I got left on read. And it pisses me off. I asked this person to hang out. Nothing romantic. They just didn't answer. I mean,, ok? I guess that's a no? Saying no is fine, they don't owe me anything and are not required to like me. Just annoys me when people don't tell me their reasons. I mean, I guess they don't have to do that either, but even a simple ""no"" is more polite. I'm awsre there's achance they were going to reply and just forgot or are super busy or whatever. But I'm still kinda hurt over that. I shouldn't be, it's such a stupid reason but I can't help it. I almost never ask anyone anywhere so this rare instance I do I don't even get an answer.
    So my immediate reaction is to get pissed off and call them out on their behavior. I didn't do that because I felt it's too impulsive and immature. I'll see them tomorrow and I really want to give some back: just ignore them completely or something like that. I won't do that because it's petty and stupid.
   I'm aware this shouldn't be such a big deal. Happens to everyone, right? But right now I can't really control my feelings even though I can somewhat rationalize them. How can I handle situations like these better and more maturely in the future? If I can just not get this upset over something so small, I won't. How should I ""cope"" with negative emotions or upsetting situations? Right now I just don't really talk about it because I have no way of expressing almost any personal negative emotion in any way. I just want to become more mature so I can handle life better. ",01Apr2019,2
615,"I noticed I got a notification from FB that this girl I've been friends with since elementary school was in my area (think she's just visiting, not even sure if she's still here). I've not kept in contact with her since graduating from HS (~10 years ago), mainly because I ended up moved to a different state and got busy with my career.

I haven't looked at her profile in several years, just this notification I got made me remember her. Looking on her profile I found out that she is married and is pregnant, which is awesome, I'm happy for her.

I was thinking about messaging her to catch up, but I don't know if this is appropriate given that it's been so long and her relationship status. Also I will admit I had some attraction to her back in grade school, but never pursued a relationship, didn't think it would work anyway. I really don't think she knew, but can't be sure. Of course, I'm not going to bring any of that up.

However I am leaning towards not doing it, just not sure if it's a good idea. There is nothing that went on in our past that would make it a bad idea I think, but I've never contacted someone after this long before.

Maybe just let her reach out to me if she wants (although I have no idea if she even knows I live here). Thoughts?

She’s great. We’re really compatible, comfortable, and encouraging to each other. I absolutely love and adore her. I definitely have that “feeling” people talk about.

The one thing we get into it about is her trust issues. Unfortunately she dated some assholes. She was cheated on in most of her relationships. It’s making it really hard for her to just let go and trust me.

I’ve let her play with my phone, and if a female texts she clams up and acts cold. It’s never flirtatious and I’m never flirtatious back. She’s always concerned because “that’s what happened with her and ‘so and so’.” I’ve told her I’m not like ‘so and so’, and absolutely don’t condone cheating nor would I cheat on her. 

I know she’s “damaged”(as she calls herself), but I’m kind of irked. I’m moving into sales, where I’ll obviously have to talk to other women one way or the other. I’ve told her I shouldn’t be forced to walk on coals, just because other women exist and I talk to them, and that’s just gotten her upset.

To make things worse, every time I feel the urge to believe that something the person has done makes them a 'not so good/ bad' person, I write it off as me having misunderstood their good intentions or that I just 'don't get it'. I'm an idiot basically. I know people can be bad, but I just don't realise it when I face the situation.

Well first off, how do you decide whether a person is 'good' or 'bad'?

627,"So I agreed in the beginning of the year to babysit for a semester for an old friend. She has 2 kids (ages 5 &amp; 10). I did it as a favor because they live pay check to pay check. Anything they sign the kids up for always ends with ""that costs more money ."" So I agreed for half of minimum wage to commit to 4 days a week to: get them ready in the morning, drive them to school, pick them up, and watch them after school 2x a week. She relies on my so much that she even asked me to not go on my planned summer vacation. My main issue right now is that I'm a full time college student as well.

630,"I have been going to college on and off for the past 6 years. Right out of high school I went to a university and lived on campus, first time living away from my parents so I had a lot of independence. My first semester I did okay in my classes, though I did fail my English class because of a combination of me always doing poorly in English and my lack of discipline. The second semester I did really poorly, I failed all of my classes. I couldn't handle my newfound independence and neglected schoolwork to play a lot of video games. It also did not help that I did not enjoy any of my classes because I chose a major that I thought I wanted to commit to. I dropped my GPA low enough to be on academic probation, so I needed to bring it up and the next semester I moved back home. I ended up not being able to maintain the GPA I needed and was put on academic suspension.   


I took a semester off, went to community college on and off trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my future, what I wanted to get a degree in, not failing any classes. Fast forward to a year ago, I apply to come back to university and finish my studies in computer science, I love computers and games and I want to do something in that field. I am admitted back into university and I am given a list of things that I need to maintain since I was on academic suspension previously. I did okay this first semester back, but I failed calculus this time which I need for my major.   


Now I am in my second semester and I am only taking 3 classes just so I can make sure I do well in all of them, but here I am failing 2 out of the 3. I can't learn calculus, I have tried a tutor and it went okay for a little but then I fell behind in my class and felt so lost. The other class I am failing is the second computer science class and right from the first day I felt lost, I felt like I already could not catch up even though in the prerequisite class I got a B and thought I did okay. I have never really been an academic, even since elementary school I have never gotten straight A's but I really have not done well in any classes that I don't find interesting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I want to do computer science anymore because I realized I don't have a passion for it. I realized I have never used any of my free time to research or delve into programming at all. The only thing that I have a passion for is video games, still. I have tried streaming and am still doing it and I like it a lot, way more than I thought. Nobody really watches me but sometimes one or two of my friends will hop in and they type in chat and for some reason I think it is so much fun. It sucks, but I feel like a 12 year old saying that I want to be a streamer. To be completely honest there is not anything that I am particularly good at either, so I can't find anything that I could do with that.

I have no clue what I want to do. I am most afraid of disappointing people, particularly my parents. I don't want them to think I am a failure. I feel so lost and like I am so behind in life. All of my friends are done with school or they are pursuing their graduate degree, meanwhile I am technically a sophomore in college. I feel like I keep messing up and I just want to be happy with what I am doing instead of always being embarrassed when being in class because the teacher knows I'm failing the class, instead of always worrying what to tell my parents or family or coworkers when they ask how school is going, instead of worrying what my future holds and what I am going to do.

634,"This situation began about five years ago. My uncle (moms brother) owns his own business. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer and had to have surgery to remove it. Because he would be out of work for months, and because I had some experience working with him before, I agreed to take over his work during his convalescence. After all, this man has done more for me in my life than all the other members of my family combined. He was basically my dad growing up. So I took over his business and did the work without asking for money. He couldn't afford to pay me anyway, his business is barely lucrative enough to support him alone. 

Over time, he gradually came back to work. I stayed on to help him, again, without pay, because he needed the help. This was years ago, and yet nothing has changed. He is fully recovered and capable of work. Yet, somehow, now, he has too much work to do alone. Maybe it's because he took on a few more clients, or maybe he's just getting old and can't handle the labor as well anymore. (This is hard outdoor work, and we live in a subtropical climate. It's hot,  all the time.) Whatever the reason, his business could not survive now if I left. Unfortunately, my uncles ability to pay me has not improved. I maybe can make $100 in a good week. (We work 50-60hrs a week.) Anything I make is cash under the table. 

All this was okay until my fiancée lost his job and we had to move in with my parents temporarily. He found work again, but at a large pay cut. We really need another income in order to pay for a new place to live for us and our daughter. I have many marketable skills and would have no problem finding employment. The problem is, if I do find another job, one with a real paycheck and benefits and such, I'll have to quit work with my uncle, and he would likely lose his business. He has social problems which prevent him from hiring new people, not to mention he really can't afford a payroll. He's too young to draw his retirement, so he has to keep working. 

I'm in a position where I need to have an income on paper, something I can prove and pay taxes on. I've brought this to the attention of my family (my mom and uncle mainly), and was made to feel like a total jerk! They seem to think that because I didn't finish college, I'm not capable of anything more than being cheap labor for my uncle, and I should be grateful he lets me work with him. Neither of them, my mom or my uncle, seems to understand the sacrifices I've made to help him (I've been hospitalized several time with injuries or illnesses related to work) despite the many times I've tried to reason with them. So now, I basically feel forced into working hard labor for pennies because if I leave, I'll essentially be driving my uncles business into the ground and he'll lose everything. I absolutely cannot do that to him, regardless of the lack of respect and appreciation he and my mom have for me. 

My fiancée is getting really frustrated at the situation, and is starting to take it out on me. I can't see a way out without feeling like a complete asshole. I feel like I'll let down my father-figure if I leave, but if I stay I have no future at all. I don't know what to do, and I could really use some advice. ",01Apr2019,1
635,"Sorry if this is all a bit nonsensical, I'm not the best at writing up my own stories and to be honest I'm just a bit confused as to what to do.

So I went out with this guy, Jack, for about two months and during that time he hung out with my friends and me. About a month and a half ago, he broke up with me and cut off practically all contact with my group, except for some classes that he has with my friends. It's been difficult for me to get over him because i got way more attached to him than i should have, but after a couple weeks and with help from my friends i started feeling better. However, Jack has started to hang out with us again.

Two or so weeks ago, my group and me were sitting in the cafeteria as we do every day and he came and sat with us. I asked everybody (afterwards) why he was there, and none of them knew. Since that one time, he's sat with us every day and kind of replaced me. We have the *same* personality but for the fact that he's louder than me, so every joke that I make, he makes better. Everything that I say, he says better. I'm starting to feel like i don't exist anymore.

My best friend, Mia, has maths and biology classes with Jack and now, whenever we talk, she's always talking about 'that great thing that Jack did at that party that I wasn't invited to', or, how 'Jack was sooooooo funny at the park yesterday'. I've spoken to a lot of the people about how I'm not comfortable with him being around, but what they all said is:

""Yeah but you're just *one* person, all the *rest* of us like him""

I really don't feel welcome around them anymore.

Whenever he's around, the progress that I've made in moving on from him just disappears, and I'm back to stage one again. My friends don't seem to care that Jack being around is genuinely making me depressed, and I think that they think I'm being petty. For example, one of my best friends told me to 'suck it up and deal with it', which - unsurprisingly - didn't help.

Even Mia, my best friend, doesn't want to be around me anymore. They do so much outside of school that I would usually be involved with, but I'm not. I just hear the stories from the day after.

I have a history of being really lonely as not many people like me much... I think i bore them to hell. I used to be really depressed because of this, and I just really don't want to go back to that place. Iv'e probably missed out a load of stuff that might be helpful but I'm honestly so tired I can't think of any more.

637,"So I'm gonna try to keep this short for the sake of time but I'm stuck right now and could use some outside advice.
About a month ago one of my best friends and my planned college roommate got a terrible case of lysteria and viral meningitis, causing encephalitis (brain issues) that have kept him in the hospital. About a week ago he was able to talk again and regain some muscle control, but only one or two words at a time. After the hospital gave him a different treatment he suffered a seizure that put him back to square one: no real muscle movement besides his head/neck, and he currently can't talk although he is slowly improving again as he has started to mouth words and seems to listen to us when we talk to him. I continue to pray for the best and try to help his family when I can.
So now moving onto the issues I'm having. Our college housing deadline is only a couple weeks away (2 or 3 I'm not sure) and I don't know what I should do because if he doesn't end up recovering in time I would be put in a dorm room by myself if they were to drop him out after the deadline. I really want to hope for the best, and I would love to room with him, but I don't know how realistic that would be. In order for him to come he would have to recover enough to be ready for college by the time August comes. Encephalitis has no real recovery time as it can range from a few weeks to a year, and it seems that the recovery can come suddenly as he was getting better very fast before. Any advice on how I should approach this would be helpful, currently I plan to talk with his mom next time I visit him and just ask her what she thinks but I feel that it would be insensitive to ask her about college while she is going through this insanely difficult time.

It was a combination of an unhealthy relationships, misunderstandings, and rumors which eventually led to my ex’s circle disassociating with me. And frankly, I’m okay with it. They were garbage humans. But I find myself often checking their social media or thinking about them, how they wronged me, etc. I have a form of OCD so I think that adds to this. Basically.... how can I make myself stop thinking about them? When I actually see them, I act like they don’t exist (much like how they act towards me,) is this making it worse?

652,"So my (21m) parents were in high school when they got pregnant and were together for a while after I was born. They split up when I was a baby and my Dad, for reasons that have never been told to me, has never been a part of my life. I know his name and the names of my grand parents.  Through some google searching I’ve found social media accounts of what I’m pretty sure are my cousins and a half sister ( I still have my dad’s last name and it isn’t common by any means). 
I’d like to reach out to someone because it feels like a whole part of me has been missing my whole life. I’m just not sure who or how I should do it. I’m not very active on social media and it seems like none of them are either.

I’ve been trying to apply for jobs since I was 16, and when I finally got one, my grandmother cussed the manager out for hiring me and I was forced to quit. I have my permit, but my grandparents thought that if I took a driving course in school that would automatically get me my license, which it didn’t. Now they are making up the excuse that “I’m a girl, and girls aren’t suppose to work,” or “date a man who has lots of money. That’s the only way you’ll be able to make it.” 
When I found out that I had E.Coli a few weeks back, they absolutely refused to take me to the hospital until I stopped going to school. They cancel all my regular doctor checkups, my therapy appointments for anxiety and depression, and my dentist appointments. Even though I’m 17 right now, if I were to reschedule any doctor appointment, she would be right behind me cancelling it.
In 6 months, they have made it clear they are kicking me out. However, they aren’t giving me any money or support to help me until I find a job or home to stay in. I can’t stay with either of my parents as my father is homeless half the country away, and my mother is also homeless. But, I don’t want to stay there. I’m emotionally abused and cussed out on a daily basis, told that I should’ve been aborted, and that if I were to commit suicide, it would be okay because they can just have more grandkids. 
I’m not sure what else to do. I can’t live with a friend, because I don’t have any. I’m not allowed to hang out with friends, and they aren’t allowed to hang out with me.

My friend is supposed to have a counselor however they cannot get one yet. Obviously no one on here is a professional and i appreciate that, but it seems even the 'professionals' I've come across have not helped a singular bit.

661,"Ever since the beginning of 2019, I(24m) haven't really been feeling like myself and stress has been taking over more than happiness can. I'll try and keep my story brief for everyone who may come across it.   


I currently go to school FT,(M-F/8a-3p). I am attending trade school so I can become an Electrician and build upon the entire electrical career. The tuition for the courses are being funded through a small subsidized loan that I've taken out, worth $2500. Come the month of May, the loan will no longer cover the remaining two summer courses for the months of June and July. If I want to continue and graduate in July, I have to pay the remaining balance for the courses that are left. The balance is somewhere around $500-$600 at most. And of course the balance is due before the courses start in late May.  
For current work, I am working at Office Max PT, and rack up anywhere from 15-25 hours a week at most. My expenses are... Not so great. My car has been vandalized twice this year, and I paid $1300 both times to have it repaired and in driving condition again. I was without my car for the past two months just before this past Saturday, so its been a combination of Lyft, Uber, public transportation, and asking for rides. Next, I am paying off my credit card, monthly, and the card has a lingering $1000 balance on it. I have also been paying my car insurance on time, and every month. My car insurance is about $150. I also have one medical bill that's being paid off monthly as well($25 a month). On top of all this, I must give my parents $250 a month for rent. I'm literally surviving on a paycheck to paycheck lifestyle and am reaching into my emergency funds to make ends meet, but those funds won't last much longer at the rate I'm spending all of this money. 

I'm getting tired of the school thing and waking up just to devote my time to class. I've already done this before when I was in college for my Associates degree, which I already have. I am ready to start working FT again and do the things I enjoy, but I feel like if I drop this program, I will just look like a failure. Money is leaving my account faster than it is entering and I am barely saving any money right now. If I have to, I can pick up a second job soon, but I'm tired of working crazy hours and having little time to rest. I want to have a normal FT job with consistent pay again. 

  
Also, I just ended a 19 month relationship with my ex bf a few weeks ago. I was just so stressed and our views were not the same, so I told him we needed to end things. It did't go too well, but it is now officially over. I am adjusting to life and doing things on my own again, which is not bad at all when it comes to things such as romance.    


I don't know what to do, but I'm starting to give up on this school thing... Sometimes I feel as if my time is being wasted and I just made a huge mistake by investing in college all over again, instead of just making money and moving out on my own. I am not sure if I should just start looking for a steady entry level electrical job now or just finish this program that I'm in.

She then messages out of nowhere ""I want to know everything about you"" and asks me a lot of questions solely focused on me. I answer some of the questions indirectly because for me it raised a few red flags for someone clingy.

 She then gets a Snapchat and sends 1 pic and stops using Snapchat. Then she adds me on Whatsapp and starts messaging me there. The most recent message she sent was, ""Okay then, from now on we use WhatsApp bc I can see when your ignoring me"".

666,"Some backstory before I dig into it:

I work in a locally owned business that has existed in my town since the 80s, it is customer service based, has mom &amp; pop vibes, and we do a lot of business with other local businesses. Very friendly environment, easy enough work, decent pay and benefits. I started this full time job because I seriously needed the money and consistency in my life, and have really shaped up my time management and attitude, the job has taught me useful skills. I also befriended a lot of my coworkers (pretty much everyone except for the two shitty ones). It’s just basic work, and it was fine for a while. 

However, towards the end of my first year there, the owner retired and sold the business to a larger company that is just outside of town. This daddy company is owned by Boss #1 and Boss #2, they’re both older men that don’t know how to talk to women (mostly women work where I work, the previous owner is a woman) and they’re obviously just interested in making more money than maintaining the friendly relationships our business has built over the years. Boss #2 pulled his wife out of retirement to train and become our office manager and that immediately became a problem because she:
1. Didn’t want to be there 
2. Was going through menopause and didn’t want to be there
3. Has only ever worked as a designer and not a manager 
4. Hates managing and loves gossip
5. Did I mention she didn’t want to be there?

As soon as the old boss left, things started to get bad, fast, and the new manager, I’ll call her Tammy, didn’t want to deal with ANY of it.The two coworkers that are problematic now (I will refer to them as Tyler &amp; Jeff) haven’t been stellar at the job pretty much ever. Tyler is a 21 yo balloon head that believes he knows everything, has a high pitched voice and pedantic way about him. Jeff is past 30, maybe 35? He’s the human equivalent of a sloth in all the worst ways and has said many times out loud how little he cares about this job. 

Now when Tyler and Jeff exist in the building, a problem will occur, they will fail to fill out paperwork, be rude to a customer or coworker, and just flat out not care that everyone else has to pick up their slack. I will say that my coworkers are a lot more friendly than I am, and I’ve made it known that I don’t fucking like the slackers. Tyler became especially problematic and me and my friend there tried to bring it up with Tammy. We all had a meeting with Tyler, tried to explain why his lack of attention and his rudeness was a problem, and like a highfalutin 21 yo boy, he didn’t believe he did anything wrong. Now this boy has been fired before from other jobs by being his own asshole of a self, which he has told other people in the office before. 

Another year under this new management has passed (I’ve been here for two years) and everyday is a drag. We get in the morning and face problems and it’s the common thing to say, “ah, Jeff and or Tyler fucked yo. Again. Classic them.” Tammy left our business to go back to the daddy company and work as a receptionist, and now the guy who has worked at our business the longest, the true manager, has become the manager. I’ll call him Ash. With Ash in command, I thought Boss 1&amp;2 would defer to him and listen to the problems going on, problem is that Ash is too fucking nice, he refuses to bring up this stuff with the bosses. 

Is it my place to just email my bosses directly and say I’m unhappy, everyone else is unhappy, we’re having more and more customers come back and say they received bad service from the problem children? I don’t believe I have any authority or say, but if I were a business owner, I’d want my workers to have syngery, be happy and also have satisfied customers. Shits just going bad. 

I don’t know, y’all. I just applied to grad school and I need the money. The job I’m in IS pretty chill on a good day and I love the rest of my coworkers. But I have been making moves to change my job, because I don’t like the vibes at work anymore, it’s just plain bullshit.

Background, and Details:
- I am 99% sure I know it's this guy based purely off details given to me by people whom I have asked, and nobody matches the description other then is joke.

- I work in a building that makes it hard to get water unless you go to the market and get waters to hall up to your floor like archaic chimp, smoking lit cigarettes from zoo employees.

- I have a coworker who sits in the same cubicle on third shift. (I work on first shift). 

- This isn't a job where I can get pushy. (I just want this resolved in a manner that might be both ""Stick it to him"" and ""try me bi*ch, I dare you."").

So basically when I found out I was pregnant I was incomplete shock - yes I know sex can lead to pregnancy but I was on the birth control pill. And my parents immediately said I had to get an abortion. During that period I was extremely upset with myself and with everything happening - that I just wanted to get drunk. To forget everything. I had at least 4 beer bottles in the house and I was so close to drinking them - when all a sudden I bursted into tears. I was so upset with the thought of hurting this baby even more (it wasn’t formed into a baby yet but I still think of it as a baby). And ever since then I have been too scared to go anywhere near alcohol. Just the thought of it makes me sad and makes me realise what I’ve done. I feel like drinking alcohol will fully confirm I’m no longer pregnant. Is there a way I can forget this? It’s not like I want to drink 24/7, but I just wanna enjoy my birthday champagne without feeling sad. ",01Apr2019,1
686,"As a little background I am a 20 F away at college. Ever since I was a little kid my dad has been addicted to alcohol and varying drugs. This eventually led to my parents being divorced and myself going to live with my mom. As I got older the visits with my dad became less and less as he found other things to take priority. We had a huge fight and falling out almost 5 years ago and I haven't seen him since. 

Today however, I am still very close with my aunt and cousins. With the last visit they told me about their recent encounter with him. He's been dropping into using crack and based on how bad my family estimates he won't survive another year at the rate he's using. 

I'm not sure if I can help in any way or if he is a hopeless cause at this point.

691,"So some background: i’m 15(f) and attend a relatively small high school. 

Last year, my “friend group”  turned against me for something I didn’t do. It is kind of a long story, but it ultimately led to me being excluded from a lot and always caused a tension in the group. 

Anyway. this year I continued to sit at their table to be around my 2 close friends (who were never jerks and stood up for me) This may sound dumb for me to do, but it had been going relatively fine for the past few months of school. everyone seemed to put the past behind us, and i looked forward to school in the morning .

now the issue. 

Last friday, i overheard the girls LOUDLY talk shit about another close friend of mine. my friend, who i will call Ellie, considers these girls friends. They were  talking about her in a negative way. 

Ellie and i are both on our school’s track team. At practice, I expressed to Ellie how there was a rumor about her coming from the others and how she should act like everything was relatively normal, but to obviously not trust these girls with anything. 

Fast forward to today. I head up to the lunch room and am immediately bombarded with questions. this is how the conversation went: 
girl a: “hey did you tell ellie we were shit talking her?”
girl b: “yeah because she won’t talk to us and is acting really weird” 
me: (in a state of panic &amp; not knowing how much they knew) “no, i’m not sure what you’re even talking about” 
girl a: “well i heard you told ellie so” 
me: “look, you want the truth? I told ellie that the rumor about _ was getting out of hand and she should step in. you guys WERE shit talking her” 
girl a : “no we weren’t!”
girl c: “it’s obvious you’re lying and i think you shouldn’t sit at our table anymore”
girl d: “that wasn’t your conversation to overhear”
me: “look, i apologize for going behind your back. it was wrong. but i felt wrong being around her and not telling her” 


you know what? i don’t fucking regret telling my friend. i may have done the wrong thing but i know deep down i didn’t do it with ill intent. 


i have so much anxiety about what the upcoming days hold. I know things will most likely brush over but i DO worry for the tense days with these “women”.

Not for lack of applying, but I've never had a job.

I didn't get a car until I was 18, and this area is very much a ""everyone gets a car at 16"" area with a shitty city bus service. And, in this area, too, a lot of people start working at 15, so I was already three years behind.

I applied places like McDonalds, Wal-Mart, Target, local and chain wait-staff restaurants, etc., etc. and got zero replies then and zero replies now, eight years later.

Even then, when I was 21, 22, 23, 24, I was applying pretty much everywhere that had an opening. Ulta? Applied. Jared Jewelery? Applied. Nordstroms? Applied. Wal-Mart? 15 trillion times.

Been called in for two interviews: one at 19, one at 23. The one at 19 was a local McDonalds...but the manager had already left for the day when it was my scheduled interview time (like, early afternoon right after lunch).

The second was at the local mall's food court KFC. We were in the midst of heavy rainy period and the roof of a freestanding KFC the manager managed leaked, so they had to be away and an employee - completely unprepared and not a clue what they were doing - interviewed me. 

Never heard back from either.

I have no criminal convictions - not even a speeding ticket. I say I'm open to work whenever the hell they want me to work on my applications (especially now that I'm not in school).

I'm currently living at home and feeling like a bum and a drain on my parents, who aren't exactly wealthy, but made enough so I have no student loan debt (along with Pell Grant money and a scholarship or two). 

I also keep having to bum gas money from them every so often to visit my girlfriend (she's only 15 minutes, but it's still bumming money for gas)

So, I know that some people in this situation have no one. I kind of do. I don't have a good relationship with my mom/ dad. My mom is alright. My 2 cousins are the best. I have a circle of old friends/ acquaintances who I feel 99% like they are my family. Here's the issue. 

I feel like the burden of my death will be less of a burden than me alive. They will get over my death and then remember the good times. I feel like a financial burden on my parents. I feel like my non-life threatening chronic health issues are a burden on me. I'm starting to feel like a burden on friends too. I did confide to some people about these thoughts. I'm starting to wonder if any friends would remember me. I hope so.

I'm not sure how he feels about me tbh, but I don't feel like I'm attracted to him anymore. Another thing I think might contribute is the issue is, as far as appearances go, he's not really my type. He's basically the complete opposite actually. Saying that seems so superficial, but I can't change how I feel about it.

698,"I go to a college that's known for its academic dishonesty policies. 

Earlier this semester, I took a test and did very well on it. My teacher even told me exactly what I had missed following the exam, so I effectively had an answer bank in my head. After leaving the test, I encountered an old friend who was about to take the same test. This is where things start to go wrong.

I tend to lose my head when talking to the sex that I'm attracted to (which I won't include so as not to leave any identifiable information). This person especially made me nervous. In addition, I always have social anxiety and I was running on days of very little sleep. My friend asked me if I'd taken the test yet and I told them yes. They laughed and showed me all the notes they had typed up to study from.

Now, what I did could have been a lot worse. But it's still pretty inexcusable. I'm known for having decent grades and I always try to help out when I can, just never by helping people cheat. That was about to change.

Instantly seizing the chance to help and maybe even impress this person, I, without thinking, effectively told them that they needed to change one specific thing (which I won't include here so I can't be identified)  about several of their answers and that the rest looked good. I didn't actually give them the full answers, just part of them.

We said goodbye and parted ways. Walking away, the realization of what I had just done hit me like a freight train. I could physically feel panic weighing my chest down.

It had never crossed my mind that I was helping my friend cheat; in my mind I was just giving them some advice for the class.

What I did was wrong, and I feel terrible about it. I've worked hard for my reputation as an excellent student, and I hate cheating. It's the easy way out.

My question is whether I should confess to my professor. I'm concerned that even if I did, they wouldn't believe I could have accidentally done this without thinking (I can hardly believe it myself). Additionally, I can't really come clean without potentially getting my friend in trouble as well, and that wouldn't be fair. They didn't ask for the information I volunteered.

Only one other student heard the conversation, and I don't know their name; they don't worry me. My chief concern is that a professor in a nearby office overheard it.

Do I take my chances and come clean, hoping my teacher (whose very good side I seem to currently be on) has mercy on me and doesn't report the incident? They're very nice and understanding, but a bit by the book. I'm afraid I may stand no chance of being forgiven.

Or do I wait and pray nobody ever finds out? My friend certainly won't say anything, but a professor who overheard the conversation very well could. It's a somewhat small school and they know exactly who I am.

I probably won't be suspended or expelled, but my academic reputation will be ruined and I'll fail the course, ruining my GPA.

This may have happened a little while ago, but due to the way my school processes cheating allegations, the time is getting closer and closer for me to potentially get hit with an accusation and I'm starting to sweat it a little bit.

Please help.

TL;DR: I got nervous around my friend who I'm attracted to, let my social anxiety get the best of me, and helped them out with the answers to a test I had just taken without even thinking about it. Do I hope I don't get caught or come clean?

About a year ago, myself (18M) and my two best friends (18 F and 18 M) were going fine. Life was good. They start going out, I am in no way jealous, they seem happy, I didn't have feelings for her. About 8 months go by and now they aren't doing too happy. They call it off for a while to take a break. In that time 18F has sex with an old ex/ old best friend to 18M. 18M and 18F get pissed at each other, but in school (JROTC) have to work with each other a lot.

I am a male high-schooler, 16 years of age. I live in a country in which it's mandatory for each child to have 8 years of elementary school. As one would expect from school of course, bullying was present through all those 8 years.

I was always told I was a good kid and still am but that's the whole fucking reason I got bullied in the first place. It's always easy to jerk around the quiet kid. It's always funny picking on one kid out of a class of 15. It always fucking had to be me.

In elementary grades 5 through 8, everyday I would hope the day ends faster, everyday I would hope that maybe today would be good, that I wouldn't catch shit and insults from others. But that day never came about. In the 7th and 8th grade it particulary got bad and I thought of harming myself regularly but never had the guts to finally do it.

I endured those 4 retarded years with the help of 1 friend who I could trust and finally high school came about.

I went to a psychologist regularly in the 1st year of highschool because all I did was mope around. No night outs, no hanging out with ""friends"" nothing. All I had was my anime and that's it, I was and still am the loner.

That one friend who stuck by me eventually parted aswell. His parents got divorced and he had his own problems to deal with, and I agree. Why should he care about my shitty life when his own is pretty shit aswell.

But depression is not why I'm seeking your guys' help. I beat depression, I finally fucking did it 3 months ago, I beat it!

So then why do I still leave myself open so fucking much? For some fucking reason I was born this way, I try to help others and I'm polite, I'm nice to others for no reason. I'm naturally like this and it always gets exploited.

Why am I like this? Because of all the shit I went through, I can barely trust 2 to 3 people in my life IF EVEN THAT, yet I'm still nice to people. Fucking why???

721,"My ex and I dated for two and a half years and broke up two years ago in June, I broke up with him. For context I'm also 20 this coming June so I was basically a kid when I was with him.

He was abusive and I was happy to end it, I haven't seen him since. 

One thing about him was that he loved showing off. He bought me a ring and said it was a promise ring, the ring was valued at around 1k when it was bought.

The thing is that I really like the ring, not because of the memories but the design is really my type and that is hard to find because I am really picky. 

If I wore it it would be on a normal finger obviously and I would only wear it on certain occasions. 

However, I don't want to hurt my boyfriend's feelings by me suddenly wearing a ring and telling him it's from my ex. 

Should I ask him beforehand or would it be okay for me to wear it randomly one day without asking? Or should I just come to terms with not being able to wear it and sell it? ",01Apr2019,1

 Hey guys, so this is gonna be pretty light compared to some other topics here, but the gist here is that there’s a concert coming up in a larger city in a few months that I really want to attend. The downside is that I really don’t have anyone who either knows/likes the artist, or that I’m comfortable with going with. I’m really considering just going alone (tickets are ~$75 so it’s kind of a commitment) but I don’t know if 1) That’s a thing people actually do (concerts seem more of like a bonding thing I guess?) and 2) how would I go about making sure I’m safe and have a good time should I choose to go alone?

725,"Soon, I'll be a graduating senior and something has been slowly coming up on me harder and harder. Is it a good idea to go to college when I have no real desire to do so? Just to clarify, I never really cared about school and only am good at it for the sake of making my parents happy and proud and to not let them worry about me. I have good grades and am nearly top for my class, already got accepted to multiple colleges, but don't really care about any of it. I don't care about anything in particular and I have no real motivation to chase anything. Because of that, I decided that I'd go to college as it is what my parents expect me to do and because it is the ""logical"" thing to do until I find something to give a damn for. However, recently, more and more people keep asking me where I am going and they are all continuously growing concerned as to whether it is a good idea for me to go to college (or anywhere for that matter) with that type of reasoning, saying that I won't be living happily and with regret. Honestly, I don't care whether or not anything will make me happy and I just see college as the next thing to do until I find whatever my passion is, but considering how often I am receiving concern from others, I want to know, is this a remotely good of an idea/move? Should I be doing something else even though there isn't anything I want to chase? If so, what should I be doing? ",01Apr2019,1

I do eventually want to get a masters degree in educational counselling (guidance counselling), but first I want to teach social studies for junior high! I’m extremely passionate about teaching and I volunteer with a Girl Scouts group and love mentoring as well. Psychology is also a passion and helping people with healthy lifestyles in general! 

Here’s my issue! I’ve ALWAYS wanted to be a midwife. I don’t like the medical fields usually but something about helping women in such a special time in their lives makes me so excited.

729,"So I know I'm a nasty person for doing this and I hate myself for it because I don't usually do things like it. But I do community theatre and my director is Irish. Well in one show she tells everyone that she could play the parts better than everyone. So a couple months pass, and we find out the next show and I say to my friend, her mum and the woman who does costumes about how the director said she could play all the parts in the last show, and how she could do all of them in our next show (jokingly). Then my friend starts saying lines in an Irish accent, and soon enough we all are. 

Well fast forward a year and the costume person is doing the costumes for another group in which my director was in. Now I know the costume woman to be quite gossipy and so I'm super scared that she's told her what happened. I feel so bad because I don't usually say things like I did then and I shouldn't of said it, then I don't want to of hurt my directors feelings because I really do like her.

I don't know how to get over the guilt of this and if she has found out about me doing it. The thing is though, I don't see the director anymore because I've finished with the group, but I just don't want it on my conscience about her being angry/upset at me. And it would be very weird for me to randomly message her about it because 1) I don't message her and 2) if she doesn't know, she will then know...

733,"21F, suffering from anxiety, BPD and body dismorphia.  Dad is also very sick and unable to work. Mum makes $200month. 

Dad needs expensive therapies every month.

I needed to drop out of college due to the inability to pay tuition.  

Studied IT, found some freelance gigs on UpWork, they cut out our Internet and TV.                   Managed to pay that, dad needed another emergency therapy, had no money so he had to beg his friends for money. 
I never saw him cry before that moment.

In the midst of all of it, still pushed myself to work. Worked day and night literally for a month and earned $2k as a UI Designer.                             Planned to pay for my therapy and dad's therapy and bills and save some money for university (to try and reapply next year). 

Upwork suspended my freelance account due to a mistake (which they admitted). They gave back all the money I earned ($2k) to a client which now won't refund me for my work and molests me when he answers the phone at 56th try. He falsely introduced himself, basically was scamming me the whole time. I think I failed to realise that because I was so focused on the payment and what I could do with it, that I ignored all red flags.

Unfortunately last year my best friend since freshman year (16M) had asked her out and has been dating her. He never knew my feelings for her, but I think she may have suspected my feelings for and vice-versa. 

However last month my best friend broke up with her. He never told me but my crush did. I brought it up with him and said I’m here for him.

743,"For context, I have been watching Game of Thrones since it was in it's fourth season and I got deeply invested in it. It's my favorite show of all time to be honest, I can still remember how I reacted to many important scenes over the years. It's a show I really like to be immersed in and I pay full attention the whole time. I got my aunt interested in the series during the previous season, she really liked it and got caught up to me.

We started watching the new episodes together the night they premiered. While we were watching it, at every important scene she would look at me and say something like ""Oh wow! Did you expect that? I didn't expect that!"" And completely interrupt the show. She always looks at me when things happen on the show and expects a reaction, it bugs me a lot because I like to give my full focus to the show. Otherwise, I miss out on important details and I don't like having to pause and go back. This continued every episode we watched, and honestly I really enjoy her company it's just very distracting to hear her talk every few minutes and keep looking towards me expecting me to conversate about the episode while it's going on and I'm trying not to miss important details. I told her we could watch the next series together, she is all excited about it but I want to tell her something like ""Is it okay if we don't talk during the show, and then after it's done we can talk about it as much as we want and even go back in the episode to rewatch things if you want"".

The problem is that I don't think she will stop doing this, she talks during important scenes every time we see a movie together as well. I told my mom about it and she does not think she will stop either. It's also sort of awkward to watch Thrones with her because of the incestual relationships in the show. (I don't think that's a spoiler, if you follow the show you know exactly what I'm talking about). I miss watching the show by myself to be honest, and if she doesn't stop I may just watch the rest of it by myself.",01Apr2019,1

",01Apr2019,1
746,"I wrote this for another sub and it has many details so I'll post it here then clarify what I'm seeking advice on:

You're the most recent guy I've genuinely liked and that doesn't happen very often. We will never be together and it's partly my fault, partly yours.


The first night I met you, you seemed like an asshole.  I met you through my friend's friend, Jim. As the night when on, you warmed up to me and kept making comments about how my friend acted, like you thought she was trashy. 

You kept talking to me and asking me about myself and when you looked at me, your eyea shined and the corners of your mouth were upturned. I could tell you liked me. 

I was flattered and I thought you were pretty damn cute. Your thighs looked squeezable and you had deep blue eyes.

The third night I saw you, you came up behind me and your hand was resting on my back. I told you to give me some space and acted like a brat. The closeness threw me off and I got defensive. I'm a hard woman to get close to because I sabotage things I want. 
 
You were clearly upset in the video my friend sent me. 

Later that night, my friend told me she liked you and I was a little thrown off because I felt like it was obvious that you liked me considering you gave me all your attention and didnt acknowledge her while I was around. I thought she knew. 

She kissed you that night and you kissed her back. So just like that, I lost your attention. She told me that later on in the night, of the first night i met you, all of y'all went back to Jim's apt and she said you listened to her talk about Slayer for 3 hours. 

My friend. She is a loser. She's been on probation for the past year for driving drunk and she totalled her car recently, while on probation. She lives at her parent's house still and spends every penny she makes on getting fucked up. She's obnoxiously loud and talks with a lisp. Her haw juts forward and she's not very pretty. 

These are the things I've focused on since you chose her over me because I may not have you but I do have my beauty and my success and I also have this ugly attitude that is driving me crazy. 

You haven't even tried to sleep with her yet. 

The other night when I met the two of you at the bar, you guys didn't act like a couple despite the fact that you've been dating for a month now. When you look at her, your eyes aren't shining. Your mouth isn't tilted up at rhe corners. You didn't even really look at her. You just stared at the tv, hand on your beer taking a drink every so often. I would make a snarky comment and you'd tell me if I had something to say then to say it. I had plenty to say and i kept it to myself. 

At one point she went to the bathroom and it was an awkward silence. 

Then you put your hand on her thigh and I saw that you kept looking at me in the mirror behind the bar. I kept my eyes glued to the tv like jeopardy was the most interesting program I've ever watched. Then you grabbed her face and kissed her. You kept looking at me while you kissed her. You didn't say a word to me when you left. I didn't either.

The whole thing confuses me. I don't know if you genuinely like her or if you're playing some stupid game because I pissed you off. It doesn't matter at this point. There's absolutely no chance that I could date you now and, honestly, I don't like this person I've been because of you. Badmouthing my friend and comparing myself to her.

I wish I could tell you exactly what I think of you. I wish I could tell you that you look stupid as a couple and we could have had a lot of fun. Instead I'm going to lick my wounds and get over this bullshit.


My question: how do I get over the fact that used the oppurtunity to get close to him when I pissed him off? I have to work with this girl and I'm having resentment issues towards her. It's very petty and I'm not trying to create a negative work environment for her or myself but I'm pretty damn salty towards her.",01Apr2019,0

But Parent B won't take the steps necessary to gain employment. They won't follow up on an application, reach out and call anyone, etc.  They won't even look for a job unless I bring them to the table and fill out the application for them. 

Here's the kicker, Parent B spends all their time at the bar. They're depressed, but won't seek help. I don't know if they even want to work at all or if they will just admit that they are giving up.  Children are not in a situation to financially support them. 

Confronting directly has never been an option for my family.  Parent B is prone to extreme emotional outbursts when feeling confronted and usually pairs it with reckless behavior and inflicting emotional wounds as a deflection.
