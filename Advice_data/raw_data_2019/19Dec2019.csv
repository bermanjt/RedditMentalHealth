0,"Context: Emily and I have been best friends for 8 years and have lived together off and on three times. I broke up with my boyfriend and needed help with my living situation and was very excited when she said she wanted to live with me. She left her boyfriend (they were having problems and she was ecstatic to come here too) and moved to my town to live with me. Six months later my girlfriend Elizabeth moved in with us (Emily and I discussed it prior and she said she was fine with it). I met Elizabeth really soon after Emily moved here and I tried really hard to spend as much time as I could with both of them so neither was left out or neglected.

Some important things to mention about Emily: she has severe social anxiety and a deep fear of exclusion. She has attempted suicide twice in the past so I'm extremely afraid of upsetting her. She has talked to me about her fear of exclusion a couple of times and I have modified my actions to make her comfortable. 

The list of things I have to do / avoid doing seems to be growing and I'm starting to get frustrated. I'm not sure how to talk to her about this. The list includes:

• Saying hi immediately when I get home, if I go to the bathroom or am otherwise home for more than five minutes without knocking on her bedroom door to say hi she gets very upset.

• Spending every moment she is home with her unless her boyfriend is over. I love spending time with her, but it's starting to feel like an obligation. If I want to play video games or do something by myself or with Elizabeth Emily gets upset.

• Including her in all dinner plans. If Elizabeth and I get food and don't ask Emily if she wants something she gets upset.

• Making sure I tell her ahead of time if I'm going to be having a date night out with Elizabeth.

• Watching tv with her or making sure she doesn't want to watch a show with us. She's very busy so she doesn't get a lot of TV time, but if I watch tv with Elizabeth it has to be a show that Emily has expressed she doesn't want to watch. If we watch a show Emily likes and she finds out she gets upset.

These are just the things off of the top of my head. Elizabeth feels like I'm practically dating Emily because of the amount of doting I have to do. I'm starting to resent Emily and don't want to spend as much time with her because I feel like I'm constantly upsetting her despite how hard I try  to make her happy and the way that she expresses it is very passive aggressive. I'm starting to have anxiety about her all of the time and I hate it.

Emily wants to talk to me about something tonight and I'm afraid it is going to be about how I've been kind of distant the last couple of days. I need to figure out how to talk to her about this. Please help!

Edit: I can't kick her out or move out. She has school here for the next year and has no one else to live with, I also don't have the money to move out. Please keep in mind she has been my best friend for EIGHT years and I'm more looking for help with what to say to her in a talk of some sort.",19Dec2019,1

3,"I recently stumbled upon a present for myself when looking in my parents' closet for clothes hangers. I'm interested in fossils, and it was a book on the subject, but I realized I already own a copy.

4,"So, the past Saturday I took my clothes to a laundry and today (Wednesday) I picked them up. When I got to my home and open the bag I saw immediately one jacket that wasn't mine, it was a work jacket from an important oil company in my country (the most important actually) so I went back and returned it because the laundry is near my house and I really don't have anything to do with it. In my home again I open the bag with my sheets (the one before was the bag of only clothes) and things for my bed, and I see another jacket but this time it was an Anne Klein jacket, very cool one and expensive according with my little google research.
I really don't know what to do, I've been in situations like this before and I'm a person who always does the right thing no matter what, but this time I'm very tempted to think selfishly and just keep it; this jacket may be from the same person who works for that company and I'm sure the money is definitely not a problem for him/her. Please consider what would you do if you were in my position and help me to know what should I do.

9,"Trying to keep this as short as possible. I'm 28M and my dad is 60M. When I was like 5 we used to play super Nintendo together and had a good time. Soon after he stopped gaming and focused on providing for his family, started a business, became a millionaire, quit it all, and started his own church 20 years later. During this time our relationship became strained, I went in and out of jail, and moved out when I was 18. Now that I'm ""older"" and more ""mature"" I have amended my relationship with my dad and would like to do some activities together. I think he is too old for physical activities and he definitely does not drink or smoke but I remember he loves zelda, super Mario bros, and tetris attack among many other classics. How do I get him back into games and see if we can find a game we both like? Every time I visit and bring games up he looks up half asleep at me on the couch and then falls back asleep while some korean drama hes never watched but is on episode 7 is playing on the tv.

Another thing you may want to know is when me and my brother had a n64 we tried to play with him but when he grabbed the analog stick between his left index finger and thumb, and put his pinky on the directional pad, my brother and I made fun of him so much that he only played one game and stopped.

I also remember when I got my game cube i bought tiger woods and he played for hours a day for like a month and then just stopped. 

I guess this was longer than I wanted but I love my dad and would love to game together with him again. Help a redditor out and feel free to ask for more info if you feel its needed to give this advice/opinion.",19Dec2019,1
10,"Okay, I don't know where else I can go to ask. This is a throwaway account since my real name is linked to my main account. I'll try keep it short. If not; sorry. Might be a little jumbled up because how emotional it is to write this and to even reach out for help. 

My entire life; my dad has been emotional, physiologically and verbally abusive (mainly) - there have been a few times where he got physical where he hit me hard with his belt on my back when I was about 10 years old. My mother kicked me out at an early age so I had to move in with my dad. So I've been here for about 9 years (Currently 24 years old), throughout these years it has been so much fucking hell. Any time he talks to me, it's mentally beating me really down. It honestly has affected me so much that let's say if you ask me to get something in the kitchen and I didn't know what you wanted, I would panic and feel the next thing to come out your mouth is, ""HOW FUCKING DENSE AND STUPID CAN YOU BE. IT'S THIS FUCKING THING HERE. YOU'RE SO FUCKING USELESS"". 

I could go on and on and on with hundreds of examples but to my question. My dad is the only person I can live with while I get my degree. No friends can take me in, the family I have in the country where I am, they don't like me or want anything to do with me. My mother kicked me out and my dad's side of the family is in Spain. I have gained a LOT of weight. I currently weight anywhere between 19-21 stone at over 6 feet tall. 

My question is now; when my dad gets abusive HOW do I stop emotional eating when he triggers me to eat?. I tried asking the few friends I have and it didn't help especially when I'm in that zone of where it's like a drug and I need constantly get that short happy feeling because NOTHING i feel is making me happy or feel good about myself. I feel like a fucking junkie. I'm so fucking sick of this problem where I eat when shit goes south. They suggested go to the gym; that's fine but what if it's late a night? or what if I'm really emotional and I know I'll have a breakdown in the middle of the gym. I need to stop the problem before I start going to the gym, what's the point if i can't stop over eating when I need that happy feeling. 

Please, can anyone give advice on how to stop myself from over eating and is there anything that can give me instant happiness when I need it like food does. I have suggested alcohol or drugs but my friends obvious said no.",19Dec2019,1
11,"i know this is outside of what is usually posted here, but i'm still hoping i could get some sound advice.

i'm way outside of my home country and my phone screen got broken. i got a replacement on amazon and have successfully disassembled the phone (Huawei P9 Lite) up until the part with the battery. It's glued on SO SO much, i tried removing it, but it kinda started smelling a bit fruity in the lower left corner after a while. i was very gentle with it, trying my best not to damage anything. 

i have it disconnected from the phone and was just trying to lift it with a plastic tool. before any smell happened i tried very mildly heating up the phone from the screen side (directly opposite the battery), the part where the adhesive is strongest in an attempt to loosen the adhesive. it did help a little in trying to move it around, but then the smell sorta happened. 

my question is mainly if it's safe to proceed in taking out this battery, because i'm planning on getting a new one either way and putting it instead of the old one. is this dangerous, should i proceed, and if so, what's the proper and safest way? i have some basic tools needed and have gotten this far pretty well, but i'm scared about this battery stuff.

13,"Hey guys! 

So I am a 21 year old college girl and I have been part of this friend group which contains about 7 people including me. Out of this friend group 3 of the members are very involved with their boyfriends and I barely see them so that leaves me with 3 left. The ones I will be discussing the most are the 3 left. 

But recently I have been going through a very tough depression, even though I believe that depression should be discussed with the therapist, I expected a little support and comfort from these 3 friends. Generally I would say I am a person who is always there for others and I would drop everything and help my best friends if I see that they are sad. But out of these 3 friends, only one really reached out to me and tried to help me to some extent and it seemed like she actually was trying to help while the other 2 seemed completely heartless. The reason I am writing about this is not about my depression but then giving the general “attitude” to me. Some examples below: 

- While we have a group chat for 7 of us, mostly it’s the 3 girls I am close to and me who talk and none of the other members respond to anything. And every time I say something the 7 girls leave me on read in messenger without responding. 
- One girl who I am the closest to, acts weird which I am debating whether I’m delusional about it or not. Every time we set up a meeting she arrives late or waits and shows up almost 2 hours later than what we planned. I feel like mostly I’m the one making plans and she never really reaches out to hangout with me. ( A great example can be the most recent time we hung out where she showed up 4 hours late and didn’t pay for anything or never bothered to bring anything to the gathering.... and while riding back since she ordered the Uber she asked me to pay my half! Even tho I paid a lot of money on drinks and dinner and everything which comes to almost 10x of the money she had to pay for Uber) 
- Another girl out of this friend group which I am friends with, always acts very opinionated (a great example: she’s very political which I’m not, so we were in this make up store in mall and I bought some kind of eye shadow and she genuinely got pissed at me Because I chose a brand that is Apprently is cruel to animals..... I apologized to her and said I had no idea but she got super pissed and made me feel like a villain even tho genuinely I had no idea. These things happens all the time where she makes me and my choices look almost dumb compared to her) 

...... guys I am so so sad about this because this is the only 7 girls I am friends with and I am genuinely tired. As a junior girl studying one of the hardest engineering at a very hard engineering school in USA it gets very tough for me and now I feel like all my friend are letting me down and I can’t do anything about it. How should I deal with this? I have been thinking about taking a break from everyone for some
Time but I am afraid I’m gonna feel lonely.... 

Any advice helps :(",19Dec2019,1
14,"For the past 4 years (roughly) i have been identifying as transgender FTM and i am beginning to question myself.

I do genuinely feel gender dysphoria. The idea of people viewing me as female disgusts me, but i’m wondering if it is because of the way i have been treated as a woman, not because i am trans.

16,"So I’ve been best friends with him for three years now. She has been around for 6 months. 
We started talking first before the two of them but I retracted from talking to her after I found out he liked her. I still don’t understand why I did that. My feelings have only grown for her and she is currently living with me as he can’t house her and I have to watch them interact constantly and I feel like I’m an awful person for feeling this way recently I confessed my feelings and it was mostly reciprocated. The whole situation makes me sick with anxiety and guilt. I really don’t know what to do. She’s also moving up north in a month or so. I don’t want to hurt my best friend. But he also has issues. Over protective somewhat manipulative and narcissistic. She’s shown me things and told me things that are very concerning about his behavior that sounds very close to abuse and I don’t just want to make him out to seem a bad person he isn’t, just troubled, they have been together for about three months but I’ve been told he is violent in a sleepwalking state and he has also lied to her. And at one point insinuated I’d be betraying him by allowing her to say she doesn’t want him inside the house because “she hasn’t actually paid rent yet therefore has no control on who comes or goes” he has started using coke again and she hates that she made us both promise not to use it again. It was a seldom recreational activity I’ve stopped he hasn’t and he recently picked up and she doesn’t want him in the house if he has it. I’m almost positive he has in his car but he didn’t show me so I can’t know for sure. He did use some for sure last night however. I don’t consider him violent but when he sleep walks he is and I’ve seen it happen before he isn’t conscious. But I just feel trapped. In my situation and I also just am extremely stressed about this and can’t talk to anyone about it. I feel as though and I’m trying to be unbiased although that’s impossible. As objectively as I can I think that he’s not being good to her in other ways daily conversation will completely shut down and not talk to her at the slightest inconvenience just toxic red flags. And she said she actually somewhat fears him. I don’t know what to do. Could we just have a conversation in the comments? Sorry this is all over the place by the way.

In love with my best friends girlfriend and feelings are reciprocated. Best friend is toxic. I feel guilt for my feelings and the situation. Don’t know what to do.",19Dec2019,1
17,"So I smoked with them in a group before, but they were the only two people that I vibed with. The other people in the group were weird and I just didn't vibe with them/felt uncomfortable...I want to smoke/chill with them again cause it's my last year of undergrad and I've made absolutely zero friends and I'm kicking myself in the ass for being such a recluse. Granted I was depressed but, still...

Be honest, would they be weirded out? They're really nice dudes and I trust them, but I worry they would feel weird being the two guys with one girl...My roommate would be here, but she's really awkward and shy so it really would be just the 3 of us. I know I probably need another girl and/or guy, but I literally know no one. Unless we did it at one of their places? But how would I even bring it up?

The only thing stopping me from asking is fear of rejection/fear of them being weirded out...I am friends with them on social media and actually gave one of them some \*cough\* brocoli for free because he was generous enough to smoke the group out that one time (he has my phone number from that interaction, too).

21,"Okay so, I already posted the following post on another subreddit but I really need an advice on the following because I'm feeling.. well, weird. 

So, my mother and I (23 F) always had a rocky relationship where I felt I wasn't good enough or doing enough. 2 years ago she started drinking. At first it was a beer here and there in the afternoon but soon it was happening daily and it wasn't just that ""one beer"", how she liked to call it.

Btw, my parents are divorced for 12 years now and I have a younger brother (14). We both lived with her until I moved out in August. Also, I'm a student, currently on a gap-year because I'm working. Been in the same company since October 2018. Living alone, I have minor financial help from dad on his proposal. Might be helpful for context.

To continue, one evening she got home dead drunk. Couldn't walk, couldn't talk. I forgave her, she said she ""drank one to many bcs her friends were paying"". Soon, she became distant, started snapping on me much often and was drinking daily. Believe me when I say that I tried my best to confront her, understand her, help her. But all she did was either push me away from her or lie to me. I got tired. I was always transparent with her. Never once told a lie. Always tried my best to meet her wishes and expectations, but it seems like it wasn't enough.

This summer I moved out because I couldn't stand living with her anymore. After few weeks we started talking again. I forgave her for everything she did to me; for every physical attack on me, threat and attempt to make a psycho out of me. We had a pretty good relationship again. She said she stopped drinking. And I naively believed.

2 months ago I found out she did it again. I went to her apartment to take my brother with myself because I didn't want for him to be around her while she's drunk. When I came to pick him up, I told her that our relationship is over and not to call me again. She didn't say anything because she was too drunk to form a sentence.

She called me a month later to try and ""wiggle"" her way out by saying something in the lines of ""I didn't deserve this"". I didn't forgive her this time. I told her that I don't know how to trust her again and that I feel used and hurt. Just thinking about everything she put me through makes me anxious.

Basically, I don't know anymore if I did the right thing. I kinda feel like I did - not being in that toxic relationship feels great, but something's been bugging me. Maybe feeling like I could do more. Please, I'm open for every kind of advice or opinion. Do you think that's the good thing what I  did? Is there anything else in my power what I could do to maybe help her or such? I'm clueless atm.

22,"This semester a friend of mine has skipped several days of classes.  I asked her privately if she had depression and told me she did.  I let her know that I also have depression and would be open to talk.  The next week she actually comes to all of our classes, but then is very absent again afterwards.

29,"Hello, hopefully I’ll try to make this short. 

Background info: 
I’m in a program with a fire department that allows you to work 24 on /48 off, pays $8 per hour and has tuition reimbursement. I am currently a senior in college doing a pre med degree, in hopes of graduating and moving on to medical school. I have one semester left of pre-reqs before I can study and sit for the MCAT. HOWEVER, this fire department program requires you to take a whole semester off and work a day shift, 7-4 Monday-Friday, to fill in for the other students that are at class. I was selected for This day shift for the spring semester of 2020. This would set me back an entire year because of classes that are only available in the spring that are pre-reqs for classes in the fall. I’m already behind as far as schooling, however I have been taking full semesters and am so close to my goal of graduating undergrad. I can see my goal within reach and just want to cry thinking about taking another whole semester off. 

I have three options here: 
1. I agree to the day shift, take the whole semester off, take 1 class at night at a college an hour away from town, and be potentially set back a whole year. 
2. I pay someone $2000 to work the shifts for me and avoid the setback. ( this option is dwindling away because no one will agree to work it for me) 
3. I quit the program, lose tuition reimbursement, $8/hour pay, get a different job, avoid the setback and finish my school and move on to med school.

31,"Hi! Pretty long read, sorry.

This year, I (m15) have really been coming out of my shell and talking to more people, girls and boys alike. It’s not really that I was shy or anything, it’s just that I was way too focused on academics and sports, leaving me with less time to spend on socializing. Before this year, you could probably say that I had no friends who were girls, and about five friends in total. 

In September, I met this girl and I quickly developed a crush on her. This lasted until about Thanksgiving weekend, when I started making friends with another girl. I have a pretty significant crush on her now. But are these really crushes, or is it just the fact that I’m actually getting female attention for once? I feel like I should have a few friends who are girls before actually having a romantic relationship with one, but on the other hand, I keep obsessing over girls who I talk to.

My only argument against this is that there’s one other girl who I’m friends with now, and I don’t find her physically attractive; I don’t have a crush on her, even though she’s really cool. 

So should I hold back on romantic pursuits? Or would you say, go for it anyway? I really think that I should have female friends, though, and asking them out runs the risk of losing these new friendships. 

That being said, I’ve found a great friend in the girl I met in September; I was too shy to actually make a move on her and in hindsight, if she rejected me, we might not be friends right now. I really appreciate the platonic relationship we have.

tl;dr: Am I actually crushing on these girls, or is it because I was so deprived of female attention all my life?",19Dec2019,1
32,"My extended family usually does a massive get together each Christmas Eve and usually one person hosts and makes like 80% of the food and then each smaller family will bring an appetizer. It usually is 30 to 40 people and we rotate who does it each year.

This year my dad recently got married to his wife, I'll call her DW for dad's wife. She's very excited and wants to throw a Christmas Eve dinner at their house with a smaller group (me and my boyfriend who are in our mid/late 20s, my sister and her family, and DW's adult son and his girlfriend who are in their late 20s). She said she would make the dinner and I said I could bring an appetizer or dessert.

Right away she asked me to bring a dessert and my sister to bring an appetizer. We ended up switching as my sister really wants to make a cake and I had some good appetizer ideas. DW texted me to check what I'm bringing and I let her know my ideas for an appetizer and that my sister will bring a bundt cake and some cookies. 

DW just asked me if I think that my sister and I should bring two appetizers and two desserts total. We had only been planning to bring one each since it's just 8 adults and two very small kids who are picky and have small appetites, I thought a cake and large appetizer should be plenty.

For some context as well, my job gets extremely busy this time of year, as in I put in 10 or so hours OT a week and I can't get much time off. I also am going to therapy for major depressive as I am having a rough time with energy level and they are all aware this is going on. This is making money tight. The idea of going to the store and buying extra ingredients and doing more cooking is so stressful. I think her expectations are high for what I bring since I usually make very exciting dishes for this type of thing but i doubt I can even make one good dish right now.

I managed to get that entire day off but was planning to try to relax up until I make the appetizer.

Also it sounds like DW's son and his GF aren't bringing food.

Would it be rude to say no? Should I just suck it up and make another dish? Is there anything noncommittal I can do in addition to what I was planning to make?",19Dec2019,1
33,"Hi, please stick around and read because I really am not sure.

I've only been in one relationship before and it lasted two years. I was friends with him for about six months and friend zonesd him twice before I asked him out funny enough. One day I just started to like him romantically for some reason.

Besides that, I have never been super boy crazy. I've only had a handful of crushes in my life. I have found that I either fall into what I call complete ""crush love"" where I have on rose tinted glasses if you will. I completely super duper like them a lot. Or, I'll go back and forth on either really being into them romantically to suddenly not being sure or only liking them as a friend. I cannot explain why this happens. This happened to me with my ex boyfriend. One day I started to like him romantically, then not, then I did, and so on for about a month or so. After a month or so went by I decided to ask him out because I started to like him more romantically than platonically.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I broke up with him a year ago for a bunch of reasons. I recently met this guy and have been on three dates with him. I really liked him by the end of the 1st and d2nd date where I even held his hand and leaned into him the whole time we were at a movie. For whatever reason on the third date, I was uneasy. I went back and forth between feeling relaxed and not sure if I actually like him.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been up front with him that I am interested but I don't rush into relationships... he is a really great guy. Like checks off all the boxes and more. I really don't want to accidentally lead him on or anything like that. Anyone have any idea why I feel this way? Im not sure if this gives enough information since I Confuse myself, but I was hoping for some insight.

34,"Thanks in advance for anyone who reads and responds! It means the world to me.

For some backstory, I've suffered from depression since I was in 6th grade and it took me all the years between then and now (a senior in high school) to find my drive and reason to live. This means that I've failed at pretty much everything so far, I've spent my entire high school career in a hole due to my depression and have failed most classes and when I began my Junior year I was so behind I was going to dropout. 

However, I didn't. I wasn't trying either, so I've still failed a class every now and then and my grades have never been stellar. Then comes this semester, I didn't have much drive at the beginning but I put in more effort than I ever have, and I'm ending the semester with 7 grades above 90%, but I am certain I will be failing one of my 8 classes, as I am currently two months behind on the coursework. Over the last month I've been drafting up plans for how I'll do better next year, how I'll put in more effort than just the smallest amount I can justify, how I'll start working out, how I'll meditate, how I'll turn my life around. But I'm scared because I've tried changing so much on my own but I have failed and fallen back every single time. I currently have no study habits, no healthy eating habits, no exercise habits, poor coping mechanisms, poor memory due to depression, and am overweight. I have plans for how I will overcome all of these things, but I fear that I won't follow through on these plans, and that my motivation will leave me. Does anyone have any sound advice for how I can make this attempt to break out of my bad habits the one that sticks, rather than another of the dozens of failed attempts at redemption?",19Dec2019,1

38,"I'm relatively happily married but the problem is, I keep falling in love with other girls.

I'll try to make a long story short. When I met my wife, I was getting out of the worst relationship I'd ever been in. My ex was physically and emotionally abusive, so much so she was prosecuted for it. I met my current wife intending it to be kind of just a physical thing, seven years later, here we are.

She's pretty much driven the relationship to its current point. We got married because she wanted to make things official when I got custody of my son. Most of the major decisions have been her doing because I just didn't have the energy to fight anymore. Problem is, I couldn't argue with the results.

My wife is an absolutely wonderful woman. She's smart, driven, funny, quirky, she makes every situation better, and we click on most things. Our communication is pretty good. Plus, we actually understand each other. Though I've found when I push back on issues now, she says I'm being an asshole and she's pretty much made my son a clone of her.

Two years ago, I fell hard in love with someone I work with and I'm pretty sure that was a two way street, but we never acted on it. In fact, we went our seperate ways.

Ironically, I'm at the exact same job and it's happening again, two years later. Not the same girl. But this one is....really smart, quirky, funny, gorgeous, intelligent, but also very, very broken. I can't tell if it's the bad I'm attracted too.

39,"(TW: murder, child abuse) 

I think that my father is planning to murder me. I have no solid evidence, but an intense gut feeling.

Background information; 
-My father without a doubt hates me: doesn't talk to me unless ordering me to do something, makes me sleep on the floor, makes me pay for all my necessities (food, clothes, school bills etc.) I think the only reason he hasn't kicked me out is because I cook and clean for him. 

-I'm still a minor, I'll be 18 in a month. I have no funds to support myself if I were to run away and no family in the country I can stay with.

-I have no form of protection except a taser gun I'm almost too scared of to hold upright.

Alright so, recently my mom bought a house and invited me to come live with her, which I gladly accepted. My father found this out and, to say the least, was very angry when he heard he wasnt welcome to come live there too. I'll be moving to the new house in two months. 
  I have a terrible gut feeling that my father wants to kill me now that I, his personal maid and cook who works for free, will be leaving. I don't have any good evidence to back this theory except that my father has been acting stranger than usual around me and cleaning his gun collection everyday (just like in those cliche thriller movies scenes). What's most concerning is that he's suddenly planning on getting me life insurance out of the blue before I move out.

41,"so i have this friend and i think our friendship is toxic but i’m not 100% sure. Here’s our history: 
we went to elementary school together but we weren’t really friends because she was very quiet. However she was best friends with one of my good friends so we were friendly with eachother. We went to different middle schools and I had a huge group of friends and i was very social. I found out that she was transferring to my middle school for seventh grade and i decided to be nice and show her the ropes of the school and walk her to her classes and introduce her to people and let her eat lunch with my friends and i. I remember telling my friends that she would eventually get comfortable and make her own friends. but that never happened, she followed me around for weeks and slowly overtime because a part of our friend group. She wasn’t really friends with any of the other girl’s though, she was just always with me. we got really close and i really liked her, we were very alike and i was glad that i finally got to know her. Near the end of seventh grade however i realized something. She didn’t have 1 single friend that i hadn’t introduced her to, she never disagreed with me, and i never hung out with anyone without her anymore. Even my friends that didn’t go to our school she would follow me to hang out with them and eventually it just became expected that we came as a pair. Skip 4 years later to sophomore year of high school. My social circle has shrunk immensely and i’ve lost the vast majority of my friends. I have about 5 friends but every one of them is friends with this girl too. We are still very very close friends, and she still follows me everywhere, texts me all the time (a bit obsessively) and inserts herself into any relationship i make. Most people at our school will only hang out with both of us not just one of us because we are always together. One of my friends won’t talk to me anymore because we used to be really close but after this girl convinced our guidance counselor to switch her into all my classes my whole life was consumed by her and i didn’t talk to that friend as much. I don’t get lunch with other people because once i did and she texted me long paragraphs about how she felt like i didn’t want to have lunch with her and like i was excluding her. She didn’t have any friends that she had made on her own until this year. Now she has a few friends that she did make on her own and that i’m not super good friends with and i’m grateful for that but now i’m stuck because i don’t have a life outside of her and when i think about my life before she came to my school compared to my life now i am so isolated. She encourages all of my bad descions and still has never once disagreed with anything i have said. she invited herself to everytbing i do and follows me and it’s like i can’t have a conversation with someone without her barging in or just standing there listening. I am scared that i will eventually not even have shared friends with her and i will have 0 friends except for her. What do i do? How do i make real friendships with people that aren’t a three way friendship including her? how do i become less close with her so my whole life isn’t consumed by her?",19Dec2019,1

So I've been here for about 9-10 years now, throughout these years it has been so much f\*\*king hell. Any time he talks to me, it's mentally beating me really down.Even in front of other family members he has embarrassed me and  It honestly has affected me so much that let's say if you ask me to get something in the kitchen and I didn't know what you wanted, I would panic and feel the next thing to come out your mouth is, ""HOW F\*\*KING DENSE AND STUPID CAN YOU BE. IT'S THIS F\*\*KING THING HERE. YOU'RE SO F\*\*KING USELESS"". I honestly have tried to kill myself previously because all of this shit is really getting to me.

I could go on and on and on with hundreds of examples but to my question. My dad is the only person I can live with while I get my degree (Once I get the degree, I WILL BE MOVING OUT AND CUTTING TIES WITH HIM). No friends can take me in, the family I have in the country where I am, they don't like me and don't want anything to do with me. My mother kicked me out and my dad's side of the family is in Spain. I have gained a LOT of weight. I currently weight anywhere between 19-21 stone at over 6 feet tall.

My question is now; when my dad gets abusive HOW do I stop emotional eating when he triggers me to eat?. I tried asking the few friends I have and it didn't help especially when I'm in that zone of where it's like a drug and I need constantly get that short happy feeling because NOTHING i feel is making me happy or feel good about myself. I feel like a f\*\*king junkie. I'm so f\*\*king sick of this problem where I eat when shit goes south. They suggested go to the gym; that's fine but what if it's late a night? or what if I'm really emotional and I know I'll have a breakdown in the middle of the gym. I need to stop the problem before I start going to the gym, what's the point if i can't stop over eating when I need that happy feeling.

Please, can anyone give advice on how to stop myself from over eating and is there anything that can give me instant happiness when I need it like food does. I have suggested alcohol or drugs but my friends obvious said no.

54,"The title explains it. I get these feelings of dread quite often whenever I think about specific things, mostly about other people. And by “feeling of dread,” I mean this unexplainable pressure in my chest. Like, my heart will race, I’ll start to get sweaty, sometimes my hands and legs will shake, and my mind overflows with unnecessary thoughts. 

I didn’t go to school today because I woke up late and missed the bus, and the only people I could ask to drive me were my dad (who doesn’t live with me) and my aunt (who does live with me, but I strongly dislike her). I had to finish up homework for a group discussion for English this morning since I accidentally slept for 14+ hours yesterday, and it took way longer than I expected. Once I finished, I was about to call my dad to ask him to drop me off, but then there was that feeling of dread. 

“He’s going to ask me why I called him so late. He’s busy (my dad works a lot and will often leave the state). He’s going to think I’m a bother. He’s going to ask my aunt to take me instead. My aunt doesn’t like me (we don’t really have a good relationship, my sister doesn’t like her either). She’s going to think I’m a bother. She’s going to judge me. She’s going to think why she has to take me to school, that’s my responsibility. The kids are going to look at me and wonder what I was doing and why I was three hours late (it would’ve been third period by the time I arrived at school).”

I hated the thought of all of that, so I just stayed home, content with being grounded and yelled at by my sister. It was never the consequence that scared me, it was more like the judgment of others and the thought that I was just burdening others. 

This feeling of dread also comes when I think about talking to employees, but only sometimes. I have to be 100% sure of what’s going to happen after I say what I need to say, or else I won’t want to talk to them. It’s like I’m scared of them even though their job is literally meant to help people like us. My sister gets extremely frustrated with me about this, and there was a time I started crying because she practically forced me to talk to an employee, and she wouldn’t do it herself. She kept saying stuff like, “Why can’t you just talk to him?” and “You’re crying because you don’t want to talk to another person, maybe you should get that checked out,” while she just looked at her phone. When I asked her why she couldn’t talk to him, she said, “Because I know how to talk to other people. You don’t.” I eventually managed to talk to the employee after I made sure it didn’t look like I was just crying, and it was so much more simpler than I thought, and I felt embarrassed afterwards because we stood in front of the self-checkout for thirty minutes for... nothing. He just helped us and walked away.

I sometimes need confirmation for everything I do, or else I can’t do it. I can’t even text my own dad without my sister telling me what I have to say.

This doesn’t apply to every situation. I don’t even know what the circumstances are for this feeling of dread to happen. There are days where I’m perfectly okay with talking to other people, but then there are days like this where I’m just scared of what’s going to happen next.

I tried looking this up on Google (“feeling of dread”), and all that came up was “anxiety” or something related. I’d hate to be “that” person and self-diagnose, but is this really the case? I know this isn’t normal. But it’s not like I’m in a constant state of worry, it’s only when something comes up.

I’ve thought about talking to some of my good friends about this, but I quickly threw that idea out of the window because I didn’t want to seem like I was seeking attention like, “oh nooo, I have anxiety!!” And I felt like if I tried to talk to my friends about this when I’m not even 100% sure, it would just be a punch in the stomach to all the people who DO have anxiety, so I tried denying it for the longest time. But I realized it’s become a problem because I’m missing school. I’ve been nervous before, like presenting in front of the class, but I feel like this feeling has gotten worse over time. It’s never gotten this bad before.

The more I think about it, I feel like I’m just using this dread as an excuse to miss school... My thoughts are all over the place, I can’t even remember where I was going with this originally.

Is this feeling of dread normal and am I just using it as an excuse? Or is it something I need to talk about? Seek help for?",19Dec2019,1

63,"Hey guys 
So I’m traveling this week, and as soon as I arrived to my destination, my left foot started to feel wet. The  hole in my boot that I had just noticed while on the bus had finally given in. I’m in the PNW so rain is expected and that’s why most of my boots are waterproofs. These were the only walking shoes I’d brought. Since it’s a short trip I just decided on my daily boots and heeled boots for going out (they are not meant for walking miles in). 

So I found a cobbler and took my shoes in to get repaired. Not only did he rush my order so I’d have them the next afternoon, he didn’t charge me any extra. We talked for a bit my city and his, travel plans he had and what I was doing this week. He also gave me recommendations. 

Today when I went to pick up my boots we talked again, he asked me about what I’d done so far, how long I was in town and some other small things. He was super kind and really easy to talk to. I honestly feel like we could’ve talked for hours. He felt very genuine and kind. 

I have his number because he texted me when my order was ready. 

So my question is: Would it be weird/creepy for me to ask him if I could buy him a drink as a thank you for getting my boots fixed so quickly?",19Dec2019,1

I've been working on creating music for a couple of years now (on and off) but I feel as if I still need to work on some aspects of making music. 

The main thing I'm worried about is my singing voice, which could use a lot of work. When I was still going to my singing classes, (which I no longer go due to financial difficulties, which will soon change and I plan to continue sometime in the spring) my teacher told me I had a rich lower tone. I try to work with it and write songs that could help with it, which isn't very hard being a tenor. Thing is, my voice seems really nasally when I hear recordings of it. I usually have to over enunciate my words with my mouth wide open. I feel as if it makes me look silly, but it does help. However I still need help / to work on sounding nasally. Any advice on that?

I also need to work on my confidence.  I'm not exactly sure what it means to sing more confidently, but I was told by my instructor at the time. Any insight on that would be helpful.

Hi, 

I grew up religious. I believe in the supernatural stuff. However, it had become a phobia for me that ruined my life. I cannot stay alone or live alone at night specially. I would literally rather stay outside at 2 am.

76,"My grandfather is career military and has small cell lung cancer. His chemotherapy just ended today and my grandmother is basically intellectually disabled. My grandmother is 68 and absolutely can not live on her own. They spend over 300 dollars a month on her medicine alone. She needs physical therapy, constant doctors appointments and supervision to make sure she remembers her medicine, she's schizophrenic, has no idea how bills or anything of the like work, can't drive.. she's basically helpless because my grandfather did EVERYTHING for her. It's extreme learned-helplessness. Short of bathing and feeding her, she needs help with everything. Dressing even. That being said, I don't think she's considered legally disabled. I don't think anyone has ever pursued that classification for her.. I think we all just assumed she'd pass before my grandfather as he's really healthy (before the cancer) and she's absolutely not as she has heart failure, kidney failure, and type 2 diabetes.

Meanwhile, she is entitled to about 300 dollars a month in social security and that's it. My grandfather has next to no life insurance (about a 10,000 dollar plan) My mother and I live in a 2 bedroom apartment and don't make enough money to support another person.

When these events take place, my boss usually tells one of us 3 to basically watch over the center and make sure bad shit isn’t happening. I used to enjoy doing this, but as I’ve become more active in my social life and school, I simply do not have as much time for this as I used to. I’m finding myself having to cancel plans because suddenly my boss wants me to work an event, and I’m tired of it. I’m kind of indirectly the one who always gets asked to do these, and I know if I do not my other coworker will have to. My third coworker often does not have to because he is “busy” or is taking calls, but I know he’s favored because he’s my boss’s son.

83,"(Note: I'm 16, and my sister is 18.)

She just moved out recently, (living with my relatives.) We've always been close, but I've felt used by her a lot of the time too. A while back, she was in a discord server with me I created for a writing group. Everyone there, except for two individuals, were (known to be) around my age. One of them was in college, a girl, same age as my sister, and a friend of that girl, a guy who's also in college and probably older by a year. Anyway, I didn't kick them from the server just because of their age, there are strict rules on the server, I have four other admins and my sister was one of them. If they broke any rules, started asking for personal info or bothered anyone in the server, they would've been removed. I joke around a lot about different characters and stories in this server, and I did talk to the both of them because they participated.

Instead of telling me she wasn't okay with these two individuals because of their age, she screenshotted pretty normal images of our conversations. There were a few inappropriate jokes, but the rules in the server don't let it go beyond mere suggestion and it really wasn't a big deal at least from my perspective, and I come from a family of very christian people. She sent them, not to our parents, but to all of our closer relatives, claiming I was talking to an adult predator. She had been completely inactive in the server for like a month, hadn't talked to me, or expressed that she didn't trust the male in the server. She specifically removed herself from the server around that time, unfriended me, and didn't contact me for another month.

That caused a big uproar with my parents after the screenshots got to them. A month later my grandmother prompts her to text me, and I tried to talk to her about what happened. She re-adds me on discord, and I bring it up. I'm upset about it because how my relatives see me is really important to me, and because she knows what our parents are like (they blow up a lot and are very intense, with an Ndad) and she doesn't have contact with them because of how they are. I talk to her for a total of 10 minutes, I never yelled at her or tried arguing, I just wanted to explain how it affected me and I wanted her to not do something like that again. She ghosts me and exits the call. When we were talking, she refused to accept responsibility for it or agree that it was wrong not to communicate with me or just remove the guy herself, which she could've easily done as an admin. She blames me for not knowing better, and for 'sending (friend) after her'. I told a friend what happened because I was really upset, and that friend didn't go after her. He just tried talking to her through text, he even sent me pictures of the text conversation. He didn't say anything bad to her. Apparently it's okay for her to send all of our relatives after me, but me telling a friend who tries to reason with her isn't okay? 

She doesn't respond for four hours until I call spam her, which I apologize for later. My bad, not a good way to handle that. Come those four hours later, and she says that she's at walmart, and cant accept my call. I tell her that was fine but disappearing on me wasn't, and I'm not okay with how she handled things. She ignores what I said, and says she 'will not continue to discuss what happened.' She says she 'will likely contact me at a later date.' I don't understand how it's reasonable to refuse to talk about it. I understand \*why\* she did what she did, but I just want her to accept that it was wrong not to try and express her concern from the beginning, because of how much backlash she knew I would be getting for it from my parents. Not to mention that she wasn't even busy throughout the months. She's not working, she's doing online college, which she's already ahead in her classes (she's very vocal about how ahead she is, too) and she has time to go on two hour walks everyday.

Is it wrong for me to want to hold her accountable/for me to still be upset about this? I don't know where to go with things, I've been having a really hard time and she keeps telling me she's there for me, but she never really supports me while I'm always here to help her with whatever is stressing her out.

94,"I’ve received a letter of offer for a new position which is the exact career path I’m looking for. Unfortunately, it’s a 12 month contract to replace someone on maternity leave, and has a non-negotiable fixed end date. 


I’ve spoken to the manager who has implied that other positions may come up in my team or one of the other teams in our unit during that time, and I’d be welcome to apply for those as an internal candidate. My worry is that, what if I don’t get those positions and that I am forced to leave after the 12 months. It’s a fairly entry level position, and I feel it would look poorly on a resume, and be difficult to explain to a new company why they didn’t keep me on. Surely if someone is really worthwhile they would do everything they could to keep me. But if no new positions come up, then I’d essentially be screwed. 


My thoughts are like this: 


Pros:

- Huge pay increase
- Cuts my commute time in half each way
- It’s exactly the kind of work I want to move into 


Cons:
- A position may not open up in another team, or I may not get the role 
- I’m not considered a permanent employee, and do not have the 9 day fortnight roster that everyone else has. I worry this will make me stick out as the ‘Temp’ 
- I’ll be viewed as the ‘Temp’ in the team, as they will all know I’m replacing someone to who WILL be returning
- Because I’m viewed as the ‘Temp’ I’ll be doing all the grunt work and none of the interesting/career growing stuff because they won’t see any reason to develop my skills if it’s guaranteed I’m leaving 
- Accordingly, I won’t have much growth or be able to gain any seniority

3 weeks ago, my girlfriend (f24) broke up with me (m23). We have been together for almost 2 years, but we have been living together for the last 5 months. She told me she no longer loved me, and that the last 2 months of living together she was falling out of love. She also told me she cheated on my the night prior to breaking up. We were planning on doing through the end of the lease (July 2020) but recent events changed that. She found someone new a few days ago.
I have been left betrayed, hurt, and alone. And even so, I still have feelings for her. We plan on breaking the lease, but that still means living together another 2 months. It's hard to be stopping her, as things have changed so quick and she can't stand being around me. 
How can I move on? I've never been put in this position before.",19Dec2019,1

109,"I am currently a junior in undergrad at a competitive school. I will graduate in the Spring of 2021 with several different honors and awards should I stay on track. I will graduate with two majors (one in History and one in Indigenous History) and a minor in Deaf Studies. 

I'm currently looking at various grad schools with the goal of getting my masters in Student Affairs with the eventual goal of being a chancellor or a director of TRiO (I currently work for TRiO and love my job with them.) 

However, lately, I've been really tempted to move out of America. I currently am registered to vote in Minnesota, but my residence changes throughout the year due to schooling. 

I've looked at going to grad school in Canada and then applying for permanent residence while already there on a student visa, but considering the fact I will likely not pay any money for grad school here in America due to assistantships and such, I'm not super thrilled to attend a Canadian school and pay a couple thousand (although that is really cheap all things considered). 

So if I wait until after I finish my masters, how hard would it be to immigrate considering I will have no job experience except for internships and any work I do while in school. It seems the easiest way to move is by having job experience in the proper job sectors or by having a student visa and then staying.

I hope I explained all of this well, but feel free to ask for any clarification in the comments.",19Dec2019,1

112,"For context: I am a bisexual girl. I met this girl, whom I'll call Veronica, at the beginning of this year through a theater program. We became friends quickly, and I also became friends with her best friend. Pretty much right off the bat, I was attracted to her and developed a significant crush on her. Veronica claims to be straight for a while. However, she texted me one day and asked me how I'd known about my sexuality. I told her briefly how it had happened for me and warned her that it would probably take a long time to figure out. She then tells me that she has feelings for me. I didn't want to get hurt, or for her to get hurt, so I told her to just think about things for a couple of weeks or so until she figured it out. She texts me again, a day or so later, and says that she's pretty sure she's bisexual and asks me if I like her. I very clearly said, ""Don't jump into anything or feel pressured to get into a relationship just because I like you."" She made it clear that she wanted a relationship, too, so we started a relationship.    
Less than a week into this, she tells me that she's started to have a crush on a boy. She tells me not to worry and that it would pass and nothing would come of it. I didn't want to be a douche so I didn't get upset and I trusted her. I agreed to just let it go and not worry about it. A week later, we're coming out of auditions for another play when she stops me and promptly tells me that she just doesn't have the same feelings for me as she used to and breaks up with me. I tried to act like everything was fine, again, because I didn't want to blow up in her face. But I got home and I started sobbing and I texted her telling her all of this and how much it hurt. She apologized but frankly, I'm still upset. I'm not over her at all. She's still the sweetest and funniest girl I know and I really like her. I want to not like her because there's nothing I can do about liking her and it hurts. What do I do? How do I get over this?

114,"Hey guys,

So I’m really lost right now when it comes to this girl... a bit of background. 
She’s 24 and I’m 23. I like her way more than any girl I’ve met before and known her for 4years since we are in the same course at uni. We’ve got along very well since day 1. In the past we have admitted we find each other attractive and kissed on nights out a few times but nothing more than that, possibly due to me being a little naive at the time honestly.
People often ask what's going on between the 2 of us, including a girl that's a good mutual friend in our classes.

So this year I come back to Uni after our year abroad (Spain for me, Germany for her) and we get along great again except now she has a boyfriend of a few months who lives in Germany... sad times. 

Anyway, fast forward to the past 2 weeks,  she has been even more talkative and flirty than usual. 
We organise to meet for drinks last week and she tells me she’s ‘broken up’ with the boyfriend quite early on (he was getting too close to some other girl).
So anyway we spend the night talking and playing pool until 4am, We have this crazy amount of eye contact like we always do, compliment each other’s looks, clearly I think she is gorgeous (She says that she always thought I’m the best looking guy on our course etc.) and as the night goes on we get way more touchy (hugs, playful slaps while we played pool and sitting with my arm around her for ages). 

At one stage we played doubles with a couple and she said to them that this was our first date. The guy from the other couple actually said to me he thought we’d been together ages since our chemistry seems great.
It was genuinely a great night and from texting for a couple days after we both clearly want to do it again. My only regret was not going for a kiss again.

Now, heres the bad part. Turns out her and the BF had booked to go away on a trip together and she has gone since they had already paid. She says they might try work things out but finds it hard to trust him now. 

My problem is, I get the feeling things were finally on the right track for something to happen between us and now she’s on a 5 day trip with him where they will defo figure things out :( plus I’m not going to see her until the new year. 

Should I ask her out again? Should I give her space? I’ve literally no idea what to do and she means a lot to me honestly.

Does anyone have any advice/ thoughts as this is really wrecking my head! I’ll answer any follow up questions. 

Help me out folks :(",19Dec2019,1

119,"Hi everyone, I'm gonna make this story as short as possible, but I really want some advice about what I should do.

3 weeks ago I attended a Christmas party with my mom, and noticed this really cute guy, we were exchanging some looks at eachother but I didn't think anything of it. A couple of days later he ended up matching with me on Hinge, and we hit it off and met up in person. Everything was great when we met up! We went out for coffee, and food. We ended the night making out, it was amazing.

We arranged to meet the following Friday, and on the night of he asked me if I was ready to go out, and asked me of spots we should check out, I named a few, and then he said he wasn't picky, so I suggested one bar, and he never responded or confirmed with meeting me at this bar.

We agreed to meet for 7:30pm; I didn't end up hearing from him until 8:30pm and then he told me he got into a car accident, he said a drunk driver hit the back of his car and that his car was ruined. He apologized and said, ""I'm so sorry my dear, I really wanted to see you. I'm so sorry for getting back to you so late, this was the only time I could get a hold of you.""

Anyway.. I figured he was lying, and wanted to get out of seeing me, so I deleted his number and moved on.

He texts me today, saying that he's had a stressful week because he doesn't have his car because its in repair. He asked me if I'd be available to meet on Saturday if he got his car back tomorrow and if I'd be interested in going out for drinks &amp; dinner on Saturday evening, and then to head back to his place after.


What should I do? Should I give him the benefit of the doubt, or is he lying to me and just trying to get sex out of me?

120,"Here is the run down. My SO's childhood friend is living in another state which is my SO's birth place. He has always been weird about talking to my SO and blocked him on Facebook for no reason. I asked what was up and he claimed that he didn't want my SO to see him struggle with his depression... Despite openly sharing edgy suicide memes on his public Facebook account, and often talking openly about his Depression and suicidal ideation. Fair enough, I guess, everyone does their own thing, but here is the problem. He would only talk to me. Not my SO. He even let us come up and visit a few times, but still refused to talk to my SO after. After a while I started to get more angry and finally convened him to talk to my SO, because I got pissed off that he wouldn't directly talk to my SO online despite us visiting him multiple times. He told me yes, but it had to be short. I thought he meant that he wasn't willing to have long conversations, but now I realize that he was only willing to have ONE short conversation and that was it. My SO friend has never told me why he is doing this. Talking to him is like trying approach a skittish animal. You have to be cautious and you have to word things very carefully. If you even try to act approachable and friendly he will stop talking to you and sometimes not even reply back for months. I end up having to talk to him like I just met him. You have to act as emotionally distant as possible with the guy.

My SO is emotionally attached to his friend due to things that happened during his childhood. He deeply cares for his friend and it constantly worried about him because this friend is suffering from severe Depression and has bad suicidal ideation. He talks about trying to help him, to support him, and to go visit again. Either my SO realizes that his friend is ignoring him, but is too stubborn to admit it and accept it, or he some how hasn't put two and two together. 

I understand that the dude is struggling, I have bad mental health issues too, and I understand being secretive about it, not willing to open up in order to not hurt other people, being unbearably overwhelmed 24/7, and socially regressing due to feeling overwhelmed in any situation involving human contact, and but this isn't okay and it needs to stop. If he is willing to let us drive 7 hours and stay 2 days to hang out, then why does he refuse to talk to my SO any other time? Maybe a defense mechanism? Maybe he is unsure of when he is going to commit suicide, so he is keeping people as far away from him as possible. Or maybe he is just being an ass. Who knows.

I shouldn't have to be the one to tell my SO what is going on, but this has gone on for too long. I can't get his friend lead both of us on, and I am not going to join his friend on leading my SO on. The guy isn't a bad guy. I don't think he is a bad guy, and I know it's his mental health causing him to behave like this. I'm just angry at him.

About 3 days ago, my girlfriend and I came back to Georgia from LA from our leisurely trip. However, I left my phone at the airport, LAX.

127,"I’m going to sum this up because it’s too long to explain. Essentially I had a friend. Said friend is a habitual liar and extremely manipulative. When caught lying they just continue to lie about things they haven’t been caught lying about. On three separate occasions I caught them lying and on the last occasion I snapped and alerted everyone around me to their lies and manipulative tendencies. 
Problem being is my friends don’t care. They still laugh and talk with this person and essentially validates the fact that they can being extreme toxic without any repercussions. I’m sick of being anywhere near or even having the displeasure of knowing this person. Because of this person I have horrendous trust issues that are ruining my social life but no one seems to care about how this person lied about every single aspect of their life to seem better. Even worse when I try to tell my friends that this person is still extremely manipulative and still a liar they literally ignore me. Won’t respond to my text. Won’t talk to me. Treating me like I’m the one who’s the shitty person.
I just want to get rid of them all, but I won’t have any friends, and I lowkey love them but I dislike the lying mfer so much I don’t want to associate with anyone who associates with them. Classes will be awkward with then and I’ll be alone. After all of this I’ll be left alone, friendless and wondering the train wreck that is the rest of my academic life without anyone to be there with me. While the bitch who deadass believes they are superior to any and everyone around has even MORE friends than before this whole debacle, and still continues to lie and treat people like “peasants” (their words not mine), is seemingly thriving.
As I write this I wonder, if I didn’t do anything wrong why am I being ostracized? Is life just this unfair? If I’m trying to be a good person and this is what happens to good people, what’s the point of being a good person? What do I do now? Do I go back to my friends? Do I give up and accept back the lying bitch because without them I lose everything? That’s the last thing I want to do.

128,"Ive known this girl since 2010 and we have been friends since. I dont know how to handle our friendship at this point and i was hoping you guys would have some advice for me.

My friend has always been the type to be the lead and shut down anything that wasn’t her idea. We couldn’t even hang out unless it was her idea and even then she’d ditch me in favor of her bf that she lives with. She makes empty promises and only reaches out when she wants something like for me to buy her food or to ask me for money. Shes been known to ignore me when i go to visit on days we planned to hang out because she wasn’t feeling like it or just didn’t want to. During nearly none of these times did she cancel ahead or tell me when i got there, she would pretend she wasn’t home so she didn’t have to deal with it. I feel taken advantage of and its only now that im realizing that i have probably not been a friend to her since she first met him in 2016 when this all started. 

Before she’d at least treat me with some decency and like i was actually her friend. 

A few months ago she and her bf got in a fight with my brother over something my brother saw her bf do. It wasn’t anything huge but it still caused her to stop talking to me for two months. 

Fast forward to now. My family had promised my friend and her bf that they could move into a rental property after their apartment least was up. It turns out that their house was still being renovated and wasn’t livable yet. They had nowhere else to go so we offered them my house that we’ve been working on (i had already paid the deposit in advance for when i move in) so they wouldn’t be homeless. 
Their house is set to be done within the week.

Since this whole thing started my old friend has been trying to talk to me and hang out since they moved into my house and frankly i have no idea how to deal with this. I don’t want to just cut her off but i don’t want to be taken advantage of, treated like im not worthy of her time or shit talked by her bf. They’re joined at the hip and this behavior started when he came into her life. 

I just want my old friend back but at this point should i just let go or try to work this out?

I am a person who has always loved games since my childhood.

Some time ago I played ESO (elder scrolls online) a lot and got very attached to it in all aspects.

The problem started when I set aside ""enjoy the game"" to ""play incessantly to get gold"". For a while this was not a problem as I was really enjoying it, but there came a time when that routine (almost like a real job) started to take away the magic, the feeling, that I had for the game and basically stayed that way with others games too.

I would like some advice to enjoy things as simply as they are, to laugh with other people and slow down a bit.

I would also like to leave this message as a warning to those who come into games, mmorpg, with the intention of ""being the best at everything faster"". Yes, everyone enjoys games the way they can, but be careful not to become toxic to yourself.

136,"Sorry for the throwaway

My sister just got started high school but has been struggling with her grades. Even though she is extremely diligent to the point where I don’t think she even has free time, she has trouble keeping up with her classmates. I don’t interact with her as much anymore since I’m in college now, but whenever I call she seems really down.

At home my dad puts a lot of pressure on her and says things that I feel are unjustified, things like that she doesn’t care about her grades, or has a bad attitude. I feel like it’s gotten to a point where she’s about to break, but I don’t know how to change it. I’m too afraid to stand up to my dad.

Growing up my dad used to have a bad temper and I would constantly listen to fights or see my mom cry. He never hit anyone, but it was still very traumatizing to me as a kid. Even when his temper got better I generally avoided talking to him and tried to stay away from him as much as possible. When I was a kid, he would also control my grades, but I was able to manage.

I don’t know if it’s related, but my sister broke her arm once when we were playing. I tickled her and she rolled off the bed, hitting her arm against the bed frame and breaking it. She underwent surgery with general anesthesia at a pretty young age (4-5). I’ve read studies saying that getting GA at that age inhibits your mental functions permanently. I still feel extremely guilty from the fact I might have ruined her life by making school so much harder for her. I feel like I’m failing her every day I’m alive.

Seeing your friends put in a fraction of the work but receive better grades is a feeling I couldn’t even begin to imagine. It hurts so much to see her like this, and I don’t know what to do. My dad sees nothing wrong with his approach, as I managed to make it out alive, and no one believes in going to therapy. My mom can’t seem to change my dad’s mind, and I don’t have the guts either to tell my dad he is wrong.

I've tried multiple different toothpastes including whitening and non-whitening (for a while i was brushing twice each time using both), I've tried charcoal toothpaste, I floss once a day as well.

He says he wants his own place to be more independent but seeing how he’s been for the past few years is making me doubt that’s possible. I can see him moving out fine but I also think that he’s most likely going to be calling my mum to come over constantly to help him with something. Whether it’s making food (which he can do himself but sometimes he has episodes where he gets too stressed) or fixing something in the house. I mean even now he stresses out when my mum is at work. She tries to make him more independent and he can be but a lot of the time he does need her mostly for emotional support. 

I’m worried about what happens when my mum dies. I don’t want to think about it but I find myself thinking it constantly. My sister loves my brother because they’re siblings but she hates him. If she had the choice she’d get rid of him. She hates him because of how he treats my mum sometimes and ya know I get why she does. Seeing that type of treatment hurts me too but I’ve always loved my brother, always even when he’s horrible. I’m worried that when my mum dies it’ll be my responsibility to make sure my brother is okay. Part of me hopes my sister will help but I don’t see that happening. Part of me wants to just not help when that time comes but I would never be able to forgive myself.

the problem i'm asking about is that i think i have severe alcoholism. i started drinking about 8 months ago, stealing half a glass of whiskey from my parent's cabinet once in a while, maybe twice a month just for fun to be drunk alone. i thought it was fun to be in another state of mind for some time. but things began to go downhill after i got a job, and my depression was getting worse.. i decided that i'd start buying my own alcohol with the money i'd earn from my job from older people i know. the first two bottles i bought were smirnoff vodka. i was so skeptical and it was crazy to think that i was buying my own alcohol.. i drank almost every day that week. both of the bottles were empty by the next week. so i bought more. more bottles of vodka. more of whiskey. i'd mix them together sometimes. i dont even know how much i drink at a time, i usually just take a swig for every letter in my full name which is 13 letters long. in the past 3 months, ive bought over 8 bottles and drank them all by myself on school nights, weekends, in the daytime sometimes.. i hated being drunk with people, but i loved being drunk by myself.

3 days ago i threw up blood for the first time and ive been worried since. but guess what i did the next day? i drank again. i feel like i can feel myself deteriorating, but i just don't care enough about my life to stop. my family doesn't have ANY idea that this problem is going on. i haven't said anything to my therapist (who ive only seen three times so far) because i don't know how to say anything. my friends are so disappointed in me and don't know how to help.

He was talking about her and his for some reason (I wasent really listening that closely) so after I asked if he knew and if it was ok to tell him I said ""you know she also likes girls to right""

He kinda.stopped for a second before saying something along the lines of ""gross"" this stopped me.

""Its not like it's her choice"" I said feeling a bit angry already 

He said ""yeah it is liking the same gender is a choice"" then he continued to ask around the table for there opinions 

Then I was getting super angry at how he obviously knew nothing about what he wa talking about so I said""there is scientific proof that it's not a choice'

He then had the nerve to say ""is science always right"" ok so you feel validated by a group of teens opinions but science is just to much 

This was my limit so I started cursing and we argued until it was time to leave. 

I just need to know what can I do? Should I just ignore him?",19Dec2019,1
175,"Info: I have lived with my roommate for about a year. They are awesome and a very close friend. I have thought they might be bi-polar for a while now. My roommate will sit on our couch and not move for a few days and will talk about how sad they are. Then after a random amount of time they will change everything up. They stop sleeping, they begin to clean everything, and will even clear out their room and move it to our empty room.

177,"So, for some context, this girl is 17 years old, and I’m 16. We became friends a few months ago, and that’s all I saw her as. She was in a very abusive relationship, and she has had a terrible life. She has many different mental illnesses, depression being at the forefront. A couple months ago, her and her ex broke up. About 3 weeks after that, she tells me she likes me. I was shocked, and told her I don’t feel the same. And I didn’t. But recently, as I’ve gotten to know her more, I’ve begun to catch feelings. She is currently checked into a mental hospital because of suicidal thoughts and tendencies. She just told me that the hardest part is that she has to tell people all day about her unrequited feelings for me, and then talk to me on the phone. It is making her life a lot harder, and I don’t know what to do. Would me telling her how I feel hurt, or help the situation? If it is the latter how would I go about doing that?",19Dec2019,1
178,"Im not explaining more than what I can, but I almost jumped my dad.

My parents have been married 20 years. My mom has a hard time standing up to my dad and she finally did so, but when my dad is stood up to, he gets pissy and pouts, for whatever reason it may be.

He does not treat my mom right at all, it is never physical but he'll ignore her or be rude at some points after bedtime, to the point where my mom is the one sleeping on the couch every night.

I come out of the rec room to find my mom crying because my dad felt ""disrespected"" after my mom being rightfully upset that he didn't do a simple task that she asked. I try to go back there and talk to him, she pulls me back crying, saying ""You'll only make it worse, please"". I slam on the door yelling at him to come out of his room and stop hiding and acting better than us when mom finally pulls me away. My sister comes out asking wtf is up and mom is explaining through sobs what happened, and I lose my temper and run to my parents' room and break down the door. Both my sister and my mom had to restrain me from jumping on his stupid ass sitting in bed reading a fucking book like he's fine, when earlier tonight he was getting upset about not having food come to him fast enough in a drive through.

I don't like my father. He disrespects my mother too much and none of us deserve it, especially when me and my younger sister get dragged into it every fucking day.

I have since calmed down and am not going to attack my father, but I will not be his friend anytime soon.

183,"I met this guy a couple years ago, we’ll call him Steve, and we hit it off right away and became good friends rather quickly. Since we first met, he’s told me that ALL of his family members hate him for no discernible reason, his parents abandoned him when he was just a toddler like just left him to the streets, and he doesn’t keep in contact with any of them. Several months go by and one day I’m at his apartment and a piece of mail catches my name. I noticed the first name it was addressed to was his roommates, we’ll call the roommate Rick, and Steve’s last name (he was living in a shared house with rick and a family consisting of a single mother and 3 kids) so: “Rick *Steves last name.* I found this really odd and suspicious because as far as I knew they had no relation to one another. I asked him about it and he told me that they’re not related, Rick just changed his last name to Steve’s because almost a decade ago they were involved with crime (not gonna give details) together and when they both wanted to leave that lifestyle they thought it would be a good idea to stick together and share the same last name. Didn’t really get it but just tried to accept it and move on, even though I didn’t fully believe what he was telling me. I noticed they had an odd relationship; Rick was helping Steve out financially and showed care for him but Steve was mean to him and told me that he really didn’t like Rick.. Anyways, ever since then there have been a few incidents that has led me to be even more suspicious that they’re related, as well as Steve being related to the family he was living with; so basically they’re all related, and Steve is adamant that these people are strangers except for Rick who is at most an ex friend from a past life he left behind. Some of these incidents include:

1. One of Steve’s roommates, the single mothers daughter, vandalized my car and so we called the police. When they came and were talking to me and Steve trying to get the story straight for their report, they said to Steve, “that’s your sister right? You’re sister is the one who vandalized the car? Steve said no she’s not my sister she’s just my roommate but they didn’t believe him and said we know that’s your sister, we’ve been here before. Confronted him about this later and he told me that one time the cops were called on the mothers son and Steve lied and said they were related to vouch for his character better. 

2. At this time, Steve moved into a new house with Rick and the single mothers mother, lets call her Jane, who was friends with Rick, ended up moving in too. I overheard Rick talking to Steve and referring to Jane as his mother. He kept saying “tell your mother” and I heard Steve shushing him, probably because he knew I could hear. Confronted him about it and he was adamant that Rick was saying “her mother,” but that was really hard to believe because I heard “your mother” SEVERAL times and the shushing made it even more unbelievable 

3. When he first moved into the new house with Rick, the old roommate (single mom) came to visit and went up to Steve’s bedroom door and said “COME ON STEVE, SHOW YOUR SISTER YOUR NEW ROOM.” He got really mad at her and told her to go away. His excuse? Back at the old place they used to joke about being related and the joke still stuck around years later. Side note: if the single mom really was Steve’s sister, it would make sense that Jane would be Steve’s mother.

Even after all this, I chose to trust what he told me and keep my suspicions and paranoias at bay. Idk why but today I decided to google ricks name, and I ended up unfortunately finding things that shocked me and confirmed my suspicions. I wasn’t really expecting much but I basically found a ton of evidence suggesting that Steve is indeed related to Rick, pretty sure Rick is his uncle, and Rick and Steve are also related to the ex roommates. I’ve already made this so long so I don’t really wanna give details. I will if someone wants to know, I also have screenshots, but I’m not sure how much relevancy this post is gonna get. Anyways, I confronted Steve and showed him a ton of evidence and he still was adamant that he’s not related to any of these people!!!  He claims that this is a case of identity theft (I found ricks relatives and they all had Steve’s last name). He thinks everyone but rick “stole” his last name. I know this is a bizarre situation and I hope it was somewhat easy to follow, but I guess I’m just posting this to get some input and curious if anyone knows about identity theft (I know next to nothing about it) and also the likelihood that all these people from ricks family(i’ve found at least 4 so far) managed to change their last name to Steve’s last name. I’m sure it’s probably very very slim so honestly I’m more so looking for validation that Steve is indeed lying. Also, who the fuck lies about something like this? The only reason I can think of is him and his family are involved in something really sketchy. I would really appreciate some thoughts on why someone would lie about who their family is. Tell me he was disowned by everyone just for that to not be the case at all. So crazy, especially since besides this he’s been nothing but great to me and has opened up to me about a lot. If you read this whole thing, thank you so much, you a real one.

Tl dr;    Met a guy and he told me he keeps in contact with none of his family because they all hate him and disowned him from a young age. I find evidence that strongly suggests he’s related to his roommates but even after so much evidence is shown to him he denies that they’re family and accuses the ones that share his last name of identity theft claiming they “stole” his last name. Really would appreciate some input because what the actual fuck.",19Dec2019,1

193,"Background:

4 years ago I started hanging out with this girl I met on social media. We went to the same college, so would hung out a couple of times at campus (e..g, getting lunch together, even making out in her car one time). Eventually her and I went on a ""real"" date; we went to get dinner and see a show. Throughout the date, her and I made out a couple of times. When we got out of my car and started walking to the show we were going to, she was being flirty with me so I touched her butt. She said in a flirty/joking voice ""Haha anon stop that"" to which I did it again as I honestly thought she was being flirty/joking around. Then she said ""Anon I mean it stop"" to which I did and apologized on the spot. The girl then proceeded to grab my hand to hold it and we went on with the date. During the movie, she even asked me to ""place my hand"" on her inner thigh to ""keep it warm."" When I dropped her off at her house, we made out again and she even joked that she needed to ""teach me how to kiss."" She told me to text her when I got home safe which I did. We texted over the next couple of days, however, I started to pull back as I couldn't see myself dating her (e.g., rude to wait staff, immature, not serious about school, consonantly posting stuff on social media, etc.).

One day I ""innocently"" liked one of her friend's selfie on Instagram who followed me a couple of weeks back. A couple of minutes later I received a text from her ""Why did you like her selfie and not mine? I let you keep touching my butt when I said no"", almost seeming like she was trying to gaslight me for not giving her attention. A week or so later she asked about meeting up again and I told her that I was busy with school/work. Over the next couple of weeks she would text me memes (i.e., ""This reminds me of you"") and ""like"" posts of mine of social media. One time I posted on a social media outlet how a funny situation I was in landed me a date to which she texted me and said ""Remember my tips anon"" referring to her ""teaching me how to kiss.""

Fast forward a few weeks; I check my Twitter and I see that she has a screenshot of a tweet of mine with the caption ""This is funny coming from a guy who kept grabbing my ass when I said no on a date"" with a fair amount of people ""liking"" it. I texted her immediately asking her what was up and she said that ""someone had to call me out"" and gaslight me about how other girls were contacting her with a similar experience about me (?) which is not true. I lurked her profile and before she made that tweet she tweeted ""You're so cringey why did I ever go on a date with you."" A day later she started to ""like"" social media posts of mine. A couple of weeks later she even contacted me about buying a car that I was selling. Her ""interacting"" with me on social media (e.g., ""liking"" my posts, tweeting memes at me, etc.) continued for a couple of months before I unfollowed her. When I realized I unfollowed her she tweeted at me ""I'll miss you anon."" I remember randomly getting notifications on Tinder years back that she would ""Super Like"" me.

Now:

I realize that this girl has been friends with some of my friends. I'm worried about this ""rumor"" starting again and her ruining my reputation, even more so now that I have a career.

I can honestly say that me touching her butt on the date had no malicious intent; I honestly misunderstood her as we were just making out. After everything I did look up more on consent and ensuring that everyone I have sexual relations with is 100% comfortable. My girlfriend even joked to me ""Anon I appreciate this but you don't need to keep asking.""

1. Do you think I should contact this girl or just let it go? I feel like contacting her about the situation would make everything worse and she would just use my words against me.
2. Do you feel that it was weird that she continued to contact me following the date and the ""call out"" post? I feel like if I truly did something to violate her she would have cut me off ASAP. It seems that most survivors of sexual assault NEVER want ANY contact with someone who violated them. I almost feel like she is doing this due to me not giving her attention.

Three years later at a vendor Christmas party I met my ex-boss and he is still holding a grudge. I approached him placing my hand subtly on his shoulder and asked if he was still angry, he replied with “always brother, take your hand off me”. I did so and continued socializing with everyone else.

He is very well known in the field in my small country and I’ve heard stories of him telling employees who I still have contact with that he wants to “break my jaw”.  Where do I go from here?

198,"I did a job for a charity today and I'm thinking about calling child services but I'm not sure if that's the right thing to do. 

I didn't see any signs of abuse but the conditions were so bad. The house was infested with bugs and mice. They were literally everywhere. Piles of bugs in huge mounds. They were crawling on me too and at one point a mouse took a roach off my leg and into a hole in the house. I had to leave to get something for the job and I was just shaking the whole time. I didn't want to go back. I was scared but I went back and I finished the job. 

There are kids living there and they were just walking around in diapers with bugs crawling up them.  The parents seemed mentally disabled to me. I don't think they were on drugs or anything.

I've showered and washed my hands but I still feel like I have bugs crawling on me, I still smell the house on me, and I keep thinking I'm seeing mice out of the corner of my eye. I'm not the kinda guy to be bothered by things but this broke me. I almost cried for the first time as an adult today. 

Anyway I keep thinking that maybe it would be better if someone did something to get the kids out of there and that maybe even an orphanage would be better than that.

I profusely apologised and explained I didn't know it was meant to be a secret. Told her I had a concussion and was rambling for 30 mins and wasnt even sure what I had said. I've taken full accountability that I shouldn't have asked. She responded by saying it's not my place to ever speak about anything shes told me. And that she'll know better to speak to me again. I've only known CG 7 months, so this kind of hit me hard that she felt so strongly about something I genuinely didn't know was a secret.

It made me think through the day, and I noticed a pattern through her texts of her getting deeply offended and upset by minor issues, such as her mum not calling often enough but she refuses to call her mum, her friends boyfriends not joining her for drinks and anyone that has ever cancelled plans. She holds grudges with these people but I hadn't noticed til I've seen that side of her myself. 

I was meant to be staying with her and my cousin this weekend, but now I feel very uncomfortable doing so. Unfortunately I can't get a hotel on such short notice and so close to Christmas. I'm now wondering should I go at all because I don't want to stay in a hostile environment for the weekend, especially when there will be alcohol involved at the birthday party. I don't want drama and have just made progress through a very tough time with my own mental health. This is literally keeping me up because I don't want to let my cousin down but I dont want to feel unwanted or unwelcome for the weekend either. Should I give the party a miss?",19Dec2019,1
207,"So about a week ago I got fired because my supervisor tried to rob two stores with a knife on a Sunday. I only work weekends, so when I came back Friday I was bombarded with questions about my acid reflux (reason I have called out before). Then my managers and owner of the store proceeded to ask me about my supervisor robbing the stores. They seemed to believe I was involved in these robberies, although I wasn’t. I haven’t been contacted by the police at all since it happened. (It happened on the 7th)

The only reason they fired me was because I “sold” him Xanax. While he would annoy the hell out of me about it until I got them for him. Him being my supervisor made me decide to get them for him because I didn’t want to make my work shifts hell. 

They also accused me of not coming forward to them about him being on drugs, while every other employee in the store knew the same information I did about his drug use. I was only involved with selling him Xanax, which from my experience doesn’t incline you to rob stores, he was definitely on meth and probably herion, I know this definitely not linked to me, although they do have proof I sold him Xanax at some point. I’m not a drug dealer at all, I just got some for him because he told me he stole his moms and wanted to replace them. 

As a result of this, I was the only one fired, no other employee was questioned, and my manager originally told me I probably would get my job back because I was not the only one at fault. I was just told today that I am not able to come back or use them as a reference, although my manger was on my side during the initial process. 

I’m pretty upset about this, I know I won’t get my job back, but I want to unleash hell on the owner for singling me out. By unleashing hell, I just mean sending him a rude message or call because I Just feel like I’ve been unfairly fired, and no one else at that job have faced any other consequences.",19Dec2019,1
208,"For the past four to five years, I have been dealing with emotional numbness (depersonalization), sexual problems, among other side effects and symptoms. I have tried psychotherapy, sex therapy, 26 psychiatric medications, trans-cranial magnetic stimulation, electro convulsive therapy, exercise, diet, attempts at positive thinking, and despite how hard I try, hardly anything budges. I haven't laughed, cried, or been aroused (among other things) for years and its really bugging me. I feel stable but also like a robot as if I cannot fully participate in society due to something holding me back.

So it started in 2014 when I was dealing with overwhelming anxiety about finances that made it hard for me to fall asleep. I remember the anxiety being so intense that I couldn't fall asleep until that intense anxiety faded away into oblivion and was substituted with numbness (anhedonia). This feeling would persist for a long time and after feeling numb for so long, in 2015 I started therapy. Due to my therapist not meshing well with me, and that I was spending buckoo bucks (a lot of money), I decided to try medication to deal with my problems. It was a rough nightmare. My prescribers were constantly titrating and tapering me off many psychiatric medications like SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, MAOI antidepressants, antipsychotics, stimulants, lithium, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, esketamine, and antihistamines. In addition to that, I tried electroconvulsive therapy and trans-cranial magnet stimulation and while I didn't sad, hopless, suicidal, or bed-ridden, I still don't feel like what I used to be when I was a kid or a teen. My attraction (romantic and sexual) towards women has vanished years ago. No happiness, no ecstasy, no anger, no sadness, no confusion, no affection, nada.

I talked to several medical professionals and they told me that I am a unique treatment-resistant patient and that they have never met a patient who has been resistant to so many treatments. One day, when browsing through Reddit, I saw a thread of a woman complaining that her boyfriend's low libido is negatively affecting her quality of life. I then saw someone posted a comment that just made me heartbroken.

&gt; *If intimacy and sex are that important to you, you shouldn't settle since it is a crucial component in your quality of life in a relationship and you shouldn't have to suffer. Yes, it sucks that your boyfriend has a low libido due to reasons outside of his control, but you don't owe him your time if you don't feel like he can satisfy you.*

It made me feel hopeless and even suicidal because if sexual relations and romantic bonding are so important in a relationship, and if I cannot preform well romantically and sexually in a relationship, then I might be doomed to spend the rest of my life numb and alone. Recently, these suicidal thoughts have been becoming persistent and it is a weird experience. I don't feel the sadness and emotional pain that many suicidal people would feel, all I have are thoughts compelling me to end it all just to find relief from this horrible case of depersonalization that medical professionals failed to find an adequate solution to my problem. Being on a slew of medications made me gain so much weight, killed my libido, gave me ED, made my ejaculation weak, developed strechmarks, type 2 diabetes, and gynaecomastia.

I feel that my life is ruined beyond repair. I never imagined that I could go through so many treatments only to be royally screwed over by side effects, some are permanent like diabetes. If I even can get to lose the weight and restore feeling, I worry that certain things like strechmarks, diabetes, and sexual problems will follow me for the rest of my life with no viable solution. I don't want to start a pity party, nor am I having any plans on acting on my suicidal thoughts. However, I feel like my situation is hopless and while suicide sounds appealing on first glance, part of me is thinking that a crappy life is still better than a premature death.

Hi! My name is Antti. I'm a 16-year-old male from Finland and I'm in need of help/advice. For a long time now I've suffered from depression, social-anxiety, and anxiety (Planning to get help for that, but unsure on when I will). Recently my life has come to a dead end and I have no idea on what to do. I quit my studies (Didn't like what I was studying and I felt out of place) and I've shut myself inside my room, I have nothing else to do so I mainly talk to my online friends on my computer.

I have a lot of different things that I am interested in, such as sports (mainly sports like football, floorball etc), computer games, music (favourite instrument would probably be the piano), tv-series, movies, books and I'm mostly eager to try new things. For the last two years or so however, things have not looked so great for me, I realized that I have no friends and I am really bad at making them, I started becoming more sad, and I've felts more and more down. I've gone through self-harm, bad thoughts, etc. This year, I graduated from secondary school (which means that I'm legally allowed to quit school if I so wish to) and then I applied myself to a vocational college specified in marketing. I stayed in the school for a few months and after autumn vacation came, I decided I was going to quit, I hadn't made any friends there and I didn't really like what I was studying anyways. This decision was easy for me to make, but my parents scolded me for it, and they are really upset at me about it (Divorced). They continuously keep pushing me to try and find a place to study and I am not hearing the end of it.

As of right now, I have no idea on what I want to do, sure, I have a lot of interests, but I can't see myself doing anything related to those interests (I have no idea why). There is absolutely nothing I've been passionate about for the last 5 years or so, and I haven't had any hobbies (besides playing games) for more than 5 years. I'm scared of going into a new school, since I'm scared of talking to people and I'm scared of what people are going to think of me (I've been bullied a lot in the past and I barely ever have had friends, hence my depression and social anxiety). I'm turning to this subreddit for help, so I can find a place where I'd be at least somewhat interested to go to. I have 2-3 months till I have to figure it out, but I'm absolutely terrified of even thinking about it and I don't want to become a disappointment to my parents (which I'm pretty sure I already am).

My life has been a huge pitfall.I was born a heavy and extremly good looking baby,growing up i have clear memmories of when i was young like age 5,that i would say things like my dream is too conquer the world and that i would basically have all my teachers literally have me as their favourite.I could easily understand them even as adults and if i wanted something i would be able to act in a way to get it,idk if that can also be called charisma tho.As kid i was fairly normal,but i felt that i was pretending maybe that i think about it now,i was an extremly charming kid,chubby,perfect feaures,hair and very tall and build for my age,i was easily the most likeable kid in my village and older people really enjoyed my company.

I really find it tought to analyze my thoughts entirarelly,i would actually treat people  kidnly,respectfully and i loved playing with dogs,i never cheated,i have an incerdible unexplained sense of moralle instilled in me,but inwardly it scares to think that maybe all of what i did was actually  being the best actor,so good i problably could fool myself anytime.I wouldnt and still im not able to understand myself,i had some talents if achievements get taken by age compparisson,but i never cared about developing any.In classses i never studied and in maths i always was one step ahead and new exacly what would i learn like an inward feeling,subconsiouly i remember once i tried to be able to solve 6-7th grade grade problem instanteniously,i have no idea how it happened,i have never even learn what is division but my mind just automatically figured it out,like inveting on spot.I also never lost an argument to my parents.(or anyone)

Anyways during that time my parents had lots of fights and broke up,i think that had an impact on me mentally,especially when i have to grow up wihout a father being around and messed up brother trying to beat me and who yells all the time.I developed a weird thinking patern and idea which idk how it came throught,it basically was that i will try and appear dumb and innocent,and act like that.I would also have a weird habbit of creating superstiotions randomly,like example,if i lets say walk out of my would by jumping a specific step,my day will go well,if i pass that obsactle course,my parents will be together,it was very weird.

Later on at around age 9-10 i would  get into fights and arguments,and get like extremly mad,i was a big kid for my age and i wouldnt even back down against kids 2-4 years older.I would always make my classmates laught and joke around all time,i loved videogames,and i loved hanigng out.At 13 i once again turned myself into videogames, but i stopped going out,i never studied srly even once,i only opened a book for half  to an hour and got like 18 or 19 in tests that require memmory knowledge,maths i just studied one or two hours for the whole year and got high grades without ever payiing attention.I would overthink about what others think of me,insanly,i was an extremly cute looking kid,and people always called me ""He is such a good kid"",l know tho that im not myself when i acted like that,i just wanted them to believe that and it happened,if i didnt want to be a good kid i could change it,i had the weird feeling that i could actually be whatever or whoever i wanted to be,is this an just acting talent,idk?I could easily read through every intention but i ignored it,if i wanted someone to believe im dumb they would,its just felt like everything was predictable and i kept practising dialogues and reactions naturally and subconsiousnly in my head to pass time often.

At 14 i suddently got incredibly good looking,yes this may sound narcissistic,but every single girl would look at me in my class like i was some other species,they would try touch me and kiss me in my birthday.I had 2 female teachers,both of them sat on my desk and looked at me,women just pick me up from the road randomly when i missed the bus,and the girl i loved,my crush,actually followed me around with a car whenever i went into my english class or home,i would also get an insane ammount of compliments from relatives or close people,and an insane ammount of smiles.I was a lonely kid but when my looks changed,my classmates would just come and pick me from my house and tell me to hang out,this happened for the first time.

You know,some would be so damn happy to have been blessed with height,looks,and have no trouble with school.But to me this was so different,it was like a huge pressure suddently appeared out of no were,huge expectations for my looks,i was put on the spotlight,it felt like my personallity didint matter anymore,and i turned to obssess over my changes looks so much even i would not believe it.I would start notice how much change can appearance make.As a result i developed this  messed up ideology about looks,once someone called my insecurity,being fat as a kid and stil lbeing a bit heavy,i started to go full anorexic.I messed my body to a degree were i lost all muscles,my skin completly dried up and looked like a skeleton literallyIhad lost over 30 kg in 6 months.I took medication,developed skin issues and other things that messed me up worse,i picked on my face often and ruined a good part of it, damaged my jaw.

The biggest impact was for my brain and body,from then on i just couldnt think anymore,i couldnt go out,i couldnt sleep,i couldnt enjoy anything,malnutrition might have been a big role.I couldnt even collect my thoughts and use my pencil to write words properly,sometimes i messed the letters.I'll have you know,for a person who is overthinkg and loves to think,someone who was that good looking that everyone complimented him and his parents even after seeing him,someone who grew up in this way, for all of this to happen and get wrecked in the age of 15,for all the pains on my body and bones,hair thinning,major skin issues and mental issues to appear so fast,its just too much,my mind basically became empty.Nothing would really stimulate me,i lost my videogame addiction,i would literally only think about my cool past since that day and how good my future would be if i dint mess up so badly.I wouldnt be able to focus properly on anything.

Im now 20,i have recently stopped my crazy eating habbits,but too much damage is likely already done.I cant think clearly anymore,i cant focus or really enjoy things or have passion.Im problably realising how i am right now,slightly autistc when i talk with others,im really unable to accept the way i look,and im scared of myself,i would honestly rather die than live a life of a complete failure and dissapointement,i still cant feel any empathy if a relative dies or someone else.Im so empty it scares me,i never had a relationship cause i dont consider myself worthy of one,i realised how messed up i likely am and dont dare too get my self in a relataionship,i just can realise how bad the way i act is,i realise everything,but i likely still punish myself by doing nothing,nothing at all,this is the worst punishement in my view.Having no interests,no love,no friends,and humiliating yourself in public situations,making everyone think adn believe im weird and avoid me,not keeping any contact with my old classmates or friendships,and ruining or ingoring every god given oppurtinity.I can say that i find no point in anything,and my thinking of me being a sociopath is because of a simple obvious reasion,i have extreme ambition,i want to be number 1 in this world but i know its literally impossible now,so i can ever find worth in anything,unless i am able to change this thought processs,but i really find it coming back to me,like an inward though that i know its wrong but hard to explell.I literally get goosbumbs whenever i say to myself""Okay,ill give it all,ill aim right for the top even if it kills me""My body the first time i had that thought was goospubmed for like 10-20 seconds straight multiple times,like an insane stimulation that gets my body and mind into anderaline mode just by having this thought geniunly,but i also have a logical side that tells me this is all complete bs,this way of thinking is so wrong and i really dont want to be this way,i want to just find joy in mediocrity and find a woman i can love and give my all in improving as a person.

I believe the only thing that can save me as a motive is compassion,like aim high and if i earn a lot of money ill make great charity doanations,all that just for myself tho,only to feel useful and not empty,not because i feel bad likely.But ill just be kidding myself,i have reached the point of not dispalying emotions of myself,i can cry from movies,i can cry from some situations,i cried when my parents broke up,i cried when i was lonely and now i cry nearly every day when ever i see how i look and how i changed,what a failure i am,i cant tell anymore im so confused,lonely ad likely depressed.Im so weird,and so mentally fatigued.Since the age of 15-16,every single day was been the same,I feel like i have no hope to enjoy a life  like this and its just gets worse every year,i would easily trade my whole life just to live 3-4 years of how i was prior to age 16.I dont expect anyone to understand this,maybe some think im overeggarating,but i know the thing that ruined my life and that is appearance,you cant imagine how much the world perspective and treatment to you can change along with your appearance,i have expierienced it first hand.Life shouldnt be so complicated,there are many variables in it,many completly uneccery for living hapilly,but unfortunatelly my brain just want to take account of as many variables,as many possibilties,as many harmful potential outcomes as possible into persective,and this just ends up making life complicated and thus difficult,and sometimes  even miserable.

What an insane ammount of text and mess of a post,i dont actually hope to have someone read on this,but i know that writing this and posting it for sometimes might work as coping method and realese some emotional stress.Anyways if you managed to read until here i dont even know what to say,wow.",19Dec2019,1

223,"I have a friend whom is going through arguably the roughest patch in her life, and they recently experienced an extremely stressful falling out with their family. She struggles with mental illness and is oftentimes unable to leave her house. She’s my best friend and I’m a huge part of her support system (some may say that I *am* her support system). 

As I understand it, she’s experienced traumatic events as a child within her family, including one where one of her parents forcibly removed her from the family and essentially fled away with her to escape some hardships and drugs. She grew up without half of her family and the parent she lived with was never a role model for her and subjected her to the poor choices of their romantic relationships (abusive step family). 

On the day she had the falling out with family, I was away on a date with a friend exploring a nearby (~1 hour drive, 2+ with traffic) metropolitan city. I have been courting this friend and it was a big step for me to even get that far. It was a lovely date and given that I haven’t been in a relationship in 10+ years, I got to feel emotions that I’ve been lacking in that length of time. 

On that day she contacted me and asked if I would be able to cut my date short and head back as soon as I possibly could, presumably to comfort her. I stepped away from my date and we talked on the phone for about a half hour and I tried to comfort her within the confines of my distance from her and the time away from my date. I was able to comfort her somewhat and suggested that she should go out and get some Christmas shopping done.

Not too long after that call ended, she pleaded with me once again to please head back because she couldn’t handle it alone. I told her that I’d head back as soon as I was done with the things we had planned for the day. We did not speak again until the evening once I got back to my city. I called her to notify her that I was on my way to her house to spend time with her but she said she wasn’t home and acted cold towards me.

Now that we’ve talked about that day, she feels like I abandoned her. She says that I made my choice and I chose my date-friend and not her. She doesn’t feel like she can talk to me about the things that she feels anymore and is actively trying to push me away. 

I’ll be the first to admit that yes, I choose the date over my best friend when it happened. I was having one of the best days in recent memory, and because I generally disregard my own feelings or comfort in favor of the feelings and comfort of others, I felt like I deserved to be happy once in a while. That opportunity just happened on the same day my best friend experienced one of the worst days of her life. 

I feel like shit because I don’t think that I abandoned her, but I can understand why she feels like I did. I feel like shit because I was made to choose between myself and my best friend and I chose myself. I feel like shit because relationships, like a lot of things in life, rely on timing. I felt that if I had cut the date short, the “spark” or “magic” we may have experienced on that day wouldn’t be able to be replicated on another occasion. I didn’t want to lose out on that spark, and I rationalized my decision on the fact that sometimes we can’t be there for the ones we love, despite the utmost desires of wishing that we could. 

In that sense, I did abandon her. I’ve spoken about this to another close friend and they say that it’s a shitty situation, but that I too deserve to be happy and that I can’t always be there for my best friend. 

It doesn’t help that now my best friend and I aren’t talking and there seems to be an impenetrable wall she’s placed between us. I think she’s trying to protect herself from another massive disappointment that may come from me. It’s too much of an obstacle to feel vulnerable to me I suppose.

I guess that I should also mention that I am currently single and have been for 10+ years. We get comments from many people saying that they thought we *were* a couple. The truth is that we’re not and that I choose to spend a lot of my time with her because she’s my closest friend. I always knew that when the day came where I would meet someone, that it may cause problems between my best friend and I, but I never anticipated it to be like this. 

At this point, I’m trying my best to not hurt her again and to try mending the bond we had. But again, I can’t get through to her. She feels that I’ve abandoned her in the same way her family has. I think that will be an extremely tough link to dissociate now, and I don’t know if the distance that she’s creating will harm our friendship to the point of becoming irreparable. 

Has anyone any advice for what we’re going though or perhaps see something that I can’t?

Thank you in advance.",19Dec2019,1

For example, having conversation that doesn't really have a goal. I don't really struggle if were talking about something and I have a goal (like ordering food, making specific plans, asking about something, talking about something specific) but if theres no real goal and were just ""hanging out"" or ""having fun"" I dont really know what to say. It seems weird just asking questions and answering questions in a setting of like 3-4 people. I feel like people around me just know how to kick back and just enjoy company when it makes me uncomfortable because I dont know what to do.

This also applies to humour. I hate humour beacause theres no real formula or logic to what makes people laugh and I want to become funnier and practice being funny because I like making people around me happy and being happy but it just comes off like I'm trying too hard when I try to be funny. For example I can practice listening to people and being empathetic which Ive done and its improved my relationships but humour makes me mad because I dont know how to practice it.

I dont really know what Im trying to acheive here with this little rant but Im bored and I want to know if anyone has any general advice for me

227,"I've cut out lots of details for your time and my anonymity.  

How do you professionally and successfully deal with someone from another company (small and close-knit) that you need something from (a very specific lease, in my case) and you've talked with them, they've agreed to it, saw that it benefits both myself and their company, etc etc....but they are the ""SO busy and SO stressed ALL THE TIME"" type of person that lets things stagnate until you basically have to beg to get things finished?  It's super unprofessional, but to keep things short (this post kept getting auto-deleted every time I tried to post it on the Work sub for some reason), going up the ladder is not an option that would help (decades-old nepotism in their favor) and finding a different place to lease what I need is pretty much impossible here. (I never stopped looking, but this isn't the simple solution here.)  I also know I'm not the only one going through this with this person, but the other folks gave up.

I've been patient, I originally contacted them many weeks ago.  Any advice on how to proceed?  Thanks Reddit strangers.",19Dec2019,1
228,"Background info,

I am a senior and I am about to graduate next semester

I have over 9 years' worth of experience (internships, part-time jobs, volunteer)  focus on my major.  I am currently taking 18 credits and next semester I'll be talking 17 plus a research grant project that I need to focus my attention on. 

I currently have 4 internships right now, all paid. I wanted to experience corporate, nonprofit,  and academia settings. This would of allow me to figure out what setting I wanted to work 

In October I got a job as an environmental management internship at a corporate which is a  fortune 100.  I thought it would be great however I realized I don't like the setting and task that entails. I guess my values don't a lineup. I know exactly what I want to do. ( Work with communities ordo  research on how to help them). I plan to apply for a Ph.D. for spring2021. 

The pay is well, however, is it worth my stressing 



How do I quit the corporate internship? It's been killing me on how to do it or what's the most professional way to do without burning any bridges.

231,"Only doing this on my main cause I don’t feel like making a throwaway, but to be honest who cares. 

Maybe I’m the problem? I guess? 
I remember times where me and my friends would talk about stuff and have fun. 
Nowadays things are different.. 
I feel pretty excluded from things. 
We have a group chat and 95% of the things I say get ignored. The 3% of conversation I am included in involves something I don’t care about, and I have to force myself into that conversation. The last 2% is anime.. they usually ask have I seen the episode or not and that’s that. 
I’ve been feeling depressed for about 2 years.. my mom is suffering with illness, and my brother is also suffering with illness.. and my father is busy trying to raise his daughter, and take care of his mom in her old age. I’ve said something to them where they completely ignored it (2 years ago), and I’ve cried so much it’s not even funny man. I’ve expressed that, and One Of them even heard me crying (which led to them making the group chat we’re in). Its honestly a lot that bothers me to the point where I’ve just recently had my first therapy appointment (woohoo). I just want to have a personal conversation with a person I’m not paying.. I could with my parents and my brother , but I don’t want them to worry, plus I’m not use to telling them anything, I figured friends would be the closest outlet, but I just don’t even see an opening to even have any conversation. I feel like a pest, I honestly don’t feel connected to them, and these are suppose to be my closest friends, I don’t have anything to talk to them about, I don’t have any mutual interest other than anime, and we don’t hang out. 
I seen one recently at McDonald’s where he works. I asked him if he needed a ride cause you know he didn’t have a car. He denied it.. I’ve known him for years, I’m not saying he used Uber, but he doesn’t have many resources of transportation. 
Often times I just want to ask did I do something? But should I have to ask my friends? I feel like all of this is apart of life (we’re all 22-23, me being the youngest), but I see other people actually having fun or at least appearing to have fun. 
Then I tell myself maybe I should just be a friend first and ask is anything wrong, but I can’t even get a conversation.. I honestly don’t know what to do. Should I just focus on spending more time by myself? Get new friends?",19Dec2019,1
232,"My girlfriend says not to worry and laughed it off but I'm freaking out about it.

I just started a new job the other week. My boss is a busy man in his 50's with a family but he is extremely tech savvy.

I have various emails logged into my Gmail, including my work email. I emailed him with the wrong one, an email I primarily use for spam as it's a very old email account. 

If you Google the name of the email account you'll find a thousand forum posts from when I was 19-21 (ten years ago) about anything and everything BUT the first ones that show up are the most controversial ones where I said something unpopular and argued a lot. 

Nothing illegal but I was kind of shitty back then. A lot of my opinions were also shitty and judgemental. I had a shitty childhood so I had a weird personality on the internet. 

Once I grew up I started being a lot more reasonable and started using a different alias(es). I tried to bury that one because you could doxx me through it but I can't log into those old forums anymore been if all the posts are indexed (they're closed to members but still up and indexed).

234,"First off, I appreciate anyone who took their time to read this, and I am extremely thankful for all the honest input and feedback, as I am in need of opinions from other perspectives.

I will start by giving off some background about our relationship. I just graduated from high school, and I've met her on my last senior year. We were actually from the same class, but we only started talking about 1 month before we end our high school life. Hence, our relationship is very fragile.

There are a few points in which I would appreciate feedback from others.

1. To start things off, we are both shy people. We only really had a handful of face-to-face conversations. After our high school, we spent the recent weeks communicating via text. I find us having quite comfortable conversations via messaging. However, I recently asked her out for lunch and hangout, and I can sense that our conversations do not flow as natural as how we text. Should I be concerned about this? Are we not compatible because I can sense an awkwardness between our conversations in person?
2. This is mostly on me and my insecurity. I will admit that I am a texter. However, she is not. Our conversations usually start with me initiating, sometimes it dies off quickly, sometimes we could chat for about an hour. She never texted me first, until I voiced my concerns to her and she admitted she does not like texting as much as I do, but she did promise to change her habit. From then, it changed from 99% of the time I initiate, to about an 80-20 ratio. Point is, did I do something I was not supposed to do? Was it a right thing to do to ask her to step up her texting game?
3. This continues from point 2, about my insecurity. Not only did she not initiate text conversations, but I feel that I am always the one carrying the weight and only the one showing affection. It takes 2 hands to clap, but I sometimes feel that I am just doing all of these by myself. I am in a struggle, as we only really started to 'date' for just about a month, and I know it is the right thing to give her space. However, am I right to be concerned that her affection level isn't as high as mine? And is there any way I can do to improve it?
4. When we met up recently, she occasionally brings up the fact that there is an awkwardness between us, and sometimes she asks if we were compatible in the first place. I know awkwardness is inevitable, but I felt the sense of insecurity when she keeps questioning our compatibility. I tried my best to show my truest self, since I do not buy in the 'show your best self during dates' thing. However, I just feel that there is awkwardness between us. Once again, was she right that we were not compatible, because of us finding it hard to make conversations flow naturally sometimes? If so, is there any way I can improve myself on?
5. Next, I also brought up about our relationship during the meet up. I was trying to see if we were on the same page. However, she said that we were rushing things a little, and that we were jumping into a relationship too fast without knowing each other well. In your opinion, am I pushing it too fast, and acting too eagerly? If so, how can I take things slowly? I am relatively new to the dating world, and the last thing I want is to screw things up.

I would also like to point out that we agreed to go on a second outing soon. However, should I voice my concerns to her during that outing? I feel that communication is really important for a relationship to work. And the last thing I want is assumptions. Though I am facing a dilemma as I feel that bringing this up on our second meet up feels a bit too soon and really shows that I am desperate and/or needy, which is the last thing I want to be.

I have so many more concerns about my current relationship, but these are the main 5 things I really wanted to know about your honest input. I am someone who likes criticisms, so please shoot them at me, harsh or not. I am in need of advice from experienced individuals to guide me through. I like her a lot, her truest self, her personality. I do not know how my future will change that, but I will leave that up for time to decide.

I hereby apologize if my use of grammar was inappropriate as English is not my first language. Once again, I sincerely thank those who took their time to read this post and for your honest and useful input.",19Dec2019,1
235,Okay so me and my girlfriend been together for 2 years and 5 months. I’m 17 and she’s also 17 and we’re both turning 18 in a couple of weeks.

So that’s what happen. So fast toward 11 months later we have a wonderful daughter but shit relationship. Literally I have no type of freedom. I stopped hanging with my friends and I can’t do anything in my house without her saying or telling me shit. Every time we argue I kid you not it’s the dumbest fucking reasons. So ya know I wanted to break up but I can’t leave my kid like that . Plus her dad doesn’t want her at his house and her other family members live somewhere else . Literally as we speak she got mad cuz I served my sister in law a plate of chips and she said she could’ve gotten it herself like what the fuck. I feed and clean my baby . I mostly wash the bottles.

I know I have to support my child no matter what. I’ll pay child support I don’t care but what can I do. Like I have no freedom at all . For example one time I went to the doctor and they said that I needed to lose a little bit of weight so I wanted to start on a diet and started to count my calories intake. She gets mad that I don’t eat what she eats. I take care to what ever place she wants to eat and when it’s time to order boom she wants me to cuz off my diet.

241,"Problem: How to get to know someone that I have a crush on, and not to look like a creep?!  


Backstory:  
There is this girl that was going to the same high school as me. When I was last year she was first. She has the most beautiful smile that I ever saw. I had very busy teenage years, especially late high school, I had to work (mine divorced when I was 15 -first yohs), help my family (we live on a countryside) study and practice for college internship exams. Because of all of those I never spoke to her.  


Present:  
SO now, I live at a steady pace, so to say. College is finished, jobs are coming and going, but the memory of her remains. One night I was at the celebration of my niece's birth. Got drunk pretty well. The next day I saw that she accepted my friend request - one that I don't have memory of sending. I don't know how to feel. How to act. She is more beautiful than before, smile prettier than before. I am aware that I have a crush on her. What most drives me crazy is that I don't know what kind of person she is. Her social media is almost without any info. I would love to get to know her but I don't know how to start a conversation.  


I had girlfriends before. I've been using dating apps and meeting girls at parties during college - but somehow this is different. Or am I seeing it as different?

My skin bleeds there and creates scars, and the area is always very sensitive and irritated.

As for more skin picking related issues (lol fun times), I always pick the pimples of my face. I am not one to have many pimples, but when I have a few, I will pick at those until they leave the area completely smooth. This makes it prone to bleeding and scarring and just horrible things for my face. I can’t bring myself to stop. It’s this compulsive need I’ve always had and I absolutely hate it. I regret these decisions almost immediately and still can’t stop.

251,"Hi, I'm a minor and I'm stuck in a tight situation.
Please let me explain.

I'm a young teen and I really need help. Let me explain what's been going on. I was at my sister's house and she was drunk with a friend. I don't like physical contact, my sister knows that. The two drunks kept touching me (not sexually) I got mad and the two threatened to beat me up for being a so called ""bitch"" I told my father and he came to pick me up (my mom and step dad were at their honeymoon) he then brought me to his friends house to go see the puppies since he wanted to cheer me up. My dad knows I've had suicidal thoughts so I guess that's why he wanted to get me distracted instead if putting the threats of getting into a rumble with my sister and her friend, into my book of reasons I shouldn't be here. After half a week or so I really loved this one dog and my uncle told me I could keep her because the owner who was going to buy it off of him would keep her outside, so I took the pup in wanting the best home for it. After taking it in and staying at my dad's with the pup for awhile I had to go to my sister's house again so my mom could pick me up. Before my mom came I texted her about the puppy and if I can't keep it there with her(which at the time I lived with her) then I'd be moving to dad's. She didn't reply, the next day she called in drunk and I told her on the phone about the dog but she ignored it. So the day comes and she's supposed to pick me up and doesn't want me to bring the dog, I don't go with her because I'm not going to abandon my new best friend. The next day my mom decided it's ok and I can keep the pooch. We go home and the pup likes it. Time skip to a few weeks in and my mom is constantly finding reasons on why I shouldn't keep her ""the other dogs are pregnant"" which no, they weren't ""she pees everywhere"" pee  I constantly cleaned up, plus the puppy was still learning potty training. ""She bites us"" she had no toys, my mom would not take me to go buy puppy supplies. After that I feed our other three dogs some treats and turns out my pup has interest in them too, I give her one and one of my mother's dog bites her in jealousy. The pup has a small scar but it'll heal. Now in my mom's eyes this was the perfect reason to get rid of her and so she tells me she's getting rid of my dog. I tell her constantly she's not getting rid of my dog and I'll move out if that means I'm keeping her. Next morning I'm ready for school and I'm downstairs petting my dog when my mom calls her upstairs. Now at the time i didn't think anything of it other then, maybe my mom finally accepted her and she's taking her to work with the rest of the dogs. I ask her where she's going and she says her new home. So I stand there and I hate myself so much for not doing anything. I just stood there as she took my dog away. Ever since that day I've felt nothing but like absolute crap and I honestly just want to give up now. Is there anything I can do to get my dog back? Just for some more information, no I did not agree to let her give my dog away and no she did not pay for it nor do anything but yell at it and nitpick every single con about my dog.",19Dec2019,1

253,"I have this friend who I dated for about a month (this was at the beginning of just having met her), which ended in a messy breakup. I felt really suffocated in the relationship and decided that what was best was for it to end. Around 3 months after our breakup, I decided to work on having a friendship with her again. We both had similar interests and our personalities worked well together, so I thought that perhaps we were meant to be just friends. Two years go by and we remain close friends until we both start flirting. We started just making out almost on the daily, but it wasn't until she decided that it would be appropriate to just start dating. We thought we both had matured and agreed to try again on being in a relationship with each other. I didn't think things would change between us by dating, so I asked her out. When she started saying ""I love you"" was when I noticed that she felt more than what I did for her. When we would make out, I would enjoy it, but wasn't emotionally attached. When we had sex for the first time, I enjoyed it but didn't feel attracted to her. Then I met a guy who made me feel everything she didn't. I felt like I was almost emotionally cheating so I decided to just end the relationship. After I decided to remain friends with her, and it was all going well until she would get mad or sad at me not texting her everyday. She would understand I was busy, but would still be moping around that I didn't talk to her or bother replying. I didn't make much of it until I had a family member pass away and I decided to take a break from social media. I didn't tell anyone about my family member's passing, but I assumed my friends would understand that I needed space. Everyone understood, except for her. After a week of not being on social media, I receive a text from her saying how I didn't deserve her etc. That's when I replied to her and told her what had happened. She apologized and wanted for things to go back to normal with us. I decided to just take time away from her and I've felt fine and perhaps slightly more free. She messaged me again saying she wants things to return back to normal, and how I was a big part of her life...I don't know what to do.

My girlfriend’s family was asked to dogwatch for a week by mom’s friend (T). She dropped off the dog and didn’t explain why or give a time and date when she’d be back for him. The dog was a cute silky Maltese named Rudy and he was such an angel but he definitely showed some signs of PTSD. 

After a week had passed, we tried asking when T would be back for her dog and she would not give an answer. After a month, mom started being more assertive and demanding to know when she will pick up the dog. Mom’s friend replied that the family can take better care of him and asked them to watch him for a while longer. 

5 months later, T texts mom saying she’ll be over soon to see Rudy. This was the first time she reached out or asked to see Rudy in the entire 5 months. She showed up at the house with her entire family, said nothing, held onto the dog the whole time while crying, and then just left. The next day she demands her dog back and so family gave him back, not wanting problems. Family had assumed after 2 months Rudy was theirs to keep and everyone became really attached to him.  We took really good care of him and we worry about his wellbeing with T.


Now that he’s gone, we’re absolutely pissed. T blocked everyone so we can’t contact her easily, but we can contact if we really try. Is it worth threatening legal action.

We have so much in common. From robotics, politics, sciences, etc. 

The thing is, I’ve always felt he was too good for me in so many ways. Smarter, more attractive, etc. How could he ever fall for me? And on top of that, he recently told someone at a Christmas party we were both at that he isn’t interested in anyone right now but he wants to be in a relationship again. 

Again- we are really close. Almost like best friends. Is it worth risking the loss of my friendship to tell him about my feelings and ask if he reciprocates them? I feel as though he has already indirectly said he was interested because of what he said at the Christmas party.

258,"Hey Guys,

I really need advice and this has been weighing on me for over a decade and I don’t know why. 

I’m 28 and female, I started playing soccer at 12 and played for 8 years for my first club. Worked my way up to captain of the first team and we won the title and cup many years in a row. So basically I was the captain of the best team of the top league in the state. The next level would have been professional (well semi pro as they only get $10-20k a year but I think that’s increased). 

I really enjoyed it at the start but the last couple years I was there I just really hated going to the trainings and games and would miss a lot of trainings. I loved the game and there was no issue there, and I loved playing with players who actually knew how to play. But a lot of new players came and I think maybe I just didn’t like the culture anymore? All my close friends on the team left also for other varied reasons. My mum was heavily involved in the club and she’d be around a lot and so I couldn’t really be myself, or at least it made me shrink into my shell as she is quite loud. I’m a pretty quiet person. But really I just can’t explain why I didn’t like it, I just had a horrible anxious feeling every time I had to go. I don’t know if it’s just me being anxious, or if the culture just sucks and I just don’t enjoy it. 

Anyway another coach tried to poach me and I ended up joining that team. They were a much worse team in the same league. But I guess I didn’t hate going to trainings quite as much. I did my acl and meniscus my first year which plagued me for years so I played only maybe 4 full seasons in the next 8 years. We got relegated in that time and the team became really shit as all the good players left. I did go back to my old club one year for just the pre season, but I had that same anxious, scared, not wanting to go feeling that I had when I first left, so I went back to the second club.  In this time many players from my first club and others all around me became semi professional, playing in the national comp. players who I rate myself as better than. I feel like if I had stayed I probably would have become semi pro. I feel like I wasted the last 8 years. They have won the league many times since I left and I’m feeling a bad case of FOMO. During this time I kept questioning if I should go back to the initial team, and I’m still questioning it. 

So now I need to choose a new club for this next season. I am sick of playing in a crap league and want to push myself again since I am 28 and only have a few good years left that I can play at the top level. I am deciding between my first club and a completely different new club that’s just started. But I just keep thinking I should go back to my old club but don’t know why. I have this feeling of guilt like I should play there because I have a lot of good memories there, but I’m not sure if I’ll enjoy it. Also I feel like I might feel awkward when I have to play against this club. I was captain there and feel and sense of pride that I helped that team become the best in the state, but also thinking that maybe I need to move on? I also feel guilty because my mum put a lot of effort into the club and helped make it what it is today. 

Does anyone have any advice? Should I go back to my first club? How do I stop questioning my decision if I play for the new club? How do I not feel guilt and regret every time I think of that club? What questions should I ask myself when making such a big decision? How can I figure out why I always hated going to trainings, but have FOMO when I’m not playing for them?

Also, bit of info, I play futsal and have friends there and enjoy going to that, it’s just something about that first club that I didn’t enjoy, but I wonder if I stick at it for a season or two and make a huge effort to make friends I might like it?

Anyway I hope that makes sense and that some one can help. I’ve discussed this in therapy and still can’t figure it out. I’ve even thought about moving cities so that going back to my old club will stop being an option and will stop being on my mind. 

Tldr:
Was the best of the best but didn’t enjoy it, wasted 8 years and have questioned my decision of leaving ever since. Why does it still plague my mind?",19Dec2019,1
259,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for a year now. We’re 20 and live together. Sometimes my thoughts wonder off randomly from the beginning of our relationship when he used to kind of “pick” on my body. I am petite, i have breasts but...unfortunately, not too blessed in the back. I have a small ass lol. I remember he said he thought I was “thicker” when we met in person. (we met through facebook) And he used to crack jokes on how small i am. I’ve struggled to gain weight for 2 years off supplements but i just wasn’t consistent enough. he has TRIED to set up a day to have sex with a girl one time in our relationship and when i found out, i seen her profile and she has an amazing coke shaped body and that made our relationship rocky as hell for a month. (He was forgiven it’s the past) And the girls he used to love on the internet has fat asses. He stopped when i told him how it made me feel... i even saved for surgery and looked into it for months now but he thinks surgery is so gross...Im assuming he just got over the fact im not his ideal woman that he’d lust for and stuck with me anyways. I know having a big butt is something EVERYONE has nowadays but I don’t know, I still randomly feel insecure when he tries to tease me and make me feel good by grabbing me.

260,"Hi all, 
I am 16 years old and I’m experiencing a lot of emotions and hormones I guess? I’m not like 100% sure of what gives someone baby fever but I’d definitely say I have it. 
I have an IUD right now, but have an appointment scheduled to get it taken out. 
A little bit of background, my boyfriend is completely on board with it at the moment, but we aren’t very financially stable. I work but he doesn’t have a job yet. (I work at a daycare so I have some experience with kids.)

My feelings about this are very intense, to the point where I have done pregnancy tests just to make sure because I don’t use protection and theres a 1% chance of pregnancy, but every time I test negative it’s actually devastating to me. 

Has anyone else felt a strong urge to be pregnant, but not at the right time due to finances or other matters?

262,"So basically we had a project for AP Gov where we had to make an “ornament” on a given topic. I knew I had to leave early for vacation, so I did the project early. However, I had to make up a whole bunch of tests and quizzes and other bigger projects ahead of time so I completely forgot to turn it in. Fast forward to today, I get an email telling me it’s a zero and I need to figure out how to fix it. I could eat the 0 and still pass because my grade in that class is decent, but I really don’t want to. Because it’s a physical project I can’t do it here without buying a bunch of supplies. Should I request an alternate assignment, take the zero, or turn in something I make here(which would piss my parents off). I’m not at home so I can’t take a picture of it either to turn in.

267,"Thanks for any advice in advance.

Sorry for long post .

Some background:

My mom has always dislike my grandma, dads mom( her mother in law). She experienced some verbal abuse from her early in their marriage and never had a good relationship with her.

My grandmas name was Eloise. Eloise is not here with us anymore and passed in 2015. She was a good grandma but definitely I could tell she was controlling and overbearing.

Fast forward to last week when my wife and I welcomed our very first child to this world. The days prior to the birth we released the baby’s name as we kept it close to the best on a Christmas tree with a new letter each day and photos sent to family in text...finally revealing the name Elise as our soon to be newborn daughter name.

We don’t hear from my mom after we release the name. She sent one text congratulating after name was revealed.

All is happy in the world until I find out the day of the birth of our baby that my mom was very upset that we would name our baby a name so similar to my grandmas and not even considered her. I heard this from my dad as they got to the hospital and she uses the restroom. She was extremely
Pissed and had this look of pain on her face as if we did something HER! Without over elaborating here, she came into the room and was careless with the baby and only held her for a couple minutes and acted extremely displeased, closed off and got in her phone during this time. On her way out she tries to slam the door and I catch it and ask her what is really wrong and she explodes on me in the hallway and blamed me for naming her so close to someone she hates. Even though it’s not the same name.

I was at the point where I truly considered cutting both her and my dad off but my dad would be devastated. My wife , who had a good relationship with my mom prior, is very heartbroken and sad. I don’t know if she will ever let this go.

My dad has already coordinated a text exchange of apologies but in my opinion they were forced and half hearted. My mom never actually apologizes for anything and they visited once we got home and brought food and gifts but she treated the baby as if she was second class and instead paid way more attention to our dogs. She has asked very little questions about the baby. At the end of this visit they asked if we would still do Christmas at their house, I reluctantly agreed.

I was completely caught off guard by all this and just wanted to get peoples advice on what they would do if this was your parent?",19Dec2019,1

272,"\[tw: mentions of rape\]

My relationship ended about a year and a half ago officially. But there was a period of time between November and March where he and I would hook up and whatnot. I stopped talking to him for good when he forced himself on me and basically raped me. So I tried to cut contact. He did reach out to me but I told him to leave me alone, he also started doing coke at the time so there's that. Anyway, I haven't talked to him since April but I still have PTSD from those last few interactions with him; it was all the parts that were toxic and I felt so unsafe every time he'd try and talk to me. 

I haven't told anyone what he did. Mostly because he and I share a few friends (we used to run in the same circles). I'm not sure how I'd be viewed, and how he'd be viewed and what would happen between the group dynamics. I also forgot to mention that during the time we were hooking up after our break up, and when he raped me, he already had a girlfriend (they are still together). 

So what I'm asking advice for is should I tell someone about how this is all affecting me or should I just try and deal with it on my own?",19Dec2019,1
273,"My grandma is living in a memory care facility. She's ailing physically, and mentally as well. She was so angry when we had to take her away from home to put her there, but we had no choice because she couldn't live alone anymore, it was too dangerous, and we couldn't afford a live-in aid. That was a couple of years ago and she has deteriorated a lot since then.

Almost every time we (me, my parents and my sister) visit her, she gets very upset. She's usually confused, often doesn't recognize me and my sister, and she gets angry with my dad (her son) because she recognizes him but knows he's the one who took her away from home.

She cries and quietly begs to go home. She always thinks she did something wrong and that she's there as a punishment. She'll ask about Mike, her other son, who died some twenty or so years ago, and we have to make up something about how he's just traveling. But she'll forget within a minute and ask again.

From what the staff tell us--who really are wonderful people, very kind and they take care of her--for the most part she's pretty happy. Confused, forgetful, yes, but seems okay. 

It's only when we show up that she seems to get upset. It's like the sight of us triggers some part of her memory and she immediately gets sad and angry.

I don't know what to do anymore. Truthfully I don't want to visit her anymore because it's never a happy occasion, and I feel awful for saying it. I keep trying to justify it by telling myself, well, she doesn't like seeing you either. But I feel like there's that obligation to visit your elderly, especially when they're ailing because they will die in the near future.

I don't know what to do. I just want her to be happy, but I don't know if ensuring that happiness means visiting her or just . . . leaving her be. I feel lost.",19Dec2019,1
274,"So i’m in my freshman year of highschool and i went into this school knowing absolutely nobody. There’s a few people i knew from elementary school but not from middle. A kid i knew from elementary school happened to notice me on the first day and we started talking and quickly we were friends. What i didn’t realize, is how much of a fucking asshole psycho this kid really was
(info on me because it’s important) I’m a white kid in a super urban and gang filled city, so i don’t have much to choose from for friends as i’m typically not accepted in general. 
Recently he’s become super aggressive towards me and it’s just getting worse and worse. Everyday he punches and stabs me, and it doesn’t have to even be with a pencil, anything sharp he can find will be stabbed into me. I cant really do much as he’s stronger than me and knows how to fight. I would go and just talk to a counselor about it or a teacher and see if they could separate my classes from his, but, the kid is a psycho. He’s always posting videos of him holding his gun and ammo on snapchat and is always talking about how “if anyone fucks with him they know what’s coming.” 
Another problem is that he’s on my bus, and a stop after me. He’s made a couple jokes before like “i can rob you. i know where you live” and even though i want to think he isn’t being serious, i really don’t doubt that he would do something like that.

Friend group 1: So me and my bff have been friends for pretty much forever. We always hang but she has a new boyfriend and we probably only hang 1-2 days a month and we have definitely drifted apart...we’re still friends but she doesn’t even ask me to hang anymore and our friendship is really going downhill and it’s both of our faults for not working on it I guess. I haven’t tried and she hasn’t put any effort into it either..   anyways we’re close with these two other girls and so these 3 friends are the group #1. they don’t like the girls in group #2

Group #2:  consists of 3 other girls I’m friends with but the girls in group 1 don’t like them. I’m a senior and probably won’t see much of anyone after this year so I mended all the friendships I had in group 2 and we have lots of fun when we’re together.  I want to hang with them more.

So the thing I have to decide is which group do I hang with this weekend? My bff hates the girls in group 2 and she will honestly be mad...she won’t be rude to me (hopefully)but I do know it will make her become more distant and I don’t want to lose our friendship since we’re not really best friends at this point I guess...just friends
I want to be friends with both groups but I’m risking more with going out with group 2.

I don’t want to have to worry about it but I am and I’m not going to cut anyone off so don’t mention it plz. Should I ask group 2 to hang and invite group 1 along?

277,"About 4 years ago around this time, I had just finished my college applications. It was a tough time. My parents were nearing a divorce after 2 years after my dad cheated on my mom. I dealt with the aftermath of that for most of my high school career to the point where I did very poorly academically with a rough home life.

Now, things are seeming the same way. My dad was unemployed for a whole year. Now, my mom’s job sucks. She works 16 hours every day now and all she does is complain and pop off at me because of it. This isn’t a second job or anything for her and she works for someone else. I had a rough semester this fall. I took 6 classes, which was more than I could handle and finished with 2 A- grades, 2 B’s, and 2 C’s. My overall GPA was a 3.6 and is now a 3.4. I’m studying computer science and I will graduate around this time next year. This entire semester, I have been battling an eye infection that hasn’t gone away. I am having surgery to fix it tomorrow. The better news is that since I took 6 classes this semester, I don’t have to take more than 4 per semester from now on.

I’ve worked as a substitute teacher for like the past 2 and a half years and the kids have gotten to me. I’m thinking of stopping. I didn’t work the job much this fall because I didn’t have the time. But for the few days I did, I’ve encountered just entirely rebellious students. Some of them just don’t even bother to listen to me. I guess it’s just because I’m young. I’ve been hoping to go to graduate school for an MS in computer science. I’m not really seeing myself as much of a desirable candidate. A lot of times now, I don’t even have a desire to compete. Most of the time when I think about this, I just don’t even want to be bothered. I just think of all the advantages that other students have, between parents who are already engineers and/or professors or just in general more successful families. I was hoping that working in education would have given me something favorable in graduate admissions, but I guess it won’t.

I haven’t bothered to apply to internships, mostly because I don’t even think I will get any return offers or follow ups. I don’t have any relationships with professors or any research research experience. I have applied to one professor’s research assistantship for next semester, but I haven’t heard back yet and I got an A- in his class this semester. Haven’t bothered to sign up for the GRE either, but I’m intent on taking it at the end of January and again in February.

Four years ago, everyone told me things get better eventually. Everything now to me when I see successful people is just to think that they have something that I don’t and that I never will be able to obtain. Every time I think of how undesirable I am, I find myself to be more fit for out-groups than fit for in-groups. I barely can even drag myself out of bed anymore. It takes like an hour on a good day. Then, even when I come home from work and school, I just go to bed so that I don't have to deal with things. I've made efforts to talk to old friends but they don't even reply to me. To be honest, I probably wouldn't want to talk to me anymore either.

I really think it is just my ability to focus. Back in summer, I took 4 classes, and I did amazing with 3 A's and 1 B+. I breezed through work and studied without a problem. But this semester, everything just seemed so out of reach and difficult to just concentrate on.

278,"Dear reddit users of r/Advice,
I am the youngest of four siblings and my brother thinks he can tell me what to do because he’s older, and therefore it seems he thinks he has the right to be a douche/be annoying. This has been going on for years, and I’m sick of it now. I used to rub it off as my brother just being that one sibling who likes to mess around with his younger sibling(s). But now I see it as him being patronizing, and being antagonistic, 

Examples of things he’ll do.

-come into my room and at 10:30 pm sometimes (I say sometimes because he does this a bunch but not every night) when I’m about to hit the hay, it takes me 20-35 minutes to get him out of my room because he thinks it’s funny until I punch him or accidentally hurt him in some way trying to get him out so I can sleep. (Btw this is extremely annoying because I have school in the morning and I like to sleep for eight hours so I’m not half asleep at school, and can focus. Also when he does this I’m so angry I can barely sleep)

-He constantly mocks and mimics me when I do things when no one is around. I hate this so much. But he thinks it’s funny, when I’m clearly annoyed or look like I’m about to punch him. 

-He doesn’t understand personal space. I don’t like being touched anywhere. I’m fine with things like hugs and high fives because I’m also engaging. It’s weird to explain, but in short I’m sensitive when touched. He thinks it’s funny to touch me when ever he gets the chance. One place I hate being touched are my thighs. I don’t know why, I just don’t like it. You can already tell just by reading this what he does. 

-When I walk past his room he’ll say he took something out of my room. I like to be very organized and everything in my room has a place/a purpose. I have boxes for everything, boxes are all labeled, just me being a clean freak. But obviously I don’t know what is in every box. So I get very angry when he does this, a lot of the time it would take me around 15 or more minutes to get the item back or less depending on if my dad/mom has had enough and tells him to give it back. He will but sometimes he’ll say “I didn’t take anything, she’s just over reacting”. So yeah that’s annoying.

-When I’m angry at him or we’re in a full blow verbal fight. He’ll say something like “oh you must be on your rug right now” or “are you on your period?”. Very insulting, and honestly makes me angrier, he also says this to my sister, but doesn’t do everything else I’ve mentioned to my sister. He’s the third child while my sister is the second. My oldest brother is out of the house so I think he doesn’t have anyone to direct whatever it is onto anyone, so he picks on me.

I don’t absolutely hate him, I love him a little, and I’d hate for anything to happen to him. But I refuse to put up with this any longer. I wanna cry, I hate this so much. Call me sensitive, I probably. Say it’s just a sibling thing, maybe. But this isn’t normal behavior. He swears at my parents, swears at me, calls me retarted, an idiot, any insult you can think of. 

So basically what I’m saying is. How do I have a better relationship with my brother, I want one, we NEED one, we have a very toxic relationship as a brother and sister. I’ve seen that since I’ve actually notice that this isn’t okay. I’ve bottled this up for years since I’ve noticed, and every time I tell my parents they don’t do anything, other than tell him to stop, which he doesn’t, and they don’t punish him at all. I thought I could handle this by myself by doing nice things for him, being nice to him, cracking jokes, doing things HE likes that I don’t particularly like or don’t want to do at the moment. 

So @ everyone with sibling or knows how to deal with one. How do I tell him in a gentle but strong way to ‘stop it please, what you’re doing is hurting me very much and it’s making me want to hit you with a crow bar’ without him going into full ape mode and us not having a screaming match.

280,"So I do hair and with it being the week before Christmas, you never know what mood of guest you’re going to get. It’s sad,  but true, that we encounter some of our biggest hard-to-love guests at this time of the year.   

TLDR: Today, I helped a busy stylist out by washing her guests hair, and the guest ended up hating me and complaining about me to my boss. After the guest complained, it felt like my boss and two other stylists were now mad at me over an accident that I didn’t intentionally make happen. So why do bosses/jobs/companies favor the side of the guest versus the side of their employees help? And how should I talk to my boss about how this has left me feeling?

Today, while washing a guests hair, I lost control of the water hose and sprayed myself, which then bounced off of me and onto my guests face, as well as on the guest behind me that was getting her hair washed. Now nobody in this situation was soaked besides me. The woman behind me was so zen she could care less, but my guess began complaining immediately that her face was soaking wet and ripped a towel out of my hands when I tried to dab the water off. Before leaving the shampoo chair, she eventually ripped her cutting cape off saying she was soaked all the way to her waist line, and when I looked at her shirt, she wasn’t soaked at all. Through all of this, I still have her a thorough wash and a deep scalp massage, only to have her leave our wash room and head straight to my manager where she yelled about me and how I did a terrible job and drenched her back. Since I was shampooing for another stylist, I didn’t have to encounter her again, but my boss and the stylist were left to diffuse the situation.
What sucked, was that after this woman treated me like I am a careless shampoo wench, my boss came to talk to me about the situation and as I always do, I began to stress cry in the middle of telling the story. My boss wasn’t really saying much to me and so I said, “I mean it would never be my intention to sabotage another stylists guest, you have to know that.” And then she responded with, “Well I wasn’t in the room, so I can only assume so.” Which to me, made me feel like she thought I wanted to ruin the guests day...which I did not! 

I just don’t understand why in service positions, jobs allow guests (the money coming in) to bring employees (the ones making the money) to tears, and would rather reprimand the employee instead of telling the guest that they don’t accept that kind of y’all towards their employees. I’ve worked in tons of restaurants as well and most of them run on the law of the guest is write and so the employee will get a write up. I want to say something to my boss but I don’t know what to say at this point because I feel like her and the other two stylists involved think I intentionally tried to screw everybody’s days up.",19Dec2019,1
281,"So for some background im 15m and I think I might have ADD or ADHD.  I decided to ask reddit because well I can't decide if I should even ask if I could see a psychiatrist. And I also have been smoking weed pretty regularly for these past couple months and don't know if thats affecting it. But I decided to take a test on some website and it said that I do have ADHD but I don't know if I actually do or my brain is just telling me that as an excuse for being bad at school. I used to excel in the very early years of school until like 5th or 6th grade. Lately Ive had no motivation I find the classes so boring and repetitive, and then on the side my mind is everywhere. I have a very bad memory and forgot to do things alot. I also daydream a ton. Again I don't know if its ADHD undiagnosed or the weed but I don't know what to do trying in school especially outside of it is hard. Hellpppp",19Dec2019,1
282,"I’d like to start off saying he’s been an extremely important part of my life in the past year since I met him. He’s been a large part of the reason I now dress the way I do and act the way I do. He’s raised my confidence immensely and I’m certain he doesn’t understand how grateful I am to him because of this. 

But recently, with the discovery that I had sex with a friend of ours, he’s begun to show interest in me. He started by telling me he wished I was 18 (he’s 22, I’m 17f) and then kissing me later in the night. Then talking to me about it how he was only down to fuck but only when I turn 18. He’s repeated “no strings attached?” Multiple times at this point. I’ve said yes multiple times. And yesterday I came over to his house just to hangout and I ended up on his lap and we made out for two hours. He called me cute a lot. 

The thing is, I’m not afraid to hook up with him, I’m afraid of the after. I don’t want to start liking him and that’s going to be really really hard because I think he’s a very sweet guy. A bit snarky and funny but sweet. He’s a good person and I know he’s just dtf and I don’t know if I should risk our friendship, no matter how good a kisser he is or how warm his hands feel on my back when he kisses me. I’m really confused because he keeps telling me I’m going to catch feelings for the guy I’ve been talking to but then turns around and wants to be fwb? He tells me not to catch feelings for him because I’m going to get hurt but also telling me I’m definitely going to??? I don’t know anymore",19Dec2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

Very recently, as in, less than a week ago, I drove down with my boyfriend to his hometown, where his mother, step father, and 3 brothers live. This is a very specific story, and the only reason I'm writing this is because 1. I know he doesn't use reddit, and 2. I am Kind of drunk right now.

My boyfriend and I live in a town temporarily because of college, but he recently graduated. Graduation and winter break is a cause for celebration... So we drive down to his home town which is about 9 hours away. At this time, I already knew about his mother's problem with alcohol; she is divorced to his step-dad, his step-dad is kind of a huge prick, and because of this stress, she turns to alcohol to deal with it. 

This woman is 5'1, skinny, and rich (because of her divorce). This woman doesn't work, and enjoys using her money to manipulate the people in her life.

My first time meeting her was at my boyfriend's graduation; however, I suffer from anxiety, and having this big of a moment, plus meeting his brothers, mother, and step father all ate once really overwhelmed me, so I did not get to talk to her as much as I wanted to.
In his hometown, I did get to talk to her. She is an alcoholic.
She spoke to my boyfriend in a way I didn't like; ""Drop me off now, I don't care, I have blank amount of money in my account, etc""
She ended up buying $1000 Valentino shoes.
I tried telling her this was too much and I could not accept it. She told me I was stupid and to go aaway,
My boyfriend ended up going to pick up her sons because she couldn't be bothered to leave, which meant I had to stay behind and look after her.
I told my boyfriend what happened in the two hours I was alone with her; She threw up in the middle of the bar, she almost fought with another mother (not relevant to the story), and she drank an entire bottle of processco, therefore, was blackout drunk for the entirety I was alone with her.
I told my boyfriend how uncomfortable I felt with her. The entire night consisted of me trying to convince her I didn't hate her, and my boyfriend backing me up.
She took an Uber to a restaurant later that night and my boyfriend and I had to pick her up. I waited in the car for a good 20 minutes before she came out. The minute she started talkning to me was the minute I began crying.
For the next hour, all I received was insults, saying how I was a two faced pig (she got this idea when I told my boyfriend I was unconfortable with her gift and drunken statements towards me and he relayed this fact), how my boyfriend will meet better and more beautiful women in a new state (since he graudtated and starting his career across the country and I am still in school), and I will become nothing else. This entire time, she gave out lies, saying that my boyfriend wanted to break up with me, how he called ME and alcoholic b*tch, etc etc. She told me she had texts to prove it, yet she never provided any of it. I finally stood up for myself, my boyfriend took a video of what she said, had to call the police to get her out of his car, and we had to drive through the night (below 10 degrees without a heaterr) to get back to our college.
She texted my boyfriend the next morning, saying she was sorry to HIM, and that she would send him some money. Yet, I never heard a single apology. I asked him if she apollogized and he said yes she did but in a call, not a text, so he couldn't show me any evidence. 
I don't belive him. Earlier today, I saw him browsing $34,000 rolex watches, which means that is his graduation gift, or that is an apology, both from his mother.
I will accept any apology I get from her, for the sake of my relationship with my boyfriend, but I qill not accept a second hand apology.
I am both anxious and resentful that he is even considereingsuch an expensive gift after %1000 valentino shoes ruined any chance of friendship or mother figureshioop I had with her.
She has not apologized to mee personally, or even over text. 
I will not accept any apology from her unless I know it's sincere.
His mother hates me.
How can I come back from this? We have been together for almost 2 years now, and meeting his mother, the most important figure in his life, went so downhill so fast. 
The way he's treating the situation, saying how it sucks becase me and hi sm mom don't get 
""along,""f but he will sitll take a car or a rolex or both as a grauasiton gift when this whoel thing started because i I couldn't take 1000 valentino shoes from her (we are returning the shoes, btw). 
I don't know if I should be mad at him???????
I guess, after all of this, my question of advice should be;
Should I forgive him mom (she was drunk and could not remember her actions the next mroning) if she ever apologized to me in person, either through a text or phone call,
and Am I overreacting getting upset that he already forgives her after the awful things she had said to me by looking at rolexes and brand new cars/?
FI I don't care how rich you are, you do not deserve treating people like they are below you.
I wihs to stay with my boyfirned as long as I can, while I finisih college, but I am ahaving serious doubts after this encounter.
Please help.
Thank you.",19Dec2019,1

285,"I was upset about something today and he asked whats wrong and obviously I didnt tell him, but he helped talk me down anyways. And he said do u feel better about ur stuff and I said thankyou yes. And he said thats what I'm here for. And then I went off my break and he just spoke to everyone else besides me even though he was looking at me or tried hard not to look at me. And when I was about to talk just randomly like we always do it felt like he was running away from the conversation. He was also glued to his phone all day and being so private about it. But he opened up to me about deaths and sad times he experienced. So what did I do wrong?",19Dec2019,1

287,"f= ""friend"" described above

context: I'm 16(F) and a junior in highschool. I became friends with f through my gf at the time. I gave him my snap thinking nothing of it because he knew I wasn't interested in guys. Anyway as I got to talking with him in and out of school I realized his ""humor"" was really dark. But, I still became one of his friends and that was natural since he was in the same friend group as me. Also I forgot to mention but f is like 4 times my size (height and weight).

Recently, f has started touching me even if I say no. f would stick his hand on my upper thigh. At first, I wouldn't say anything because i am extremely anxious and very introverted. But, once I started saying no he would just touch another area like my knee or arm. f would also grab ahold of my wrist very tightly and not let go even when I was saying stop and visibly trying to get away from him.

The worst is his threats, which I can't tell if they're a joke or not. Once, f claimed that, as a way of dropping out of school, 'he would bring his rifle, shoot up the place and then drop out.' He has also said ""if you dont (do xyz) then I'll just have to kiss you on the lips"". f gives off a lot of rape vibes and other students have even joked about it. Then most recently (the reason I'm writing this) is that when I ignored him while watching a movie in class he said, ""I guess I'll just have to bring my gun and shoot you"". I was already extremely uncomfortable around f at this point so this just put me into a full on anxiety attack. I dont know what to do. I know I should report it to the school but I'm scared that if they don't do anything to him, then he'll know it was me and do something life threatening. 

Any advice would be very appreciated, thank you.",19Dec2019,1
288,"Long story short, growing up I had few friends because I was just a weird big nerd that wore the same two outfits for years due to not having parents that helped me with things like personal hygiene and I learned as a teen. But I always had someone so it could be worse. Being the socially awkward kid this left me as a stuttering adult with no social skills and me being complete clean freak. This is clear in my personality and it tends to keep people away. I have a couple friends and am in a serious relationship so I can't complain much. 

The big problem for me is now I'm in the adult world and have my first job with a wide age range of adults. I had my teenage fast food job with people my age and hobbies so I had a very friendly relationship with my coworkers and it was amazing. At my new job I've been at for a few months I like the work a lot and I don't find a lot difficult besides trying to make my coworkers accept me. 

Some have been working together for close to a year to several years and they all act as if they're best friends. But as soon as I enter the break room its silent and people turn from me. I always greet everyone and am polite and make sure to show expression. I don't force conversation either but I make small talk when possible and I don't complain much. I know I just need time to be accepted but it's just hurtful when I'm telling a coworker that I really like it here or something work related and then they walk away while I'm still talking. Then those same people talk to each other about the same things all friendly. I also have lightly praised other coworkers and always say thank you plus I don't think I ask for help much. Management has also told me their happy with my numbers but I'm not far ahead of anyone else's.

My parents however, are sticklers for this religion and feel that it’s the only path and I feel very trapped.

290,"Ok, so, my ex doesn't have social media, but some of her friends do. I really missed her after the breakup so I looked at their social media accounts to see if they posted any pictures with her; I rarely found anything about her, but I guess even finding *something* made me want to keep looking. Problem is, it's been a few months since the breakup, and I still habitually look at the accounts every day even if I'm not looking specifically for information about my ex. I've never met any of the people whose accounts I'm looking at, but for some reason looking at them comforts me?? I don't really have many friends so looking at the accounts makes me feel a connection, I guess. It's really weird. Anyway, do you think this could be holding me back from getting over my ex?

293,"I am a college student at Pitt (only saying this because I didn't feel like editing what I already wrote in my notes) who is attending a branch campus (Pitt-Johnstown) as an undeclared student.

So, you need to be at a branch campus for 2 years in order to transfer to another Pitt campus or main. Well, I've spent a term at Johnstown, and despise it here. It doesn't have the major that I want to pursue, and I just don't fit in with the general culture of the campus (lots of drinking. Johnstown is in the middle of nowhere, essentially). However, I'd need to spend 3 more terms here with a 3.0 to be eligible for transfer to Oakland, which is the main campus where I can pursue my major in Music Performance.

It's been hard because my older brother refused to help her and my older sister housed her for a year but made her do everything and then she moved out of state.

Helped her with hospital stays, got her to quit smoking, got her to begrudgingly do physical therapy, made sure she was eating and eating well, the works!

She was a fantastic play with at least 8 champion characters at anytime (she would delete them and recreate them and go through the gambit of lvl grinding. She knew about the respec option but that's no fun).  Her friend suggested that my oldest play her account and her games (as well as myself) but I dont know if that would be respectful to her memory.  What if I fuck up a mission or accidentally delete something I wouldn't have known was something she promised to another player or was in game dear to her?

Fake name for boyfriend : Ethan 

I met Ethan at a graduation party. We hit it off and all. We started snapping a lot. To be honest : I was lonely. I had another really bad relationship end before that. I’m gonna flat out say it: I have problems falling too easy, and letting go of people. 

Ethan and me started snapping/texting. I tried to ideologically think of him constantly. I put all my energy in him, because I needed someone. So me and Ethan started hanging out I was his first for everything: relationship, etc. 

Ethan and me hung out at night a lot even when we started dating. He would never take me out. He put a lot less effort in. I sacrificed a lot to be with him. Hence my brother graduated at the same time as him and I just finished sophomore year. (2yr age difference) I missed hangouts w friends, I sacrificed everything. When he went to college, sacrificed school which I’m serious about, again hangouts with my friends. Drove an hour and a half to see him with my gas money. He came back sometimes but I always put more effort in. 

He cheated on me, before I had a competition in the morning that he knew about. I drove to talk to him about the breakup. I ask “did u want to kiss her” he goes “yes”. He didn’t even talk to me much he tried to hookup with me (this was at 1am) I had to wake up at 7am to go to this competition and I hadn’t even memeorized yet. He knew all of this. And still did that shit. (By the way out of the luck of the universe I got an award for that competition. Idk how. I memeorized during the car ride) 

So I kept talking to him. and yes I know. I deeply know “WHY TF R U TALKING TO HIM??” “JUST CUT IT OFF” that’s all I’ve heard. I wish I could stick to not talking to him. But I fail. I’m a fucking hypocrite. I still talk to him. I still hangout with him. He doesn’t even care if I’m in his life anymore or not. He doesn’t make the effort. He’s here for break. And yet I still can’t fucking stop seeing him. (I’m sorry for the aggressive swearing honestly I’m confused with myself on why I talk to him) 

What do I do. I want him to fucking feel sorry for what he’s done. I want him to realise I treated him so much better than he treated me but he doesn’t get it. I genuinely gave him the world. Comforted him. For him to disrespect me. For him to treat me like a god damn object. I bet he thinks it’s a chore to hangout with me. And yet I let him take over my mind because I don’t even have the respect for myself to fucking cut him out. 

I don’t have a family in the way that I can talk about love and that. My family is just very not into the emotions and just tell me to move on. Which I wish I could do but idk how. Because every time I try I go back. And My friends advice is not helping. 

What do I say. What do I do moving forward ? How do I start doing things for myself? How do I leave him feeling bad about the way I was treated? How do I let go ??",19Dec2019,1

299,"I have a family member through marriage who treated me terribly through narcissistic behavior for years in the past and has never apologized for it. They ruined my self esteem and in many ways told me how I was useless and could never do or be anything. Now they act like none of that happened and they want to help me on my job search ever since I did what they told me I couldn’t do and earned a degree. They’ve been reaching out to me lately and giving unsolicited advice after learning that I had a discussion with the person who has made us related, which was expected considering they always insert themselves into conversations and want to control things that have nothing to do with them. I already am not interested in LinkedIn so I don’t put effort in to it but they went and found my profile anyway, and that’s specifically what they are focusing on and want to talk about.

If I told them how I felt and brought up the past they’d be shocked and it would affect my other family relationships. I already try to keep them at a distance as much as possible but I can’t completely remove them from my life.

300,"For context, I'm a 23 year old girl. I have struggled with my mental health since as long as I can remember. Over the top panic attacks if I felt in danger, I could not be consoled at all. Things like shots, dental work and being in front of groups would cause absolute breakdowns. And I often had moods where I just had to hide in my room alone or I couldn't stop quietly crying, but sometimes I would still cry when I was alone. I don't think I knew until way later that this isn't how people are supposed to feel and reached out for help. As I got older I got better at controlling myself when faced with scary things but I still can't help crying everyday.


I've had highs and lows, and right now I'm in a really bad low. I always have the urge to hide in my room and I'm crying multiple times a day. This is likely externally caused by my job right now. I work at an animal shelter and we are extremely understaffed. Basically, we have morning shifts at 6:30am and night shifts at 5pm and four buildings to cover, we have 5 people working there. We are all working everyday or 6 days a week and it is hard work. My hours doubled over night because one person got fired for always being 40 minutes to an hour late all the time and someone else quit because she was a great, smart worker but was being pushed out because she was promised a position that someone else was.


When I came on, I was filling a part time position and it was decided I would work 20 hours a week. My last job wouldn't let me go part time because of corporate rules and I was just physically unable to handle the job and I had to deal with some people I really didn't want to be around. Another big factor is that we have three dogs and my partner works full time. 


Now I'm stuck in another 40 hour a week job that is twice as difficult as the last one. The best way I can describe it is that I'm falling apart. My mental health has gone down the toilet, I'm crying because I'm so tired. I'm crying and having panic attacks because I know I'll have to work the next day, I dread it now, I just need to sleep, but I can't sleep because I'm dreading work. If I quit then all the other workers are going to be absolutely crushed, or possibly mad and I won't be able to show my face there again, I just know it. And I can't predict how my boss will react. She has a full time job and being a shelter director is a volunteer position for her, so she basically works two full time jobs. Unlike other bosses, she really does bust her ass all day, this woman never sleeps but she keeps on trucking everyday. She makes me feel so weak and pathetic just by being her, but she's incredibly nice, to most people, at least to me so far.


I did enjoy the job, and I have been working with the dogs on some of their behavior problems so that they'll be easier to handle on a day to day basis and so that they are more adoptable. They keep dogs long term because many of these buddies have problems that most people couldn't handle, I'm talking years. I really love these dogs, I spend a lot of time thinking of them and I think of them as my own. Of course my guys at home come first but I really want the best for all the dogs. 


Everyone, my partner, my family, is alright with me not working full time or working at all because of my health, I could even go to college if I wanted, which I'm tempted to do soon. So I really don't need this job but I think suddenly quitting would burn the bridges I've made here and I wouldn't be able to continue helping the dogs. That is something I'm considering more and more but every time I think of the dogs I start crying. I don't know what to do, I hate making people upset, but I feel so terrified all the time, it's like a constant panic attack, I'm getting so tired.",19Dec2019,1

302,"I've been trying to get ahold of Uber for over 2 months. I had a promo code I entered and my friend who referred me said it's about $20 value. I entered it and it said $2 off first 3 rides. On the app and the invites page it clearly says first ride free and also for the person referring you. 
On the app though it says you'll get $5 for referaly. That's a big misleading but at least it says it. 
As for the $2 off I appreciate it but I've emailed them and also again recently providing screenshots that says first ride free etc and even on their own policy. 
I didn't ask for anything but I at least though they could follow up after. I emailed again saying I haven't heard back again for a while. I don't really care for a credit and it was more so that I emailed because my friend wants something out of it who referred me. I did it though to at least give them info they have contradicting stuff with the promo codes. Anyways I still appreciate the $2 off that I used. I haven't to used Uber since. My driver deserved 3 stars but I gave him 5 regardless. 

I'm wondering if I should hold a grudge against them for not responding to me least after I sent them all the info and screenshots and a follow up msg as well. I'm wondering if I should just leave it or just delete the account and app altogether or what?

I (26/F) have a friend, Mary, (27/F) of like 6 years or so. It's been a questionable friendship the entire time but especially the last few years. I really felt things start going downhill this past Summer, Fall, to the present. I want to note that Mary has been dating a drug addict and he's kind of taken over her life, her emotional and mental state, consuming her energy that she would otherwise spend on herself and with friends. She cheated on her boyfriend earlier in the year - screwed some guy overseas and never told the boyfriend. Told me it wasn't a big deal because boyfriend let her down all the time. Boyfriend ended up finding out, tried to blame me for the cheating as a bad influence on her (???), and current state they are still together today. Fast forward to the fall, my very close, life-long friend Joe (who I have known since childhood and introduced to Mary) and I got into a quarrel where, long story short, Joe was upset that I don't have feelings for him, that a romantic relationship will never develop between us. Joe and I took a break with our friendship, I confided in Mary about it, and Mary advised him and I should not contact each other. Mary ended up throwing a bunch of get togethers over the fall, inviting both me and Joe to them. I awkwardly turned down each invitation because I felt uncomfortable with Joe being there. Mary sent me photos of her at an event where Joe was, and a bunch of other mutual friends in our group, and never invited me. Told me how much fun it was. Mary did other things like inviting me to an event where I couldn't make it because it was my Father's birthday, and telling me that they made a big plate of food for so and so because they couldn't make it (but not doing the same for me, which made me feel excluded). I told Mary that my grandma died this Fall at 100 years old, and all she said was ""Damn that sucks."" I told Mary that I was dealing with a lot of  health issues this Fall (auto immunity and neuralgia problems), and she completely disregarded me reaching out about it and just said ""at least you have a diagnosis."" It got to a certain point where I felt so brushed off and felt like she only reaches out when she needs me to somehow do something for her, like fill a space at a potluck, or fill her time when her boyfriend is too high to function. So, I did something kind of immature and I blocked her on Facebook (I don't have any other social media). About a month went by and everything otherwise was fine. I was taking the passive approach at fading the friendship - every time Mary would contact me to get together (which was maybe a small handful of times, not often), I would just politely say thanks but I unfortunately can't, and let it go. I know that's passive but I was afraid if I tell her what I feel, she will get really upset/defensive/lash out/essentially manipulate everything onto me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I guess a friend was talking to Mary about my work I posted to Facebook and Mary realized that I'd blocked her. She texted me asking if I blocked her. I didn't see the point in lying so I said yes, I did, but it's because I've been hurt and need some space. She kept pestering me for reasoning via text, and I told her I didn't want to get into it right now because of miscommunication via text messaging. She told me that communication is the only way to solve problems, that we can't grow unless we talk about things, but she ended up saying she doesn't want to meet in person to talk because she's just going to listen to me call her a bad friend. Long story short, I ended up telling her via text message the things that were bothering me, and she completely deflected absolutely EVERY single thing I brought up and said I was manipulative and trying to blame her. She said she never excluded me, that she doesn't exclude people. That her other friends aren't as nit-picky as I am about her communication style. That it seems I don't like her as a person. That I am a bully (because I said she's acting manipulative, controlling and self centered). She couldn't understand WHY I felt excluded, despite me trying desperately with my entirety to make her see my perspective. She said she's never had a friendship like this before (obviously meant it in a negative way). And the part that kills me, out of everything, is that she said I'm ""assuming"" that I was excluded from events, but that it's not her fault I feel excluded. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this is the right word but I feel kind of gaslighted. She told me communication is the only way to work through problems, and then when I tell her how I'm feeling (and I was trying really hard to be polite and not use accusatory sentence structure, more statements like ""i felt this way when \_\_\_\_ happened"") she completely shuts down, puts a wall up, deflects everything onto me, and tells me how other people don't nit pick her. If I had a friend who was having a problem, and I HAVE had friends approach me with problems, I would 1000% tell them that I want to sit down and work through it together and figure out exactly where the miscommunication is because I value their friendship, and I would even apologize for them feeling bad because it's not my intention. No where did Mary EVER say anything like that. I feel like my heart is aching because this person, who I had considered my friend for years prior, truly will not listen to me. She truly does not think she did anything wrong. She thinks I am the one with the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you do if you were me? Try to work at this friendship (of like 6 years or so)? Or move on? What steps would you take? I'm so afraid of actually losing another friend because it makes me feel like a failure, like there is something wrong with me that this friendship didn't work out, but I truly WANT this friendship to work out, but I really don't think it will because every time (even in the past) when I try to express my feelings to Mary, she refuses to look at herself and basically will get like super logical/emotionless and start justifying all her actions.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Having MAJOR communication problems with adult female friend of 6 years, ultimately leading to the friendship  failing. Told friend that I am upset about some things, she told me we should talk about those things but refused to meet in person. Via text message, I expressed my sentiments and she deflected them all, refused to take any blame and told me I am manipulative.",19Dec2019,1
305,"My friend’s boyfriend hit on me, tried to make out with me and groped me a few days ago and I haven’t told her. My first thought after it all happened (and I sobered up) was that I needed to tell her ASAP so she doesn’t waste one more minute on this piece of shit guy, but then I calmed down, thought about it more and decided not to. 

The reason why I don’t want to tell her is because she will pick this guy over me. Something like this situation, not as bad, had happened before and she took the guys side immediately and we weren’t friends for months. Also, she’s the type who doesn’t ever like being single and especially since now it’s the holiday season, the odds are not in my favor. 

I really don’t want to lose her as a friend, and I know I may lose her anyway when this inevitably comes out, but what else can I do? What would you do?",19Dec2019,1
306,"Hi. I’m in a huge predicament currently. You see almost three months ago my girlfriend and I started dating. It’s been so amazing and I really like her. About a month into our relationship I meet some more of her friends and start to hang out with them more. It was nice as my bff had started making more friends so I felt like I had a good couple of friends. But there was this bad feeling I got from one of her friends, let’s call him B. There was just something off about him and I couldn’t shake it. My gut kept telling me he was bad, but I’m way too trusting of people so I didn’t say anything. B and I later bonded over our liking of anime, and we became acquainted. On Halloween, my girlfriend and her friends decided to head to a pizza place by our school and I invited my bff. It was really nice to have all of my friends together at a table eating and sharing our love of Halloween. Over the next couple of days B and I became friends and I gave him my bffs number because he asked for it. He later told me that he had a crush on her and wanted my permission to date her and also said if I wasn’t okay with it he wouldn’t pursue her and that he’s a man of his word. (which is weird cuz I’m not her mom) I said sure because I knew that she was feeling kinda lonely because she wanted to be in a relationship and I thought this would be perfect. My friends, girlfriend and bff all together having fun without it being awkward, and maybe we could go on double dates to the fair or something.
But I learned later on about how we was a serial monogamist (meaning he jumps from relationship to relationship) and I no longer felt like them dating was a good idea. It was also weird because he would ask me very personal questions about my bff and how he was planning on doing something extremely romantic for her birthday. (which is in March) I felt EXTREMELY uncomfortable as he was using me to get close to her. My girlfriend also told me about how a year ago he had a crush on HER and he kept trying to make her date him even though he knew she’s not interested in men. I told him that I wasn’t comfortable anymore with the idea of them dating and he started to play the victim and he said to me “oh so this is how I’ll be perceived by everyone then, the guy who jumps from woman to woman. Well what about my feelings?” I knew he was being abusive so I called him out telling him he needed to stop because what he was doing was abusive behavior. He finally agreed to stop his advances towards my bff. But this wasn’t the end. Later he asked her if she liked him and then said that he liked her. I told her everything trying to warn her that dating him was probably a bad idea, but I can’t control her. They became close. B then did something so harsh that it threw me over the edge. He told my girlfriend that she wasn’t an innocent person and she wanted to cut. He almost drove her to self harm.
Two nights ago my girlfriend had a nightmare about him and I learned that not only was he mentally abusing towards my gf, but also was sometimes physically abusive. She was scared he was going to hurt her or one of our friends or me. I’m scared too, but I feel like he has control over the whole situation. I’ve warned my best friend multiple times but she caught feelings towards him and she won’t stop talking to him. All of her friends don’t know what he’s done and they think the two should date. Every time we’re together all she does is text him and it gives me a sick feeling in my stomach. I’m so terrified because I have no clue what he’s capable of.

308,"Okay, so, my therapist appointment isn't for another two weeks, so I don't wanna wait to talk about this and vent, and I just want this problem solved. There are some things my mom doesn't really get about me (why I do things a certain way, or how I like certain things done), and it annoys me when she not only decides how I do it doesn't look right, (which I refer to the times it doesn't matter), but also, she tends to tell me things like putting the blinds up for our cats (they're literally not in the room), or saying a cat is at the door (if they scratch at my door, THEN I know they want in. Otherwise they walk right back out). What happened today irritated me. She came into my room and told me tomorrow (December 18th, this happened on the 17th, yesterday), I was watching a Christmas movie with her. I was fine with that. Then she said something along the lines of, ""Because I said so.""

313,Last year I went through a lot of mental problems and I'm pretty sure I was delusional but that's a story for another post. This led to one thing and another and I got expelled from school. This was is 6th grade. In 6th grade I also came out of the closet as lesbian and started dating my best friend. She wasn't good for me tho not in a abusive way but in a way of she encouraged my problems and was just as delusional as me and was the reason I was so bad. I loved her so much despite this unhealthy relationship but then I got expelled. This actually helped pull me into reality tho. I realized my problems and that she wasn't helping and I was honestly really glad that she wasn't allowed to text me anymore (reasons). I go to a new school now and its amazing compared to the shithole school I was at before. My new schools in the middle of a rich neighborhood so its really nice and the people there are waaaayyyy better. I'm completely different now and I've been so happy with my new gf and I don't have many friends but I would rather have no friends than leave this school. So everything's been amazing up until a couple of weeks ago. My ex contacted me on my school iPad and apparently me cutting off all contact with her wasn't enough. She thinks we're still together and I don't know how to tell her I've moved on. I still want to be her friend and help her leave her delusions behind but I'm worried that after I tell her she'll hate me. I have a big issue where I'm scared to tell someone something important cause they'll be mad at me or be heartbroken or I'll lose their trust. Honestly it's hard for me to stand up for myself or be honest with someone cause I don't want to hurt them despite being hurt myself. How do I tell her I've moved on?,19Dec2019,1
314,"I don’t know if I’m paranoid or not but I feel as if my husband cousin’s wife is trying to be me and replace me.

Lets call her Lisa 

After I got pregnant, Lisa who has always been against getting married got pregnant 3 month after me. She and my husband cousin then rushed to get married. Lisa has a very outgoing personality and knows how to talk. Meanwhile I’m the complete opposite and socially awkward but make up for it with my looks (I can confidently say this)

My parents in law and sister in law decided that since we are both pregnant, they would do all they can to help us and have the babies be safe and healthy. Not complaining here but then things started getting weird. She would blatantly ignore me when it’s just us two, but when with people, she would put me down and say things like “I don’t think she likes that but I would” “Don’t stand close to her, she’s might throw up on you, she almost did to me” “She wore that shirt yesterday too, she didn’t bother can you believe that”
I don’t know how nobody is noticing but me. 

Lisa said since my family in law promised to help her, she needed to live with me so she can get as much help as possible since her own house is far away. Somehow whatever they buy me, she must also get the same. My parents in law brought me a Louis Vuitton bag for my birthday, and she started throwing a tantrum about how her parents in law hates her and this and that until my husband said that when her birthday comes, he promised to buy her a Chanel bag.   Like I said, she knows how to talk and make people give in to her. 

She also wanted my husband to lend her his bmw since she was getting a driver license but when he refused, she went to my parents in law and they forced him to give her the keys. 

Fast forward and our babies are currently now 6 months and 3 months. She still lives in our house and is making no move to leave. Her husband works out of state and comes back a few days a month. 

All her baby supplies are paid for by my sister in law and my parents in law. Meanwhile I pay for my baby supplies through my savings in the bank. My husband is currently job hunting and I don’t want to bother my sister in law or parents in law when they are already forking out so much money for my husband cousin’s wife. 

Deep down, I feel so much hate it’s about to burst. I want this woman to move out of my house with her baby and stop  bothering my family. But then my thoughts turn to if she doesn’t exist, would my in laws be as helpful to me then they are with her. I’m socially awkward so do I deserve to receive love compared to Lisa who is fun to be around. When I think that, I get depressed and go back to standing in the corner with my son and watch how she receives all the love and help that might have been for me.",19Dec2019,1
315,"So this kid is basically super insecure, but not like omg what do people think of my clothes today, he hides it, he’s one of those people who subtly tries to ask for compliments. He uses any excuse to share things that make him come off as unique. Whats particularly annoying is his music, he considers himself a musician, and he wants everyone to know, I’ve studied music for a while now and for context I’m better at it. Whats annoying is that he’s “composing” a piano piece right now and he will randomly get out his laptop and at full volume will begin to play this piece. It’s quite an annoying piece but that isn’t the point, I just want to yell at him that nobody cares about his damn interests, but I try to keep a quiet and calm composure at school. My school is filled with these people, I know most people think their school is filled with people like this but my school is genuinely just people like this.

316,"My girlfriend and I are both 18. We go to different colleges but they are not too far apart so we see each other often. The last time I visited her at college, we ran into some guy. From the way he interacted with my girlfriend, I could tell that they were somewhat close. What bothers me was the fact that the guy was clearly surprise that my girlfriend had a boyfriend until I introduced myself. It just seems weird that my girlfriend has known this guy for a few months and is good friends with him yet she never told him that he has a boyfriend. 

My girlfriend has many guy friends but the way she acted with this guy was just different. She usually tells me about her friends at college but she has never mentioned this guy even though they are supposedly close friends. Now that I know this person exists, I notice that my girlfriend texts him pretty late at night. It’s mostly about harmless school stuff so I don’t think i should worry too much about this. Lastly, a few weeks ago my girlfriend was telling me about how chains look really attractive on guys and how I should start wearing them. Well when I met this guy I noticed that he was wearing chains. Again, I really don’t think this means anything but still thought I should mention it. 

Like I mentioned previously, my girlfriend has many guy friends which I have no problem with. I have never felt uncomfortable about any of her friends until I met this guy.

318,"My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly 3 years. We are very much in love and want to get married. The problem, which has been our problem from the beginning, is his parents. My boyfriend comes from an Arab-Muslim family. He was born and raised here in America. I am not Muslim nor Arab, but rather I am white and raised Christian (Lutheran). His parents live on the other side of the country... thankfully for us they do not live in the same state as us. His mom found out about us after we had been dating about a month and she completely flipped out. Essentially, she said she’d disown him if it continued. However, we stuck together and remained a couple despite their disapproval. His mom never disowned him and it seemed as though, over the course of 2 1/2 years, things were simmering down and getting better. We decided to fly out and finally get his parents and I together. When my boyfriend broke the news, his mom absolutely flipped (not surprisingly). She said she wanted no part of it and would absolutely not agree to meeting us. Despite her response, we decided to make the journey anyways to give it a try. My boyfriend texted his dad to give him the time and location of where we would be meeting the day before we arrived. Sadly, the next day as we sat at the restaurant, the clock continued to click and his parents never showed up. My boyfriend extended meeting the next day for lunch, but again he never heard a response. So, now I feel as though I’m in a pickle. I absolutely hate their reaction to all of this, but what I hate the most is what it has done to my boyfriend. I know in the end, he will have to “choose” between me and his parents... a decision no one should ever have to make. Am I selfish for staying? Am I selfish for making him “choose”? But, how long can I wait for him to make up his mind on how to move forward. He continues to say that he “will keep trying” with them, but it seems clear that this will take years if it will ever come around...

319,"I’m 18 and currently attending university so I am not living at home currently but I am still feeling very affected by my dad and his increasing dependence on substances and alcohol.

He and my mom separated in October of 2018 largely due to the fact that my mom was extremely unhappy due to my father’s substance abuse and felt like no matter what she did, he would not listen and get help. She has told me stories of trying to lift him off the couch when he was strung out and barely conscious  on weed, benadryl, and alcohol trying to take him to a detox centre. He would refuse and say he was fine. That happened frequently for almost their entire marriage of 12 years. 

I have 4 younger siblings as young as 4 years old and my dad gets custody of them every other weekend. This past weekend while he had them the power went out at his house in the next town over at around 11pm. My mom tried calling him repeatedly to make sure the kids were okay and he would not pick up. Eventually my 12 year old brother picked up the phone and said “dad is blacked out in the other room right now and won’t wake up so i’m taking care of four-year-old.” I was sitting there listening to this conversation and I got so incredibly angry. My mom of course picked up the kids and she literally walked into the unlocked house, took the kids, tried to wake up dad up (&amp;failed), and left the house. He had no idea she took the kids. That could’ve been anyone!!

I was so unbelievably angry at him that I messaged him the next day and said “I do not want to argue or hear excuses, I just want to say that you need help.” He ignored me and ignored my email today of a school paper he asked to read a few weeks ago. This is not the first time I have expressed this to him so I’m confused as to why he is ignoring me now.

I have a little cousin who is 13 years old let's call her Diana who is overly affectionate. Whenever she is around me she is constantly touching me, kissing me, hugging me, patting me, holding my hand, and overall just being a clingy little girl. I absolutely hate it but I have never brought it up for fear of upsetting/offending her. Okay now for the meat of the story.

Today Taylor and i  went for a coffee where  we started talking about my baby shower, which took place last Sunday. He started telling me how Daisy was all over him throughout the whole party. He told me he felt extremely uncomfortable as she was constantly touching him and getting uncomfortably close to him. He didn't say anything to her as he didn't want to seem like a dick or create issues. I am deeply troubled by this as I thought she was only this way with family.

323,"So I met this girl on bumble, we went out on a date 3 months ago and have been talking and going out since...  


Things were going well aside from a few bumps here and there but we always sat down and talked about them.  


last night we were talking and I was driving home, so I told her to wait till I got home and that I'd message her.  


When I did, she sent me a screen shot of when I sent her the message and of when I was last active asking how come if I said I was driving I was active 5 minutes after saying that.  


Thing is I left the conversation open (instagram) and while driving I just hit the lock button so I could turn on the screen and read her message on the lockscreen.  


She didn't believe me, so I sent her a screenshot of my instagram DMs showing I haven't been speaking to anyone else aside from her so it wouldn't make sense me opening the chat either way. (My other convos were days old)  


After I did that she completely went cold and just ended the conversation, I tried to ask her to tell me what happened and why she went like that but she refused to talk. Blocking me from seeing her active on instagram.

&amp;#x200B;

Later this afternoon she unblocked me from seeing her activity, I asked how her gran was and she just replied saying her gran was ok.   


I left the convo there but she asked me how I was and I said not to worry and asked if she was good and she did.  


Her answers were extremely serious though, as if we had just started talking and didn't know each other, she made some more random small talk then cut it off and said she was going to sleep.

I've been up all night cuz I had the same kinda treatment from my ex and I'm still dealing with the effects it had on me so I can't sleep.

Sent her some memes and a message saying I hope she had a good day, she replied ""thanks, you too"".

She can’t even ask me a question because it’s all about her now and I can’t act happy and fake a smile anymore and i honestly do feel bad about acting that way.

His opinion is right, everyone else is stupid and wrong, done.

He tells annoying jokes that don’t make sense where he proceeds to laugh Immensely at.

I’m leading towards that, ayy, fuck off, and leave my friends to decide what an ego maniac he really is.

The problem is I like everyone else in the friend group, but they 100% are on his side.

I want to stay with everyone, but I’m considering  just leaving everyone the friend group, I might be better off on my own.

It’s close to Christmas’s, I’ve been looking for this for a long time. My plan is to maybe call off the friendship then, because I don’t want to ruin Christmas’s morning over this.

332,"I've been posting here a lot but here's my 98th problem. I honestly don't stand up for myself at all and my main issue with this is I have a really abusive friend that I've known for 3 years and she makes me feel like shit but I can't get the nerve to tell her. Shes been like this since 5th grade. Here are some incidents that stick out in my memory to give you an idea of what shes like. 5th grade she would ""playfully"" slap me and I hated it but I could never work up the courage to tell her. One day she slapped me and I snapped and slapped her back. Apparently it was to hard cause when recess  came she convinced everyone (even people who weren't in our class) to flip me off. I ran inside crying and she literally just laughed. She also my fun of me on the bus because her mom had told her that I'm autistic and she only stopped when she realized I was crying. In 6th grade I went to a different school and I came to over to yet another sleepover and I got angry at her and she tried ""cheer me up"" by holding her bird over my head and telling it to shit on me. I slapped her hand away and her bird flew away and it wasn't even hurt but she body slammed me on the wooden part of her bed because ""it could of gotten hurt"". This led to me calling my mom at midnight to come pick me up. She talked me out of leaving and I just spent the rest of the night in silence. In 6th grade I got expelled and realized how abusive she was but then I went to her school. It was only for 2 weeks before summer ended and my fear and rage disappeared because of how charismatic she is. She literally hugged me when she saw me and I thought that maybe she was a better person now. I was wrong. I spent the last day of school on the verge of tears cause we had to do stuff around the school with friends and Lizzie ditched me and she was my only friend. Now in 7th grade shes still really abusive and the worst incident ever happened a few weeks ago. She was bullying me in science class (she sits next to me) and I had enough. I grabbed my sharpener, went to the bathroom and broke it open and cut myself with the blade. I hadn't cut in such a long time and she caused me to start again. I was deepening the cuts in class when she saw and told a teacher and told my mom too. I was pulled out of class and my mom took me home and told me about the text. For once I thought that maybe deep down in her tiny cold blackened heart she cared a little. Emphasis on the ""I thought"". The next week she avoided me, declined when my counselor said she needs to talk to me and in science we had a table project and none of them talked to me at all until they came to a gross part and she asked if I wanted to do it. Then she started talking to me like nothing happened and I told me that her mom had been verbally abusing her, telling her to kill herself and all that. This made feel awful for her and awful for thinking she was a bad friend and I even feel guilty typing this. I really feel like she's the victim whenever shes around but then I take a step back and realize shes a horrible person. Me and my mom think she has narrsisistic disorder and I think shes a sociopath. She honestly is so mean and then she acts like we're great friends to make me forget my hatred. Oh and did I mention how she constantly makes fun of my gf who I love with my heart and soul and wouldn't change for the world? She does that too. What should I do?",19Dec2019,1

334,"This has been an ongoing issue for a few months now. To keep it short, here are the facts:

- I live in a house of four (all 21M), three of us are sick of coming home to the smell of weed.
- Our lease specifies that we cannot smoke anything inside the house
- We live in a state where recreational marijuana is not only illegal but also pretty harshly looked down upon
- Our home is in a school zone
- We are college students living in a town that looks down upon college students - the cops look for reasons to knock on doors of colleges houses

The three of us have told our fourth roommate to stop and he hasn’t. We’ve even tried scheduling meetings to sit down in a formal setting and he’s rejected our approach. This led to one of the three of us sitting with him in a one on one to explain where all of us were coming from - he said he understood and he would stop but he continued smoking inside the house anyways. I have no problem with smoking pot, but given the cirumstances of where we live I’m worried we might face eviction or legal repercussions and my two other roommates share these sentiments - it just seems that our fourth is not understanding us.

340,"I was looking at this old, painting, of a naked woman. Her body looks exactly like mine.
I don't have individuality, I'm hidden behind the male fantasy that is my body. My body is an object of sexual desire. Men look at it and imagine that they use it, they project their little fantasy on it. I'm attached to this body, I can't get away from it. This make me want to mutilate what makes it attractive. I want to slice the sexual curves and make it straight. I'm walking around with a bait. 
I tried to look in the mirror and see my body as part of me, my body is supposed to be more than a sexual object. But for men it will never change. I don't hate my body, I hate how it is seen. Male gaze. I might be dead my naked, dead, body would still be sexual. I might be a robot and that would be the same. I could be replaced with something identical. My body isn't valuable. It's just piled up sexual body parts.
When I was a child I didn't have this. I was someone, my body was just one of a child, I didn't know I would become a sexual monster. And when it happened, I had to change the way I moved, so that it won't be too sexual. I learned that my body was now sexual, and that men would want it. I learned that my body has become a sexual object, just like the pornographic images, that was just pictures of bodies that were now identical to mine. To make myself valuable, I would have to show my personality, so that men look past my body. This is horrible. Please, get me out of this nightmare that is my body.

341,"At the place I [M36] work, we have been in discussion about choosing a new CRM software, it had come down to a choice between two different software packages, I will just call them Software A and Software B. After a meeting where my boss had explained the pros and cons of each and had stated he intended to make his decision by the end of the day, my coworker [M40 something], who I will call X, randomly offered to bet me $15 that my boss would choose Software A. I accepted the bet, as I believed the boss would choose software B.
At the end of the day, the boss announced he was going with Software B, I attempted to collect my $15 from my coworker, but he said he didn’t have it on him and would bring it the next day. The next day when I asked him for the money, he laughed and said he had never put it in writing. I asked him if he was welching on the bet and he confirmed he was. I was really shocked and appalled, as I was raised to be a good person with good morals who keeps their word.
I decided my boss should know and I explained everything to him, he became angry at me, saying I should be doing my job instead of gambling at work, he yelled at me and told me to get back to work. I then wrote an email outlining everything about how me and X had made a bet for $15 and when I won, X had openly and shamelessly welched on the bet. I sent this email to everybody else in the entire office as well as several clients that X deals with directly, as I figured it was important to let them know what an untrustworthy lowlife he was. After I did this X became furious at me, as did my boss, who then told me he was getting HR involved.
When I met with HR and explained everything, they were rude and hostile and gave me a strongly worded warning not to engage in my “unacceptable behavior” ever again.
I was furious about suffering such a massive injustice and decided if couldn’t get justice at work, I would  get it out of work.
So I printed a bunch of large posters with X’s face on them (I took the image from his facebooK) and simply put the words “Warning, this man is a liar, lowlife, untrustworthy. I then stuck the posters all over the neighborhood that our office is located in one weekend. On Monday, when he had seen the posters X wanted to fight me physically, but our boss intervened and reported X to HR, as I denied responsibility for the posters and there was no proof I had done it.

Almost a year and a half in college I realized that I don’t want to do this, I forced my self to continue just to not let my parents down but my grades weren’t becoming better. Im scared to tell my parents that I don’t want to pursue this degree and let my full scholarship go to a waste as my government probably won’t give me another scholarship to continue my higher educations.       

Long story short,I was always a video game lover and the industry of e-sports interests me so I thought why not research if I can get a degree in this industry and I have found a couple of schools outside the US and found e-sports managment degrees and have been seriously considering this big switch but I am scared from the reactions and if anyone is going to back me up in my decision. I already thought of selling my car and work just to be able to pay for my own education. 

I have talked to an uncle who had a similar experience and we decided to meet up soon and just talk about his experience and learn from what he has to tell me because heck he went through a lot just for him to be where he is rn.

Then proceeding to say he “gave the account to one of his friends” needless to say we all fell for it. Well David used this account to make his character grow close to me. I still had no ides it was him. This went on for awhile until i trusted the character enough to let out a secret. Even making me admit some Sexual things. Not long after Lily sent me a screen shot of David admitting it was a character needless to say i was pissed. That situation blew over. Well not long after David admitted he had feelings for me and we exchanged in short relationships (Dumb idea on my part i know) well it lead to a point where he sent me nudes. (Keep in mind he is 19 and I’m 14) I wasn’t sure how to react so i went along and let him send nudes well i couldn’t handle it and i broke up with him. Ever sense i started to notice how creepy he really is. He’s constantly telling some of the younger members that they are adorable and using little symbols like “UwU” and just childish stuff in general. Me Lilly and Aaron all took notice. Ive known Aaron the longest so where pretty close. He’s pretty much the only one who never doubts me. Lily isn’t sure how to react but she aware that things are getting weird. And Aaron is worried that things could get bad. It got to the point where i tried talking to Julian about banning him. I told him about evrything including the nudes and he dosnt believe me.

Doesn’t show all that much interest in me but i have a MASSIVE FUCKING CRUSH, and he’s the only person i would want to do things with. Am i rushing into this and should i wait for the right person?



Hi, i’m 17F and still a massive fucking virgin. 

i’ve only ever properly kissed 2 boys, first being when i was 16 and the second one allot more recently, probably around 4 months ago now. 

I met the most recent boy, we’ll call him James, on this app which is basically tinder for kids. Usually i don’t meet up with strangers from apps like this but we had been talking for around a month when he randomly messaged me asking if i wanted to sneak out with him, bare in mind he lives around 1 hour from me, didn’t have his license nor his car at the time. Important to note i’m new to the area, i’ve never snuck out before and i’m generally quite a straight, well behaved girl. 

Long story short, he stole his moms car at 2am and picked me up, all while being drunk and high. We hung out for a couple of hours and at the end of the night he kissed me. Now being the absolute virgin i am, i develop a really bad crush on him, of course i don’t tell him this because of personal insecurities lmao and slowly he kind of breaks contact with me, messaging me only ever so often.

A couple months go by and he messages me,by this time i’m starting to finally get over him, telling me how he wants to run away to California and asks me to go with him. He knows i’m in a shitty situation at home and with school but not shitty enough to ruin the rest of my life and go to California. I manage to talk him out of it and during talking him out of it he starts being extremely sweet, telling me how much he wants to be with me and hold me (gay shit i know). We start speaking more often after this but it’s never been as sweet as it was that night. But unfortunately again he starts to break contact with me, only occasionally messaging me about random shit, sometimes sending me dick pics but he’s a hormonal 16 year old boy.  For the longest time i thought i was asexual, and the thought of sex terrified me, but i feel as though i could do it with him, and i have no idea i only have these feelings with him. 

Now present day, i started speaking to a new boy, and we’ll call him Jesse, i thought i liked him at first but as soon as i got to know him allot more i realized that’s not the case, and my mind keeps trailing back to James. i posted something on my private story ( which i use as an outlet because i don’t want to burden my friends with my problems lol) about how getting to know someone ruins it for me and i create an image of people in my head and when they aren’t the same as the person in my head i lose interest. James popped up to this story and told me that we could arrange something, which after thinking a lot about i’d be down for. 

We started speaking last night, and i asked him why he didn’t like me back, spur of the moment type of thing i’m still not sure why i asked, and his response was that he does like me, but he’s too busy to speak to me, he works 30hrs a week, is failing all his classes and his parents are really strict because of his illegal habits. Now i know that that is the SHITTEST EXCUSE but i’m fucking dumb and still believe there is a chance something could happen between us.

We’ve arranged to meet on Friday, and i know he’s going to expect some sexual favors from me, and i want to do them ( whether it be the fact i too am a horny hormonal girl or i’m desperate for his approval i’m not sure) but i have a feeling i would regret it. 

Am i rushing into things? Should i wait for someone who actually shows interest and cares about me?

360,"I was talking to this dude a year or two ago about helping him with his small food truck business. We were potentially going to be partners. He had just obtained a big contract to supply products to a retailer. It was a large order, and he had no money to buy ingredients, so I loaned him a not small amount of money to fund this order. We had an informal understanding that once I did due diligence, we would convert the debt to equity in his company, but the contract itself was straight up written as a loan.

Turns out he's a terrible businessman and didn't make any money at all on the order. When it came time to collect, he claimed I never loaned him anything and it was an investment in his company but he no longer wants to give me shares so I'm shit out of luck. This is obviously a ridiculous argument from a legal standpoint, but I still had to waste money talking to my lawyer about it because you never know. 

Due to my own stupidity, I lost the original document, but did have scanned electronic copies. We went to court, and him and his girlfriend swore under oath that he never signed that, he only signed a letter of intent, and made the same argument in court that since he no longer wanted to issue shares, that money was lost. They committed perjury, a crime. Fortunately, I had enough texts and emails documenting my side so the judge didn’t buy it and I got a judgement. I asked about getting them charged with perjury, but apparently that’s very hard. There isn’t enough evidence that they knew what they were saying is false. 

After the judgment is issued, he folds up the corporation. Turns out he owes tax authorities money and that takes precedent over the corporation’s debt to me, so nothing is left for me. Shortly after, he reincorporates and essentially carries on the same business. Also, the food truck wasn’t technically owned by the corporation, but by his roommate who he’s been friends with since they were kids (this is total bullshit in practice, but they have the right papers). So, legally I am fucked. I could spend tens of thousands on lawyers to argue that the food truck is de facto a corporate asset, but that would cost more than the value of the food truck. I pretty much have no legal remedy here unless I want to spend a ton of money on lawyers. 

I’m good friends with a guy who is in his 40s and use to be involved in gang life when he was younger. He still believes in street justice though. He told me he would fuck up the guy’s propane lines and slash his tires on the weekend before a food truck event. Logically, I think this is straight up justice. He committed a crime (perjury), dealt with me in bad faith from the start, so he deserves it. He’ll probably know it was me but has no way to prove (same situation I’m in). I don’t see any logical reason why I shouldn’t do it. Yet, a voice in the back of my head tells me this is straight fucked up and wrong, and I feel that more strongly. I have no idea what I should do.

I should mention I’m not some rich guy pissed I had a negative ROI on an investment. I’m in my mid 20s, and he’s a couple years older. The loan I gave him was literally all of my life savings. I’m now in credit card debt. He’s poor too and I guess he screwed me over because he legit couldn’t afford to pay me.

362,"Okay so basically I’m gonna try and summarize it, my friend I don’t talk to/hang out anymore (he just hanged out with other people we never had beef) dated this girl in freshman year since he was the quarterback of the football team but in late 2019 I’ll say around late September/Early October they broke up due to him being overprotective and not letting her hangout/talk to other guys due to him being jealous. she keeps dropping hints that she likes me like for example today she told her friend “I only go to this class because DoggoPlant is cute” and the same day she told me “hey DoggoPlant you wanna play chicken?” (Chicken is basically where there are two people and they try and kiss each other and the first one to chicken out and not kiss the person loses) and also she keeps playing with my hair and keeps holding my hand when ever I’m trying to do work in class but sadly I don’t feel comfortable going out with her since she was the girlfriend of a old friend of mine and I just don’t feel comfortable going out with her because of that but I know she’s gonna ask me out due to her hints being super obvious since she said “I have this friend he’s really cute and quite in class I wanna ask him out but I’m scared it’s gonna ruin our friendship together” so I need advice on how to reject her without sounding like the bad guy and without sounding like a piece of shit to her since I like her as a friend (I would’ve gone out with her if she never dated my ex friend) and also she tried touching my dick with her arms and legs so many times during and after school.",19Dec2019,1
363,"It sounds pathetic written down but I’m jealous of my sister. It was hard for me to admit that to myself but I am. She is objectively attractive, attractive enough that random men ask her out on the streets. I am objectively average looking, but overweight. She’s thin. Growing up we’ve always been compared by our Korean family that way. I was seen as the overweight ugly one while my sister was the beautiful one. That obviously hurt my young self and that might be part of the reason why I hold a deep resentment for my sister. She’s hypocritical, greedy and selfish in all sense of the word but it’s gotten better over the years. I thankfully have talents, and have won over my family in that aspect and have gained their respect that way. Not the way I would have liked but it is what it is. I want advice for myself. How do I stop being jealous? I have good, deep friendships and people I can rely on. I have a career path figured out and overall I’m happy. But in moments where I find myself seeing my friends wanting to be friends with my sister I get extremely jealous, and I don’t know why. I obviously won’t display my feelings to my friends when they do but I hold a deep resentment towards my sister and the thought of my sister taking away something that I worked for so hard is angering. Deep down I’m aware my friends won’t obviously ditch me for her because we are very different personalities but when they’re curious I’m jealous. And I shouldn’t be. It’s annoying and it’s getting in the way of me being in a happy mood. Just seeing my friends with my sister turns me bitter from happy. What should I do?",19Dec2019,1

I can deal with the bullying thing, I don't care, but months ago he broke my phone, he shaked me in the break just to annoy me, unintentionally he hit my hand and my phone fell and broke.

Context: I had another phone, but got robbed, so my mom gave me this one my classmate broke.

I told him I knew it was an accident, and he told me he would pay for it, I said it was okay, but it was my mother's phone so if she wanted, I would ask him to pay. My mom of course got angry. When I told him the situation he said ""I'm empty"", a lie, of course, and now he doesn't want to pay, he avoids me every time I talk about it.

Tonight, he came home- drunk as usual- sat beside me, talked about the dog then started to cry (unprovoked) but turned away so I wouldn’t see his face.

379,"(Disclaimer: ☠ Long Venting ☠)

Lately, I've been experiencing an alltime low and I need somewhere to vent because my mind keeps drifting to the idea of suicide. I tend to beg others for help here on Reddit out of desperation, end up listening and feeling comforted, but then after some time has passed my depression comes back full force. My life is constantly full of ups and downs and recently, it's been one thing after another for me. Just when I start to feel comfortable and content with my life, it all comes crashing down in front of my eyes. I need to vent or I might do something I will regret. I sincerely apologize for wasting anyone's time from reading this pitiful post. I've never felt so awful about myself in such a long time...

For the past five years, I've been with someone who has made me feel like the most special person in the world. (For the most part.) He was always my shoulder to lean on and typically was the only person that I felt happy talking to .....because he understood me and accepted me for who I am, anxiety and all. However, throughout these years... he has done some extremely questionable things, such as talking to other girls inappropriately (Leaving messages on girl's profile like ""I love you"" and ""thanks for calling me past 3 am &lt;3"" but then insisting that he was doing it in order to make this girl's ex boyfriend jealous because their friends) and not bothering to mention me to other girls, that has severely damaged my trust in him. He had done these things to me in the past and he promised to me that he would never do anything to hurt me again. 

What else could I do, but to try and trust him? He is and always will be everything to me. So for the past year, I have been struggling to let him in or get close to him again out of fear of having my heart broken or discovering some secret conversations with other girls. Now skipping to present day, he hasn't been talking to me nearly as much as he used to because his phone was taken as a consequence. (Yes, he is an adult) This sudden lack of communication has forcefully given me time to reflect on my relationship. And to make matters worse, he is going to the military for 4 entire years VERY SOON. 

My two sides of me are torn and are constantly battling with each other 24/7: 
I love him so much and I couldn't bear to see him with another girl after everything I've been through 
V.S.
 I am so unhappy with the relationship as of now and to me, I feel as though my future with him will be grim because I will be alone for those years coming up. 

On top of that, I feel like I cant even fully trust him and I believe that we need a lot of time spent together to fully heal the relationship.... Time that he doesnt have for me. He has already made up his mind on the military and is telling me to make my decision whether to leave or not.  What I cant get him to understand is that I CANT decide. Its killing me on the inside. My mind is completely overwhelmed by the fact that he's going to be gone and during the time in my life where I need him more than ever. I have such strong feelings for him despite all the horrible, shitty things he has done me and I still even hope to marry him one day.

All that being said..... I have been heavily considering suicide through all of this. This constant internal struggle is damaging my mental state (which is added on top of my already extreme anxiety) and I feel like its time for me to call it quits with life. I dont know what to do... because I cant stand the thought of losing him and I love him with all my heart. I've been trying my hardest to be happy for him and all that's doing is making me more and more depressed..... Sometimes when I tell him what I'm going through, he will dismiss me as being repetitve and will tell me that he's sorry.... He has his career plan all set and I dont think that he will put that aside momentarily to fix things with me.... I feel so shitty and I think I'm an awful human being for thinking so selfishly.. All I ever wanted was to be loved whole-heartedly without having to worry about what he could be doing behind my back (especially in military). I hope that God makes the decision for me.... to either kill me before things get worse or allow for things to get better. I know that sounds so awful and selfish and I apologize for those who read through this all just to be bummed out by my own self-destructive thinking. 

Thank you for listening, Reddit...",19Dec2019,1

383,"My little brother is currently applying to colleges, but we don’t expect him to get into too many. Especially not good ones. His grades in HS are low (2.7 gpa) and so are his SAT scores (I think around 1100). We come from a community of really, really high achieving individuals, and I myself go to a top 5 US college. Since we’re siblings, people compare us a lot which I know doesn’t make him feel good. I try to always encourage him and tell him I’m proud of him, but I know how hard it can be. I myself was super stressed and depressed in high school, and tried to commit suicide twice. He does not know about the severity of my depression. 

I’m scared because I know his self-esteem is low, and it’s going to take a bigger hit once college letters are out. Some of his friends have already been celebrating Early Decision acceptance letters top tier schools, and I know it must sting. I want to protect his mental health and make sure that he doesn’t lose motivation to keep trying. Even if he doesn’t get into our state school, he can go to a community college and transfer or even take a gap year and reapply. It’s not the end of the world, but I know it can feel like it is. 

He has next to no discipline, which is the main reason (IMO) that he’s in this situation. His room is a mess, he can’t stick to any hobby because he gets bored, and loses points on STUPID things like forgetting to turn in completed homework. But sometimes he gets scared and DOES try. For example, I helped him study for 2-3 days for a biology test and really felt like he got it. He ended up getting a 50%. This kind of thing happens super super often, and it’s really heartbreaking to see him so dejected. The kid NEEDS a win.

He got diagnosed and is being treated for ADHD as of 1 year ago, which is helping a bit. But his math, reading, and writing skills just aren’t up to college standards. He has tremendous emotional intelligence, however, and is well loved. A happy-go-lucky boy, in general. 

I guess my question is: how do I protect his self-esteem while also getting him to get his shit together? I have so many self-esteem issues myself and I cannot bear to see him go down the same path. 

TL;DR: 17 year old little brother likely messed up his chances of getting into a good university, and doesn’t really have the skills to thrive there either. I’m his older sister with more academic success but a history of suicide and (still) self-esteem issues.

I have an emotional support animal, a cat, who lives with myself and my boyfriend in a one bedroom apartment in California. Today we received a notice that on Friday, December 20, a contractor will be coming in sometime (unspecified) between 9am and 6pm to measure our apartment for 30 minutes. They said that any pets must be out of the unit, in a crate (not in the bathroom as that needs to be measured) OR someone has to be home with them. This is mandatory.


We both work 9-6 and can't afford to take the whole day off. We can't humanely crate our cat for that whole period of time, as she is coming off of a UTI and needs to use the litterbox every couple of hours. We don't have a friend who can take her for the day on such short notice and can't afford to board her for the day--our emergency funds got drained earlier this month when she needed unexpected surgery--plus she's ill so all of our usual daycares would not take her anyways.

Hopefully the landlord will compromise with me but in the meantime I'd love some advice on how to handle this--I'm a wreck since she's sick and we're already low on funds this month, and I have no idea what to do.

398,"My mom hardly has any money to spend on herself. She works but her whole paycheck is given to my dad so that he can pay bills and rent. He doesn't give her any kind of allowance or gives her any of her left over money back. From what I understand, it sits in their bank account where my dad has almost full control over it. My mom resorts to using the many credit cards my dad has opened up for necessities and she has to borrow money from my siblings to do things for herself. Occasionally she borrows money from us  to pay her own credit card bills or to send to relatives over seas who are in struggling, because she knows if she asks my dad he'll ask a dozen questions  as to why she needs X amount. 

I was thinking of getting her a reloadable gift card for Christmas and reloading it every so often so she has at least Something. Then I started thinking about opening another account and letting her use those funds for herself. That way she is free to withdraw, deposit, and spend however she likes. I believe she has her own secret stash and every so often my siblings give her some money too but I will do most of the depositing into that account. No credit cards, seeing as my parents both have cards from many different places. 

So I need advice on what to do. If I get her a reloadable card she can still spend money whenever and on whatever but she wont be able to withdraw if she needs cash.

I have noticed noticed a significant decline in my overall mood. Although there are likely a multitude of other factors contributing to this, I’m certain my recent lack of exercise has been a major issue which I know I have to fix as soon as possible.  

Sorry for going a bit off track there, but basically I am wondering if my lack of body mass will prohibit the benefits that are generally stated when promoting a consistent gym habit. This is because the vast majority of people who want to start going to the gym are trying to lose weight, which is something that I definitely should not be doing. 

Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",19Dec2019,1

402,"Hello Reddit, this isy first post, and I really don't know how to go on about doing it, sorry in advance for the essay.
I'm 19(M) and I had a lower back injury with 4 herniated discs, I think they were S15(?), L1,2, and 3, I didn't know where else I could ask except a doctor, but my family is in a really shitty financial situation, and my surgery cost my family's Medicare I suspect, so we can't really ask my doctor directly without some fee popping up.
Anyways, I'm not too sure if I should keep going with my career of choice, which is being a mechanic at a dealership, working on the newest cars and whatnot, I completed a semester of normal Auto tech classes, and next semester I'm taking core classes that are a prerequisite to get into a GM program that has me working at an actual dealership, or shadow at least, for half a semester, and they'll be paying me like 9/hr. However, I feel like my hernias might come back because I get this strange numb pain that felt just like when the pain started waaayy before the surgery, if I stand for too long my legs feel numb-ish, but goes away after about a 20 minute walk, I'm fine for 5-ish minutes, then only the numbing feeling and a poke of pain remains, and I'm afraid I might not recover in time for the semester in August when the normal labor-filled classes start for me again, I'm afraid that my fafsa will get revoked if I stop now, I got into college a month after my surgery because I wanted to waste as least time as possible so I can get things I want to do in order, the college is fully paid for and I'm getting help from another program for extra financial help to hopefully get better tools and start working to save up for a car, because the buses that the college has alternating between the 3 different campuses (they're about a 20 minute drive between the core, nursing, and tech campus, yes it's divided) are super hard on my back, and I feel like the buses are the reason for my numb/pain feeling returning.
I really want to do this mechanic thing, and I'm fully prepared to study and learn so I can get all my certificates done and hopefully open up my own mechanic shop in my mid 30s, but I just have all these anxiety inducing worries that I won't be able to do it, first and foremost, I want my back to get better asap so I can really start getting my life in order, but I have no way of doing that as a 19 year old male college student with no way of transportation, my mother is a single mom and has the only car, I don't have my license or a car, so that was the plan for this semester, to get my core classes out of the way and get me my license and my car, but now I fear my back will get in the way, I do know how to drive, but after making you read this ridiculously long essay, what would you do if you were in my spot? Any advice?",19Dec2019,1

405,"I need some insight from a neutral third party. Tonight after xmas party some girl walks up near me at a bar down the street from my place, and starts calling my name from like 10 feet away. Thought she was looking for someone else. After the third time I turn around and give the ""hey, whats up?"". She looks vaguely familiar, I ask how she knew me.

From XXX neighborhood bar she says. I'm like okay, I go there on fridays sometimes maybe I know you, hows it going? That's when the conversation goes sideways.

She says ""you kicked my friend Z out of XXX neighborhood bar and were pushing her and yelling at her, shes inside (we were out smoking) and thought it was you here tonight. I was in country Y when it happened and she was so upset she called me to talk about it"". As you can imagine, I'm like wtf. I said ""well that sounds terrifying, when was this? I have no memory of this, and it doesn't sound like me"". Said it was a few weeks ago, and I've only been to XXX bar maybe twice in the last month. We exchange some words that basically amounted to ""that sounds messed up but I don't recall any of this"". She cuts the conversation off after a minute or two and just says ""I didn't think you would remember but I knew it"" as she walks away (implying it was me). She sounded kinda mad about the thing but not super pissed, and was fine explaining the situation when I asked for details. I was and still am confused, so I promptly left. It sounded like her friend was afraid to confront me so I sure as hell wasn't going to go in there and do it. Maybe she was expecting an apology but I wasn't going to give one for something I'm fairly sure didn't happen.

So about XXX neighborhood bar, I get blasted at this bar sometimes and occasionally don't remember all the details. Especially the people I meet since I'm bad with names anyways.  But I've historically been a friendly drunk with no history of going off on people. I've helped kick people out on occasion but only crazy homeless people that come in to bother customers for drinks/money.

This kind of accusation is a nightmare scenario for me, I've always tried my best to steer away from shitshow situations. I'm pretty damn confused as to 

1) Why she walked up to me and told me this

2) Why she gave me so many details, like her and friends name, where we met, and what she was doing in another country if she thought I was a psycho

3) What the hell I should do now, if anything.",19Dec2019,1
406,"look im not going to take forever explaining every little detail of what happened but if you'd like, i can but right now im just going to give you the gist of it. Im 15 and i suffer from chronic depression and anxiety, i end up sick a lot due to a weak-ish immune system, recently ive been sick a lot and have been in and out of school, more out than in. i recently had to deal with my gf (14) attempting suicide twice within a week. i was already a mental wreck before hand but now i feel completely dead inside and out. that isnt the point of the story so ill move on from it. For the last week or so, ive been getting about 5-6 hours of sleep a night, it doesnt sound too bad and it wasnt. Last night however i got maybe 1.5 hours of sleep, so i asked my parents if i could stay home at least for a while so i could sleep. i got yelled at at belittled for about 10 mins, and then ultimately told that because i was starting to cry and shake, that because i wasnt being told i was right, or that i wasnt getting what i wanted i was going to throw a fit. a. fit. they like to treat me like im 7 trying to get a lolipop, if you cant tell already. so i snapped and yelled at them that i wasnt throwing a fit i was just asking for a bit of time to catch up on sleep, i got told, and i kid you not, that the reason im tired is because i sit up all night playing games and watching tv/youtube. I then informed my dad that i had stared blankly at the ceiling for four hours before even looking at my phone. he, of course,  said to ""Stare longer"". i ended up just laying down on the couch showing little to no interest in what they were saying before, ""You not being well rested, your girlfriend attempting suicide again, and the fact youve been out of school, is, all, your, fault. if you stopped looking at those electronics all night, you would be well rested, if you actually went to school, your grades would be up, and YOU chose to date her"" what kind of father tells you something fucked up like that, and has the decency to say i love you. but im wavering from the point again (Sorry). i feel like i have no one to trust, no one to look to, no one to even trust. Not my friends, not my gf, not even my own family. i felt so alone tonight, i sat on the couch, staring at the kitchen, at the knifes. i dont know what to do, i cant keep going like this, please help me, before i do something horrid",19Dec2019,1

I cannot for the life of me, figure out *why* they treat me this way and the resentment is killing me. My question is, how should I deal with this situation? Do I need to stage a sort of intervention and talk it out with them? Or should I cut them out?

411,"My ex boyfriend and I broke up a year ago, we've been friends on and off since. I had made it very clear that as long as he wants to be in my life and stay friends, he needs to not flirt with other girls where I can see it/hear it and that I don't want to know of any business of him dating or flirting, I need him to keep all that away from me. 

He's been doing that for the past year, or at least trying to, until recently where I went crazy over stuff he did and felt really disrespected and hurt. I made it very clear to him, again, that he will be hurting me if he keeps doing this. He thinks I must have feelings for him if I can't accept him flirting with other people in front of me, he thinks he needs to be free to do what he wants even in those few moments we're together, he thinks I'm ""trying to change him"" and he wants to be able to ""be the guy he wants to be"". I find that extremely absurd. He values being able to flirt more than my own feelings. I feel utterly heartbroken and confused that someone who claims to care so much about me doesn't mind hurting me.

I tried to end our friendship three times over this. He freaked out, and refused to end things until yesterday where he said I'm a disgusting liar for claiming he wants to intentionally hurt me for thinking I'm the one who should be accepting of his behavior instead of him restraining himself a little when I'm around.

417,"This will likely be very long. 

I have had persisting problems stemming from issues with my anger since I was very young. Obviously screaming, breaking, kicking and throwing things was out of the question in school and as a result I have developed unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with the anger. As a child this resulted in my scraping the skin off my arms until I bled, because pain was the only distraction. 

For obvious reasons having been that angry so young was concerning and extremely isolating. I worked with an elementary school counselor for many years to circumvent this and for a time it worked. 

My problem is that I suffer from blinding seething rage. It’s so much worse now that I’m older though, because it is far more difficult to let go of. The blinding part also was not an exaggeration. In recent years my vision goes black when I’m angry and as a result I have taken several serious falls. Apart from that I have broken 2 fingers flailing around, punching walls, and hurt myself from bumping into things due to my inability to see. The rage I feel is so deep and intense that I have stabbed myself in the leg with pencils and bent on my two previously broken fingers to try and snap out of it before it gets too out of hand. It’s also exhausting, and when it does pass I typically have a headache and feel hot.

It has been a persisting problem throughout the majority of my relationship with my boyfriend and has been affecting it for some time. A lot of my anger in directed towards him and is released when we have arguments whether big or small. It’s very taxing on him, and I know that on my part it is abusive and toxic (not intentionally). We took a year apart and I am no longer abusive, and not as toxic (more so to myself than the relationship if that makes sense?) Nonetheless, I am still negatively impacting our relationship.

I have been to therapy but didn’t find it very effective. It makes me extremely sad because my anger keeps me from communicating my feelings in an effective way and makes the environment for having productive discussions on issues that upset me non conducive. I want to get better, I have made some improvements over the past year, but would like a more permanent solution. I love my boyfriend deeply, he means the world and then some to me and is exceedingly supportive, respectful  and kind. But, I don’t want this to be the thing that sticks in our relationship in the years moving forward. Any advice on communication or whatever else would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR I have blinding rage that is affecting my health and relationship. I want a more permanent solution to get better, please help me.",19Dec2019,1
418,"When I was 10, I moved in with my stepmum. At first everything seems okay. She was nice and all, but soon if I made a slight mistake she would yell at me really loud and punish me for things like forgetting to say thank you, switching on the air-conditioning, spilling water or watching tv. This went on for 5 years. I totally understand that it was my fault but, soon, I started to develop anxiety, low-self esteem and self harm. So I asked my mum to bring me to a therapist. She asked what was the cause of my anxiety. I couldnt say as my parents were next to me in the same room. So I lied.

After a few weeks of changing my life around, I felt good and I finally found a good roommate and on the day I am going to tell the roommate yes my ex texts me and asks to see me the next day.

I said i cant, roommate will be moving in. She blew up and started saying I am not allowed to have a girl roommate saying all this shit about me trying to reach onto anything I can and that I need work on myself more. This was after I hadn’t talked to her in 5 months after she moved out.

So she got me to come over and says its okay but then texts me after saying I’m just not ready. It just made me really fucking depressed listening to this shit. I didn’t reply to any of it.

The only reason i started talking to my ex again was because of how soul crushingly lonely Id been the last months, so I struck up a conversation a week ago. I regret doing that obviously. 

I was so depressed after she did this, i stopped replying to the girl that night because I wanted to be alone again. The next morning the girl says she wont move in for the 15th now but for the 31st if I choose her. FUCK!! I wanted someone for the holidays!


So I ghosted her.. because I want her as a roommate but I dont want someone moving in while im depressed (because of first impressions and I become very introverted when depressed). 
I feel a bit better right now but.. I dont know.. should I even contact this girl? It would be awkward.. like I have to recover a relationship before it even starts.

423,"I apologize ahead of time if I sound redundant or repetitive, but I wanted to be thorough and get out any details that may be relevant.

I'm 25. I joined a group of friends around my same age about a year ago, and was the last one to join while the rest of them have been together for a while. There's 7 of us--5 guys and 2 girls (including myself and my best friend). By choice, I mostly don't have other close friends who I regularly hang out with or talk to. 

They're not bad seeds. They either work/go to school/both and don't get into trouble. When I'm with with them, I always have a great time. They're funny, make me laugh and feel happy. Despite this, I ran into separate problems with two of them.  I've been trying to make a decision about it, and after this being on my mind for some time,  I came here to seek advice.

One of them is my best friend of 14 years. I love her and care about her. She adores me, shows it with acts of kindness, brags about me on social here and there. Then the last time we all went out to eat together, the topic of my sister came up. She brought up how my family and I enable her and always gives into her wants, then proceeds to LIST SEVERAL examples of incidents where that has happened. This is at least the 3rd time she has brought it up in this specific way, as if I didn't hear her the first time. I had enough and finally defended myself, as opposed to before when I let her say whatever while I disagree in my head. The rest of our friends were quiet while we went at it for the first time. It wasn't a screaming match, but I definitely used a tone to indicate to her that I was not having it. She ended that conversation by saying that she just doesn't want to see me stressed out. I believe it was more so just to diffuse the situation. 

I'm not sure if she realized that night that she shouldn't use that approach with me. In the past, she does the same thing in other areas where she believes I'm making mistakes in. For example, telling me that I only pick out horrible people to be in relationships with and proceeds to LIST EACH ONE OF THEM and remind me of what went wrong with them, as if I wasn't there for it. To add onto that, she uses a patronizing tone with terms like ""honey"" and ""sweetie"" when she makes a correction, which I think I can handle because I'm not sure if that's all in my head. However, I can no longer tolerate these attacks on who I choose to date and how I handle family matters.

The right thing to do probably would be to talk to her about how I feel and my wishes that she would refrain from doing it again. When I'm dealing with something, I just want to vent, and I want someone to listen. I'm not asking for input, and I'm definitely not asking for them to tell me what I did wrong and add it to a list to bring up in future conversations. I think if she was really my best friend, she would respect that and do what's necessary to keep me happy right?

At the moment, I no longer feel comfortable telling her about my personal life. A part of me is still upset about what happened at the restaurant. I've been avoiding her, and it got to the point where I don't talk to her at all, even about minute things like what I did with my day.

Next friend. He started having feelings for me for about a year now, heavy romantic feelings, not the ""just wanna date and see where things go"" kinda deal. He expressed this to me 6-7 months ago, and we exchanged long messages to discuss it. To sum it up, I turned him down, as I know we are not right for each other, and he ended the exchange by saying he would rather have me as a friend than not have me at all in his life, and will try his best to get rid of his feelings and treat me as a friend. Even so, he brought up the notion again weeks later. It was still a no for me, and he said the same thing again about trying to be my friend.

Ever since that second time he mentioned it, I thought it was best to distance myself from him. Maybe then, his feelings will go away. We stopped hanging out alone, and I only saw him during our group hangouts. I stopped taking the initiative to text him first. When he reaches out, I'm short with my responses, and purposely don't show any excitement (not using emojis and exclamation points as usual). But then on two occasions, he noticed this and becomes insecure, mentally beats himself up, asks me if he did anything wrong, and I have to reassure him that everything is fine. I'm usually very caring towards my friends, but at the time, I was focused on a major family issue, and the last thing I wanted to do was tend to him when he's like this. Or I have a major exam coming up in 2 weeks, and he tries to find ways to talk to me by bringing up plans that won't happen until a year later. I'm screaming in my head, but of course I don't tell him to leave me alone to study (my fault). Whenever he does this, I catch myself thinking of him negatively, and of myself negatively as well because I am not prioritizing his needs when my own life is hectic.

I know that he has made attempts to see me strictly as a friend. I recognize that feelings are not controllable, and it's not his fault. However, when it comes to his actions, he does treat me a little better than our friends, bringing food to my door, getting multiple souvenirs from his travels, etc. I was upset recently and he then bought me multiple gifts online as his way of doing something about it. I admit that it is definitely nice to know that you're adored, and I do appreciate the gifts, but I feel like I don't deserve any of it and don't like that he spends his literally hard earned money on me. I talked to him about this, but he doesn't see that I'm getting special treatment compared to the rest of our group. In my eyes, I see it as him not being active on treating me like a friend although he said he would. A part of me also believes that he is giving me so many things to possibly win me over, but I could be wrong, and he's genuinely doing this to make me happy.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, he tells me that he doesn't think his feelings for me will ever change. After some thought, I decided it was best not to leave any room for false hope by being honest and told him that I still stand by my first answer and I don't see that ever changing. This pained him, but he said again that he'll try to commit to being a good friend, but it will be sometimes hard to separate his feelings while doing so.

Group hangouts have become a lot more frequent, but I kinda have been in limbo trying to figure out what to do. During this, I have avoided all group functions. Partially because I was still a little upset at my best friend, but mostly because I don't think it's healthy for me or my other friend to be around each other. One of my  major concerns now is what if I do get into a relationship in the future? He spends most days working 12 hours and if not doing that, is either at home, or with our friends and doesn't meet anyone else, so dating is not as likely for him. It's definite that he has some form of undiagnosed depression and/or anxiety, and I'm worried that if I do find someone, it will take a huge toll on him. I do care about him and scared about what might happen. What can I do now? I have already distanced myself in the past, but it seems that even the few times we see each other during major occasions like birthdays and holidays, his feelings become stronger. So I thought about exiting myself from our social circle.

Since avoiding my friends, I normally don't see anybody else outside of my immediate family. It got to the point where I no longer feel like I need to surround myself with friends. So far, I actually don't feel socially incomplete, which is also a reason why I think I can do this and not have close friends in my life. It probably helps that I constantly keep myself occupied and busy everyday, so spending time with friends is the last thing on my mind. It might not even seem like a major change, as all it takes is to exit our group chat and to stop attending functions with them altogether, which I'm somewhat already doing. This might be the best for my friend and help him move on, even though he believes it's not possible. 

1. With my best friend, should I tell her about how I don't like the way she attacks me those few times so she can work on it? Or is this more of a me problem, and I should rewire my brain to be more understanding because this is her and I should accept her as is? And in that case, if I continue keeping her in the dark about my personal life and don't tell her everything, does that mean she isn't really my ""best friend"" and we should take out that title? It might lessen our obligations towards each other and make things more light than heavy

2. Is it unreasonable to leave a group of friends to possibly keep one of them from being hurt if this continues later on and I don't reciprocate his feelings?",19Dec2019,1
424,"Sorry this is so long! I just needed to express myself (journaling seemed so stupid in the moment). TL;DR at the end. 

Background: I’m an ok student generally speaking (if I try I will get an ok grade). This is technically my first year at university. The worst grade I’ve gotten in university was 73% (B) (class average was  74% (B).

This semester was one of the toughest for me. It started of terribly with everything going wrong. My mom had to fly overseas because she was a victim of identity theft. This affected me deeply because I had to be alone and it was truly horrifying. (I have mental health issues).

So, I didn’t get a great start like I usually do. Naturally, I tried my best to catch up but somehow the work just piled on.

I couldn’t keep up at all. I was taking 3 Phil courses (all required for a BA Phil major). 
(I did not take Phil intro courses, which I now regret) 

Then, just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse, my mom (who I’m very close with) got sick and doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong for a while. 

Around this time I literally ignored all my readings. Didn’t even pick up a book. 

And then, the doctors finally did! I was happy and I started working on assignments a bit. But I was still behind.

Then my mom got sick once again. This time she was diagnosed with diabetes. I was concerned (of course) but not all that worried. I knew it was controllable. 

But then, she started having sharp pains, numbness and tingling. This meant that she had a type of nerve damage.

At this point, honestly, I didn’t even want to know about her symptoms because it was all just so overwhelming terrifying. (I know that’s selfish but that’s honestly how I felt and acted, if I could go back I would).

With this mindset came essentially giving up on all my courses. I missed deadlines, procrastinated. I simply did not even try. 

Soon I asked for lots of accommodations on pretty much all the assignments and managed to get most of them in. 

However, I did not submit one assignment (worth 20%) in each of the 3 classes.
This made all 3 of my finals worth 60% 

By this time my mom was on medication for everything. I had so much anxiety about her taking it that I set alarms and ensured she took it. (I think the medication has effected her mood too. She was and is much more irritable.) 

By the time finals comes around I’m a mess. I’m fighting with my mom (we live together), procrastinating as much as possible, literally doing nothing productive at all.

The night before each final I try to cram. It feels as if I’m actually studying. I realize I missed this feeling of learning all semester. I make (good) study guides. I regret the procrastination and stupidity. 

The cramming however, doesn’t work obviously. I don’t have time to review those good study guides. 

I looked at my grades today. 2/3 grades are out. 

58% (C-) in one and 49% (Fail) in the other. 

I just feel like such a failure. I’m honestly considering dropping out. I feel like even the times that I really tried (submitting a minute before the deadline, getting extensions, the good study guides) was really just a waste. 
I’m just a waste of a person and this is just unacceptable. 

TL;DR: I failed a course and I feel like absolute crap. Even the effort I’ve put in seems like such a waste. I might drop out.",19Dec2019,1

426,"I've been diagnosed with social anxiety last week. I've had it for the last 16 months and it's extremely severe. I've had times where I honestly thought I was going to go permanently insane. I feel like when I talk to people I kind of come off as rude. I know you're supposed to talk to people differently depending on who they are to you, but I just don't feel like I can do that anymore. 

I don't necessarily feel like I'm doing anything wrong when I'm talking to them, but when I think about it later on I feel like I've been rude or something. In fact, my mother asked me something yesterday and I gave her an answer. She said I'm being kind of rude, but I honestly didn't mean to be and this is happening quite a bit with other people. 

**Is this due to social anxiety or am I just a rude person**? I've never been like this before and to be honest it's led to a few issues with people in my life when I honestly didn't mean to be rude/meant no harm. 

Thank you.",19Dec2019,1
427,"Well, I guess the point of this is to open up perspectives. I’d like every and all input about this decision. I’ll list the entirety of my thought process in bullet points. Here is an outline if you seek to look at some things specifically.



1. What 1 army recruiter said to me
2. The Contexts of my current college Career 
3. The Problem I Am Facing: Degree? Officer? Enlisted?
4. Why I want to join the military? And what branch am I looking at?




1. I’m in my second semester Junior year as a psychology major. I’ve talked to one army recruiter and he’s said OCS won’t consider me since my major isn’t stem-related. 


2. I’m now considering just quitting college for this time being and joining the military now as an enlistee and use those benefits to come back and finish my degree. Now there is more context here:

a. My current major is psychology.

b. The major I actually wanted to major in was Computer Science but I failed a calculus class (bad work ethic and weak background in trigonometry). Failing that class freshmen year scared me into pursuing psychology with the intent to pursue social work. However, this year, I’ve worked with non-profits and did volunteer work and found human services to not be my calling.

- however, I am planning to retake the calculus course. I believe my work ethic has improved immensely and I have been improving my background in trig and algebra. Junior me is outgoing and can admit to weakness compared to freshmen me. 

c. I have taken all my GEs, upper and lower division. I have only my upper division major classes to finish. If I work even hard enough, I could finish my degree a semester early even.

3. My goal is to enter as a Commissioned Officer. So there are two options (A and B) that seem viable to me. And I will provide which branches and why I want to join them (C). Im still doing research myself so here is where my logic will have holes.

A. I don’t finish my psychology degree and leave the school with my units. I join as an enlisted. I finish my four years of service, and then come back to my university to finish my degree (but this time, as a computer science major). 

+ don’t have to exacerbate nonexistent finances 
- enter as an enlisted 
- enter as enlisted at 21
- don’t have bachelors 

B. I change my majors after I retake my calculus course. And then take another 2-3 years to finish a bachelors in compsci. How I will afford those extra years, I will assume loans 

+ will have bachelors 
+ stem-related major 
+ increases/ have chances of OCS candidacy 
+ possibly loan forgiveness program if OCS candidacy approved 
- longer time in school (I’m already at 2 1/2 years; changing majors may push me to staying 5-6 years in school)
- May have to pull out loans for extra semesters 


C. Air Force or Navy

+ more data, logistic based jobs

+ I’ve spoken to a few airmen and sailors. There’s a general consensus that Air Force is more corporate like and has a more respectful culture. 


4. I want to be able to financially support my family as soon as I can. College has been a slow burn for me. I feel trapped as a psychology major. I thought I could be passionate about human services as I kept getting closer to graduation, but I literally feel suffocated with this major. I did college because it was the only way to go after I graduated high school, but after I met a few sailors, soldiers, and airmen, I realized there’s a whole world of opportunity the military could offer, and that the benefits can help my life and my family’s life in the long run. 

Thanks for reading my thesis lol",19Dec2019,1
429,"So I have this friend I've known since 6th grade. We kind of stopped talking at 7th grade, since we weren't really close at the time. But then 8th grade came, we were put together in classes, and we came to be somewhat close with each other. I hate to admit it, but there were times like I wanted to cut myself off from my friend. And the reason is that, sometimes, I felt like I was a nuisance to them. Unlike me, they're pretty smart, and have talent. To put into simpler words, I kind of hold this person in high regard. I hate to say this too, but I envied them quite a bit. (Plus, they're a straightforward person and was sometimes difficult to read.)

There would be times when they'd call me annoying. Now, I never dared interject, because I know for a fact that I am. I usually just shrugged it off until it became a big deal to me just this 9th grade. We weren't put in the same class anymore, but we still talked for a bit. It might have been out of sheer overthinking but, I began to assume she hated me. Like all those times I annoyed them just started making me see things more clearly, I dunno. At the same time, I was conflicted, since we shared a great bond too. 

I could see that they were around friends they seemed comfortable with and that made me think they didn't need to be friends with me anymore. And to tell you the truth, that was actually the same drive that made me act like I didn't know them when we were in 8th grade. It'd seem weird for me to try and strike up a conversation when, y'know, this person had friends of their own and maybe it'd seem like I was, uh, awkward. At this point I can agree I was kinda overthinking, haha. 

It made me question why I was hanging out with a person such as them and from there, the doubt worsened and eventually made me avoid them. Yes, just straight up avoid them. I wanted to so badly talk to them and know what they thought. That was an impossible wish, as they usually answered with replies that led me to more questions. At some point, my friends helped me talk to them again in chat. 

They told me they felt uncomfortable with me suddenly avoiding them out of the blue. I wanted to know why it mattered to them, the actions of some average, useless individual. They didn't answer, but it led to more replies. In the end, they kept saying they were VERY chill with me but the doubt was still there. I said things like ""Maybe you're just saying that to calm me down. You really don't have to lie."" and ""We're friends, right? I mean, I feel like Im only an annoyance to you."" 

I came to face them the next day, and to my shock, they yelled at me, with a bit of tease in their tone, saying ""So you're just gonna start controlling my thoughts then?"" Me with my oversensitive ass, I overreacted and ran off, crying infront of my other friend as I reached my classroom. I waited for them to talk to me. Nothing. I just wanted to know if they actually cared.

The following months were just me constantly turning back to and away from the situation. Sometimes I wanted to talk, sometimes I wanted to abandon it saying, ""Ah, well, they don't need me anyways. Why would they want a piece of garbage like me?"" or something like that. A friend told me that they wanted to approach me, they just didn't know how without both of us going nuts. One day unexpectedly, they approached me but I kept running off. At the time, I just felt like it was too much of a surprise. I tried talking to them the next day, while covering my face with a book (because I was afraid to face them). Our conversation went nowhere, and then I chickened out.

I reflected on it for abit and then decided that for real, I was ready to talk. Maybe it was a bad move on my part to run off like that. But I was I afraid that they had lost interest because of what I did. All my friends that gave me insight on the situation say that if they were them, they'd listen. I kinda need advice on what to do. I've been getting more and more stirred up about it lately, and it saddens me since we were pretty good buds. How do you think I should approach them/ what to do?


TL;DR: Avoided a friend for four months because I thought they didn't want to be friends anymore(basically I overthinked), I want to approach them now, but I don't know how.",19Dec2019,1

She's been on antidepressants before but won't go on them again. We live separately (divorce) so it can be difficult to always be there for her and I know she's lonely because she's told me.  


Obviously this isn't the whole situation because it's too much to put here but that's the basic idea.  
I've considered some things like cooking some meals for her that are from her country, and buying her or making her gifts but I dont know if these would actually help?

438,"It’s a long story, but basically I got into a huge mouth off with 2 people online. I tried to settle the beef and in the process of doing that they decided to try and doxx me. They narrowed it down to about 30 people and sent me a picture of those 30. I was  one of them. They obviously don’t know me as they would’ve sent a picture of only me. Basically, I did a stupid thing and if these 2 people interact with another person they could easily find me.

On a fake acocunt I asked about myself and they said “he was a dick”. I continued to question them and basically they don’t like me, but they said it’s “water under the bridge”. 

So...they may or may not know be by now, and I have a HUGE anxiety problem. Things like this stress me out completely and this has been terrorising me for months. All my accounts are now deleted. 

Deep inside, I know they don’t know me, and I know that even if they did they wouldn’t act on it (I’ve given huge apologises and have had chill convos with them since).  It’s hard to communicate everything that has happened, but basically, a lot of things would have to happen in order for them to find me (I’d say it’s very unlikely).

I just want tips on whether I should further investigate (knowing that it will take a long time to do, and there’s a good chance I’ll never actually find out how much they know), OR whether I should just move on, and ignore it every time the thought enters my head.

439,"I’ve always yearned for intimacy. My parents never gave me any as a child so I tend to seek that in a significant other. Why does my ever so neediness get in the way of my independence? Does it not exist for me?

I’ve been on this self improvement path ever since I quit my job and broke up with my bf. Enjoyment has come back into my life. I am able to do whatever I want, at anytime I want. I meditate, I journal, I exercise, I eat healthy. I AM happy.. to a certain extent.

The only thing I want on top of all of this is to cuddle with someone I like. Certainly, I do not want to cuddle with a random, and definitely, do I not want to cuddle with someone I’m friends with. It has to be a crush that I’m comfortable with.

I’m in love with my friend.

We met through work about 2 years ago. She left the company 2 months ago and we regularly text and see each other from time to time ever since. 

We’ve been messaging good morning everyday - me with the sunflower emoji, and occasionally text good night. Once I didn’t and she asked  where was her sunflower. Told her she didn’t text me and she got upset of always having to initiate contact first. It was only because I felt like a bother.

There were instances that makes me think she loves me too as more than a friend and I suspect she knows my feelings towards her. I saw writings before on a paper the words, ”love in your eyes”, “my faith”, fix you” etc. But perhaps it was for another person and I’m just seeing what I want to see. Like she says, I overthink a lot.

She’s a great friend and has a beautiful mind. I don’t want to lose her but I also can’t bear the thought of her  with somebody else. My anxiety gets the best of me and it is making me sad and heart broken. Whenever I think about distancing myself, as if like the universe was watching or God, there she was, making her presence known.  And I’m too weak for her. Haist. It’s been  a hard year to say the least.

456,"Didn't know another title to go with as that's what I've known him as my whole life, the bully. But here we go. There are a few details I need to write before hand.

Me and my partner have been seeing each other for a little over a year now and It is a very serious relationship. I'm 25 and she's 24. We both work part-time and study part-time, hence we see each other only a few days during the week. She does live quite far away, around a 2 hour drive to go and see her. 

Now my step-father has always been the controlling, 'powertripping', manipulative, passive-aggressive all the time, my way or the highway kind of person, and has bullied and picked on me ever since a little boy. Anything he can comment or put me down he will do without fail. 

Long story short, he's been recently enforcing a new rule within his household and that rule is that my partner is only allowed to stay over the night once a week. Now I find this very unfair due to the little amount we actually get to spend with each other, the time it takes to drive to hers and pick her up and come back. We only have half of Thursday to Saturday morning to spend with each other. 

I wanted to ask if you guys thought it was unfair that I'm being enforced this rule. I understand it is ""his"" house, well, partly my mothers too, but still... His reason for enforcing this rule was due to ""privacy"", I think his exact words were ""I want to feel comfortable getting a glass of water at night"", but I just don't buy it... Not only because I've never seen this man in 20 years of living with him go and get a glass of water but due to the fact he constantly tries to make me miserable, anything he can control he will.

I picked her up the other night and as soon as we got in he started on me. ""I thought we had a fucking agreement"", long story short, he had thought she stayed more than one night already.. even though she just got here... I just have no clue what to do anymore, I feel honestly trapped.

Oh and for my mothers view point, she adores my partner and knows it's a very serious relationship and she doesn't mind her coming over whenever she wants. 

Any advice will help, thanks.",19Dec2019,1
457,"This is a long story but I'm going to try and keep it simple and short. 

I have very consevative, religious parents. I'm not a religious person and I've been faking it for years, going to church with them, never arguing about religious topics with them etc. 

Its also important to know I have depression and my parents really don't understand the illness or me. So now since I somehow gave away my beliefs about religion my mom sent me to see the pastor today to have a talk. Im waiting in my car as Im typing this.

I am popular with girls, just because I get into the conversation easily and am extroverted (the other guys are introverted) 
I’m not trying to jack myself off, but when she didn’t respond to one of my messages, I felt like she isn’t that easy to get, and I like that alot.
When i talk to her face to face, it is no problem, she Laughs at my jokes and talks alot with me.
But recently i Developed this complex Around her, and it is not that easy to talk with her as it is with other girls.
Am i just delusional by thinking i have a chance?

467,"I've lived in my roommate's house since March 2019. He's the homeowner which definitely causes most to not all of the problems. 

He's extremely passive aggressive despite me stating to him that that was my biggest pet peeves when he was interviewing me for the spot. 

It's hard to list the multitude of times he's acted out his passive aggressive behavior, because a lot of the time it's too subtle for my actual brain to give it enough value. But I am a very perceptive person, and dealt with a manipulative and passive aggressive mother where it easy me to pick up on whatever signs the person is trying to send out. 

One dumb one was him leaving a duster mop in front of the fridge door for a couple days. I didn't do anything with it and eventually he took it away. I clean all the time but hadn't mopped in a bit. He hardly ever cleans, which is fine since he's homeowner but I won't respond to that pass agress nonsense. 

Couple of backstory points. He's admitted he's Machavellian in his dating life, has had Machacellia's book laying around and is not secure with his sexual identity. 

He says he's bi, but from my friends who have met him, and my own observations, it's clear he does not seem comfortable at all. He doesn't embrace gay culture and puts his nose up to it. He complains about how unsatisfied he is if he goes on dates with girls and only once out of several times has brought a girl back. 

He was out of the country for two weeks and to I guess reestablish his dominance in the house, had two different guys come over the first two nights he came back for quick hookups. The emotional energy or message he was trying to send me was very strange. 

I don't mean to disparage his sexual behavior or sexual identity confusion, but it has played a part in his apparent toxicness toward me. I'm heterosexual and you can tell he gets annoyed or bothered when I bring girls back to the place. His pass agress behavior, antics and emotional coldness increase whenever this happens. 

Recently, he cleaned out below the sink due to a mice problem. I offered to give him any help but he refused, as he always does, because I think it's some sort of power thing. But nevertheless he asked me to put all the bottles of cleaners and stuff back. Not wanting to cramp his space I said I'd do it later but he hung around the kitchen almost egging me to do it. I did and then he proceeded to watch me put every piece back in and critique me, to a point very father to child like saying ""now what two things are still missing that need to go in"" with a weird smirk on his face. There was definitely some sexual or dominance energy he was emitting. Sort of screwed up.

Few other large parts to the current issue. I'm definitely underpaying for my place, which leads him to have weird guilt trips for me. I also haven't paid utilities in many months, which is no fault at mine, but because he's lazy and hasn't figured out the costs in maybe five months. So, there's definitely an untold agreement that I have to pay my share, not only because I live with him, as any roommate does, but because I don't pay utilities. 

There are a myriad of issues that have to be done with the old house, and these projects aren't something a renter would or should be expected to do. Nevertheless, he gets these arbitrary points of ""contributing"" to the house and then uses that against me if I maybe am too busy to unload dishwasher, take out trash or buy new toilet paper immediately when it goes out.

These are major slips, but they're amplified by him being emotionally unstable, me not paying utilities and him always having to do work to the house. I mean that's the deal of being a landlord. I'm his first renter I believe, as he didn't have someone live with him at his house in his old city.

Another factor before I get to current crisis: there is also a high expectation that I hang out with him. His ad for the room definitely leaned this way, that it wasn't solely to help with rent, but that he wanted a friend. 

You can tell the guy is lonely where at one point he didn't do anything social besides use a hookup app twice over the course of two weeks. The energy during this time period was very strange. He also has a dog, which again, you can tell he only got because he needed a companion, which is fair, but he's not a great owner and personally thinks it's the wrong reason to get a dog, if you're not a dog person.

(shockingly, there's issues with the dog too, and again, he will use all the work it takes to maintain a dog against me as me not pulling my fair share)

I will hang out with him occasionally, but have a busy schedule and also like to shut down in my room when I'm finally. But like other issues, he will becoming cold or more pass agress if I don't show my face on the couch in a while. I also think there's a weird thing where he wants to be sexually romantic with me. I'm not projecting but I get a sense a lot where he's flirting with me then frustrated when I don't reciprocate.

Also, his dog seems to like me better. This happened with an old roommate of mine, who was also a homeowner but my best friend. There is not an easier sign to pick up when an owner realizes their dog prefers someone else living in the house over them. Part of it is good cop bad cop, me being the fun good cop. 

But mostly, it's me being good with dogs by giving them enough attention, playing with them and sending out the right energy. Also, both my dog owners have gotten the dog for the wrong reasons i.e. for social status and/or loneliness. They don't give enough back to the dog and in my current case with outcast him to the yard for the silliest of reasons and times. 

This insecurity over his dog by my current roommate manifests mostly when he will try to separate the dog from me. When roomie is in a bad mood or in imaginary one-sided battle with me, he'll send the dog outside anytime I come downstairs, or he'll have the dog sleep in his room (which he doesn't allow upstairs so it's a big tell). There's little subtletly to his actions. 

Finally, what I think happened to cause the current battle is a combo of a few things. One, I haven't paid utilities in a while, he's been toiling over the mouse problem (which I even went out and got poison and traps myself), I've been too busy and not been around the house, and I said the following to him -

He asked if I was going skiing this next weekend and I responded sort of ""no shit Sherlock-e"" it's Christmas, I'm going back home with a small chuckle. He did seem put off by it. He doesn't celebrate, and is staying here. He laughed saying he doesn't think about the holidays in general. 

His two week weird holing up happened to start right around Thanksgiving, I don't think that's a coincidence. I left town to go do a solo trip that weeknd because I wasn't going to hang out with just me him and the dog on Thanksgiving, depressively. But ever since then, I have felt more coldness from him.

So back to this week, he again, as he said during Tgiving week, likes being home for holiday to do nothing (we live in a city with a lot of people move here from out of state, so city empties out on holidays). 

When I said I'd be going home for xmas, he sort of questioned me, and I said in matter of fact way, well yeah I think almost everyone goes home this week. He then said he thinks he knows a few people hanging around still. I said, that's cool, but yeah I think it's will get pretty empty here, nonchalantly. 

The energy shifted massively during this convo. Despite him not being Christian (he's a non-practicing Hispanic Jew), I can tell he will likely be alone on Christmas. I asked if he goes home to celebrate Hannuhkah, and he scoffed and says he likes the Christmas season and whole aspect of it. So, somehow with whatever I said, it triggered him. 

In addition, he was working on mouse stuff for a while, I came back after work and said ""wow, still working on it?"" in shock that there was that much work, and bitingly and sarcastically said back to me ""yeah I have a day job"" (he typically works from home).

Since these the xmas and mouse work convo, he's been extremely unfriendly, he did the whole watch me put away stuff below sink thing, has kept the dog away from me, parked in my off street parking spot one night without any explanation (he had open space in his own garage where he usually parks), pulled out washer and dryer to do ""mouse prevention work"" (has left w and d out and unusable for five days now), mentioned me not paying utilities (told him yeah I'll pay whatever man, it part of the gig), and then finally had a huge xmas party last night without telling me.

The xmas party was really a shock because he usually tells me (usually via text) every minor thing with house like a guy coming over to check out a dresser he's selling. I'm not offended by not getting the invite, it's just the crescendo on a really weird week of getting stuff thrown at me by him. I walked in late after xmas shopping, no one said hi to me, and finally after a good half minute (he does this  Machiavellian shit often to leave you out to dry in social settings) my roommate said to about a dozen or so people, very shortly, 'this is my roommate, guys'.

I have three months left on a one year lease. I think we both expected me to extend it, but I'm leaning very heavily on moving out because of his antics. Hard to encapsulate all of it, but he seems overly vindictive and unstable to me. I get passive aggressiveness to some extent but trying to make my life more difficult seems adolescent for a homeowner well into his 30s. 

Do I have a blindside in all of this? Communicating my issues with his pettiness would seem like he'd relish in it for affecting me successfully. I guess that's the sign of a toxic person haha, right?",19Dec2019,1
469,"So I have this friend I've known since 6th grade. We kind of stopped talking at 7th grade, since we weren't really close at the time. But then 8th grade came, we were put together in classes, and we came to be somewhat close with each other. I hate to admit it, but there were times like I wanted to cut myself off from my friend. And the reason is that, sometimes, I felt like I was a nuisance to them. Unlike me, they're pretty smart, and have talent. To put into simpler words, I kind of hold this person in high regard. I hate to say this too, but I envied them quite a bit. (Plus, they're a straightforward person and was sometimes difficult to read.)

There would be times when they'd call me annoying. Now, I never dared interject, because I know for a fact that I am. I usually just shrugged it off until it became a big deal to me just this 9th grade. We weren't put in the same class anymore, but we still talked for a bit. It might have been out of sheer overthinking but, I began to assume she hated me. Like all those times I annoyed them just started making me see things more clearly, I dunno. At the same time, I was conflicted, since we shared a great bond too. 

I could see that they were around friends they seemed comfortable with and that made me think they didn't need to be friends with me anymore. And to tell you the truth, that was actually the same drive that made me act like I didn't know them when we were in 8th grade. It'd seem weird for me to try and strike up a conversation when, y'know, this person had friends of their own and maybe it'd seem like I was, uh, awkward. At this point I can agree I was kinda overthinking, haha. 

It made me question why I was hanging out with a person such as them and from there, the doubt worsened and eventually made me avoid them. Yes, just straight up avoid them. I wanted to so badly talk to them and know what they thought. That was an impossible wish, as they usually answered with replies that led me to more questions. At some point, my friends helped me talk to them again in chat. 

They told me they felt uncomfortable with me suddenly avoiding them out of the blue. I wanted to know why it mattered to them, the actions of some average, useless individual. They didn't answer, but it led to more replies. In the end, they kept saying they were VERY chill with me but the doubt was still there. I said things like ""Maybe you're just saying that to calm me down. You really don't have to lie."" and ""We're friends, right? I mean, I feel like Im only an annoyance to you."" 

I came to face them the next day, and to my shock, they yelled at me, with a bit of tease in their tone, saying ""So you're just gonna start controlling my thoughts then?"" Me with my oversensitive ass, I overreacted and ran off, crying infront of my other friend as I reached my classroom. I waited for them to talk to me. Nothing. I just wanted to know if they actually cared.

The following months were just me constantly turning back to and away from the situation. Sometimes I wanted to talk, sometimes I wanted to abandon it saying, ""Ah, well, they don't need me anyways. Why would they want a piece of garbage like me?"" or something like that. A friend told me that they wanted to approach me, they just didn't know how without both of us going nuts. One day unexpectedly, they approached me but I kept running off. At the time, I just felt like it was too much of a surprise. I tried talking to them the next day, while covering my face with a book (because I was afraid to face them). Our conversation went nowhere, and then I chickened out.

I reflected on it for abit and then decided that for real, I was ready to talk. Maybe it was a bad move on my part to run off like that. But I was I afraid that they had lost interest because of what I did. All my friends that gave me insight on the situation say that if they were them, they'd listen. I kinda need advice on what to do. I've been getting more and more stirred up about it lately, and it saddens me since we were pretty good buds. How do you think I should approach them/ what to do?

484,"So I'll try to keep this as short as possible.   


We are a family of 5, me (22F), my older brother (25),my oldest brother (26) and mom &amp; dad of course.   
Me and my oldest brother, gonna go ahead and call him Max, had a really tight and good relationship when I was young and he had a huge impact on my life.   
Unfortunately, when I was about 16-17 an incident happened that I'd rather not talk about, but all my trust and respect for Max was long gone.   
After that, our relationship fell apart slow and steady. I couldn't stand living in the same house as him but fast forward a couple of years and he finally moved out!   


He moved out about 2 years ago and our relationship became much better. BUT, now were coming in to the main issue here. He brags constantly about everything and he always has to ''one up'' me. When I say ''one up'' me I mean for instance if I say that I had to wake up at 6am he has to climb in and say ''I WOKE UP AT 5am SOOO...''. He does this **CONSTANTLY** and it's always around ME.   
It can be things that are so silly as well and he always tries to shit on my happiness. I remember not long ago, maybe about a month ago, I called him to tell him how happy I was that I finally bought a new Nintendo Switch Lite. In the MIDDLE OF MY SENTENCE, he interrupts me to tell me that he got a surround sound system in his home. Like he couldn't wait til' I told him what games I bought with it or how happy I was. I barely got to say that I bought the switch lite before he interrupted me.   


He seems extremely narcissistic, talks about himself non-stop and around specifically ME he has to brag, prove that he's better somehow and always ''one up'' me as I mentioned.   
This is getting on my nerves and I'm afraid it'll ruin our relationship that we've just been able to rebuild these last 2 years. But I can't fucking stand this shit and it has made me avoid him a whole lot.   
Also, he always has to be right. When I say always, I mean fucking **always.**

495,"I’ve rented a house for two years in a neighborhood that isn’t considered very safe in a metro city in the US. It’s a nice property though -under a street light, a half a block away from the local fire station, surrounded by other similarly nice houses with people who take care of their properties. Going further into the neighborhood is a little sketchy; there have been a couple of shootings in the area since I moved in. I’m 25F, fairly street-smart, and I feel totally comfortable living in my house. I have a lease on it for another year, at least.

Around the time I moved in, my neighbor got a blue-nosed pit bull puppy for his family of five. I love dogs and the pit is very cute. Not incredibly well-trained (he doesn’t often listen when my neighbor calls for him), but very friendly and mostly just excitable like a lot of other dogs. The pit is around 2 years old now and for the last two years, my neighbor often leaves the dog outside tethered to a stake. The dog has a lot of room to roam around the yard on the tether, but I think he gets lonely because all he does is bark when he’s outside. He barks almost nonstop, whether he’s outside for ten minutes or 5 hours. Shit’s annoying, especially because I work from home, but that’s not the problem.

The problem is this year, my neighbor has been leaving the dog tethered outside all night long and the temperatures are dropping below freezing ~25°F. I’m afraid the dog is going to die. At the very least he is freezing and miserable and it makes me mad and sad. I want to report my neighbors for animal cruelty to get the dog away (at least he’d be inside in a shelter?) But I am very worried about the repercussions, since I’m the only one that can see the dog outside all night, besides the house on the other side of my neighbor.

I’m pretty confident my neighbor got the dog for his family... but dog fighting isn’t uncommon nor would it be out of place to occur in this neighborhood. Dog fighting, trading, and breeding can be a very dangerous thing to get in the middle of due to the lucrative nature of it. The implication is that the pit isn’t strictly for the family and is being used to breed etc. 

I’d appreciate some advice on how to help this dog. I’m positive he’s freezing and I just know he’s lonely.

Tl;dr: The problem is this year, my neighbor has been leaving the dog tethered outside all night long and the temperatures are dropping below freezing ~25°F. I live in an unsafe neighborhood and my neighbor would likely know if I reported him to animal protective services.",19Dec2019,1

500,"Hi! I've never really posted on a public forum asking for help or anything of that sort, but I feel like I have no choice. I've dated quite a few women in my short lifespan, and after one of my recent serious relationships, I kind of ended up being unable to trust anybody or commit to anyone. (She cheated). This has affected every relationship of mine since then. However, this post isn't regarding that.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been, since last year been having feelings towards a friend of mine back from highschool. To be fair, she has been my friend since the past 6 years, and we've closely kept up with each other for the most part. We did drift off a bit in 2017 but since last year, we've again talked regularly. In short, we've been there for each other for a majority portion of our school-college-work life(almost). I realized I had feelings for her ever since we resumed talking after this long break in between. I kept these thoughts at bay because 1. She had a boyfriend. 2. My angst ridden teenage years had taught me not to confess my feelings. However, we met after 4 years(we haven't seen each other since school), and the only thing I felt when she hugged me was ""She's the one"". Ik it sounds very corny and all, but honestly I never felt that happy since forever. Nevertheless my feelings amplified but I don't want to tell her because I never want to make things awkward between us. (We share everything tbh), but I'm back in my city and she asked to meet. I ofcourse want to meet her, but that also means I'll probs feel empty after.

501,"Sometimes when I do certain stuff, my collegue/employee would say something like 'a little pace on it' even though I'm doing my best. And one time I responded saying 'I'm trying my best' and she would (nicely say) 'I know that, but you can try to speed up a little bit, which I said 'Yea but if I speed up with (bringing coffee/thee for instance) I would probably spill something' (which is true). Was it wrong for me to say this?

It's just that, she almost never tells me 'good job' or 'keep it going' (which motivates me). Saying stuff like 'speed up a little' all the time, just sounds like I'm working very slow and demotivates me as well.

506,"For the past year, I have been working as an executive (first job out of uni) in a social care environment, specifically of residential home service for children with challenging behaviour.

And what I mean by challenging behaviour, they vary - emotional, physical, behavioural and so on.

So to a certain extent, these children are your clients who are bullies, abusers and are capable of doing all types of stuff, some of which are horrible, but you have to be there for them to teach them values, empathy and other methods that are necessary to give them the support and care that they require - even if the methods need to be firm and strong (because I am learning that empathy has its own differences depending on the context - you need to be aware of the person's needs and behaviours but being firm can be just as empathetic and effective especially for clients who will probably take advantage in every situation that they can come across)

This job was quite challenging from the start - I had barely any practice beforehand, the stressors and exposures can be very harsh and impactful, clients, although they are children, can be just as tough, mean and even abusive (and this is where you need to learn to develop tough skin), the structure is often incredibly challenging and too intricately complex because of all the bureaucracy, laws, ethics and even the fact that you will be working with people with all sorts of personalities, characters and traits which can change or adapt from time to time, and having to work with other people who I surprisingly learned that they barely had any of the required skills so it is my job to give them said skills too with the level that they can understand (and such skills and requirements take months or maybe even years to understand and hone, let alone that these people already have their own responsibilities to take care and even this job also has an effect on their well-being as well).

This job is challenging in many, many ways and if you are not careful, it can affect your entire life - your well-being, your personal life, your motivation, your sense of purpose and fulfilment, your goals and so on.

Don't forget that this is a very complex job where you are working with people, all with their own quarks and challenges, with structures that are also just as intricate, and sometimes, challenges and shit will happen on the fly.

&amp;#x200B;

Now before I end up saying that I am deciding to quit, I do admit that these challenges have their own merits - they helped me face my own fears and traumas, they taught me how to be more practical and pragmatic considering that I only was taught about the theoretical aspect of the subject that I studied in (psychology), I learned leadership skills and strategetic thinking and so on. So to a certain extent, these struggles helped me grow.

&amp;#x200B;

But despite all this, I fed up of this dance. I fed up of feeling like I am not achieving anything, or feeling like I am not getting anywhere, and having to continue to do the same stuff over and over and over again for clients who refuse the change at all costs. I feel like I am wasting my energy, my time, my resources, my everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I know that these clients are still children and are limited in their reasoning compared to the average adult and I can understand where they are coming from. But we give them all the tools, all the chances, all the means and methods to teach them how to be the better person (and we go through so many strifes and fights that we have to end up playing the role of policemen to stop them from continuing to abuse or take advantage of our services) and I am tired of this dance, feeling like I am not getting anywhere and not achieving anything.

How many times am I going to continue doing the same loop and hoping that things will change this time? (the quote by Einstein comes to mind). Why should I keep on caring or thinking about whatever strategy that I can think of to teach or even to be an obstacle to these clients whenever they continue their abusive ways when they do not care about anyone except for themselves? (sometimes not even themselves. Sometimes the thought about why should I care about people who do not care about me comes to mind).

If I am the one who is given the task to play the role of the parent to these clients, why should I continue to think and act as if I actually am the parent when I am not and I have my own life to focus on?

Every time I think about this job, all I can think of is the hours that are left until I go home. Everytime I think of my tasks and responsibilities, all I can think of whatever means to avoid letting my mind take over with all the dark feelings that are clouding my mind. Sometimes even if I happen to be an accident and have to skip work, I feel nothing. Or even I am told that I was fired, I would feel nothing or even feel more relieved than sad.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that life is way too precious as a resource and I feel like if I am doing this continuous dance over and over and over and over again, with all these unbelievable challenges where my mind is telling me that I am not getting anywhere, or where every time I think about work, all I can think of is hell and damnation and its austerities instead of all of its merits and benefits and values, I feel like I am about to burst a blood vessel.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried to counter this with whatever method that I can think of - hobbies, trying to fill the rest of my time with something else instead of dwelling on work, or sometimes even talking to someone (the last part is hard to do. I already live with a family who I already have a pretty complicated history (abuse was also involved) so imagine going back home after work where you don't even feel like you are home or are going back to an environment that is slightly more welcoming. It feels like I am fighting against two wars (plus all the wars that already are in my head because I still have to go through my own personal troubles, plus all the troubles that the job make me go through and have to maintain to keep myself stable) ... but I still feel empty inside especially when 40 hours of your week involve your work, almost as if it is your second home.

&amp;#x200B;

I constantly feel angry, irritated, anxious, apathetic, depressed, filled with rage against everything and everyone for no reason. I am capable of resisting against all of these negative thoughts and feelings with the best of my ability but I am tired of feeling like this all the time, especially when I have little resilient factors that counter against these things.

&amp;#x200B;

I have considered that this is probably all in my head and I still think that this could be case. But my heart, my gut and my soul, they are scream that I should find something that is more fulfilling, even if it has its own challenges too, at least something that is more fulfilling and purposeful because every time I am outside of work and do other tasks, I feel free. solemn, and all other positive words that I can think of.

I do not want to continue to feel like this every week where I feel like I am going through hell where I feel like I am going through a dead-end and wasting all of my energy and time, and where I feel that I would rather just be anywhere else or even just dead if possible. It is even worse when the thought of regret and looking back in the near future comes to mind.

I have been visiting a therapist, I do supervision sessions and while these do geniunely help and provide me with insight and deeper understanding on how to do my job well and all the other tools that I can utilise to better myself and achieve better results while also having the enough mental stability in my life to keep on going, I still feel empty, alone, sad, and whatever negative feeling that you can think of. I feel like a zombie!

&amp;#x200B;

515,"So for some background, I have discord a chatting app where you can make servers. I use them for RPG and whatnot. 

So about a month or two ago, someone joined my server, however they began to post over 10 graphic gore images on my server in two different text channels.  ISIS photos, other photos of a women being burned to death, and highly innapropiate videos to the members of my server.  Let’s call him Gorey.  One person (let’s call her Dick) said Gorey was a nice person and she then had him raid the servers I had that Dick was in.  I banned those two people.  However Gorey even posted a trap virus that if you clicked it, it would steal your personal info.  No one else clicked it luckily.   

My group of admin had to delete all the photos.  We didn’t have proof to get Gorey banned from the discord itself so a friend of mine baited Gorey to send photos to them so they could report them to discord and get him banned. Long story short, he got banned. 

However about two days ago on a different server I’m in, someone posted a porn photo. I was asleep at that time but he got banned.  I don’t know if he spammed photos like the gore guy but he may be related.  

Just yesterday someone joined a server of mine, I didn’t mind it until they sent graphic scat porn on two text categories I have. It was over 10 graphic images which I tried not to look at them as I deleted them.  I believe it was the Gorey’s new alt account since his got banned. But the weird part is that in that server, I hadn’t “bumped” it for advertising it.  

What should I do? I personally don’t want to add that person as a friend and bait for him the pictures and report it.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me.

522,"Hello! So I (22F) am currently studying at university, doing a course in Film and Television.

I’m in my final year, about to go into my final semester, which means I’ve got some big decisions to make about my future. I have always loved film, and during my course I’ve found that I absolutely love studying it and writing theory for it, but I hate the practical side. Pretty much everyone else on my course are the opposite and all dream of becoming part of the production process but I personally don’t want to. I instead love to study it, and if I could go into a film theory career I would but at this stage I don’t know if that even exists!

I’ve always loved teaching as well, I did it as a part time job since I was 13/14 (only as an assistant swim teacher), then just before university I spent a year voluntarily teaching film and photography and I adored it. I looked forward to it all week, and I think my love of the theory side coincides with that.

The only ‘practical’ thing I enjoyed doing was producing - I loved sourcing things, talking with people, organising everyone. I know I can’t jump into that without a few years as a runner and honestly, I don’t think it’s worth it. But I feel like such a failure to go through all that film education to only pursue the job of teaching film, because everyone always says to me ‘if you can’t do, teach’.

539,"Two months ago I left my husband and moved in with my brother and his wife. In the span of this time period, a young woman has decided she wants to stay there. My brother being the kind hearted guy he is, doesn't she the massive amount of problems she is causing. This girl is 22, as to where the rest of us are 5+ years older than her. She thinks it is ok to walk through the house in a thong and a t-shirt, with my 4 year old son in the house. She has been steadily crossing as many boundaries as she can with my brother, being a married man. She took the liberty to sleep in my bed while I was out of town over the weekend, without my consent. 
    I have to wake up at 5:45 every morning to take care of my son, while my ex works. She comes in at one or two in the morning being as loud as possible. I believe she is on hard drugs, as well.

However, my mother told me a few nights ago that they are considering moving back down here (they are from here originally but moved two hours up the coast for work where I mostly grew up) and this shocked me as they moved into a lovely old house in a tree lined street looking over the river and have other professional friends qs neighbours.


But, I don't want to sound selfish when I say this but I enjoy my autonomy and being able to go and visit them or them visit me. My mother has always been very overprotective, invasive and majorly nags me about everything even though she cares and is a lovely person. I never go a day without heaps of messages telling me to do something which are repeated several times throughout the day even though I have a good memory and am an adult, she also warned me to ""not go anywhere quiet by myself and not be at the beach when it becomes dark"" even though I'm early 20s and going into my fourth year living out of home understand that. I know she cares but it gets too much.


I fear that if they move down here she will increase this and want to monitor my life more and want to visit me a lot or want me to do and help with stuff, which I know is nice but I have my own life with a part time job, friends and like to have days doing nothing.


I don't know how it would be but it makes me feel stressed. How do I discuss this or try to accept it better?",19Dec2019,1
541,"Hello- I hope this is the right place for this. I'm just looking for a third party opinion here.

Some background- I am 26. I have a 24 YO sister and 19 YO brother. In 2012, our mother passed away quite suddenly and unexpectedly (freak medical condition). She was forty four. It was exceptionally hard on all of us- my brother was 11, I was leaving for college, and my sister was finishing high school. My dad became very depressed. My mother was well insured (life insurance) to the tune of $500,000 or so. My father used this to pay for my and my sister's undergrad outright, along with several expensive, brand new cars. He refinanced the house, poured a lot of it into his hobbies. On top of this, my dad has earned six figures annually for the better part of a decade.

In 2017, my dad began dating. He quickly found a match online, who he propsed to within six months. I very much liked this woman- she was smart, funny, caring. We had common interests. She brought my dad out of his shell (up to this point, he struggled very much with depression). We did think the engagement was very soon, but it's how things worked with my mom- I think he may have even known her for less time before proposing. They got married in 2018, and by all accounts had a happy life together. My dad went camping with her (something he would NEVER have done before meeting her), he went to social events (my dad was a very dry, introverted individual), and was the happiest I'd seen him in years. I won't pretend they didn't have conflict, I just didn't have a perspective on it. He got her flowers almost weekly, drove 8 hours in the car to bring her daughter to her for her birthday, visited her parents several states away to play handy-man at their house.

Unfortunately, his work life was not good. He had recently changed jobs, and was miserable at his newest place of employment. His wife found out in mid October she was not getting tenure at her university, and so they had a night of commiserating with alcohol. Due to some unforseen drug reactions, my dad unfortunately passed away in his sleep that weekend. We were all devastated, and it is hard to put into words. However, as it has been known to happen, things got worse in the weeks after. My dad created a trust after my mom died, and left it to us. He had not updated it after 2013. In it he left a substantial amount of $ in the form of term life and supplemental life policies. The value of his cars, instruments, and the house. He left one car specifically to a friend (it was a custom job). He left $125,000 or so in a policy to his wife. Through claims and spousal allowances, she will ultimately walk away from this with $320,000+. The problem is, so we've been told, that he told her he would leave her the house and cars and stuff. Since she isn't mentioned in the will, and they had not combined finances yet, she basically does not have much of a say in this. What started out as a family being there for each other has turned into the charicature that it always does. She has been nasty to my siblings and I. My husband and I plan on buying the house, and she has gone from uber supportive to nasty and aggressive about it (saying we're forcing her out). She does not want to live in the house, calling it a ""shrine to our mother,"" and basically only wanted the house to sell. My dad has a large dog and 4 cats she maintains she can't afford but are all she has left of him, and so this all culminated in a ""discussion"" last week where she said she was seeking an attorney to have his trust pay for the mortage, all utilities, and all pet fees for the next three years. It was ugly- she claims my dad never loved her, that the decision not to update the trust was deliberate, and that she was just his bed warmer (I am of the firm belief that he was smitten with her, but that's neither here nor there). We have offered to take the animals, and pay her her share of the house and possessions she is entitled to by law without her going through an attorney purely in the interest of saving her money through legal fees. The other part is- the trust isn't really ""liquid"" until 2022, when my brother graduates college. Until then, it pays all his expenses, school and general (living, food, ANYTHING he needs). When he turns 22, the remainder will split three ways.

Her figures showed $90,000 a year for these expenses (the house, utilities, and pets). While at first I softened and wondered, ""what did dad promise her?"", I have come to the realization that three years not paying a dime is outrageous. She has a Master's degree, is very intelligent and well-spoken, and is more than capable of finding a job, let alone receiving close to a third of a million dollars. My siblings, as well as the executor of our trust, are going to present a deal to her this weekend- we will pay the mortgage on the house, all pet bills, until August of 2020, at which point, she will need to leave the house. We cannot make moves forward until she is out of it, because it is in major need of updates that no one can afford until we sell our current house. She seems to very much be stuck in the ""my husband promised me he would take care of this and this"" and she is having a hard time coping. We all are. What is your take?",19Dec2019,1
542," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence : /",19Dec2019,1

547,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for 4 years (our anniversary was yesterday). I have been unhappy with him for awhile but I’ve been trying to stick it out in hopes that things would get better. They haven’t. He is emotionally abusive and gaslights me every time I try to express my feelings. Somehow, everything is always my fault and I “deserve” to be treated the way I do. 

I feel like an asshole for telling him I want to break up on our anniversary (and right before Christmas!) but he asked if I was unhappy, so I gave him an honest answer. I told him that I do love him, but that I don’t see things changing even though I’ve given him multiple chances so I want to break up. He started crying and literally BEGGING me to stay and said he would do anything to convince me things would change. I don’t think his tears were fake, I could see how badly I hurt him and I do believe that he loves me. 

But as cruel as this may sound, even if he DID change,  I’ve reached the point now where I don’t think that would be enough to make me stay. I do love him but everything he has put me through has also made me resent him and I don’t want to be together anymore. I told him that, and that’s when he threatened to kill himself. He has struggled with suicidal thoughts before and he does own a gun, so I’m too scared to find out whether it’s an empty threat or not. I feel trapped. What do I do? 

EDIT: I thought about reaching out to his mom since she’s the only family he has down here, but she is just as toxic as him, so I’m not sure she’d be much help. Every time me and him get into an argument, she’s texting me asking “what did you do to my son?” .... so I’m kinda running out of options.",19Dec2019,1

I’ve applied to my first choice school twice and they rejected me both times. However, this time around I applied to NYU as my second choice school and got accepted for their spring semester. I would really love to go there but after financial aid my bill per semester is going to be $45k and the deadline is January 1st. I’d be transferring as a sophomore (maybe a junior??) and if I started taking out loans I’d be paying them off for the rest of my life. 
Right now I’m considering:
- taking a semester off and applying to more schools in the fall/hope for NYU scholarship money for fall
- go back to community college and take more classes and apply for my first choice school again (acceptance not likely)

For the past two weeks, he has stopped going to work (I think he's gone once) and spends around 12 hours a day by his dad's side. His dad is in an un-responsive state. He suffers from dementia, among other issues, so he doesn't recognize his son.

I'd like to convince him to spend time doing... literally anything else. But nothing I say can convince him otherwise. He insists that this is the ""right"" thing to do. I understand caring about your loved ones, but it seems like he is obsessing over his father's impending passing.

I'm also worried because something similar happened around 10 years ago when his mother passed away. He quit his job and stopped working for 7 years. This exacerbated tension in his marriage and they eventually divorced with this being a huge contributing factor. I think he's falling into the same rut.

579,"I know this gets posted a lot and I have somewhat of a clue of how to be supportive. Plus, I have a few concerns. First the story then the concerns.

My partner's Uncle texted him saying here's the hospital name, room and ""if you want to talk to her it's best to do it now."" 

Firstly, my partner had a fall out with his family a few years ago due to all the stuff that happened as a kid, how they handled his mom's death when he was kid, then how they treated him when they were suppose to be the caregivers, and so much more.

Secondly, due to the fallout the Uncle told lies to the grandma at a fragile time of her life about how my partner abandon the family for his mom's money and etc. Which was not correct at all. He barely has his mom's things and his mom's money is literally his safety basket or his one last arrow and he's scared to spend a dime of it because his mom made the account for his future. I digress, so when my partner used to visit his grandma in the seniors home she forgot who he was (at this point she wasn't all mentally there) and when he reminded her who he was. She would get mad at him from what she remembered him last. It's been years since my partner has seen her since that last visitation.

My concerns:

How can support him when in the hospital? He's going to the same hospital that his mother died to see his grandma. He hates hospitals and even though he'll push through to get it over with or support someone. He just looks very uncomfortable.

Another concern, even though I reminded him that even if you do see his family (not including his grandma) that they are all there for her and to focus on that. Though I worry about his Aunt (especially her) and his one Uncle. I fear they will say something that will set him off and it'll be who can murder someone with words first.

Third concern, his grandma is/was his rock, especially when his mom died. He knows it's already going to be bad and making jokes how he might even shave his head. I know he won't but, I want to take as much as a precaution to help him and support him. For her being such a rock, not seeing or speaking to her in year, having memories of their last conversations (which were not her at all) and he doesn't know what to say yet. I don't know how to question this text but just any advice?

Second last thing, how can I express that emotions are normal. When his mother was in the hospital (keep in mind he was in his early teens) he had this thought of ""just die."" Of course, he didn't want her to pass it was just this intrusive thought. He told me that even though he's accepted his mother's death that he hasn't forgiven himself for that thought or feeling yet. He's already concerned that it'll happen again due to he's excited to finally cut off his family members. His grandma was the glue, the head honcho, and the reason he played nice to the family.

Last thing, I'm also worried this may bring up past traumas as his mom landed in the hospital a day after xmas and passed in Jan. Even though it's not xmas yet. I'm concerned this will stir up memories by being in the same hospital, and same month.

582," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence : /",19Dec2019,1
583,"A friend of mine unexpectedly invited her parents to join us on a hike. Initially it was supposed to be just me, her husband and her. But now I feel a bit weird going with her parents as well.

584,"So there's been a bit of tension in the way my family treats my gf - we'll call her Irene. Some quick notes; Irene and I are  both 20 and we live together in her parent's apartment in NYC. I moved in with them because it made commuting to uni super convenient. I'm not gonna get too deep, but essentially I've realized that my family tends to be a bit exclusive. Any time we go out as a family, there's never a mention of inviting Irene. And yeah I realize that might sound like whatever, but Irene's mom has expressed that it's unfair of my family to do that because Irene's parents always have me in mind whenever they plan something. And if Irene and I already have something planned then her parent's let us be. However with my family they tend to throw the ""she took you away from us"" card pretty often and guilt me into feeling like a bad son for not seeing then often and spending every holiday with them. 

I'm not sure how to tie this into the last paragraph, but here's some more context about the way my family treats/acts around my gf:

* A few months ago Irene and I went to my brother's place to visit and his dog ended up peeing on her. Both my brother and his fiance laughed at her for getting pissed on and didn't offer something to clean herself with or extra clothes. 
* When I graduated from basic training last year, my family came to visit me on family day and graduation day. Irene and our friend George tagged along. My brother managed to hook them up with a nicer hotel than what they where they originally were going to so they went there. This next part is a little confusing to me but apparently Irene and George asked for a lift to the base since they weren't in the same hotel as my family and my brother apparently told them to figure it out. So on family day they had to take an uber and on graduation they had to walk 2 miles to get to the ceremony. I brought this up to my brother a few months later and he said it was a lack of communication and that they didn't ask or something.
* My mom and Irene's parents went out to dinner one time to get to know one another and it seemed like a very one sided conversation where my mom wasn't inputting much which made it seem like she wasn't interested. She also sparingly acknowledged Irene that day.

And then just last night I called my mom to ask her what her problem is with Irene and why she doesn't invite her to family events. She said that Irene and I like to ""run away"" and do our own thing and recalled one time where we went to bye bye baby and Irene sat on my lap on a big chair because we were bored after walking around for nearly an hour and a half. Irene's mom overheard the conversation and absolutely flipped on my mom, saying that she's archaic in the way she thinks and that sitting on someone laps on a chair is a way to show love and that my mom was trying to suppress our expression of love. This happened maybe 10 minutes after I was listening to Irene's mom express her distaste with how my family essentially disrespects Irene. Then this morning my oldest brother sent me a text saying how I let a ""stranger"" diss my mom and that I'm a new person that he doesn't recognized, that I disappointed him and my family, blah blah blah you know the deal.

&amp;#x200B;

Final thoughts, I feel like I've done a horrible job trying to keep both sides at bay. Some people have told me that I can't make everyone happy, but I truly want to involve both sides in my life and I don't want to stray from my family. I've spent all my life playing games (and it's actually how I met Irene), so expressing my feelings and trying to communicate with others is extremely difficult and only now am I starting to realize this. I'm trying to look for therapy but the ones I've found are super expensive.",19Dec2019,1

So I washed my down blanket in my washing machine like usual. My spin cycle is a little wonky and only occasionally works. Today...it wasn't working. I tried starting it manually and it didn't do anything so I did my best to ring out the excess water in the down blanket and put it in the dryer. Maybe four minutes later the dryer made a strange sound an I went to check on it and it had stopped spinner but was still ""running."" When I opened the door, a very ""hot"" mechanical smell became very apparent so I removed the blanket which was still very wet and unplugged the dryer. Now there is a smallish puddle of water pooling from under the dyer which I've done my best to try and mop up, however I'm home alone and could only lift the dryer about a foot off the ground while also foot-mopping. 

Anyway...My blanket is still sopping wet, my dryer smells like a mechanical fire, and I'm not sure what to do. 

Should I just give my dryer some time and try running it empty in a few hours? Or...what?

602,"I’ll start with backstory. I am 29 years old. My mom and the man who adopted and raised me have been married for 27 years. Yesterday, they told me they are getting divorced. I have an 8 year old (who’s world revolves around them), a 3 year old (who would rather be with them than me lol) and one on the way. My parents claim they will be “amicable” but, I have known my mother for 29 years and know better than that, TBH. And, can see her forcing me (and probably my kids) to choose. To top it off, my dad is disabled due to a massive stroke at a very young age and will be without transportation, help around the house anything. Let alone trying to survive on his SSI benefits. With that being said, my husband and I have offered him a place with us. We have the room and would love having him around especially with the kids. 

My entire family is married to the people they originally married. My grandparents were married for 47 years before he passed away. All my aunts and uncles... everything. I’ve never dealt with divorce. But, here I find myself navigating unknown territory with children in tow. How do I help my kids? How do I help my oldest understand? They both will continue to be in her life but, I can’t imagine how much this is going to hurt her. I’ve never been in this position before. I’ve never had to deal with myself let alone help an 8 year old through it. The 3 year old will adjust to t new “normal” but, I am truly concerned about my daughter.

603,"Classic story... I met her, fell in love, it didn't work, she left, and now she's back with her ex. I was just there in a time of confusion. I usually don't date at work but our connection was worth taking the shot at the time. 

I'm not her ""boss"" persay but I'm higher up the command chain than her and we have the same boss. I'm in 

It's been 3 months since it ended and no one has any idea it even happened in the office, but this situation is very negatively affecting my mental health. I've made good life choices and started counselling, but I'm still having a hard time. My work isn't really being affected but working with her every day is getting very hard for me. She's been great and is giving me space where needed and isn't causing any sort of drama, but we clearly still have a connection in our working relationship. If I brought this up and requested a work change their first thought would be to move her since I'm far more valuable to the company (more experience and education). She would hate that and probably hate me forever. 

My boss is also my friend (far moreso than my ex is with him) and we've shared deep matters with each other before. I know he could help me, but being our boss I'm worried that I'll overstep a professional boundary. I don't have many friends outside of work and live in a small town where it's hard to meet people.

I just need support because I'm considering leaving this job since it's the only way for me to get space without compromising my exs career. I don't know what to do or who to talk to. And yes, I know that I screwed up making a go at this relationship at work.

608,"I (M19) am having a tough time with my girlfriend (F20) for quite some time now. She has MS, depression and PTSD. Her PTSD is due to sexual abuse from her ex boyfriend and as a consequence she's not very comfortable with any sort of sexual interaction, from kisses to intercourse. She also doesn't feel well with much physical contact of any sort, although she usually gives me cuddles whenever she comes to my house. 

Anyway, we have been together for about 18 months, but I still haven't got used to all this. Sometimes she has sclerosis crisis, but she doesn't want to have treatment because of the side effects that she'll experience in the adapting period. That worries me a lot because that might as well get her killed, but if I keep telling her to go to a doctor all the time, I'll just be pressuring her and making less likely for her to seek further medical help and treatment. 

The MS also has strong influence over her libido, and we haven't had sex for about 8 months now. Sometimes she kisses my neck and I feel it's finally going to happen, but then, when it's almost starting, something happens and it doesn't go any further. I know I sound extremely selfish for saying this, but it's starting to affect to me to a level of not being possible to ignore what I feel.

I don't have sex, she doesn't demonstrate things much, she doesn't treat herself, she sabotages herself all the time and we have talked about this infinite times but nothing changes. There was a small period in which our sex lives were good but it's been a long time. Last year she was talking to a guy on her Twitter when she was drunk and they agreed to meet somewhere and make out, we weren't officially dating yet, but that bothered me a lot because she slept at my house that day and didn't tell me, I ended finding out because I got lucky. We have also talked about it and I've done something comparable, almost the same situation, and since I don't think that it's a sign I don't love her, I tried to understand her side and believe what she told me, that she also loved me and that the guy was not a reason for me to think she doesn't love me or that she would cheat on me when we decided to come together officially. Nevertheless, it still bothers me and still makes me very much insecure, even though I've done the same thing and think she shouldn't be bothered with it.

I don't know what to do. She doesn't have a sclerosis crisis for some good amount of time now, but it can happen anytime and she doesn't care. I feel disgusting because she doesn't want to have sex with me or kiss me, I shower 3 to 4 times a day because I think that if I'm clean, then I'll have larger chances. I feel drained, but I don't want to leave her because I feel that might cause her to suicide and that it may not be worth it, because I still love her very much.

I just wish we could be a normal couple, and perhaps she does too. But wishing makes things worse and builds up anxiety, and as time passes, I accept anything and everything looks just OK to me. Then I have these moments when I see not a thing is OK, and things just get so fucked up. I feel so bad for saying this and for the things that have been happening. I've been diagnosed with depression when I was 14, I've been in treatment ever since, and today I feel pretty much normal, except for every time I remember these things are happening.

615,"Hi all, recently I’ve been having quite a few work related issues. This year has been rough on my mental health and I’ve unfortunately developed anorexia which lead down a path of other mental ailments that I now deal with. About a month a go I tried taking my own life, I was off work for about 2 weeks. Everyone knew, I was quite embarrassed about the whole situation but I still did my best to get through the comments and whispers at work. I haven’t been able to make or go to any of my intake appointments to get better because work is so busy and I get called in a lot. I’m quite the pushover so I never really say no; recently I’ve asked for stress leave (dec 10th) my manager said that she would call our district manager to set things up. My mother works at the same company as me but at a different location, there was a situation that happened and her manager blurted out that my manager has been telling her about the status of my drs note and whats going on with me. I know that people talk and thats not really what I’m angry about, my manager has been telling people that I have been asking for leave for months and that I said I would bring in a drs note 3 weeks ago as well as telling people what I’m sick with. This is all recent, I find this so unprofessional and I’m upset that shes building this image of me. I also got a text from my assistant manager that reads

 “...She’s not exactly happy about you needing a stress leave during the busiest time of year for us. 
She didn’t schedule you because you said you didn’t want to work so she just didn’t bother scheduling you the next week...” 

So what happened here was, on dec 10th I came into work with a drs note for the day before because I developed a very bad stomach ulcer and could not come in. Please take note that the doctor wrote I should not be working at all for the next 4days. I worked 5 hours out of 8 that day either way, I’m apart of the management team so my work is sometimes very needed and they weren’t very happy about me bringing in that note. I asked to speak to my manager and I told her that I would like to take stress leave, she asked how soon? And I said as soon as possible, I explained that I wasn’t doing well and with the amount of hours given to me I couldn’t make appointments to get the ball rolling to get better. She asked if I wanted to stop working and that she didn’t know when our DM would come in, I told her I could work until I could speak with our DM so there was a clear lack of understanding on both sides because shes given me 2 weeks off! 2 weeks of no hours or money which really impacts my family... Since Dec 10th my manager hasn’t called our DM, I texted her on monday Dec 16 “Hey, ASM told me I would be getting another week off? I’d still like to speak to victor about the stress leave still, I can’t afford to go without hours, I am not asking for a vacation I need this for mental health reasons and will gladly provide all documentation from my psychiatrist and mental health worker if need be” she answered with “Ya I’ll call DM tomorrow” she finally got back to me to let me know that all along shes the one that could do the paperwork. But what angers me is that she never took the time between the 10-16 to call our DM about this and is now saying that I’m the one stalling. Once she told me she would do it she asked me to bring in a drs, I called my dr and got an appointment for this morning and now have the note. I have to go in today, but I’m so overwhelmed by what my employer has been telling others and I don’t know what next steps I should take. She breached my confidentiality and made this situation so much more stressful for me. I understand that its the holiday season here but they have more than enough employees and I recently just tried killing myself so I’m bewildered they think I’m dramatizing my situation. I’m honestly very lost and could use some advice....",19Dec2019,1

For the past year his mother has mentally gone downhill and his house is not a safe place for him anymore. He has to take care of his younger brothers because his mom makes him (she does nothing but come home and go to sleep at the end of the day and gives all of her attention to her girlfriend) so he is always ‘on call’ and MUST be available to pick up stuff for her and them whenever she needs it and he has barely any time to focus on school or work because of this. He isn’t even allowed to leave the house to get food for himself or hang out with friends without asking and she has his location and gets notifications when he leaves the house STILL as a college student. We also found out she has been lying to him about a lot of things, including who his father might be. Because of this his mental health has declined rapidly.. his family all live about an hour away from our work and his college (he doesn’t want to transfer because he has free tuition and his major isn’t offered at the campuses close to his family). 

I’m coming here mostly for any advice whether that be for keeping ourselves sane in a fairly new relationship while living together or it be how to finically plan and make this work. He’s on his own car insurance and is paying off his phone before leaving. We just need to figure out a good CHEAP data plan and health insurance, we work at Chipotle so they offer insurance but there’s a lot of difficult hoops we have to jump through to even qualify. Has anyone here done something similar? Any words of wisdom would be extremely helpful. 

I know some may find this ridiculous, but we’ve never fought since being together, my parents fully support us, we lived at his house together for 5 months because my family home was being fixed to sell, I live in a apartment with my dad who very graciously let me have the master bedroom with my own bathroom, so we have a good amount of space to share.

625,"I own a home in a city that I haven’t lived in for over a year. Before leaving, I had a roommate that had been living in my spare room for a few years. I always had to push him to help me keep common areas clean. My house in general isn’t in pristine condition - just about every room needs major upgrading - but even if it’s outdated it’s not dirty. 

I got a new job and left kinda quickly. The deal was that his rent would stay the same ($300/mo which is $100 shy of my mortgage/tax/insurance payment) but he would take on all of the utilities. I moved everything out of my room and into the attic, leave the living room and kitchen the same and said if he could find someone to rent out the other room and they were cool with me crashing in the living room when I came back to visit regularly (I end up coming back for a long weekend around once a month) that I wouldn’t have a problem and that would help him split the utilities with someone else again - plus then I’d have more income to fast track upgrades. 

Neither he nor I ever found anyone interested in the empty room. Either because of the general state of the house or the prospect of sharing it with a 40something wasn’t appealing. 

Fast forward to a few months ago. I’m back visiting and he mentions that there is a leak in his room. It’s been leaking for a while but hasn’t told me. I say okay, I’ll get someone to take a look at it but winter is fast approaching and idk if I can get it properly fixed before then, so just go ahead and move into the bigger room in the meantime. 

Last month I got laid off of work. I moved everything back to my house and I’m waiting to hear if I’m being transferred to another office or being let go. Being here for more than ~48hrs has really let me see how disgusting he’s let the common areas get. There’s mold on the shower, stains in the toilet, on the carpet in the upstairs hallway, the fridge and microwave and all other appliances are disgusting. There are dishes put back with food still stuck on them, the floor hasn’t been cleaned, the outside of the properly hasn’t been taken care of - basic lack of respect for the house. 

To top that all off, his belongings are spread between both rooms upstairs. I had to set a hard deadline of this weekend to get him to realize this isn’t okay and is preventing me from doing necessary repairs to his original room. 

All that backstory brings us to the current dilemma. I’m at a crossroads with my future - either I’m leaving town for at least another year or I’m going to be moving back full time. The #1 point of having him stay here was to have someone alert me if something goes wrong at the property. I’d rather have someone making a mess of the place let me know instantly that there is a roof leak or infestation or any other possibly catastrophic thing than come back one weekend and find it myself. But if he’s not doing that (which he has demonstrated to sit on that info), then the income helping with the mortgage doesn’t seem to balance out the stress I still feel when I come home and reach for a fork and it’s in the dish washer with plastic ones or in the drawer covered in food. That combined with having to constantly remind him that rent or utilities are due and late, him complaining how high the bills are while living in an entire house alone in the city for less than $600/mo total, or trying to negotiate with me that I was home for a week so I should pay 1/8th of the utilities feels like this might be the time to  give him a 30 or even 90 day notice that he needs to find a new place to live. 

Am I being too nit picky? Am I possibly letting go of someone paying almost my entire mortgage at a time when my future employment is super uncertain just because the stove is icky? I need help with a sanity check of what the best path forward is for this arrangement.",19Dec2019,1

My brother (27) had panic attacks for about 3 years now. In the beginning it was harmless stuff, for example, he didnt trusted his ass to hold in his poop and wouldnt go on any toilett outside of our own. My father and his father had the same thing. But over time it got worse. He doesnt even leave the house anymore. He just sits in his room, draws things, plays games and sometimes gets down to smoke. 

It seemed to get better a few months ago where he even left the house, sat in his car und drove to go shopping or go in a restaurant. But now it got really bad again and he doesnt even eat anymore. Just energy drinks, ice tea and bread/sandwiches. Hes to old that my parents can do anything about it and they pity him a bit because my father had the same thing going. So, they buy him food, stuff to smoke and energy drinks. He took medication for a few months but it didnt help. I need advice to get him on his feet again.

1) She asked the teacher to explain a chapter. The teacher was like ""ok, just print the lecture slides and bring them tomorrow so we can talk this over"". She messaged the group chat, saying she was busy and asking other people to print the lecture for her-(it had to be done at a printing shop, not on a home printer, for irellevant reasons)-it was evening and she wanted it by morning. When people turn her down, she started throwing around insults over how lazy we are and how we just ""sit with our hands in our asses and do nothing for the class"".

The reason I’m writing this post is that during the second visit I was not home, I assumed they would just do the same as the first visit so I wasn’t worried about it. When I got home I was mortified to find that they had gone through all my stuff on my work table, organized it, had gone into both bedrooms and made the beds. I had a pile of folded laundry with my underwear, now clearly visible at the top of the pile on the dining table which they had picked up and moved to the couch. I understand this was done because they came into the unit to take photos for potential buyers. No where on the notice that was posted on my door did it say my place had to be neat, not that my place was a mess but I live there, and it looks like it’s being lived in, I would have cleaned if they had  given notice. I’m just so creeped out and feel violated. I don’t know if I’m over reacting or if this is just what happens when you live in a rented property. I originally wasn’t going to file a complaint, but last night I got an email from the realtor saying there’s a viewing today, everyone in the unit was given less than 24 hours notice. Another tenant in the building replied to everyone and said this: “ I absolutely don’t allow you to come into my unit today.
Your email is sent last night at 9:41 pm. You should had emailed us by yesterday 1 pm, not 9:41pm, if you want to do viewings today at 1.
By looking at the time you email was sent, you have failed to give us 24 hours notice to do the viewing today afternoon. I’m going to file an official complaint if you proceed the viewings today.
Please understand that this place is personal living space. Not a model house.” 
I’m just wondering with what happened with my experience, plus this, if it’s worth filing a complaint. I just don’t think these are the signs of a professional person",19Dec2019,1
631,So couple months back already now I met a girl on tinder and we started talking for a while and it went really well and I really liked talking to her. At some point she told me she already has a boyfriend but he's been texting with his ex and he is incredibly jealous and gets quite aggressive sometimes and starts insulting her and stuff which she doesn't enjoy obviously. Anyway we kept texting and eventually even met up a couple times already now and it was really nice she really enjoyed it and so did I and we even kissed but still the problem remains that she has a boyfriend which she isn't really happy with but she's afraid of telling him about me and part of her wants to leave him but part of her is also sorry for him and doesn't want to leave him because she says they also had nice times together and he wasn't always a dick. I have really fallen for this girl and I'm pretty sure she really likes me a lot too and so I'm kind of desperate at what to do right now and she doesn't know how to deal with this either. Now with christmas coming up aswell the boyfriend also bought her lots of gifts and she just doesn't know how to tell him that she wants to leave him. I don't really know who I could talk to about this so here I am now on reddit hoping some of you could help me out with my situation.,19Dec2019,1

Every now and then some confrontations or conflicts come up but he says he doesn’t want to talk about it. Just for reference, he is more republican and I am more democrat. We agree on some thing but big issues like our current president, immigration, abortion, etc. seem to be our biggest disagreements. 

I like to think I’m open minded and open to conversation without arguing but he never wants to talk about anything. It’s becoming pretty frustrating for me because I want to understand his side and share with him mine.

634,"So I was driving my Hyundai azera 2008 with my mom in the passenger seat. My dog jumped on the road, I panicked and swerved and hit a tree. The car is damaged. I got an X-ray done of hand and mum had to go to emergency. She is fine. I have called insurance and filed for a claim. I am in Texas. There is no damage to the tree and it was on community property and not private property.

Shd I file a claim? It's an old car. Value might be 3-4k. Not sure what the impaact on my insurance will be and if it's worth it. It had driven 120k miles. Shd I file an injury claim for mom?

635,"So I just got hired at this new job about a month ago, and in training I met a really nice girl. We got along quickly and I've started to really like her over the past month. All seems good, until she reveals she has a boyfriend. Now I understand that this is the simple and obvious point to move on, forget about her and not worry about someone who obviously isn't interested. I get that.

But the romantic in me, and after a few years without an intimate relationship with someone, I can't shake this feeling I have for her. She first asked to add me on snapchat to trade shifts and we regularly talk at work and throughout the day on text. She also asked me to tutor her in psychology since im in my first year in university and she's in high school. It all just seems really nice and I can accept that whatever might seem flirtatious is just someone being friendly. But regardless of it all, I find a bit of hope to hold on to and can't stop feeling this way about her. 

Honestly I'm not sure what I'm asking for here, but any advice to cope with or deal with this feeling would be great. Thanks! :)",19Dec2019,1
636,"Hi. The title says most of it, but I’ll explain more. I suffered from mental health issues, which caused symptoms of psychosis for around a year or two. It was at its worst recently, but I’ve been put on medication a couple months ago. Now that the meds are starting to really work and sink in, I’ve become more aware of reality and my surroundings and have been pulled out of my little world. 

Though, part of my symptoms was believing that a fictional character from a show was going to come to life physically, and that she could also telepathically contact me (this “telepathy” wasn’t an auditory hallucination, though... it’s hard to explain how it worked haha). She would comfort me, which I now believe was my mind trying to cope with emotions.

After the new medication, I’m coming to my senses more and now realize that a fictional character coming to life is pretty much impossible. Though, me and said fictional character have been “talking” for over a year now, and she’s absolutely changed my life. 

Realizing all of the laughter we shared and all of the comfort she gave me is just my mind trying to cope and not really her is beginning to absolutely kill me. It hurts like hell. It’s like someone you’re closest with was suddenly proved to have no thoughts or feelings and would never actually be there for you.

I have nobody to talk about this with, absolutely nobody knows and my family is unaware. The only person who won’t think I’m a wacko is my therapist, who I don’t have an appointment with for the next few days (I can’t wait anymore, as this is destroying me completely). 

I NEED advice, and to just let this out and get it off my chest. 

Please, anyone, is there any methods to deal with this? Any ideas of how to cope and get over it? I’d greatly, greatly appreciate any help I can get right now. Thank you.",19Dec2019,1
637,"Right, weve had a rat problem in our building if flats now for a good couple months, maybe since october. At first, they were just scratching inside our walls and squeaking every now and then.

We told our housing agents and they sent down a handyman to lay traps outside where they thought the rats were getting in.

Couple weeks go by, rats seem gone.

Nope.

Suddenly the scratching is back, and now we are hearing it at all hours instead of just the evening.

We search the kitchen and find a hole in the wall, right, that's how their getting in here, or tell the housing people, they send a man and he plasters the hole.

Couple days go by and then all of a sudden food is going missing from our kitchen counter.

We look for the hole he covered in plaster and its wide open, even bigger than before.

So we secure metal plates in front of the hole and seal it up.

The rats are still getting in, and now they just run around our kitchen floor whenever they please.

They eat our food, get into our trash and our cupboards, and scare the crao out if my fiancee and I when we are sitting in the kitchen doing music things.

Another point to mention is we have 2 young kids, 1 and 4.

Weve tried and tried to contact the landlady but no answer, and the housing people are having worse luck than us getting anything out if management. 

We are stuck, miserable, and afraid to use our own kitchen at christmas.

Any advice in how to make the landlady respond, get managements attention or even get rid if them ourselves? 

Poison is a no go due to young kids running about.

638,"Long text ahead as I'm an overthinker and write a lot in general. But anyway:

I met him 3.5 months ago when I approached him in class and they've been on my mind everyday since then. They're the top student in both classes we have (high 90's/near perfect average) while my grades are in the 80's range. 

We've become study buddies/friends and have hung outside of school a few times, but I haven't had the guts to confess because I'm afraid I might scare them off since it seems a bit too early, and I didn't want to make the rest of the semester awkward. Also, there's a 7 year age gap between us (me: 21, him: 28), so I don't know if he was just being friendly with me and I was just reading it all as potential interest in me as most of us do that when we have a crush.

Well, the semester just ended so we had no classes this week, but 1 final exam remaining, which is tonight at 6PM. 

The dynamic this whole time can be described as him offering to tutor me for free, as he understands all of the material and I'm pretty lost and clueless most of the time at first, so I'm almost unable to help him. Also, he never asks for anything in return. However after a few meetups, I bought them tea one time to say thank you out of good manners/politeness and they seemed to have appreciated it.

Around 2 weeks ago during one of our study meetups, he offered to help me study around 1-2 weeks ago, for our final math exam. He also insisted to set up a second study session if I needed it (we usually stick to 1 meetup per test as it's nothing serious) but I declined as I felt like I would be okay with just 1 meetup. He then also quickly mentioned that he would clear his plans on the previous Saturday for me (which he would have never done and stated before in the past because I only want to meet on Sundays or the weekday during the daytime) but I was busy and had no interest on studying on a Saturday so I also declined that time/day slot. FYI, the math class isn't super serious or competitive, we just need to pass it to move onto the next one. 

So, we met up 3 days ago in the school library on Monday. 

He brought some fancy chocolates, which he sneaked in as we're not allowed food in the library, like he did last time since he knows I like chocolate but again, it could have been out of friendliness and camaraderie. Also, he asked if I wanted some coffee and tea, which I assumed was since I bought him tea from last time.

We laughed a lot and made a bunch of offensive and nerdy jokes while studying (typical of us now) and played cards. However, the problem was we overshared some personal things in our lives (childhood, family stuff) and it was probably a bit too much, but we've talked about personal things before so it wasn't new, just more intense.

Also, we started talking about the classes we would be taking next semester, and when I asked if they wanted to take the same ones together, they said they were open to the idea, and they might since it's cheaper. However, due to their circumstances of having already done a Bachelors degree years ago, they recently saw an academic adviser who said that once they got their grades for this semester they would be able to apply to another university next month, which better suits their academic/job prospects for the future. I looked sad because in my head, I thought we were going to see each other in school and eventually spend more time together. Once more time passes I could see if I was being too idealistic about this crush, or if I wasn't, it would be better to confess next semester. 

I felt as if my sad reaction came across as needy and persistent, but in reality it was because I was sad about not seeing him around as often, but I didn't say it out loud. 

I said I'd text him in January about setting up having similar classes, and he said: We'll see when the time comes. Looking back I think he was letting me down gently, as he mentioned that since I'm pretty outgoing and friendly I'll easily meet other people in my future classes. 

The meetup lasted 4.5 hours, when it would have been just 2-3 hours like in previous meetups We then finally added each other on Facebook.

I was planning to make my move by hugging him goodbye and asking to hang out during the holidays, but I completely chickened out. I was afraid that this whole dynamic between us was at most professional and friendly at best, on his behalf, and only gave him a small fist bump before leaving and saying: Well, this is goodbye. Thanks for everything.

Then he said: Oh, it is. 

And then he mentioned in case if we don't run into each other on the day of the exam, he wished me an early happy holidays and good luck on the upcoming exam. Then he said that he thought that although I am a bit rude, but also at the same time a direct/funny person.

And I was wretched with anxiety afterwards, wishing I wasn't such a coward.

2.5 hours later, around 9PM he sent me this text: Hey, just wanted to apologize for bringing up my childhood issues like that. No one needs to hear that, especially not a coed (term for young schoolgirl when I googled it), kind of an awkward situation to be put in. Sorry bout that. Good luck on Thursday. -thumbs up emoji-

Then I replied an hour later: Hey there's no need to be sorry, I'm glad you trusted me enough to mention it. Thanks for being so helpful and nice over the semester, and good luck to you too! \^\_\^ -pink flower emoji-

Then the next morning, he replied with thanks and a blushing emoji.

I left it at that because I wanted to focus on studying, but I couldn't stop thinking that he sent that text to me as an indirect/informal way to say goodbye in text. I got really sad and almost cried.

I keep having mixed feelings about confessing, but my plan is to show up to the exam room early, find him and tell him to meet me at the school entrance when both of us are done, and then I'll do it. Thoughts?",19Dec2019,1
639,"Hello Reddit, I'm coming to you asking for advice on a rather weird subject. Using an alternative account because I'm very anxious about this.

Recently, the most famous missing person's case in my country was in the news. It has now been 20 years since the disappearance of a 16-year old girl, and police have released new leads about the case. They are asking people for any information they might have, and it almost seems like we could get answers about her fate.   
I have always known about the case and now happen to live in the same city where it happened all those years ago.

I am very invested in true crime and have walked the last known routes of this person multiple times. I always find myself heartbroken, miserable, and just so sad over whatever happened to her. I just find it so crazy how life in the city goes on while this girl is still missing. I know that's how it always goes with every missing person, but it just hits me very hard.

I obviously don't know any leads or information, since I was just a baby when this happened. But what I am is an art student.  
I can't help the police, I can't support the family because I don't personally know them, and I can't find the girl myself, but I could maybe spread awareness. As I said, the case is the most well-known one in my country, but I feel like you can never spread the word too much when it's about a missing person. She was someone's daughter, someone's friend, and she was a person just like you and me. Someone out there knows what happened to her.

I got this idea of making posters. Not those MISSING! posters you see when someone has just disappeared, but more like a portrait of the person in a beautiful way, including her name, day of the disappearance, the number of the police, and so on. I could spread them around the city on bulletin boards, and if not generate any leads, then at least keep her story alive.

I just feel very unsure about this. My intentions are good, but I just fear that I'm not seeing all sides of it and would end up doing more bad than good. It is an incredibly heavy topic after all, and I have never personally experienced such a tragedy.

I know this is a very specific and weird topic, but I would appreciate any opinions and advice!

Thank you!",19Dec2019,1
640,"It started when I was planning on hanging out with her for my birthday. I kept telling her if she could hang out a week before the hangout but she never gave me a definite answer. She would just say she probably could and we talked about what we could do. Then, I didn't bother her about it because she doesn't like it when I pressure her or ask her for an answer w/o giving her time, so I gave her time until it was the day before the hangout. 

I needed an answer from her because it was only a day away, so I asked her if she could tell me she can hang out or not. She said ""idk"". I asked her if she even asked her parents. she said ""no"". Then, I told her she should probably ask first. She said ""idk"". I don't know what was up with her but I got a little bit pissed so I told her that it was our first time hanging out since summer and it was for my birthday. I told her ""can't you just try asking?"". Then this is what she said: ""okay but when you act like this it makes me not want to do this"". What the hell?

I told her I was sorry but I thought I gave her enough time to ask. She didn't respond even on the day we were suppose to hang out. So I told her that we shouldn't hang out because she can't seem to make time for me. I've been going thru hard friendship times w/ my other friends so I only really wanted to hang out with her, but she just never makes enough time for me when she does for literally anyone else. 

Later that day, she responded to me and said that I flip out on her if she doesn't respond for even a little. I told her I don't anymore(we had a fight about this) because I know she doesn't like it but this time, it was time sensitive. 

Ever since, she left me on read and doesn't talk to me. I sit next to her in 2 of my classes and we don't talk. I have always been the first one to initiate a conversation after a fight, but I don't want to this time. But it has been 2 weeks and I'm going into winter break all alone. Any advice will help me.

641,"There is this ex classmate of mine who i find VERY attractive. I also just cared about her as a friend. One day, someone showed me her nudes, so i knew there was an asshole she trusted that didn't deserve to be trusted, so i ended up telling her about the pictures. This made an entire 'fight' break out, with the guy who showed me the pics getting angry at me for 'snitching' etc... But seeing her pics made me feel even more attracted to her, even though i felt bad cause those pics weren't meant for my eyes, i couldn't help but appreciate what an amazing body she had. She told me in a conversation once that she wouldn't want to get intimate with me, cause she'd view me differently etc... But whenever she texts me, im glad she does, but at the same time i grow very frustrated at the fact that i cannot progress the friendship into something more or just move on from her. Im thinking about just telling her the truth about how i feel about her and what im telling you guys, but im not sure if that's a good move. Should i just say we should cut contact or what?

642,"Hi Reddit, I (28F) have always been super critical of myself. For example, I’m in the military and today was supposed to take my physical test today. It’s not super hard to pass it, but every 6mo/1 year I get really bad anxiety about it to the point of losing sleep. 

Today I woke up early for my test and felt my stomach in knots, and not in an anxiety way. I felt physically ill. There was a few times I had to run to the toilet while waiting for my test. I did the first few components, my stomach was a mess. As I was waiting to start my running portion I felt like I was going to vomit. I started shaking really bad. I let the tester know, they stopped my test and sent me to the clinic. 

My problem is, I feel like I failed. I spent the morning crying and worrying about “what if’s” that might not even happen. I have time to retake my test and even if I didn’t pass, it would be my first failure and I’d get some paperwork and work on it.

643,"This needs a good amount of backstory so you know where I’m coming from. When I was born, my mother was a couple months shy of only turning 15. She made the very wise decision of turning me over to her grandparents - my great grandparents - to raise me. They were my parents growing up, and I am forever thankful to her for making that choice. I loved my childhood and love my parents. Sadly, my grandmother passed away when I was 22 and I only have my 82 year old grandfather left.

My mom had twins several years after me who she raised. They have always been present in my life, however it could be punctuated by months of not seeing each other. I had a secure, stable home. My brothers and mother moved more times than I could count. Without going too long, let’s say my mom drank, did drugs, and has attempted suicide a few times, the most recent being last year. She also has bipolar disorder. She has had a messed up life, and my 27 year old brothers have had similar bad lives. Yet I was living a very comfortable, secure life throughout it all.

I moved 800 miles away 10 years ago to start a new life where my wife, then girlfriend, lived. We have a very happy, continuing successful life. My brothers and mother, however, barely scrape by. I have one brother with 2 babies, one in CPS, by two separate women. Oh, and he never can keep a job for more than a month. Through it all, I still love them.

Now my grandmother, my Mom’s mom, died this week. She was a second mother to my brothers, in good and bad ways, and my Mom was always close with her in spite of hiccups here and there.

Now for my dilemma. I’m concerned that my mom might kill herself. With drugs accidentally, or on purpose. Her ex-husband, who still helps her when he can, called me the other day. He filled me in on Grandma’s death details, then kind of floated the idea of having her come down here. Stay with us, get a job, get clean, and get out of my hometown and all its negativity. I do not want this burden. Plus it would never work.

Speaking honestly, our life down here is drama free. I’m happy. My wife is happy. I don’t want the black hole that is my Mom’s life to suck me or my wife in. It sounds harsh, but I’m being honest. Is this shitty of me? Are there things I can do to help her and my brothers shirt if having them stay with me? I don’t want her to die. And I want to help get my brothers on the right path.

646,"Ok so I'm going to jump right in it:

I'm in a project with an NGO and yesterday they told us that IF WE WANT TO we can come to their place today so we can pick up some christmas gifts that I was no interested in getting, whatever they were (they usually gave us candy and I'm trying to lose weight so instead of going there I'd rather get home cus I was hungry).

I got home, everything was alright, I even helped my mom do some cleaning then went in my room and sat down at my computer to listen to music, this being the only thing I can really do on it (I ordered a new one for Christmas, this will have to do with something later). Three hours pass, at this point I'm watching an ex cop on youtube and my mom opens my door like the SWAT breached in, talking on her phone and showing me her fist, as in ""I'll beat your ass so god damn hard"" with a crazy look on her face. She was calm while talking on the phone, I thought she was talking to the courier about the pc, and the fist was like a victory fist into the air. But no.

She was talking to one of her friends (she always did this kind of thing, even though she knows I dont have nothing to do with her kid or her, always got me in trouble for small things, nd my mom doesnt like that she is the one that always tells her that I should've done something) that kid's is also in the same project as me that asked her if my speaker (the gift they got there) is working because her kid's isn't. After she ends the call she starts yelling at me, saying I never do anything but sit down at the computer and eat all day, not ever helping her out and that I always demand things but never do anything for them (she was referring to the computer I ordered, for which I paid half the price). Then she started telling me, while still screaming, how I couldve went there and got some money. To which I responded with ""But I didnt know they gave them speakers, they usually give out candy (I've been in a partnership with this NGO for quite a while now, nd I usually know what they give out based in the time of the year). And how could I have gotten money if they gave away speakers?"" To which I get the answer most of you probably expected ""You could have sold it for a good price"". And I'm just sitting there, in my mind saying 'really? this how much u want $10?'

After 10 minutes of her yelling and me just taking it to the face, holding myself from saying anything back I explain to her that I didnt need a speaker because I only listen to music on my headphones, besides I thought they gave away candy. She starts fuming again and goes on about how I dont even think about others, what if my dad or her needed the speaker, to which I tell her again I had no idea they gave away a speaker and she says it doesnt matter and that I wouldnt care anyways.

She leaves my room and the door is left open, I go to close it and she's just staring at me from across the hallway, asking me what do I want now. I say that I only got up to close the door, I close it and she says that I'm just a fucking idiot, and that got me mad too, but with a calm tone I said that she always acts like this with me and treats me like someone she hates, I close the door and she mentions dad, saying ""Oh yeah look, what if dad finds out that you threatened me?"" I open the door again and try to make her explain to me when I threatened her, to which she goes back to me disrespecting her and never doing nothing. Then she tells me that dad will never believe me over her and that I'm the worst. I just close the door and then she opens it again, slams it to the wall and says that it stays open. Then she says that I like to close my door because I'm an antisocial (I'm not, I have quite a lot of friends and good ones too), that I will never have a girlfriend (I do, we've been on for almost 2 months now, but mom never cared enough to listen to me when I told her I guess) and that I will never be something in life, that I will have no money. I tell her that I do have friends, a girlfriend and I have a career that I'm already starting to follow. She just ignores all of it and calls me an idiot again then leaves.

After like 30 mins of contemplating whether or not to pack some clothes and go live with my grandparents for the winter break I decided that if my dad takes her side on this one too I'm going.

What should I do? I just feel lost and my mom seems to hate me more day by day.

She gives attitude to other co-workers and doesn't do what is asked of her. Making it harder for the rest of the team. 
Last night I was tasked with training a new cashier so the second cashier was sent to dishes all night. Everybody congratulated me claiming that ""Justice had been served."" But she was actually struggling back there. As I did on my first day doing dishes. And when she came up to order food for her break, she was a mess. Her hair was a mess and she was soaking wet and exhausted. 
And seeing this made me feel the last thing I thought I would feel. Guilt. Guilt for putting her back there. Seeing her struggle to keep up like I did every Wednesday. And then she couldn't even pay for her food because her bank account was negative. So I paid for her food, sent her on break, and finished the dishes for her. 
My co-workers said I'm too nice. But seeing her like that made me feel awful. I remember my first night doing dishes and I was just like that. So I related and took pity. Is that wrong?",19Dec2019,1

I (F27) am a graphic designer with a BFA in design. For the past four years, I’ve been freelancing. I get a lot of work freelancing, but it’s not enough for me to make a living off of. In the past, I’ve worked in minimum wage retail alongside my freelance work, as opportunities in my field are a little rarer than most around here. 

A couple years ago I briefly had a job that paid $15 an hour. It was mainly taking artwork sent in from someone or a business and fitting it to fit their desired label to be proofed by the customer and then sent to print. Essentially, it was solving any problems in artwork sent in that wouldn’t work on their desired label. This job had up to four week’s vacation time that could be earned right away, sick days, free vision and dental, paid for half of health insurance, performance-based raises, all paid holidays, weekends off, and retirement At the time, I wanted to land a full time job that required more creativity - something that was more actual “graphic design.” So I moved on after about a month to a job opening at a design studio - unfortunately that didn’t pan out in my favor. Back then I didn’t have nearly as many bills to pay so I was a bit more okay with switching to another job.

I spent a while back in retail until back in April this year I saw a job opening for a family owned expensive furniture store that was paying $18 an hour “with benefits.” That’s my current job now. It’s about 90% sales and customer service and the rest of the time I create some advertisements to go into local newspapers. Every once in a while I take photos of new furniture and update the website and social media, but mainly the job is talking with customers and writing up orders or answering questions. It hasn’t been bad, but because my coworkers are family members/friends of my boss’s, he doesn’t provide any sort of health insurance (let alone dental or vision). I can earn a week of PTO after a year of working there, but that’s it. I don’t get sick days here (in fact, if I ever needed a day off unpaid, that would force another coworker to come in because only two of us know how to complete the end-of-the-day ledger. My boss doesn’t even know how.) A retirement plan is available and a handful of holidays are paid. I have to work every weekend as the store is busiest then unless I call it off two months in advance.

I would also say that the workplace environment isn’t the best. I don’t agree that my boss is very particular on who he hires - he’s never said anything, but he quickly disregards applications sent in from people he deems “not normal.” (This ranges from anyone who appears to be trans, gay, bisexual, etc.) One time he didn’t hire someone based on a political sticker they had on the back of their car. Everyone I work with is politically open at work and they make fun of and ridicule anyone that doesn’t agree with them. 

One time we were hiring for a position - mainly sales and some lifting of furniture to help put in customer’s cars. He came up to me and told me to stop accepting applications from females because it is a “waste of their time.” I argued that we had the job opening still online and he told me to tell any girl that we filled it. Also, there is a workshop in the store and I asked about learning about finishing furniture myself and he told me, “No girls are allowed in the workshop.” And wouldn’t speak more with me about it.

It turns out that the previous place I was hired at was hiring again - on a whim, I applied for it. Turns out, I have an interview in a few days and now I’m wondering if it’s worth leaving a higher paying job with not really any benefits to a lower paying job with much better benefits. I was thinking on possibly asking the lower paying job for their best offer. What I’m wondering about is what everyone thinks I should go with should I get offered the new job - and if I go with the new job, what’s the best way to go about asking to start at a higher rate?

Thank you. :)",19Dec2019,1

Thing is. She's super fucking racist against any one who's not white. I mean to the point it's annoying. But I let it pass because some of the shit she says is pretty stupid. The only thing that really irks me is that she doesn't think disabilities are a thing.

I'm autistic but can function semi normally. It just bugs me when I try to defend myself about it. She just launches into this fact check tyriad that makes me just not be around them. Plus if I try to talk about something I'm interested in I always get cut off by my mother.

These dinners usually last a couple of hours and I spend most of my time being bored. I literally in butted out when I try to join in or give a fact that correlates. It's frustrating and frankly I can't deal with it.

668,"Hello r/Advice, so I know this is not as seriousness as some other posts here on this subreddit, but I think it is worth sharing regardless. I am a junior college (23 to be exact) living in Seattle, Washington and majoring in Design. The questions I have here is where do I go regarding my career and passions. 

For the longest time, my interests have always been in the realm of animation, comics, and illustrations (despite the name, these subject matters are part of my Design major). I have some ideas for animated films and/or series I felt like pursuing once I have finished college. And I have even considered founding an animation studio in the Seattle area. Though applying for work in concept art has been something on my mind as well. For now though, my focus has been to start a webcomic, which I am planning to begin posting the beginning of next year.

However more recently, especially after 2016, my interests have shifted more towards music and to a lesser extent live-action film-making (was considering pursuing the Film major at my school but ultimately stuck with Design). Have even written some songs that I plan on recording and turning into an album. Though in the latter's case, it is more just general ideas, like premises and aesthetic, rather than fully fleshed out or concrete like a screenplays or storyboards.

Ultimately, I am trying to ask where do I go and which of these interests of mine should I follow once I have finished my education? And what path(s) I should head to fulfill my ambitions?",19Dec2019,1

So, at my job we still use paper timesheets that we must turn into our GM, who then turns them into the payroll office every monday. This past monday was an off day, so I wasnt there to double check that my timesheet was turned in as I usually do. My GM, apparently, lost my timesheet, but didnt tell me she did so. Instead, she (not thinking to look at the schedule/camera timestamps, which were all correct) gave the payroll office some random days/hours she thought I ""might"" have worked and did not inform me about any of this until yesterday. I checked the schedule and brought her a copy of what my timesheet should have looked like according to the schedule and the timestamps for which the cameras said I left the days that I worked. Even with the time stamps and my copy of the schedule, the GM refused to accept the correct timesheet to send to the payroll office and told me there was ""no possible way"" I was correct, because (even tho she had the schedule SHE made in front of her nose) ""there was no way she'd schedule me for xyz shift"" and when I spoke to the payroll office myself, they confirmed that they were not allowed to fix my hours without my GM's approval. They also confirmed that because of this mishap I would only be paid roughly half of what I should be receiving for this paycheck. Is there anything I can do to fix this?

680,"Warning: it is a long post

Currently I am on my 6 month probation and already passed 6 month. I ment to receive my probation review last week, however it has been postponed to next year....without any context of why it is pospond. Partly I think because we are a agency and we are at the most busist time and not many of our director was in the office.

Overall, I was doing well until 2 weeks ago I was unable to produce good contents. Suddenly, I was left out of loop completely for one of the project( I am working on two project at the moment and I am independently incharge of it). Currently, I am not in any of the emails we always receive daily, as well as not being attend to any meetingl. The thing is we have enormous amount of work still has to do and my senior is in overtime everyday since I was out of the loop. He does not seem to give me any of his work...or talk to me

I have asked him to at lest update me of what's going on and he tells me he will but never happened. And others, who are not in the team seem to know more about the project now than I do.( The graphic design team)

As for the project I am in-charge of is a relatively short project and to be honest there is not much to do. It will finish early next year. Today, I was looking at the resource planner, which show who is on what project for how long. I saw one of my colleague will join the project next year with me, however we normally never have two mid-leve consultant in single project. I feel like she probably will take over the project. 

For the last 2 weeks I can tell my colleagues does not talk to me as much anymore, let alone look at me. I have not received any bad performance review yet but I can tell is not a good sign..

The project I am working now is a very difficult project, even for our company's standard where even they struggle quite hard.It could be part of the reasons since they don't have much time. However, I know that does not make  everything okay....

What should I do? Am I just being worried for no reason?  Should I look for a job now? There are still small projects I received next year and put in to a new house... Is that mean I am going be okay?

so i have a friend that likes to do, like, *things*, like going to events n social gatherings n such. she organized this whole lil group outing to do something fun for winter this friday night and i was on board! she gave us the option of this street fair with a movie or universal studios for some harry potter thing. well i’m broke as shit so i didn’t want to pay a bunch of money (esp for something i don’t even like tbh). i said i’d prefer the street fair, so that‘s what she decided we were all gonna do. 

well last night, my dear mother reminds me, “hey we have this thing we’ve been planning months in advance that we’re doin with the family, it’s this friday night”. note: this event is something that gets sold out stupid fast and also i’ve been waiting for like, 2 years for the opportunity to go. so i really do want to go to that. so i’m like well fuck me, god damn, i fucked up :((

so i tell my friend this morning when i wake up at like 7 am that i’m so fuckin sorry, i screwed up and i wasn’t reminded of this thing, let me make it up to you and we can go out for lunch or coffee or something. she responds and tells me something along the lines of “please tell me asap next time, we’re doing the street fair specifically because you couldn’t afford universal even tho it’s what i really wanted to do”

and fellas......... i wish i was exaggerating when i said that this text is on fucking a loop in my head. she adjusted this whole plan of her’s for me and i might not even go. i feel like, really bad. like *really really* bad. i can’t stop thinking about it. i’ve been considering ditching the family thing to just go to her thing to alleviate the guilt. i really honestly don’t feel like going to this fair thing, it doesn’t sound as fun as what i’m doing with my family. but i feel *so* fucking guilty. i also considered trying to balance both, see if i can pull it off. 

so what’s a gal to do? do i ditch the family and go with my friend? do i try to balance both? or do i just try not to worry about it?

oh also it may be worth noting that i recently found out i might have this uh... disorder? i guess? in which some negative feelings like rejection, guilt, failure, that kinda shit, are so over exaggerated in my head that it turns into a physical sensation. it’s beyond the usual like, little emotional gut punches that everyone feels once in a while. for me, it’s apparently extraordinarily persistent and... potent? effective? so this guilt of being flakey, even though i know it isn’t a huge deal, is completely churning my stomach and consuming my thoughts. literally when i got the text i had a hot flash and my entire body just started sweating. so i’m fully neurotic, which is super cool :+)",19Dec2019,1
684,"A quick perusal of my Reddit history should tell you that I enjoy dressing up casually. And it's true, nothing makes me feel so confident and energized as wearing a dress or a skirt with heels. I like to share my outfits online with whichever community will have me. I'm currently banned from r/femalefashionadvice (for reasons that I'd rather not get into here), and when I filed an appeal of this decision earlier in the year, it was declined. I'm wary of posting this question in any of the subs that I currently frequent (e.g. r/FashionPlus, r/CurvyFashion, r/RepLadies) because I'm afraid of what the reaction will be. So I thought that this might be as good a place as any to solicit feedback.

One thing you'll notice is that my outfits seem to be hit-or-miss with most people. Sometimes what I post is received positively​ (examples: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionPlus/comments/e9bi7g/mondays_outfit_cowl_neck_sweater_dress_with_ankle/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionPlus/comments/d1y6m6/black_flared_swing_dress/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionPlus/comments/cyx11s/todays_outfit_a_black_dress_over_a_white_shirt/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurvyFashion/comments/c0xdc9/yesterdays_outfit_a_black_dress_with_a_burgundy/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionPlus/comments/alg6a8/what_sort_of_waist_belt_would_go_with_this_outfit/)), but more often than not, it garners a mixed or even negative reception: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/ecb95q/daily_ootd_general_discussion_thread_december_18/fbbu1zt/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/e20nm6/daily_ootd_general_discussion_thread_november_26/f8sudzq/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/e03s97/daily_ootd_daily_discussion_thread_november_22/f8bpq69/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionPlus/comments/d0cotk/beige_sweater_with_pink_scarf_and_black_mini_skirt/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurvyFashion/comments/bzjf92/ootd_white_bodysuit_and_black_flared_midi_skirt/), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionPlus/comments/bsdpnu/black_jacket_and_miniskirt_i_dont_think_this/). Then there are times when I post the same outfit in different places, and it gets a vastly different reception between them – such as last week when I wore a blue dress and posted it to both FashionPlus ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionPlus/comments/e5rf3b/i_wore_a_blue_dress_yesterday_what_do_you_think/)) and RepLadies ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/e4xmkm/daily_ootd_general_discussion_thread_december_02/f9g5vp1/)). Also, if you read the responses to my posts, you'll see that many of my replies are downvoted as well. This makes no sense to me because I consider what I say to be fairly innocuous.

What I want to know is, am I doing something wrong? Is it just because my outfits suck? Or is it more likely that the issue lies with how I interact with others? Maybe I'm coming across as condescending or passive-aggressive; maybe it seems as if I'm desperate for attention. I also wonder if there's something inherently annoying about my manner of speech. I once had somebody tell me that it doesn't seem as if I take people's advice, which I don't think is entirely true (e.g. with [this outfit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionPlus/comments/b5qkxf/todays_outfit_a_beige_sweater_with_a_black_mini/), someone suggested I try a French tuck; a few months later, I did [exactly that](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/dooaev/daily_ootd_general_discussion_thread_october_29/f5qs2ud/)), but I do think it reflects the general consensus among those who've seen my posts. Perhaps they feel like I don't appreciate their input. Or, maybe someone just has it in for me.

I thought that an impartial third-party might be able to give me some more insight on how I'm coming across, and what I can do differently going forward (assuming anything needs to change).",19Dec2019,1
685,"I was in a FWB situation, just friends and sex, no illusions that we had feelings.  Which we both agreed to. He chased me, said it would be fun. He layed out terms that if either one of us did not want to participate, or we found someone else, to be upfront, respectful no ghosting and no drama. Lol, yeah, read on...

 I asked him if he was up for some fun this weekend, got a curt, ""can't, crazy busy"", which was out of character. Normally he'd squeeze it in a way or ask for another day. I kinda had the feeling he was ghosting me, especially considering he had stopped talking to me like a friend when I came over, it became strictly sex. I asked him upfront if he no longer wanted to continue, that it would be ok to say so, no tears from me. His reply was confusing. That he was indeed busy, ""but he was seeing someone and it could possibly turn serious. For clarification, nothing new with his seeing someone, he stated the very damn same thing when we started. He was open with her that he saw other people until they were in a serious relationship. I couldn't make out his intentions either way, so I said to have a great Christmas with his daughter, and have fun on his visit to see family out West. I was like see, no tears. I was trying to save face. He replied thanks, that we would remain best friends forever. I said something about missing our fun, and he said he would miss it to, that if their relationship didn't turn serious, he would be in touch so we could hook up again. 

I feel like a complete idiot. I regret that I didn't call him out for not sticking to our agreement about being respectful, that I am upset, that he used a lame ass excuse, and that pulled this a week before Christmas. And that I agreed essentially to be the secondary ass on standby. I'm thinking of just sending him a text saying his actions hurt me, that he was disrespectful, and that he could have been decent and waited until after Christmas to let me know he was dropping me like a bad habit. He could have said, have family over all week, let's talk after Christmas. We were supposed to have a respectful agreement, but in the end I felt discarded and it made my Christmas a lot shittier than it already is. Real dick move on his part. And I am not his secondary piece of ass on standby.

 My previous long term boyfriend of 5 years ended his life 3.5 years ago, right after New Year's, guess you can say I have abandonment issues. Now I just got discarded by  my ""fuck"" buddy, it's like wow, no matter what, the holidays are a shitty time of year. 

I can do it now, or wait, he'll likely send a Merry Christmas text. Might be the perfect time to not respond to his text until the day after with what I said above. Have my peace, let him know I'm not desperate enough to be on standby. 

And please, no, you need to find a nice relationship with someone who cares about you. Obviously that would be wonderful, but I am not ready to risk being in a relationship to get hurt again. I also started a business and I am far too busy to put in the effort. 

I will add one thing, by FWB guy lost his mom last month. Not that he told me since he had stopped talking personal stuff. A friend just told me today. I feel a little bad about it, but he wasn't close with her and she was 95 years old.",19Dec2019,1
686,"He’s been acting kind of strange lately. When he came home from work, he was his usual happy self but it all began after he took a nap while I was cooking dinner. I entered our bedroom to say dinner was ready and he was already awake on his phone. And the off-ness began from there. He’s your typical happy go lucky guy who’s not shy with his affection. But that night? He became distant, both emotionally and physically. He was silent on the car ride from an event, lost in his own thoughts, and didn’t even bother to wait for me once we arrived at our house. He always walks by my side though. I asked what was on his mind but he didn’t want to talk about it. He swears there’s nothing wrong with us, but why is he so close yet so far??? I’m trying to give him space but my imagination and the unknown is driving me insane. I want to help him so much. He’s suffering alone with whatever’s worrying his mind, and it seems he could be afraid to tell me. Is it wrong of me to keep bringing it up and urging him to confide in me, or should I wait for him to come to me on his own? I just don’t want him to act like that never happened and sweep it under the rug. Then he’s truly hiding something. I just want him to know he can trust me to be nonjudgmental and loving.",19Dec2019,1

692,"I was friends with this person, gonna name them ""J"", for about 2 years, almost 3. We were long distance online friends.

We met online through a group chat related to a fandom we were mutually interested in. Initially, i didn't talk to them that much on there. But that person was eager to be friends with me, so they DMed me. we kind of hit it off from there. We were both artists, and we would help inspire each other through interests we shared throughout our friendship. It was a really good time, and I cherish all the conversations we had. What I, being an extremely oblivious person, didn't notice was that they actually had a crush on me. When I eventually realized this, I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to feel either. I even convinced myself at one point that maybe I DO like them romantically and I can work out a romantic relationship with them. So I lead them on, quite a bit, out of confusion of my own feelings and my fear of hurting their feelings. That was discussed and resolved, but their feelings of absolute love and loyalty for me never died down.

Eventually, the friendship left its honeymoon phase, and things got bad. There were so many moments of awful miscommunication and emotional manipulation that really hurt the friendship. J would often be in a really bad mental state, and my support/comfort/advice never satisfied them, so they got frustrated at me. They would always tell me about their issues and I would try my best to help out but it would be incredibly draining for me. They became distant and passive aggressive whenever I did something wrong but they didn't want to directly tell me what I did. They would also guilt trip me, and try to make me feel like a bad friend if i didn't want to do something they wanted me to do or if I didn't quickly respond to their messages. I was a much more closed off and distant person than they were, and they were a hundred times more eager to want to get close to me than I wanted to get close to them. J would want me to go on voice chats and multi-user websites(things like Rabbit or Drawpile) to watch/play stuff with me, but I was very uncomfortable because of personal issues with my own voice(there is more to that but I won't get into it because its very personal) and me not feeling comfortable with them yet. I would refuse, but they would put a timer on it and waited ""until i'm comfortable"", but reminded me about it from time to time, as to pressure me. I discussed my boundaries with them and how I was uncomfortable doing certain things with them, but they only continuously got angry at me because of the fact that it seemed like I didn't want to do anything with them except talking to them through text. I thought that maybe I was being the unreasonable one for being so uncomfortable, so sometimes I would say yes to their offers to go on the multi-user websites even when I didn't feel good about it. They simply thought that my refusal was just being shy, and that I needed to be pushed out of my comfort zone. I definitely did not feel good about the fact that I was pressured to go beyond texting so early on in the friendship. It takes a lot longer for me to become close with someone enough to want to do other things, but they never seemed to understand that. The constant pressuring made me close myself off even more. If the friendship developed without these factors, I would have been so much more open to their offers to get closer to me.

At that point, I was starting to feel drained by this person. I felt like J was being extremely overbearing towards me to the point where they put their desire to be friends with me over my comfort and boundaries. I was also constantly afraid whenever they were in a bad mood, because it would mean a multitude of bad things that could possibly occur, and it felt like I was walking through a landmine.

All of this frustration I felt about J started getting bigger and bigger, and I built a giant tower of resentment towards them. As much as I enjoyed their company when things were good, the bad parts started to overshadow everything. I started to almost dislike them. I rarely talked about them to other people outside of our text messages because I didn't feel proud of our friendship. Even when things were good between us, I had such a hard time saying loving words to them. They would say loving things and send me gifts often, and I tried my best to reciprocate, but I couldn't get myself to feel as passionate as they did about me. They noticed, and would tell me that sometimes the friendship would feel one sided. I told them that it wasn't true, and that I'm trying my best to reciprocate despite how closed off and distant I usually am(even before the resentment happened). I wanted to slowly distance myself from them, but I didn't want to let go of them because I still cherished all the good times I had with them, and I genuinely liked them despite the bad stuff. I wanted to keep the peace and avoid conflict, so I wasn't entirely honest with how much I resented them, and how much I wanted to slowly step back from the entire friendship. I repressed the resentment I felt because letting it all spill out would mean that they would get angry at me, and I was so afraid of that.

We argued so frequently, and I would take breaks from them(i always let them know beforehand) because they made me so angry. But even with all of this said, they were willing to resolve issues with me. We actually tried to discuss honestly and tried our best to be better. It worked for some things, and some things actually got better, but most of the time it was like an endless rollercoaster ride of really high highs and really low lows. The arguments and passive aggression never stopped. But I believe that one of the biggest reasons why it didn't stop was because of my dishonesty. I basically lead them on to believe I wanted to stay best friends with them the entire time, while what I really wanted to do was to slowly distance myself to the point where we would not be as close as we were before. But trying to say that to them felt like it would be an impossible task, and I knew that it would be impossible for them to actually agree to distance ourselves because they were always eager to get close to me.

Things really blew up towards the end of our friendship. I would take even longer breaks, but coming back from a break never resolved any of the issues I left behind, so we would jump right back where we left off. During the break, I blocked them off of every social media I shared with them. They eventually dug through all my contact information and found my email, and started sending me messages through there. I didn't intend on coming back from my break that soon until they started to email me about the whole ordeal, so I responded. It was one of the most anxiety inducing arguments i've ever had in my life. At that moment, something changed within me. I was feeling like I can finally tell them everything that I REALLY felt, so I tried my best to dig down my thoughts and tell them honestly about all the feelings I was too afraid to show. They were utterly devastated and hurt by the resentment I felt(understandably so) and completely lost all trust in me. Eventually, we both apologized for everything. They apologized for the manipulation, guilt tripping, and pressuring, and I apologized for my dishonesty and for the shitty things I said to them out of anger. They told me that now that I told them everything, things can actually get better, and we can start a clean slate. They still couldn't trust me, but they wanted to keep being friends with me, even if it takes a million years for things to improve. But I wasn't too optimistic about it. I felt that the damage has already been done, and that I couldn't forgive them for everything they did to me. So I said my farewell to them. At this point, they were begging me to reconsider. They started telling me how much they really love me, and how much they would do anything for me. They also told me how one sided this friendship felt ever since the beginning. It was really heartbreaking to see, and incredibly hard to let go.

Its been a little bit since that happened, and I can't help but feel like I'm the bad guy in all of this. I feel like I could have prevented so much hurt if I was more straight up with them. I occasionally stalk their social media to see how they're doing, and it makes me feel so guilty to see them subtweet about me or repost posts about one sided/toxic relationships. I always try to tell myself that I did the best thing I could to let them go, but then...did I really?

**TLDR; let go of a really good friend of 2 years because I couldn't forgive them for being emotionally manipulative to me and making me feel horrible, even after they apologized and wanted to be better and fix things, but Im not entirely in the right because I should have been more honest about wanting to keep my distance with them but I valued keeping the peace and avoiding conflict over being honest, almost the entirety of the friendship I was leading them on to think I wanted to stay best friends with them**",19Dec2019,1

**My situation:** 

\+ I've done 6 successful kickstarter projects for my creative work, including a tabletop game that thousands of people know and love. 

\+I've done graphic design and illustration for various clients. 

\+In the last year I taught myself programming, and I'm just finishing up a video game. 

\+ I've manufactured and shipped thousands of products worldwide: I can ship, and ship on time. 

\+I can write well and have published 8 books and ebooks.

696,"Myself, my wife and our daughter (late teens) were going to be going to my mom's for Holiday dinner this coming Sunday. This is already sort of tenuous; it may sound cliched, but my wife does \*not\* like my mother. I can mostly understand the feeling. My mom is not great at reading a room, and if asked for an opinion on something will tend to point out the things she doesn't like, first.

A couple of weeks ago, my mom mentions she's invited her cousin's daughter (early 20's) to come to the dinner. Not too big a deal. Wife and daughter were expecting it to be just the four of us, but whatever.

This past weekend, my mom mentions to me that her cousin might be coming as well, and possibly his wife. I sort of rolled my eyes, because I'm not sure where mom thinks everyone is going to sit, but whatever. Possible key detail: I did not mention this to my wife.

Coming back from a run to the gas station this morning, wife asks me if there's anything about the dinner on Sunday that I want to tell her, that maybe I haven't already. Not sure if my mom emailed her, made a Facebook post, etc. but my wife was on to something. I admitted that mom had said her cousin might be coming on Sunday as well.

That was, as they say, the straw that broke the camel's back. That I hadn't said anything, that she doesn't like surprises, she doesn't know the cousin, doesn't like my mom. The whole thing added up to: My wife said she's not going to go to the dinner on Sunday.

We're going to tell our daughter this afternoon, and give her the option to not go. I strongly suspect she'll jump at the chance, which leaves only me, and the reason I'm making this post.

698,"I cheated on my girlfriend after we broke up 18 months ago. I wanted children in the future and she didnt. We was arguing and rarely seeing each other. I felt lonely while still in the relationship at that point and didnt think things would work out so we ended it.

I cashed in on some shares I had and spent all the money drowning my sorrows multiple times a week. On two occasions I had two drunken one night stands with two different people.

One of them during the time we had broken up and another shortly after getting back together but while our relationship was on the ropes. 

I have kept this a secret and lived with the guilt since. I haven't told her in an attempt to protect her and not hurt her. I didnt want to clear my conscience at the expense of hurting her and risk losing her. I vowed to never do again now that I was confident she was who I intended to marry and spend my future with.

We worked on our relationship and things improved. We are in a good place. We purchased a property together and have plans for the future.

Rumours are now being spread in work that I have cheated on my partner. My partner does not work there but has in the past. I have not told a soul what I have done so this has come from the other people involved.

I'm scared, ashamed, upset and regretful. I feel in my heart I should come clean and unburden myself but know that it will break her heart and potentially ruin our future.

My life is better for having her and know that because of my actions she deserves better then me. 

I dont want to tell her this close to christmas and ruin her christmas, I expect she will want me to move out and I dont have anywhere to go.

Should I confess now? Should I wait till after christmas? If I wait I run the risk of someone else telling her the rumours. If I tell her now I will ruin her christmas. If I ignore it, it will likely resurface at a later date.

700,"
I hope this is the right place to put this, but I just wanted to ask for advice, and blow off steam a little.

I’m a 23 year old guy, married with a toddler. Got married at 20, our baby was born when we were 21, bought a house at 22. Back when my wife and I were 20, we lost our home, jobs, and only running vehicle all within a month. It was rough, grabbed the first job I could, and have gotten raises equivalent to 85% of my starting salary in the almost 3 years I have been with the company. 

We busted our butts, buying crappy cars, working the jobs, trying to stay debt free and build our life. The house we bought is in a low-income community that would be seen as “trashy” by many. 

How do I break out of this slump? I am doing my damndest to provide for my family, but feel like I keep getting knocked down. I’m know I’m not the best husband or father, but I care, and do my best. I want our child to live a good life, and try so stinking hard to provide, but it feels like it is never enough. Same with my wife, she drives whatever vehicle I can keep running, buying all her clothes second hand, and I just want to give them what they deserve. My job pays well for the area, but we go to the main city near us, and I see these families going in “fancy” grocery stores, and see this sort of class that I crave for my family. Dressed up, nice vehicles, doing these activities that I can’t supply for my family. 

High school is my highest level of education, and schooling is out of the question, as I can’t go in the debt and simply don’t have the time with my work. Moving is out of the question, as I would take a horrendous loss. I don’t know how to move up the ladder, how to give my family the life they deserve. I have busted my butt to get to where we are, but we are still on the bottom rung of the social ladder. My wife has had vehicles break down in her work parking lot, we wear the same clothes day in and out. I love these two so much, but feel like I am failing them constantly, and just don’t know how to get ahead. It definitely gets to me. 

Just today I found out we lost our insurance. Every time I get one step ahead, it just feels like we get pushed down in the hole again. How can I provide a lifestyle change when I am struggling to provide the basics?

Sorry for the long post, just needed to get it off my chest, and any advice is appreciated.

I'm in the process of a multi-stage interview with a big company there with a chance to do what i love, and they've told me that they want to move forward with getting me on-site for an in-person interview.

My parents however, said they would not support me or help me in pursuing this as they will not let me leave home.  
I was hoping that their reaction would have been more supportive and offering assistance, but they instead opted to say things like:

* I'd be throwing my life away if i did this
* They couldn't take life in a city so i would hate it too
* Blaming my gf for taking me away from them (she only ever tells me that she wants me to do what i think is right and will support me whatever i decide, and in fact i'd be moving further away from her)
* I am not ready to take this step
* Do i even want my parents anymore?

Living with my parents is becoming more unbearable everyday, and moving out for me is scary because this is my current relationship with them:  
They...

* Insist that they have their name on my bank account
* Demand access to my email and linked in account and regularly send messages pretending to be me without my permission
* Won't help me buy my own car or show me how to handle finances
* Blame my gf for basically everything
* Lecture me daily about stuff i'm already self motivated on and on top of

They want me to stick it out with my current job while they help me look for better work in the area (of which there is nothing in my field that we've found yet)

I am grateful for everything but I can't help but feel like it's time for me to move on. And i feel guilty that I want to get away from such a comfortable life that people would die for.  
My parents have always had a tight grasp on my siblings and I, and have forced me specifically to not deviate too far from what they have planned for me in life.  
Growing up, my parents have done most everything for me without the chance to do things myself. I feel controlled and incapable of making big decisions on my own.

Even if I don't get this particular job there are tons of jobs in that area that are exactly what i'm looking for. I think that I'm aware of how big of a leap that it would be. I know that there would be a lot for me to invest and learn. I know I want this, but i'm scared to do it without their help and terrified of how they would react. Half of me feels like their trying to live my life for me and parent out of fear and manipulation, and the other half wants to trust that they know best.

Even if I shouldn't be making the move just yet, does anyone have any tips for how i might get some more Independence and agency in my life without making my parents burst into tears and scream at me? I'm not the best communicator when it comes to my parents. It's difficult to get a word in before I'm shut up and it turns into a multi-hour long lecture.

What should i do?  
Thank you in advance.",19Dec2019,1
706,"So at the beginning of this school year there was this girl in my chem class who I would occasionally help.  Over this year,especially in the last few weeks, we’ve started snapping more and more to the point where we literally talk and send videos to each other practically all day, everyday. She’s so cute and I feel like she might actually like me.  We’re mutual number 1 best friends on snapchat.  We’ve also kind of playfully flirted like we talked about who would win in a fight and if course she said that she would win.  A few days ago we FaceTimed for like 3 hours. It was mainly to help her study for chem but we ended up  just talking and joking with each other most of the time.

709,"My (27F) boyfriend (27M) and I met at a music festival in France in March of this year. He’s from the Netherlands and I live in the US. We kept in touch after the festival which culminated in him inviting me to another festival in Belgium in July. I went, met all his friends, and had a fabulous time. We really hit it off so we made it official and started a long distance relationship. We planned to meet up again in November for a 21 day vacation through Mexico and Cuba. Well while on this vacation I noticed that my feelings had changed and that while I love him, I am not in love with him. He is in love with me and doesn’t know how I feel.

We have another trip planned in London for a week during New Years. I debated not going, breaking up with him etc but I don’t want to cause trauma around any particular holiday. Because I still love and care about him. Just not as a significant other. 

I’ve debated breaking up with him after New Years in either February or mid January over whatsapp/FaceTime because we are long distance. I asked for advice from a friend and she told me breaking up in person during New Years is the better thing to do. Basically my question is what’s the better thing to do? Break up in person while on a trip during New Years, or breaking up over whatsapp/FaceTime? 

tldr// when/how should I break up with my significant other? Via whatsapp/FaceTime after the holidays (long distance relationship) or in person while on vacation during New Years?",19Dec2019,1

715,"Story for understanding my question better:

For a few years now I (M21) fight with dark and depressive thoughts. I wouldn't say I'm an introvert or depressed, but sometimes (mostly when I'm alone) I get to the bottom very quickly. Today I thought of something which could be a reason for my shifts in mood and maybe a solution. The day went relatively smooth and 1h before I was done with work I texted with a girl (we study thogether and connect well). I don't really know if there's something between us or if she's just very friendly. What I know is that after we texted today my mood went up and I felt affection. After that I could say what I thought and didn't think what I could have said, if you know what I mean with that. My thought now, is that I should create this external affection, internally so I'm not as heavily dependent on something external and completely incidental. I'm happy for some insight from you guys :)",19Dec2019,1
717,"So I’ve been stressing out about how my life is going to end up and I have no clue what to major in in college. I love the arts, but I know it’ll be hard to make a living off that. I tried taking a business class and it was awful, and don’t exactly have any interest in anything else. Engineering is also NO BUENO, I suck at math. I’ve already wasted time trying to decide what to major in so I have a lot of classes that could or couldn’t go towards my degree I choose, and I might even have to retake some because of my low gpa. I also used to work in Disney and I was a lifeguard, so I’m also thinking about going back into recreation, getting a managing position and getting a sports administration degree. Or if this isn’t the right route let me know.

Please give me ideas or insight into different kinds of majors. I don’t want to do something I hate for the rest of my life just because it’s going to get me a good job or pay a lot. I’m just scared on what to do at this point and don’t want to make the wrong decisions.",19Dec2019,1

721,"Hey ! I have a friend who is driving me nut. He seems to be emotionless and doesn't have any compassion for me or other friends. We're good friends and laugh a lot together but our character are totally opposed ; I sometimes need peace and silence especially if I'm tired – which happens quite often –, but my friend can't shut his mouth event if I ask him to please be quiet, he answers me something like ""I'm tired too, I slept 5 hours this night and when I'm tired, I'm talking anything"" but for me, it's not a reason to keep talking when I try to rest (beside, he always brings everything to him, no matter the discussion, whether I'm talking about myself or someone else, he will bring the discussion on him, which annoys me the most because I have an unpleasant impression of not to count for him and to be ""nothing""). When these scene happens, I feel like I'm going to explode and just want from him to leave me alone, but just after I feel extremely guilty of what I thought about him because he doesn't have a lot of friends and he has big difficulty to make friends and socialize even if he is very extrovert and I'm introvert, I find it easier to make friends. 
So, my questions is : ""What am I supposed to do ? Stop talking with him ? Which mean to stop talking to 2 more of my friends because they're always with him. Or try to have a talk with him and hope that he will change – which will probably never happen – or that I will make more effort to support him ? 
Moreover, we are in the same class, at the same table, so stop talking with him will be really really hard. 
Or, at least I will take any advice to stop feeling guilty for what I thought about him when he pissed me off, I really feel like he didn't deserve it and that sometimes prevents me from sleeping.. Yes I don't need a lot of things to prevent me from sleeping..

It's disgusting. On top of poor management, i've also had to work every holiday (which is understandable considering i'm a seasonal employee), and the drama is just ridiculous. I cant say or do anything without the entire staff knowing about it. Also, my car is decently old (1998) and it's very poor in the snow, so driving 20 minutes to work in this weather as an inexperienced driver is very scary, especially in the dark.

His behavior has become strange and erratic and he has begun to secretly drink vodka out of water bottles throughout the day. He has run both of my sisters off and my mom is on the brink of leaving.

They were the last days before winter break and it was a busy week, and I didn't mark the class in my personal calendar. So I found out later that I was supposed to be there.

I email the professor to apologise and asked if I could to repeat that class, though I didn't explain myself. He emailed me saying that I needed to provide a proper justification for missing, according to the university's guidelines (this professor is the president of the faculty). Obviously, I don't have any valid reason.

This means that I fail this class and will have to repeat it next year, paying the according money. On the bright side, I had failed a class last year and I was taking more credits to get my scholarship, and if I don't have to do the work in the lab it will balance my workload. Luckily I live in a country where education is not expensive, should I take this as a life lesson and just accept I lost like 200 dollars?

What do I say to this man? Obviously I cannot say I forgot about the class. He's the president and I never met him before, I have a feeling it would not be a wise thing to do. Should I just tell him I cannot justify why I didn't go to the class?

Should I be more concerned about my actions? I felt really anxious the day I found I missed the class, but now I don't feel anything. I don't really care and I'll accept the consequences. Maybe I'm just  burned out at this point in the semester.

I've recently come back from traveling and now I want to get started on making something of my life and doing something I love for a job.

I studied Business Management at Uni a few years ago but I left I wanted to travel, grow and understand myself a bit more.

I've had some time to think about what I'd like to do and I always come back to owning my own business. When I think about what type of business, I think about what I like and what my interests are as I think this would keep me interested, passionate, make me work hard and believe in the concept. I know its a lot of work and commitment etc.

I've had a lot of ideas but have finally settled on the idea of designing and creating mountain bike clothing. The main focus being jerseys as a starting point.

My question is, how do I find company's willing to print my designs on the right material and add features I want into the design, for example, thumb loops, cuffed sleeves, venting, labels etc.

And I'm looking for advice from others for starting a business such as this and how to approach it, what to plan, how to market, design websites and so on...

Maybe you started a similar type of business, clothing brand?, and wish you did a few things differently you'd like to share, any advice would be much appreciated.

745,"So I’ve been seeing this girl for about 3 months now, let’s call her T. Yesterday night I went out for drinks with her and 2 of her friends - the first time meeting them.

We were all giving relationship advice to one of them, and then he (clearly not knowing we were together) turns to T and says “oh you also need to let us know what happened with that guy in Brussels” (where she traveled to a couple weeks ago for a concert and stayed with a friend).

Now her reaction seemed somewhat strange, with a lot of “what? What are you talking about” mid-nervous laughing. I pretended I didn’t notice but I’m not great at hiding emotions. However, we didn’t talk about it since then.

We never established being exclusive, or even what our relationship is, so I feel like I can’t really be upset if something DID happen, but I still do, and even more upset at how she reacted and that she chose not to talk about it at all at the time or afterwards.

Should I talk to her about this and if so, how?",19Dec2019,1
747,"Recently, a conflict has sprung up between multiple friends. Some say that my one friend has been faking the injuries he received from his abusive father. Friend 1 says otherwise.

They try to make me avoid certain people and day certain things, and I can't help but listen to everyone because they say they know what's best for me. I also found out from friend 1 today that my long-time friend has actually hated me for a long time.

I am no stranger to emotional manipulation. I have been manipulated on many occasions throughout my entire life (by multiple people). I'm torn apart now I've been struggling for a long long time against depression and anxiety disorders, and This time of year is the hardest.

749,"Title says it all but I’ll elaborate with stories and some light ranting.

My coworker T is 50something, I’m 21. We work in an office and the only other coworker I see is my boss, who usually leaves a couple hours into my shift. So essentially it’s always me and T. We’ve been cool since I started working there (9 months on the 27th) but lately she’s been a downright bitch to me.

I’ve made some mistakes since I’ve worked there, all small clerical errors. My boss is the sweetest woman alive and was always helpful when I screwed up, teaching me the right way. T is very abrasive and *why can’t you do z right?* and belittling in her “correcting” of me. It tends to cause some issues because T will scold me about something, I’ll switch the way I do it, and then boss will tell me to do it a different way. I don’t want to throw T under the bus so I just switch to boss’ way.

Which brings us to the most recent issue. T is always wanting to go home. So when a potential customer came in 20 minutes before closing I gave them some paperwork and asked them to come back tomorrow when we’re open - something T has done *so. many. times.* Not only did she scold me for doing it but she told boss. Boss proceeded to scold me about it and I was flabbergasted. But I told her honestly that that’s what I thought I was supposed to do, since T had done it before. I never would’ve thought to give them the paperwork, and I told her as such. 

Since then T has been worse to me, almost bullying. Last night the phone rang while she was with a customer and I went to answer mine, but saw she was going for hers (we both have phones on our desks) so I didn’t answer. She snarkily asked if I was going to answer so I did. Then later on when the phone rang I automatically answered to avoid being scolded, and she again snarkily said “seriously, deadwrongdeadass? I’m right here.” I feel like I can’t win.

I’m worried because I’ve worked here 9 months and T has been here 13 years. Boss kind of changed the subject when I tried to approach her about T’s behavior towards me, saying that she can “be a little rough around the edges” but I feel ganged up on. T is always breathing down my neck, trying to micromanage the order I do my work in or telling me to do xyz another way. It gives me anxiety and I’m scared she’s been telling boss things about me. I feel a lot of tension at work and I don’t know what to do. I also only make minimum wage and feel like it’s not worth the stress.

I agreed to pay for that reparation but when we went to get it fixed we found out that if we got it in my size the ring would stretch out too much and it would always break.

766,"I have a lot of problems in my life right now. Unstable living situation, complicated and debilitating medical problems, fragile mental health, staggering debts.

I know the logical course of action to overcome most of these. Some of them are very complicated issues that will take a long time to fix. Others are a matter of a couple phone calls and paperwork.

The problem is, I am constantly battling debilitating anxiety and suicidal ideation. Having these problems makes me want to die. Facing these problems makes me want to die. Avoiding these problems makes me want to die. But the path of least resistance, for my anxiety, is avoidance.

I flinch when my phone rings. My stomach curls into knots and my heartrate shoots up when anyone confronts me about any of the shit that I am struggling to deal with. Whenever I'm faced with a difficult conversation I cannot get out of, I immediately steer into placation, submission, diversion, outright dishonesty, anything to *just make the fucking conversation end or make the person I'm talking to not escalate into yelling at me*. I will make promises I can't keep, I will say anything to just avoid being screamed at.

The *actual* likelohood that I will be screamed at by the people currently in my life is very low but I am literally incapable of keeping my brain from going into fight-or-flight (and I don't fight unless pushed to the absolute limit). This is the kind of programming created by decades of trauma that will only be undone by therapy aided by medication. The list of people who I can comfortably talk to about uncomfortable things isn't even an entire person long.

But the people in my life, the largely stable and mostly neurotypical adults, who want so badly to help me, don't understand this.

How do I explain that, yes I know avoiding my problems will not solve them, but being forced to discuss them can and will make me spiral? How do I explain that I do know what to do but ""encouragement"" or in-loco-parentis advisement makes it even harder for my brain to muster sufficient dopamine and seratonin (and not obscene amounts of cortisol)? How do I convey that anything I agree to in our conversations cannot be trusted?

How do I put it in nice, non-hurtful terms that I would rather bite off a finger than ""talk""?",19Dec2019,3
767,"Hi, I'm a young teen diagnosed with high functioning autism otherwise known as Aspergers. I aspire to become a soldier when I'm old enough to join (18) in my lovely small country Ireland. I have the physical side of things taken care of (I'm still trying to further my fitness, I'm not saying I'm military ready just now) since I do a lot of sports and eat right, this includes combat sports obviously without weapons.

The only problem is, well, I'm a crybaby. When I was younger my brother had gotten a lot more attention then me with my parents and I found tat if I acted up or cried then I could get attention too. So thats what I did, I would act up and cry to get the attention of my parents since I never got it. Negative attention was better then no attention. This isn't because they thought he was better then me or anything, though I did believe this, it was actually because my brother is also on the spectrum and diagnosed before me as he was more obvious. 

Now I do get positive attention for my achievements both in school and in sports, but I still go back to crying whenever I'm sad or scared. I know this will not go down well in the military and I was hoping you guys could teach me tricks to stop this. I'll need something else to channel my negative energy on when I can't train (training helps me relax, can't do that all the time unfortunately).

776,"I’ve been very stuck on this same situation for a very long time. I need any advice, any (serious) input because I don’t know what’s right at this point and I feel like I’m losing my mind. I’m posting this on my throwaway for obvious reasons and I need to be careful about details so people can’t identify me but I will try my best to explain. 

I am in my mid 20’s. My entire life, my family and home life have been very rocky. I myself had mental health issues from the time that I was a little kid (though I obviously didn’t know that at the time because I was too young to realize it). As I grew up and it started to come up, I could tell that my family didn’t believe me. Sometimes they would outright say it and sometimes would just ask strange questions or make passive aggressive comments. But anyway, I started reaching out for help from a young age even without their knowledge because I couldn’t handle it. Basically, I’ve had a LOT of therapists (I started with the high school counselor and then when I went to college I started seeing therapists in the schools counseling department). None of them really helped, and a lot of them were flat out unprofessional which is why I kept moving onto another one. 

Anyway, to shorten this VERY long story, I now have a therapist who has helped me “see the light” so to speak. After talking with her I’ve come to realize that my family and upbringing were completely not normal or healthy. I’ve been downplaying it my entire life because I was raised to believe it was all fine. But the truth is, they’ve been controlling everything my entire life. They’ve always been very strict, they have always given very mixed signals which messed with my head, they say things that have made me insecure, they have access to my money. 

And people keep telling me to just leave, and “you’re an adult, they can’t control you” but people don’t seem to understand that when you’re brought up a certain way and raised to believe that this is normal, you can’t just turn on a switch and completely change your views. 

I’m terrified to leave. Not because I don’t think I could do it. I know it would be hard to support myself and all, but my fear is that my parents will find a way to take my money or other things from me as soon as I tell them that I’m leaving. I’m afraid that my entire family will disown me if I leave. 

But ever since I made the realization with my therapist that this isn’t normal and that I CAN leave despite them making me believe I couldn’t, my anxiety has been through the roof. I’ve always had anxiety but lately, I have been having brutal panic attacks, especially if I’m “home” for too long, and I’m having such a hard time focusing at work because it’s all I can think about. Any time I bring it up to one of my friends, they all immediately agree that I need to leave ASAP because they know the whole situation but there’s a part of me that keeps thinking “is it really THAT bad though?” And I feel like I answer that question differently every time I think it. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t afford to get my own place quite yet. My therapist suggested taking what I could and living with a friend until I can find a place, but I just don’t know what the best option is or if I should be leaving at all. 

I’m sorry that was so long but I’d really appreciate any insights. Thank you.",19Dec2019,1

779,"This girl who I was friends with from 3rd to 7th grade became practically my enemy and now is warning me about a guy I like. She says he hes creepy, clingy, aggressive, and violent.

This story is two years long so to help I’m going to put bullets for her background:

Girl: 

-has self destructive behavior 
-smokes weed and drinks a lot
-stole my boyfriend awhile back while I was in the hospital 
-watched me attempt suicide while she was sleeping over at my house
-had a thing with the guy I like at the beginning of the year
-has an ED
-randomly texts me every once and awhile for the past few months to just say hi and once apologized for her behavior in the 7th grade
everything she’s done

So now the real problem:

A week and a half ago I met this guy and I really like him. He’s helped me when I’m sad, he’s funny, cute, and he has interesting things to talk about. The way we met was pretty awful- my friends came over and thought it would be a good idea to prank him by pretending I had a crush on him and wanted to do him... I knew nothing about him at that point and had never met him. I ended up feeling so horrible about the prank and told him the truth about it. He was upset of course because I had totally played with his emotions but he didn’t get mad. He and I kept talking after that and we’d stay up texting until midnight or later every night. Turns out he and I ride the same bus so we met up one day and started riding the bus together everyday since. Just two days ago he told me he liked me and we held hands and he put his arm around me. I felt safe, sure, and happy. And then yesterday this girl who is my ex best friend sits down next to me in class and tell me she wanted to let me know she knew I was talking to him. She said something about being worried and that he was super nice to her but he turned out to be super creepy. Her just talking to me, and especially about that, pushed me to my limit and I sobbed and had to go home early. I assumed that she has been sexually taken advantage of by him and after talking to a friend of mine who is also her friend we came to the conclusion it was okay for me to keep talking to him. But later that afternoon the girl texts my friend saying why he’s bad she said that he’s violent, clingy, and aggressive and that he choked her and made her bleed. I grew up with an abusive father so I know better than a lot of people the facade abusers can have. I just can’t tell if the abuser is her or him- or both of them. I’m completely and utterly lost and scared about all of this. We’re all 15 years old and I don’t know how this is something I have to be worried about, it’s all so horrible and ridiculous. 

In summary: I don’t trust this girl because of everything she’s done, this guy has never scared or worried me and I don’t see any warning signs so far at least, I haven’t known this guy very long, my dad and other people in my life are people who flip on a dime and I’m scared that he’ll be like them

I’m more lost and scared than I have been for a long time, I don’t know who to trust. Please help me.",19Dec2019,1

She knows that I like staying home and being alone, but she says that she will contact the parents of kids at school to ask if their kids want to go go-karting for my birthday. I don't want to go go-karting. I told her this. 

I asked her that it's MY birthday, shouldn't it be MY decision on what I do? She said she doesn't care. I told her that last year was the ONLY year I've ever had a birthday to myself. She said she hated that when I said I liked it. I asked her that since it's my birthday, shouldn't it only matter if I'M happy with it? She said, once again, that she doesn't fucking care.

I get not wanting your kid to become a hermit, but seriously. It's my birthday. I've had birthdays doing shit with other kids I don't like for the past fifteen birthdays. My sixteenth birthday was the only birthday in recent memory I know I fully liked. 

I don't want presents. I don't want people wishing me happy birthday. I don't want to do special shit for a day that means practically nothing. 

Sorry if this is rambly but. I really need some advice on this.",19Dec2019,1
785,"I'm a 29f professional circus artist/stuntwoman. 

I can't seem to absorb more than one auditory thing at a time, or I definitely at least struggle a LOT doing it. I was talking to my friend about it because we were at a bar the other night and a song I liked came on while we were talking, and I couldn't really absorb what he was saying because I was so focused on the music. It's not that the song was incredible or even a favorite, but I have to either completely block out the song in order to chit chat with a friend, or stop the conversation completely in order to listen to the song. Doing both is challenging. It's like two Chrome tabs are open and playing songs at once and I have to click on each one every few seconds to view the page in order to keep up with what's going on, but hearing both at once is too much and I can't hear what either are saying. 

Another thing I noticed is that I never have background music/TV playing in the background when I'm at home/in my room. I prefer silence.  I'd never be able to play background study music in school because it'd always distract me no matter what kind of song was playing. Same with TV shows: I can never just have a show playing in the background (unless it's a rerun I don't care about and I'm going to sleep). But if I'm watching a show, I'm WATCHING the show completely. 

Is this common? When I explained it to my friend, he seemed a little surprised I work in this way.",19Dec2019,1

Anyways, I found messages between them and a friend saying they wanted to take a break and that they were interested in one of our coworkers(we work together).

791,"(F) I’m a teenager in high school, just got out of a pretty toxic relationship a week ago. It’s been tough but I’m slowly starting to become happier about it.

The thing is that i have made many through him including one who I’ll just call P. So P is moving in a couple weeks and her friends are throwing her a surprise party. Before my ex boyfriend and and I broke up, we were both invited. 

Now I don’t know what to do because I want to go to the party to say goodbye to P and this seems like the only chance to do it in person. Also, I’ll see all my mutual friends I have with my ex and it sounds fun. The problem is that he will be there and we just barely broke up so it might cause tension and awkwardness.

He wants to talk to me and try to get back with me again, but I just want to go to the party for P and enjoy myself. Should i go to the party and risk conflict with the ex or just not go at all and miss out?",19Dec2019,1

The guy and I had a miserable falling out after trying to save the friendship multiple times. I eventually gave up on him and blocked his number and social media. His sister said she was incapable of being a neutral third party. I asked if she still wanted to be friends, and though she didn't really give me a straight answer, continues to call and text (she reached out to me first after I ended things with her brother.) I messaged her asking if it would be ok if I sent her a Christmas card since she still lives with her brother, and she didn't answer my question and changed the topic.

My birthday is coming up soon and I would like her to be there. Would it be in poor taste of me to invite her? I understand that this is a complex situation and don't want to make her uncomfortable, but I also don't want her to feel excluded because she didn't do anything wrong.

795,"This is especially relevant with women (I‘m m18)
I‘m trying to make this short, if you need extra info, feel free to ask. I don‘t know how to deal with situations where I give more than I take. I don‘t wanna punish the girl for not being as present as I am (especially when they have a boyfriend) maybe this is confusing, let me give you an example

Let‘s take this one girl: I am really sure that I actually used to have better conversations with her, even if she had a boyfriend during that time, and still has. Well, we formed a great friendship, nothing serious, I wasn‘t pushing her or anything, I was just observing the situation, what happens happens.

Well I started really really noticing that she avoids eye contact with me now, talks in very small phrases. The fact that she does that is really not the main problem, but I don‘t know how to react. i don‘t want to be someone‘s friend and be generally caring if she very rarely acts like she appreciates it, but I also don‘t wanna walk around forcing myself not to care for that girl at all

Basically I respect her desicion to approach me differently now (I did talk to her about it months ago, she agreed she‘s doing these things and that she‘s sorry, it‘s all okay with our friendship she claimed)
But probably because I know a different side of her, this feels weird now. I am not gonna beg her to be the old one and the problem is not her desicion, but I just don‘t wanna be that caring when she clearly doesn‘t value things I say, and I also don‘t wanna force myself to be absent, and I also don‘t wanna try to change her.  I wanna act how a confident man would act, not be the desperate looking guy who keeps on being very polite while the person is not interested.

Why am I struggling to find that balance? I wanna treat her kindly, but i soend way too much time thinking about if she deserves that, whenever I do plan the slightest polite gesture. I‘m emotionally attached but I don‘t wanna rip the leach appart and play the „It‘s your fault, I don‘t care for you now“ card

798,"Ok long enough story, sorry about this. 

As a self described outcast who does his own thing, I've miraculously been bullied only once in my life. The rest of the time of I've either met people who have accepted me for who I was or learnt to be a social chameleon and stayed out of trouble.

I was bullied once in my life in Junior High by an older kid and it was enough to contemplate suicide. It wasn't just me reassuringly. He was a bad egg. Picked on other kids, was disruptive in his classes. There was loads of files on him and his two accomplices in the school admin office. 

Long story short a superperson who will remain unidentified stepped in and it stopped.

Years later after the bully and I left school I found out through a mutual contact in our school network that the bully trespassed  into the school and then a classroom in balaclava having been hired by another student, to physically assault a teacher who subsequently had to take a sabbatical and never found out who the culprit was.

The bully has long since fled the country but is easily traceable due to the friends in common we have on Facebook (no I'm not friends with him obviously) and despite having no profile pics available and a modified name, it is very obvious it is him. 

The question is should I now begin a campaign of anonymous threats and aggression, threatening to grass him out and giving him cryptic hints that I know he was behind the stunt, or should I let it go? I hate unfinished business.

Thanks guys",19Dec2019,1
800,"If you can’t tell, this is a throwaway account for what I hope are obvious reasons.

I grew up in a lower-middle-class household with high expectations for behavior.

After I got into my mid-to-late teens, punishments weren’t particularly unfair or severe, but growing up, my father had anger issues, and my mother has always been and still is very passive-aggressive and overbearing (particularly regarding my social life), and while it was very difficult to push her over the edge, when she *was* angry, she tended to go overboard and scream and threaten to strike me and my sibling, on occasion even actually hitting us (my mother is not a small woman, if she hit us, we got a bruise).

I don’t blame either of them for the way they act, my mother has good intentions with how she handles things and is a nice person to be with 99% of the time, and my father has gotten much better at handling his anger and is a much calmer, more thoughtful person; however, growing up, their ways of doing things made it difficult to do things I enjoyed, even when I wasn’t in trouble for one thing or another.

I learned how to tell a convincing lie at a young age, and figured out a lot of tricks to avoid getting into trouble or having to deal with responsibilities. I would conveniently “forget” things or hide things, or make up stories about how I was having trouble doing something to postpone actually having to do it. I began lying to teachers, friends, and acquaintances. I even lied about things that were completely inconsequential and pointless, not for any sort of gain, but just because lying became so easy.

This became a habit as I went through elementary and middle school, and even worked through most of high school, but I’ve grown to loathe that habit and began working a little bit to break it, but I never had any motivation to do so, and so it persisted simply because I never tried to work on it.

Now, though, I have a girlfriend. We’ve been together for 9 months, and it’s a serious relationship. I love her immensely, and she’s my best friend, but my lying habit has hurt her multiple times already, and will kill things between us if I don’t break it soon. She has the opposite talents as me in that she’s incredibly good at knowing when someone is lying to her, and she can’t stand it when they do. We’ve nearly broken up 3 times already because of stupid or even small mistakes I’ve made and lied about, and I’m certain the next time I lie will be the last before she breaks things off with me to protect herself.

My girlfriend has been extremely patient and supportive as I’ve tried to deal with this, but, understandably, simply can’t keep waiting forever for me to work out this problem.

I’m at a loss as to what to do. I don’t lie anymore in a calm state of mind, as I can easily reason myself out of lying when my instinctive thoughts tell me to, but it becomes a problem when I becomes stressed or panicked. I frequently make irrational decisions despite the fact that I’m fully aware telling the truth would make the situation better, and lying is practically guaranteed to make the situation worse.

I’ve tried counseling (I just ended up lying to the counselor), keeping track of the lies I tell in a journal (I didn’t write several lies down because they were small and by the time I had an opportunity to write them down, I’d completely forgotten that I had lied at all), and several other ways of breaking long-term habits, but nothing I’ve found so far has worked.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.

TL;DR: I have a deep-seated habit of lying and I can’t figure out how to stop.",19Dec2019,1

803,"I've [M27] been seeing a girl [F21] who I met on Tinder for about a month. We were briefly exclusive, though she had trouble stopping banging other people. She was developing feelings for me, and I have not really felt the same. We talked this week, and I mentioned this to her. She was pretty sad. When she asked me what I want in an ideal world, I told her I still want to be her friend, and I still want to have sex. She said she wanted this too. We ended up having sex after we talked, but I am getting the feeling that I should end things more permanently because I want us to truly be friends after we stop having sex, and her feelings -- and my lack of feelings -- will complicate having a friendship. I need to talk to her again to see where she's at.

Today I matched with a friend from college [F27] on Tinder, and it seems like we're hitting it off.

Here's the rub: I play in a band and I have a show coming up next week. I would like to invite [F27], but I am worried that [F21] is going to want to come as well. It seems like I have a few options.

-End things with [F21] permanently before the show and say we should just be friends. I don't want to do this because she's a fun hang and the sex is mind-blowing. But maybe this will end up being the best option in the long run? It seems like her feelings won't just go away, especially if we keep having sex.

-Hold off on inviting [F27] to the show. This might be the path of least resistance, but there's also a critical window when she's interested that I would want to meet up with her, and I'm not playing another show for a while.

-Be totally honest with [F21], tell her I met someone who I invited to the show, and she can decide whether or not to come. This seems like a terrible idea that will end with her keying my car. Maybe there is a way to finesse this, but probably not.

-Invite [F27] and make up some reason why [F21] should not come to the show. My whole extended family actually will be at the show, but it seems kind of weird to tell [F21] not to come because of that.

I don't know what to do. Even if [F27] can't come, I don't really want [F21] to come to the show because I can't give her the kind of attention she wants -- we'll both be sad. I've never done the friends with benefits thing before. I think it would be cool to have a friend to meet up with where we can take care of each other's needs every now and then, but the fact that she has feelings makes things really complicated.

As a bit of background, I am the shortest person in my group and I'm usually the one that you can spot first because I am a bit too short for my age. I am considered either the jokester, the cutest, the leader, the one that fools around the most etc.

As a group (around 5-6 ppl) we usually hang around just wandering through our town. We joke around, do random things, buy questionable items... overall having just a fun time together.

 As we joke we hit ourselves sometimes, like a light punch to the shoulder or something. We do that since we know we are all okay with this. Sometimes one would hit someone when they say something, make a joke.... anything really.

I usually don't like saying certain things just because i get hit almost everytime. It occurred to me about 4 months ago that I get hit the most. I don't like it. I told my friends to stop and they just respond with 'oh, you're just complaining' or 'you just think you're hit the most', or they just treat it as a joke.

813,"I know I’m not the first person to have this problem, but I really need some help.

Ever since a kid I’ve been really good. I don’t get in trouble at school, I don’t do drugs and I actually try my hardest to stay away from them (best friend became addicted to weed a couple years ago and watching him become a different person has made me scared of them), and I try my absolute hardest to make my parents happy, and I definitely try to be on my best behavior because of the insane anxiety I get from being judged from my parents. That’s the problem here.

I can’t come home from school without being anxious that my Dad is home. If I see his car in the driveway I feel a wave of dread rush over me. Same thing with my Mom, but less since she’s honestly a lot less intimidating and though she tries to scare me it honestly just makes me strive harder to succeed and show them I don’t need their support. Nonetheless I don’t like being yelled at by them. Basically what I’m trying to say is I do my absolute best at everything I do, and my parents never seem to praise me or tell me “Good job” or anything like that, but as soon as I do any simple thing wrong I get scolded and yelled at. It honestly makes me feel like they think I’m a criminal. 

They don’t support me in anything. They think I’m a liar, and my Mom has told me countless times that I’m a disrespectful prick because her co workers say stuff about me (Works at my school) for example the Principal said hi to me and I honest to God didn’t hear it, so I didn’t say hi back and he went and told her that I was ignoring her, therefore I get screamed at and when I try to prove my point I get called a liar.

My friends know how good of a person I am and I swear I’m not just saying that. I live life in fear of my parents so I am the best person I can be.

Another thing is, they don’t try to relate with me in any way. Anything I like or show interest in they shut down. My sister goes to about 6-7 concerts a year. I’ve never been to one because my parents don’t support that I listen to hip hop and rap. They think all my favorite artists talk about is raping girls, robbing people, and killing police. My favorite artist is Lil Peep... if they cared to look into him any further than his tattoos, they would see he was a pretty good guy with some problems he couldn’t help, but no. They shut any of my interests down and make fun of them. Not exaggerating, literally everything I enjoy. I hate living here and I hate spending time with them. I do nothing but try to make them proud, and I get nothing in return for that, but when I do the smallest thing wrong I get screamed at. I’m lost.",19Dec2019,1
814,"He was abusive. There's no question.

If I was ever too busy to hang out, he would interrogate me into giving an answer for what I was doing, and he would insist that I put off my other plans for him.

When we were together and he was driving, he would refuse to drop me off when I asked him to. He'd just keep driving for longer. If I asked to be dropped off at 9, unless it was for a paper I needed to turn in, he'd really end up dropping me off closer to 10:45 or 11.

He did a lot of things like this. He never physically assaulted me, but this was still really abusive. Two weeks ago, when he refused to drop me off after I asked him twice, I decided that would be the last time. I later texted him saying we couldn't be friends anymore because he didn't listen to my wishes or respect my boundaries.

He was weirdly understanding and didn't put up any kind of fight.

Yes, I know it was an abusive relationship, and I know I did the right thing by getting out of it. No need to convince me otherwise.

I still miss him calling and texting me everyday, wanting to know how I am doing. I have other friends who show care, but no one else is as interested as this guy was.

I miss having someone so interested in the minutae of my life. I could tell him a stupid story about strawberry yogurt I ate, and he would remember every detail of it.

If I told you the strawberry yogurt story (it's a long story), I bet you wouldn't care at all about it, and you'd stop listening 30 seconds in. This guy, even though he was really abusive, was different in that regard.

By no means am I comparing this to pedophilia, but a lot of pedophilia victims feel like they have a bond with their abuser. Sometimes they even visit their abusers in prison, and keep in touch after they turn 18. I'm not saying this is good, but I understand why it happens. People who groom and prey on children are HORRIBLE, but they make it look as though they're really care about their victims, and that can leave a lasting emotional attachment.

815,"i (18F) am a first year college student, so naturally i’m pretty frugal. i always have been frugal, but especially since starting college i hardly ever spend money on myself. i don’t have a job while at school &amp; don’t plan on getting one until next school year, so i’m living off savings i worked for over the summer (i’m working at the same job right now over holiday break). i absolutely love going to concerts, it’s favorite thing to do &amp; makes me very very happy. most of the time i tend to see smaller artists where the tickets are &gt;$30 for an all standing GA floor. i more recently started listening to harry styles (was never a big fan of 1D) &amp; especially with his new album out, it really spoke to me! additionally i think he is a good person who is spreading positives messages so i think i would really enjoy seeing him in concert (he also happens to come to my city on my birthday). now since he’s obviously a huge mainstream artist the show is at the biggest concert venue in town, so the tickets are quite expensive. the seat i’m looking at would cost around $200 (they go up to $500). i have enough in my account where i can comfortably afford that, but then my brain goes into “well you could use that money towards gas, groceries, etc.” obviously i don’t want anything bad to happen, but we all know sometimes life doesn’t go perfectly &amp; if i ended up with an unexpected cost (i.e. car needs something fixed) i feel like i would beat myself up over using that money towards a ticket vs leaving in my savings if a situation like that were to occur. thankfully i have been receiving money from relatives as christmas gifts, &amp; with that alone i can already afford over half the cost of the ticket (but then i go into the situation above where i think i should put in my savings). i know i’m putting a lot of thought into this, but that’s what i do, i’m just a chronic over thinker. i get stressed out fairly easily by an financial issues so that’s why i’m putting so much thought into this. any advice in helping me make the decision? i appreciate any &amp; all feedback. thanks for your help!

TL:DR! i’m a pretty frugal college student seeking advice to know if its worth it to spend money on a fairly expensive concert ticket for an artist i’ve only recently become obsessed with.",19Dec2019,1

819,"I have started a job recently and I have been there for a few weeks. I haven't been in this situation before and I'm not sure how to cope with it anymore. 

There is this girl I work with every day, and she is just a horrible person. Let me give you little examples..

She placed rubbish on the counter while I was serving and said ""Bin"" really rudely and I was confused and looked her and asked her ""Do you want me to put that in the bin?"" She said yeah and I just told her to do it herself, so she threw it over the counter and said everyone else does it for her and acted really angry and pushed passed me from that moment on. It was bizzare. 

She asked me to put something in the bin another day and was really rude and I said ""maybe say please ?"" And she said ""what are we 6 years old ?"" And I just turned away. And she got angry at me for a very long time, yet again. 

The other day, she took over my till and tried to make me scan my staff card for her friend I was serving and I didn't do it, so she apologized to her friend in front of me. Yet again I didn't say anything because I was fuming. She talks badly to me in front of customers when I ask for help, she gets pissed off and barely replies to me, then acts like we're all good and friends. 

I used to have a lot of anger issues in the past and it is taking all of me not to say anything, because I don't think I would be able to say anything to her in a controlled manner, so I am quiet and try my best to brush it off and ignore her.  

Everyone dislikes her because she is rude and constantly angry and walks around like she can do whatever she wants and it's horrible. The problem is, the bosses don't put there foot down with her and I don't think they can really do anything, even if they did. 

I'm only casual and everyone's advice to me is to just stay quiet because if I problem does occur with her, they will get rid of me and I can't afford to lose this job.


Is there any coping mechanisms or ways to deal with this? I'm struggling to keep my sanity at the moment and let someone constantly walk over me.

822,"TLDR; Wife has a crush on a woman. She is clearly developing feelings for her and trying to stop. Won't discuss with friend. Its starting to feel a bit like emotional cheating. I could tell mutual friend, or not. Don't know what to do about this.  


My wife hasn't cheated on me, either sexually or otherwise. And without going into detail just take my word for it that my wife has a HUGE crush on this woman.  


When I first noticed this I started razzing my wife a little bit nothing harsh just saying things like ""We going to see your girlfriend babe?"" We see this woman with regularity.  


Now I like the friend in this case, her and I get along well I feel, someone I could/would undoubtedly hang out with. She and me (Her and I?) are very similar and under different conditions I could even see myself with her. But we aren't under those conditions, and I love my wife like a lot. I can see why my wife likes her so much.  


Eventually it became clear these feelings were bothering my wife. Whatever she is thinking about she clearly looks at as some kind of betrayal of me. I know this because she will not talk about them, at least not sober. As soon as she gets alcohol in her she begins talking about kissing her (our I suppose) friend and how much she likes her. When I point out that shes talking about it, she will quickly shut up and refuse to answer any questions about it.  


She has begun trying to blame me for her feelings for whatever reason. I think she thought telling me she had a crush on her would cause an argument between us and I replied ""Well, I mean those are normal feelings as long as you don't act on them its cool."" (It not being a man makes it easy for me to feel this way. Just being honest)  


It doesn't help that her family (Despite voting liberal) are incredibly conservative. My wife seems confused about her sexuality, and I think its scaring her. I think shes falling into the fear that she likes women more than men. (She likes penis a bit to much for this to be a real problem. I've seen her porn history, and had sex with her so I would be in the know.) I told her that if the feelings were bothering her I could arrange a threesome and she could explore her sexuality in a safe environment with me there and I would be ok with that. Or alternatively we could see if her crush would want to give it a shot. (She doesn't, long and short of it, I didn't speak with her friend but its pretty clear thats probably the case.)   


However recently I've noticed a shift in how she talks about it. She talks less about it like ""I have these feelings and I'm confused."" and more like ""I don't want to lose you. I'm happy with what we have."" However will then go on to talk about how hot or attractive our friend is.  


Now I am incredibly satisfied with my wife up to this point. We have never had any problems in our relationship (and I mean none!) and I know I would never leave her. I personally have feelings of polyamory, but they aren't really a big deal because I know I'm with someone I really love.   


I angled my argument from the ""poly"" side and started trying to talk about how we could get into a relationship with another girl and try dating her, if my wife as OK with it. Yada yada. I was really just trying to show her that it was ok to talk about these kinds of feelings and emotions. She had 0 problems talking about it with me until I started asking her what she thought of it. Then she shelled up and refused to speak.   


At this point it is, to me starting to feel like cheating. Mostly because she won't open up with me about this and its been 3 months. Now I don't know exactly what my wife is feeling and it may not be 'emotional' cheating. She could just be confused. So I offered a solution and this is when it became more like ""yeah, this feels wrong.""  


I said ""Look, our friend doesn't seem like the type to be a POS because you confess your feelings for her. You could just talk to her about it with me there (preferably, but I wouldn't force this) and if she rejects you the feelings will pass.""  


My wife then started going on about how she didn't want to ""Lose what she had with her."" Now to me this translates directly to: ""I don't want to lose the oxytocin (love/addiction) response my brain gives me when shes around. I want to feel like theres hope of a relationship with her."" I'm not a woman so maybe its different, but thats what I would mean by that. I personally ALWAYS confess these feelings to women, explicitly to get rejected and move on. Doubly so if they are my friends (because they should be understanding if they are actually my friend, and help/let me move past them.)  


At one point I even got confused and was like ""I have a crush on friend too."" After a discussion of this with my wife where she said I was putting my emotions on her. Then like 2 hours passed and I was like ""Wait no I fucking don't. My wife brings her up all the time, not me.""  


Example of how hard this crush is: My wife is explicitly against marajuana. Until friend said she smoked weed. Then my wife wanted to smoke with her. I'm personally a no peer pressure kinda person, so is friend.  


My options are:  


Keep my mouth closed, and don't tell her friend about this. Which has MOSTLY predictable results, but could have a single really bad one.  


Tell friend, which has unpredictable results entirely.  


I feel like its wrong to tell her friend, so friend can put her down lightly, because my wife doesn't want me to, but push is becoming shove, and I don't think I have much of an option here.

824,"Hi, I have a manager who has been harassing me 24[m] for a few months now. Condescending, talking down and telling me off whenever we are alone. He waits until we are alone and harasses/bullies me and around others will act like my best friend. He gets other people to write rude emails to me (he has a quite senior role) and then denies all accountability. 

Recently it became too much and I fired back, writing a few rude emails. Which I realise now I shouldn't have because that seems to have made things worse. He turned it around to make it seem like I'm the bad guy and being abusive. He doesn't speak to me but follows or waits for me at certain places and just stares at me. 

Today, he had his phone on camera and I'm pretty sure was recording me walk around. When I got out of view I heard a beeping noise like video camera mode being turned off. The way he did it, made it seem super obvious he was waiting for me and made sure no one was around.

He's had a ton of complaints against him but nothing could stick because there was no evidence and without out that apparently nothing can be done.

Need help here guys, I have no idea what to do. The video recording is freaking me out. I don't its sexual in nature, I think this is show that he's untouchable? Is this the first time? I feel violated and helpless

825,"Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile!

Reddit, please help me out if you can. I'm tired of this deadweight trait of stagnancy, and I just want to get better, but I feel like I am terrible at improving.

I find I can motivate just fine to do endless research and planning on any number of topics, but can't seem to pull the trigger on actually getting things done unless I'm obligated somehow or it is to someone else's benefit. 

For example, I pay tuition, so I'm financially obligated to show up and do well. Because of that, I have no issue time managing and putting in the effort to maintain honors grades at a high end university, but I put in no further effort past that to get the most out of the experience. I am not in any clubs, have applied for no scholarships or honors programs, and have submitted my work to no competitions. I've outright avoided some opportunities I have been offered, because I wasn't sure I would follow through--- I would rather miss out and regret it than possibly flake, I guess.

I find I cannot motivate myself to go for a walk, even if I'm bored, or to go eat, even when I'm hungry. I will do it happily when my spouse arrives from work and is bored or hungry, but when it is just me, I can't seem to do things even when I want to. My executive dysfunction just says no. Even right now, the lamp is off and the heat is much too low, but light and heat (things that would certainly be comfortable) just don't seem important enough to get it done. After all, I'm not really SUFFERING, and nobody else is here to complain. The cats are fine and fed. So ""why bother?""

I desperately want to overcome this but am not sure how. I know other people experience this, so I want to know: how did you get better at getting better?

826,"I don't know if this is the proper place to go with this, but my family is desperate for answers and we aren't sure where to turn. For the sake of this, ""J"" is my schizophrenic cousin.

""J"" has been going through his second schizophrenic episode. His first episode, he threatened to kill his friend in highschool when they were high on unknown drugs. He was placed in a mental institution, and this is where it was first found out he was suffering from bits of paranoid schizophrenia.

""J"" hasn't had an episode like that until recently, but his capability and mental state has deteriorated from the point of being able to job search, work, and drive... to applying for disability, sitting in a room all day unable to barely distinguish reality from fiction, no license or work to speak of.

""J"" lives with his grandfather. His parents both stopped trying to care for him when he was in his mid teens.

\---

Recently, ""J's"" text messages began getting more skewed, to the point where he was starting to just send out pictures of people's faces, necks, rings, and feet. He then started sending violent, hateful messages to the family such as:

\&gt; I hate you all

\&gt; You all should die

\&gt; You're all the worst

On this same day, he then went and verbally screamed at his cousin until she cried, insulted his grandfather, tried to disown all of us, and got violent to the point that his father had to take him to a mental health institution. He stayed here for a week, showing improvements in medicine at the end. After a week, he was released.

831,"The past 4 years have been especially rough, but I feel like my ""bad luck"" started 8 years ago when my family unexpectedly moved to another state during my senior year of highschool. 

In those 8 years, I've done a lot of good things (graduate with a BA, get married, publish a book, etc) but every day starts with a new struggle. My MIL is a monster and makes our lives miserable, we can't seem to get ahead no matter how hard we try, especially financially. My SO and I feel like we have no friends, because no one asks us to hang out anymore and when we try to throw parties or invite other people, we always get stood up. Our roommates are trash can humans who leave the house a disaster and expect me to clean up after them, but our housing situation is complicated and we only have 4 months left on the lease anyway. Our income keeps shrinking because our hours keep getting cut, and I was laid off this month, so I'm constantly stressed about money.

I know a lot of my problems will solve themselves in 4 months when my SO graduates undergrad and we can move out of student housing and get better jobs but I'm struggling right now seeing past everything I'm currently drowning in. I managed to get a part time job in my field in August, and another job at one of my favorite retail stores, and things seemed like they were going the way they should. Finally we started to claw our way out of the debt my MIL has dropped onto us, and things felt hopeful. But my retail job dropped me to 4 hours a week, so I had to quit, and my other job laid me off at the beginning of December.

My parents moved to another state and I feel cut off from them. I left their faith 4 years ago and ever since then I've felt like they only tolerate me. When I ask my dad for advice, he usually doesn't listen or gives me a Bible verse and sends me $50, like he's paying me to leave him alone.

I've had my fair share of battling anxiety and depression, but I've made a ton of progress (used to have panic attacks multiple times a day but now I only have them once a month or so). At the end of last year, I graduated, and it seemed like everything was starting to line up perfectly. But since January of this year it's all gone downhill, like I'm cursed to never fully grasp the goal or job or opportunity that's right at my fingertips.

It's so hard to stay positive when the things that seem like they are going right suddenly come crashing down.

I'm waiting until after the New Year to job search, as most places I've emailed and called have said they aren't doing anything with hiring until the first full week of January. But the waiting is excruciating, and this is by far the worst holiday season of my life. I love Christmas but this year we are isolated from our families, with Dollar Store gifts under the tree, no party invitations or Christmas cards, and I feel like just sitting on the couch all day in defeat.

838,"I’ve known a girl for almost two years now where I work who I’m interested in. We haven’t been in contact much in about a year - we work in offices that are in different locations (they are near each other though &amp; I do drop by there often). She has strong Christian beliefs (&amp; will not shy away from it when expressing them). I on the other hand am an Atheist.

I like her because she is good-looking (at least in my opinion), courteous, intelligent, hard-working, principled, has viewpoints that align roughly with my own (I find it difficult to connect with other women in this way), doesn’t drink alcohol or take drugs (neither do I) &amp; stands up for herself.

This may come across as arrogant (&amp; I don't intend it to be) but most other women that I interact who could be potential partners appear frivolous. Such things include – unwilling to take life seriously, drinking too much each weekend, focusing heavily on social media, a mentality of “go with the crowd” &amp; not willing to hear opinions that differ from the norm or those that are deemed to be offensive. Of course not all women that are non-religious are like this, but in my age group &amp; in my country &amp; of those that are single, I have found it harder to find someone that ticks the boxes that are important to me. I recognize that people in a relationship don't have to think exactly alike - this girl &amp; myself are an example of that. But on some of the key issues, I just can't find common ground with others.

I tried OLD through POF &amp; I'd get about 5 women per week for several weeks that would show an interest in me. I've exchanged messages with a few &amp; soon enough I found that we wouldn't be compatible.

Yet the point of contention that I can see with this Christian girl will be that of religion. I am very relaxed on the religious beliefs of others these days (wasn’t quite the same when I was younger). Yet she does have strong beliefs. Her family also are strongly religious.

There were several times from about a year ago that made me think that she was interested in me;  striking up meaningful conversations, laughing at each others jokes, we would be in a group of several people &amp; when we all laughed she often directed her attention to me. But the one thing that stood out was eye contact. There would be several times when she would look me dead in the eye for an extended period. At the time I lacked confidence and would look away. In the last year, I’ve gained a lot of confidence &amp; feel much better about myself.

Should I try to go on a date with her? If I do &amp; it goes well, would there any point in continuing with this? At some point religion will come up &amp; this is something that I will not yield on – I am not religious &amp; never will be. However, I feel that should I lose confidence then I'll succumb to pressure from her &amp; her family - with me ultimately kowtowing to her &amp; her family just to remain with her.

Are any of you in a relationship with someone that is religious (or non-religious)?  Do you know of anyone that is? Is such a relationship sustainable?

TL;DR – Attracted to a Christian girl but I’m an Atheist. Is there any point in trying to form a relationship with her?",19Dec2019,1

846,"I work at a small non-profit office that provides mental health counseling. One of the therapists has become very problematic lately.

She is an all-around unpleasant and miserable person to be around. Her attitude is always shitty, groans about/hates seeing clients, is extremely lazy, has other people do everything for her, and only moves to go to the restroom (more on this in a second), and constantly calls in sick or comes in late/leaves early. 

On top of that, she smells. BAD. She is in her 60s, morbidly obese, and clearly doesn't clean herself regularly. It's a rotten crotch shit smell that is truly god-awful. Her office smells to the point where you have to hold your breath to prevent from gagging. On the rare occasions that she does get up and move, she stinks up wherever she goes. Her office still stinks and the stench lingers after she leaves. Clients have complained and asked to be transferred to other therapists or have simply not come back.

Back to the restroom thing. Over the past few months, she has purposefully gone to the restroom and not cleaned up after herself, subsequently forcing other people to clean up her mess. On the toilet seat, she will leave this ungodly foul slime. It's a mixture of shit sludge, sweat, piss, and god knows what else. It's horrific. She is too lazy to clean up after herself. It's been numerous times and she always denies it and blames it on others. But the smell. Oh god THE SMELL. It lingers in the bathroom for over half an hour after she leaves. It's a dead giveaway that it's her.  

Our boss won't do anything about it. I'm fed up. What the fuck can I do or how do I tactfully bring this up to her?

851,"Greetings fellow humans,

I am very worried about my profesional life, as I feel utterly useless right now.

I don't know what to do with my life, and all the options available feel desperate. I studied the equivalent to an English Major here in Spain, plus a master in education, which leaves you with pretty much one and only job opportunity: teaching. In my country, to become a teacher, once you already have the master, you have to go through a very difficult test, which is more luck than preparation sometimes. People might spend from 1 to 6+ year trying to pass the exam and get a high enough grade to become a government worker and be settled for life. Some get lucky and get a spot early, others might even give up hope after a few tries.

The problem is this: I'm not sure anymore I want to be a teacher. I feel like I've wasted my fucking life. Don't get me wrong, I truly enjoyed my major, but I don't feel like doing this at all. I love the English language, but don't feel like being a high school teacher. I try to convince myself, but I just don't feel like it. Yes, the pay is good, the holidays are good, but I just don't feel passionate about it. I think I might do a good job, even a great job. However, I just don't feel any drive within my heart to push forward. And that is fueling up some anxiety.

 I'm pretty fucking scared, since I'm already 25 years old (26 in two months) and I have no experience whatsoever in any other field or anything. I was thinking about the possibility of studying what we call ""professional training"" here in Spain to maybe work coding or something of the sort. At least that way I could find a different job. But I'm scared about it being too late for me to change careers.

Is there anybody in a similar boat? What would you recommend?

Thank you for reading until this point and hope you have a great day,

defnac

I keep seeing people say the way to be self confident is to accept your flaws.

It feels like ""love yourself, accept your flaws"" only really applies to flaws like ""I'm too nice"" or ""I work too hard""

859,"I’m a 16 y/o girl and have suffered with eating disorders and have been extremely self deprecating for as long as I can remember. Depression, anxiety and eating disorders are strongly present on both my mums and my dads side. I think the self deprecating is mainly to do with the fact that I perform and have extremely high expectations of myself so if I don’t reach those I beat myself up over it and I’m beginning to feel like I’m spreading myself too thin. 

When I was younger I was sexually assaulted by a family friend and as a result of this my drive for anything sexual or romantic is very low. Also, a few months ago i found out my boyfriend of five months had been cheating on me for that whole time, sleeping with a girl as I didn’t want to have sex with him, despite him being very pushy. Not only this, my family life is very rocky and it’s tense all the time as we’re treated pretty badly by our parents. 

I feel like when it comes to love and friendships I put up a barrier. I isolate myself and when people don’t try with me I get more upset and feel even more alone so I’m caught in some vicious cycle. Though I don’t really blame them for not trying. As a result of this, if I like anyone and they begin to like me back I end up retracting my feelings and finding myself caught in a sticky situation as I feel as though I’ve led them on (which I feel awful about) but I don’t want anyone being dragged into my shit and having to deal with me being so messed up.

I haven't had a good relationship with my dad for 3 years. I feel very bad about being with him or even hearing his name (he used to always talk to me badly, shout at me, make fun of me, manipulate me, humiliate me and there was a time when I used to stroke my legs too much when I was little), however After all, he is usually a good father.

This involved spending Christmas and New Year with him (my parents are separated). I really do not want to go and I had already decided since before I found out about that gift.  But now, my sister is crying because she did want to go see him, but she did not want to stay long or go alone, and she will not go for that anymore and the tickets have already been canceled.

877,"Thanks for taking the time to read this 🙏🏽 My sister (31F)  and I (29F) have never gotten along nor have we been close since we were around age 8/6. My parents divorced when we were young and our dad passed away from cancer nearly 15 years ago when we were 15/13. 

At the age of 12, which I now realize is when we found out our dad was sick, she started acting out; doing drugs, sneaking out, drinking and partying, physically fighting with my mom and going to juvie at least 15 times. She was a wreck. She started stripping and moved away with someone 20 years older than her and at this point we basically had no clue what she was doing or where she was. 

Fast forward, she now has 4 kids with 3 different guys and is going to jail soon for her 3rd DUI. She’s still living life totally illegally and honestly her life brings down those around her. Whether it be her friends that she’s using to watch her kids for days at a time while she’s out of town “working” or our mom who does anything she can to help for the kids.. or me. 

I went through my teenage stuff early on and totally overcame everything by the time I was 24. Got it all out in the college years, which hey I know everyone is different but I needed to get my parting and drug using out of the way. I’ve always been on my own except for short periods of time when my mom let me stay with her to get back on my feet.

Fast forward on me, I am married to a wonderful and supportive man and have 2 dogs and a beautiful house. I live near my mom but my sister lives 30+ min away from us. My mom raises her oldest daughter and the other three I see maybe 10 times per year at get holiday togethers or birthdays or when we take them to spend the night.

Now, we don’t have kids because we don’t want kids. We enjoy our freedom and quiet and naps so whether this is selfish or not, we take them when WE want to. 
However, my sister (with the lack of any relationship between us) calls me last minute on the weekends and asks me to watch her kids (so she can go party or go out of town)

The boy is ADD+ and absolutely doesn’t behave (as in just smashed her TV with a bat two weeks ago) so he doesn’t come over. The other two are good for short periods of time but We are just not KID people, so I usually say no for the sake of not being taken advantage of. 

To be honest, I don’t like my sister as a person and I’ve never said it to her. I’ve always kept my distance and helped if I can but it’s started getting to the point of her making me feel guilty and I absolutely refuse to live my life this way. 

Well, she ruined Christmas this year, yesterday, because no one wants to buy her “boyfriend/father of 2 kids” a present. And this is simply because he has put her in the hospital many times, still beats her, has a major drinking issue and is overall a complete piece of shit.  So no, we aren’t buying him a Christmas present.

I have decided that if she unblocks me after yesterday, I will be telling her that I am done. If she ever finds herself in an emergency, she can call me and I’ll do my best, but aside from that I.am.done. And I know that comes with a price, but the amount of stress she puts on me (sorry I left so much out but I wouldn’t ever finish my post if I included it all) I just cannot do it anymore. 

As a side note, when I lived with her in Miami for a short period of time a few years back, I’m 99.9% sure she had someone pay her to let them rape me. My drink was drugged when I went out with her (overall it was the weirdest night and so many things didn’t add up) but after I woke up the next day in a different city and started realizing what had happened, I found out she had my debit card AND had used it that night at a store near her house, which said debit card was in my wallet that night. I didn’t talk to her for 2 years. The only reason I started talking to her again was because of the kids.

As I grew up, I had no tv or computer and very limited phone access, I was not allowed to leave the house and needed to ask to do anything and now that I'm an adult I feel like I've gained no hobbies because of that. I work and spend time with friends but when I'm alone I dont know what to do with myself. All I can think to do is watch youtube videos on my phone or browse social media.

We use telenet for internet, tv, land line, mobile phones and what not.

This happend a couple of other times (we use to much data apparently) but since yesterday I realised it was realy realy slow, long story short turns out they cut it back to 1mb/s... Normaly they cut it in half but this is realy slow are they allowed to do this at all and can we do something about this?

She’s moving to a more expensive city for a less than a $1 raise and taking the dog. She says she upset and doesn’t want to move away from me but is too lonely here. Then says I’ll come back and see you all the time. I said you’ll have to make friends and find a boyfriend to not be lonely. She said she doesn’t make friends easily. Also her work here offered to give her better hours to stay and she turned them down. Tell me how is she going to to be less lonely living an hour plus away from all her current friends and family yet not want to try and make friends.

I don’t want her to move or take the dog that far away from me. Maybe I’m just being selfish. I don’t think she realizes that on the money she is going to be making and how expensive it is to live in this big city it’s going to be hard. I don’t even know what my question is anymore.

893,"Here is the scenario. I'm splitting an air bnb that has 2 bedrooms with two beds each to a room, and a living room with a bed with some friends.

This is a climbing trip and we are strictly using it to sleep for the night out of town.

There will be 5 of us total. My wife and I, Friend A and his brother, and Friend B.

The total cost is $200

I work, my wife does not.

I believe that the fairest way to split it (ASSUMING Friend A's brother is paying for himself) is 4 ways: $50 for myself and my wife who will be taking one bed, $50 for Friend A, $50 for brother, and $50 for Friend B.

Friend A believes the cost should be split 5 ways @ $40 per person.

My argument against this is that seeing as how my wife does not make her own income i will be paying $80  which is double what everyone else is paying even though the sleeping arrangements would be exactly the same if she did not come.

If Friend A's Brother was not paying for himself It would then be unfair to friend A with a 4 split and i would agree to a 5 way split. However since Friend A's brother has his own money I believe a 4 way split is fair.

A girl (28) I consider my (29) best friend - though we live a couple of hours apart and don’t get to talk often because we are busy moms - has recently started a new business making various crafts. Her work is beautiful and I messaged her as soon as she posted hand-crocheted (I hope - they may be knitted, I know they’re SUPER different and I don’t mean to offend anyone by guessing wrong!) toques* that look like a certain animal. She offered me a discounted price for one for my baby but I told her I was happy to pay full price to support her. I told her the style I would prefer and she said she’d get to work on it as soon as she finished a large order she was currently working on. I told her no worries at all, as long as my baby had it for the majority of the winter I’d be stoked! And happy to tag her in posts and promote her business. She said thank you, and that was that. 
*(toques are what we in Canada call a beanie or a warm, knitted hat)

That was about two months ago and it is now approaching the worst part of winter and I haven’t heard anything about it. Like I said, we are both super busy and she went on vacation recently so I completely understand why it may have taken some time. She also posted about a few new items recently so she’s clearly working hard! She kicks ass and I’m so proud of her. 

I want to inquire about the toque as politely as possible but I can’t seem to find the right wording, can anyone help me out? I don’t necessarily need it any specific time except before spring, but I want to make sure she hasn’t forgotten in the busyness of life.

898,"Hey everyone

I am a 23 years old Male doing my bachelors abroad. I am quite happy about my situation and I have almost nothing to complain about in my personal life besides some mental problems but I am improving and actively working on it. I do have couple of hobbies that I am passionate about and that I am sort of good at actually. 

I however have this really bad habit of spending insane amounts of time behind the screen. Growing up I was never able to play computer games comfortably, that meaning my mom or dad would constantly say that I should rather study and etc. But I kept sitting in front of my computer screen through primary and high school. I knew in Uni I would be really free from these annoyences and play games to my heart's desire and stop whenever. I never enjoyed human interactions and socializing back then as well.

Fast forward 5-6 years to myself right now. I am studying in Uni in a place that I like with bunch of people that I enjoy talking to. But whenever I am home and not hanging out with someone, I am always on my desktop computer wasting time. I had a conversation with some friends today about how my life would be If I spent those 7-8 hours a day that I spend on computer doing something else. How different I would be? It really struck me. **8 hours of my day just behind the screen?** Also just know the fact that I am not very interested in video games anymore(althought I still occasionaly play), so rather I just waste my time on YouTube or random ass websites doing nothing. I am really considering getting rid of my desktop and just sticking to my laptop which can do everything I need for school anyways and rather put 1/3 of my day on something else? Maybe exercise more, maybe just sit and have time for myself for an hour a day, maybe read some books, learn an instrument, start writing some stuff, drawing. I don't know just explore different things. This doesn't mean that I will never watch youtube again or anything but when I go back to my parents with my laptop only. I dont spend time on it because I don't enjoy looking at a small laptop screen. Just the fact that I have 2 huge ass monitors sitting on my desk in my room all the time and me being exposed to these every day is really distracting to my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to get some opinions from people that don't know me at all and see what they have to say. So feel free to share your positive and negative opinions about my idea.

899,"Hey. I’m a 15F. I’m a lesbian &amp; let’s just say i’m not the best at finding love. I have never felt strong connections , I always thought that maybe I just would never feel love. I’ve dated guys in the past, was never serious &amp; I never really felt anything. I recently came out to my parents about being gay &amp; they were extremely supportive of me. 

I’m not desperate for love, in fact - I don’t really want to get into a relationship. I don’t believe in love or any of that. I was just vibing with people, just talking to them ; nothing else. My friend recently introduced me to one of her friends, I texted her and we started off a conversation. I definitley thought she was attractive, but nothing too serious. 

After having ONE conversation, I started thinking about her every second of the day. I started daydreaming about what a life would be with her. This is completley unusual for me, because I have never felt this way towards anyone. She has a specific energy &amp; vibe that I’m just completely attracted to. I litteraly feel crazy because I’m constantly checking my phone to see if she has messaged me. 

My friend hung out with her the other day ; I got way too nervous to see her so I stayed home. My friend came home that day telling me everything she said about me. She said that the age was a problem, Im 15, she’s 19. She said she feels like if we did date , her friends would look at her weirdly as I’m so young. I turn 16 in a few weeks, she did say that if I was 16 then it may be a bit better. At first that really upset me, because there’s nothing I can do. I cant change her mind as to why she should date a 15 year old, because I completley get that she may feel a bit weird about it. My friend told me that every few minutes she would say ‘Fuck it. I should just do it, she’s so cute’ It was like she was in doubt with herself. 

I don’t know what to do from here, we have spoken a bit more about goals, music, hobbies &amp; interests. I want to continue our conversation but I’m so nervous to even start it. We told eachother we need to catch up asap, she lives an hour away but she told me she’d drive out for me. I feel like we need to just talk more &amp; see eachother in person.

Her boyfriend is over 5-6 days of the week. He is really quiet and keeps to her room, but it seems as if I have a 3rd roommate even if I don’t see him much. In addition to this, he stays over when both of us are at work. I often come home at 2PM to find that he has been here all day and to be honest it really annoys me.

I am scared of confrontation, but seeing that I have to live with her for another 6 months I know I should bring this up. Do you have advice on ways I can mention this annoyance in a way that doesn’t make her defensive and makes sense? 

An ideal situation for me is him staying over less and then staying at his apartment (he has his own place) or me paying less in rent + utilities because he’s practically a 3rd roommate (although I don’t prefer this route). I’d rather he also not be here when she isn’t at home.

\------

&amp;#x200B;

Last night, I let my friend down by missing her art show. I was having a flareup of depression/ anxiety/ agoraphobia that spiraled into a place of self-loathing and general terribleness.  I had already bought a ticket to her show and told her that I would be there.  I know for a fact that my absence was felt.  Today, I want to call her to apologize, but i feel stuck.  

&amp;#x200B;

We're not super close (talk once a month or so), but we've known each other for over a decade.  Now that I'm older, I'm starting to be able to count 'real' friends on one or two hands.  I'm in my 30s, and one thing I've learned is that it only takes one or two disappointments before people stop investing in flaky friendships.  This has happened before, and I fear that I've lost another friend to my brain-state. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until now, I've never talked publicly about my (sometimes) mental state.  I want to apologize to her, and be honest about what happened, but then I'll turn something that is positive about her life into something self-centered and about my own negativity. I feel like i need to reach out to her somehow, but the only choices that I see are 1) reach out and be honest, but it turns the conversation into a whole ""thing""  -or-  2) Reach out with some excuse, any excuse, for why i couldn't go, and offer my sincerest apology. I don't want to lie about why i wasn't there, but i don't want to put this mental health burden on her.  

&amp;#x200B;

How do i rectify this?  How do i make it up to her? What do i do?",19Dec2019,1
908," 

So this is almost surely a weird one. My parents weren't the best at teaching me basic skills, and after moving out and having a bit of soul searching I realized I should just bite the bullet and ask some questions that I'm embarrassed to not know the answers to. Without further ado:

1. I already brush my teeth once a day in the morning. I'm sure I should be brushing twice however, so I'll begin implementing that. Other than that, how often should I floss, should I use mouthwash?
2. How often should I shave if I want to remain clean-shaven? I currently shave about once every 2 weeks. Is there anywhere else I should be shaving other than my face? If so, how often?
3. How often should I go for a haircut to remain looking good? Also what are some good, easy to maintain haircuts / styles? Is there anything I should do every day in terms of styling my hair, any products I should be using to stay looking good?
4. In terms of cologne, what is the proper amount / method of applying cologne that is not overpowering, also if you have any recommendations for good colognes feel free to let me know.
5. Showering once a day seems like a good guideline, however should I be washing my hair during every shower? I've always washed my hair every shower but I've heard elsewhere that that causes dry hair.
6. I have horrible fashion sense. What is a good place to find what clothes would look good on me? Is it ok to ask a female friend to help me buy some outfits? What are some good stores (online or otherwise) to buy clothes?
7. I go for an hour long run about 3-4 times a week but that is about all, what else should I be including in my routine to build up a decent amount of muscle tone? Getting sick of my slightly flabby stomach.
8. How often should I be clipping my nails? Currently doing it roughly once a week.
9. Never used lip balm, but I realize now that my lips are fairly regularly chapped, how often should I use lip balm and what brands would you recommend?
10. I am a very huge introvert, and am hoping that when I feel like I'm a well-kept human being, I will gain at least a bit of confidence to meet new people. What are some good places to meet people around my age? (keep in mind I am 19 so no bars or clubs) How can I tell if someone is okay with being approached and vice-versa. Also how can I do my best to look approachable?

Sorry for the huge wall of questions. I am just generally lost and appreciate you answering even just one question at a time. Thanks in advance for any help I get!",19Dec2019,1

But recently friend A I'll call them has been angering me but I've just been keeping it in. It's only in small ways like constantly talking and repeating how amazing she is at everything, except maths which she constantly reminds she hate the subject and our teacher (she moved maths classes recently because she purposefully failed several tests so she moved down a set).

I was ready to ask her out and was going to in around a week. Then my bro has a party afterwards my friend has no where to stay so im like stay here all good she lives nearby and they both smoke a dece amount of weed so he was like im gonna stay round hers 'obv not gonna try anything i promise' this guy liked her when me and her first started linking and long story short he gets w her later that night. Next day im w them both basically all day they dont say anything he texts me two days later in the evening telling me and saying like i told her not to tell u cause i wanted to. im really nice about it all to both of them cause i care about them both. this guys been one of my closest friends for 6 years so im like yea we can work this out even though im really upset about it he avoids me all monday at school then i text him like man up come and talk to me tomo. we talk and im happy cause he seemed upfront and honest wanting to work on it. few days later one of our mutual friends tells me basically everything he said to me that tuesday was a lie saying like 'i dont acc like her' 'im not gonna carry things on' because he was trying to protect himself. he knows im pissed at him for like a day doesnt say anything. At a motive a day later someone else has to get him to talk to me we both get upset hes chatting all this shit saying i would end it rn if u want (obv im not gonna tell him to do that) he jus keeps saying im sorry what do i do? he knows exactly how i feel about it all how upset i am i was so nice and he kept screwing me over. Then next two weeks he doesnt even look me in the eye makes no effort whatsoever so basically hes a major bitch cause hes afraid of me (with good reason i should lamp the prick) and just cares about himself he like invites her round to his loads she doesnt go. during this time shes like i cant make my mind up idk. Another motive comes round someone else again has to get him to talk to me i get really upset and i was crying so hard i couldnt even talk. he says to someone else hes disgusted how he could ever do that to someone and knows he needs to make the effort. syke he still hasnt spoken to me and has jus asked her out she said yea. i still like her so much i cant not think about her. when i see them together it hurts so much and he just does not give a fuck. im still good friends w her because she was honest about most of it and obv i still like her. hes basically a massive dick btw and always had been and is to a lot of people bit of a bully and fuckboy but decently popular she said to me she knows she can fuck things up w him cause he would care less cause she cant trust herself. this isnt jus like attraction btw me and her get on so well and like each other during this time we've both had bad days obv and every time (she told me this aswell) we're only cheered up when we're with the other person. me and him have been in the same friendship group for ages and its just made it so much worse splitting it. idk what to do cause its been a month and i cant get over her at all and surely im done with him,19Dec2019,1

M and K are classic office boomers, they make sexist and inappropriate jokes on the job constantly, M even made racist jokes directly to a brand new employee who was a person of color and who subsequently after nocalled no showed until we figured he was done. But then they feel the need to cry constantly about how sensitive the world is and if they so much as hold a door for a woman they will be called rapists. This though, does not seem to stop K from constantly insisting on doing my job (packing, carrying boxes, sometimes even interrupting me with customers) to do my job for me. I of course, let all of this just bounce off of me. This office up until very recently has had them being the majority, so-

1. Any complaint would be less than descreet as office gossip and the fact that we only had 5 employees (two female) for the longest time would have been a dead giveaway.

2. The majority are older and if not one of 2 encouraging the jokes, seem to feel the need to tolerate it. 

But there are some things that have just been crossing a line for me. To name a few, K does not understand personal space with the women in the office. He will interrupt me with customers *while I am in the middle of talking and/or listening to them* not by saying ""excuse me"" but instead by putting his hand on my *lower* back, leaning over my shoulder, and whispering/talking low in my ear. This makes me *extremely* uncomfortable, he has done this quite a few times and some it is casual work related information that in no way cannot be said in front of customers and sometimes it's just to ask if I want anything from the store. I don't want to go into my history with this stuff and why but my reaction is always to freeze up and I'm never sure how to say ""stop"", especially since I don't want to make a scene in front of customers.

Another, is that a few months back, he noticed a hickey on my neck and started chuckling not just to himself but to make it noticable enough for me to ask what was up. To which he then went on to gesture to his neck and chuckle some more. He told me he ""was fine with it"", which okay thanks- I didn't realize I needed his permission for my boyfriend to suck my neck. But it was still embarrassing, I try really hard to keep them covered by turtlenecks and makeup when at work to keep myself looking professional. 

Well, just today, I come in with a small, light, decorative scraf around my neck. I wanted to change things up, I'm feeling a bit warm in the winter weather and being winter it doesn't look out of place. The moment I step into work and my manager leaves the room M says, ""so are you hiding a hickey or did you just want to look pretty today?"", which I just looked at him like, ""what the fuck, dude?"". He said that K said last time (even though it was a month ago) I came in with a hickey, so he just wanted to know if it was a fashion choice or not and began laughing to himself. I rolled my eyes and sarcastically told him that was ""very work appropriate"" but I'm a little more pissed that this was something that got around to him, because it means my other 69-70 year old coworker (with daughters years older than me) was discussing hickeys I have with another middle aged man at my job, on the clock. It creeps me out. 

The only hesitation I have still is that it is only a workplace of 6 and there is no HR department or person, so the only person i could go to is either the men or my boss directly. This doesn't garentee anything will be taken seriously or done about it and I'm thinking if I do complain and my boss pulls them to the side or has a meeting, the most that will happen is that they hear it and think I'm some sensitive snowflake and then make fun of me on top of their continued behavior. I'm just not sure if I should talk to her about it, if it'd be worth it and how I should go about it if I do.",19Dec2019,1
917,"I’m in a weird spot right now - after just putting the phone down with her my head is completely blagged.

I’ve noticed she hasn’t been herself for the past few weeks/even months, and I know she has a history l of cutting herself and depression (to what extent I do not know because she never told me and I never pushed to know). Asking her what she is feeling has always been a dead end though - she isn’t great at communicating her thoughts and feelings which frustrates me because I feel helpless. We haven’t been together that long, only 6 months, but I’ve known her for almost a year and a half as friends and I care for her so so much.

Anyway, despite that I was very surprised when she phoned me and said she thought we shouldn’t see each other for a bit. I asked why and she said (through tears) she needed to focus on herself although she’s not entirely sure what she wants. I won’t stop her if she thinks that’s what will make her happy again, but it does suck.

I’m very worried about her because I’ve never dealt with someone who has depression before (if she even does - she definitely isn’t diagnosed with it) and the stigma around it where I live and in my age group is for sure “the bitch was cutting herself so I dumped her”, so I have no one irl I can ask for advice from. 

Basically what I’m asking is; how can I find out why she is so upset in general, with her saying things like “I’m tired of everything”, “the only thing that makes me happy is Lenny” (her hamster) etc etc I really don’t want to find out she started cutting herself again in a few months time and I did nothing to prevent it. My logic says there must be _something_ causing her to feel upset but I know if it’s depression then it doesn’t have to be something that I can solve easily.

I asked if she’d told anyone else about feeling this way, unsurprisingly no, and I asked how she felt about talking to her school (there is support at her school with like therapist-type people although I’m aware from my own experiences at my school’s equivalent resources that they aren’t all that great), and was met with a no again.

I also need to know whether to give her space or not, she said she wanted a break after I pushed her to make her mind up either way, but it’s not because of anything I’ve done so I’m not sure if I should still try and keep trying to dig my way past her walls and try and help. If so, how the fuck do I do that?

I’d been in a dark place myself for a long time, and it only went away 6 months ago because of her. I isolated myself and dealt with it alone (see my username to find out how well that went) because I wasn’t strong enough to open up to people. I’m still terrible at it now. So I empathise with her, but because of that I don’t know how to get HER to open up.

I think this is an opportunity for us to become even closer, but maybe I’m wrong and she just broke up with me permanently and I haven’t realised. I just want her to be happy.",19Dec2019,1

924,"I have anxiety, and was diagnosed a few months ago, but I think -if it can- has got worse. I'm panicking over diseases I plainly don't have such as diabetes, asthma and I panic mostly about time. It just goes too quickly and I'm powerless over it. It was mainly triggered after I watched a documentary/drama about dementia and Alzheimer's. And ever since I just keep panicking about death and how I'll die. I don't know how to manage it or what to do, and little advice or guidance would really be appreciated.",19Dec2019,1
925,"So I have been deal with anxiety for a long time and only in the past year after intensive therapy have I seen some real possitive changes.

 I've already mentioned this in a previous post but basically one of my coworker uses that knowledge of my anxiety against me and will bring it up when she decides to start lecturing me. Usually it's very much uncalled for and more hurtful than sensitive. I want to go to work and forget about my anxiety so for her to talk about it is really reductive.

At the same time I notice something that's really frustrating. I sometimes stutter and stammer over my words especially if I'm stressed. It's a speech issue I've had for a really long time, although it hasn't been a big enough deal to warrant an official diagnosis. 

If I'm trying to explain something, this coworker will become really impatient and start rushing me to ""just come out with it."" She'll do things like interrupt my speech pattern and if I skip a beat she'll grow increasingly frustrated will me. 

for example the other day had to let her take over  my station due to a shift change.

Me: ""hey, just letting you know there's a... a few carts upstairs I haven't finished.""

her: ""which ones did you go through?""

me: ""I.. I went through the ones over by the... the..""

Her: *sigh* ""okay, come one.""

Me: ""The two by... by the shelves over...""

her: ""out with it.""

me: *pointing* ""over there.""

her: ""o...kay? what about the ones on this cart?""

me: ""N- N-""

her: ""so... they still need lables?""

me: ""...yeah.""


This makes it so much harder to say things to her.  And I feel so inadiquate around her which inturn make talking to her the next time even harder. because of this I'm often rendered unable to give her complete information when I have to explain something to her. No other coworkers reacts to my speech impediment the way she does and I don't feel I have nearly as big of an issue convaying information to them.

She also touts herself as being accomidating and sensitive to other's needs yet this contradicts all of that. It doesn't make sense.

The thing I'm worried about is I wonder if not wanting to be defined by my anxiety while also wanting her to be less impatient about my sqeech patterns is like wanting things both ways.  I feel so knit-picky about it.",19Dec2019,1
926,"I live in my apartment with my mother, because she sold hers and is looking for a new one but the prices are higher than they have ever been and it seems pointless to purchase a kitchen-living room apt when she sold a renovated 2 bedroom with a kitchen separately apartment.

927,"I recently got my exam results back and they were a lot better than expected, so much so that I could probably get into Cambridge. But the problem is that I don't really know if I should go. I originally wanted to study data science and languages at the Australian National University because I really like languages (fluent in French and Japanese, studying Chinese and Spanish) and they let me study 3 of them at the same time and do a bit of maths which I like too. At Cambridge you can't do double degrees and I'd be studying French and Spanish or French and Russian as you can't study a lot at the same time. This is getting pretty long so I'll just do some pros and cons. Please give me some advice about which to pick.

Cambridge

Pros

\- Amazing opportunity to learn and essentially guarantees me being successful in the future

\- I'd get to travel for like a year and half before going because I missed the deadline for next year

\- I'd be able to challenge myself

Cons

\- I don't like literature that much and so the huge literature focus could be a big problem especially with the workload

\- A lot of pressure and stress to perform academically. I'm not super hardworking and the only reason I got my good marks is because I chose languages which I'm naturally good at and my country doesn't have super high standards for languages.

\- Probably wouldn't be able to chill with friends and just enjoy youth I guess because I'd always be stressed about work and studying

\- I'd have to start uni at like 20 years old so it might be kind of hard to make new friends due to the age difference

&amp;#x200B;

ANU

Pros

\- Get to study a lot of things I like

\- Lots of flexibility to travel throughout the degree (taking a few semesters out to study or work abroad and improve language skills)

\- Security of data science jobs (not as secure as a Cambridge degree but if its a Cambridge degree in languages then maybe? I'm not really sure)

Cons

\- I'm not that passionate about data science, I just chose it because I enjoyed math a fair bit but that might not be enough? So I might just be better off doing languages which I do like at Cambridge

931,"My best friend of over 12 years texted me yesterday (Wednesday) saying I'd drunk snap chatted her Saturday with the caption reading something like ""me and (my bf) just had s** in a church parking lot"". She is catholic and I'm atheist. 

She sent me a long, very judgmental text saying she needed to ""step back from our friendship for a while"". I apologized, telling her the truth, I was incredibly intoxicated and dont remember sending her that, and that we did do it in a parking lot but not a church parking lot.

I know drunk me (and honestly sober me) thought it was funny, but drunk me sent it to someone I never would've sober. 

I feel really badly for sending her that and hurting her, but as she's gotten more entrenched in her Catholic beliefs, she's gotten more and more judgmental of me. And I'm always incredibly understanding and non judgmental of her. 

I dont know what to do from here, I know what I did was wrong, but I dont think her reaction was warranted. And honestly I just dont feel like contacting her at all at the moment. What do you think? 

This was her text to me (shortened for you):
""I'll always love you but i see you differently right now. I was really offended and honestly shocked by what you snap chatted to me.I feel like that is deeply disrespectful regardless of your religious beliefs or lack thereof. No matter what type of church it was, that ground is sacred to other human beings and I think what you did completely disregards that. I also feel like you telling me that disrespects my own religious beliefs, which I always thought you respected but your actions show otherwise.

We ended up doing karaoke and during the karaoke my friend said the N word without the -er in a song.

Anyway after the karaoke Abby's friend approached me and pulled me to the side. She started asking me why I was friends with the person who said the n word and told me that I was racist by association. I got pretty upset about that because it sounded so dumb, but I kept my cool. I told her that he's my friend and I'm not about to end my friendship just because of that one thing. I also said how I'll talk to him about it. I talked to both my friends and Abby and her friend and tried to calm things down.

He has hit my mother, me and siblings before  (hitting your child when they misbehave where I live is normal)  although he has stopped hitting my mom awhile ago but has come pretty close recently, I’m not the most physically strong person but I was ready to fight him even though I would’ve lost.

He has a favorite child, it’s not me but he treats this child so much better than the rest of us and he especially hates me, it’s because I don’t take his bullshit and will fight back with as little strength I have

939,"So i have a friend who is on the sensitive side. she recently went to a therapist and the therapist told her that she was the victim of her environment and thats why she can't stand up for herself. She grew up in a rich family and pretty much got everything she ever wanted. For example, her mom recently paid more than $12,000 for cosmetic surgeries like lipo even though she really didn't need any of it. Also, her mom is currently paying for her to live at a very expensive apartment, even though she's 25 years old.  She was already pretty thin and is considered beautiful by everyone that we know. Her therapist told her that she is a victim because growing up her family told her what to do, and to not talk back to her parents. Personally, I feel like this is a pretty normal thing for parents to do because as children we obviously shouldn't allowed to do anything we want. But apparently, this traumatized her to such an extent that she is constantly treated like a doormat by the guys she dates. She refuses to stand up for herself, and even said to me ""i know i'm weak but I'm just going to accept this and see where this goes"" when  i confronted her about how a guy she's dating is treating her. And not only that, she consistently doing badly in school (she's and undergrad) and this most recent semester she actually failed every single one of her classes. But unfortunately when i ask her about how she's doing instead of saying she's stressing out about school she always says she's stressed out about the guy she's dating. I just don't know if I'm being harsh or not, but I honestly don't see her as a victim because I see the way her family treats her and how supportive they are. I know most people will say that I'm not in her shoes so I wouldn't know what exactly is going on within her family, but I'm extremely close with her and she tells me everything from her past to her present.

My friend is a 23 year old girl in college in the US. She met 3 german men in a bar a few weeks ago, and hung out with them for the weekend and enjoyed the time.

They invited her to come visit them back home, and she's now bought tickets. Her plan is to fly to Germany, and they will pick her up from the airport and take her back to one of the guys houses. She plans on staying with him for the two weeks she is there. 

This makes me terribly nervous. I have traveled internationally quite a bit, and I'm a good 7 years older than her. 

I'm worried because she barely knows these men and she'll be going somewhere she doesn't speak the language, without her own transportation or accommodations. 

At least two of the three men have expressed that they find her very, very attractive. She will be traveling alone and knows no one in the country.

Is this a reasonably safe situation? Am I overreacting?

How do I let him know I’m interested in him??,19Dec2019,1

951,"The title is weird I know.

I’ve always had a weird relationship with my family I was always the black sheep of the family, I didn’t care to spend time with anyone outside of my cousins and I was just constantly messing up in different areas of life. The thing that kept me from fucking up constantly was my parents constantly being on my ass I remember all throughout high school my parents never cut me a break especially since I wasn’t the ideal student. In a weird way I appreciated the fuck out of it because my dumbass wasn’t going to push myself hard enough. Now I’m older(M21) and I’m working full time, my parents have been “proud” of me since I got the job and they’ve taken it easy on me since especially since beforehand I was unemployed and stuck in my room. Most of my time is occupied at work but when I’m home my parents are easy on me and I hate it. I wish my parents were still the hardasses they were a few months ago and now if I want a hardass parent I deliberately have to fuck something up which is annoying. How can I talk to my parents and get them to stop being so “easy” with me. I want to be pushed like I’m always fucking up because at least then it gives me some satisfaction in working.",19Dec2019,1
952,"My friends starting vaping in early 2019 when he was 14. Every since then he been vaping everyday, been spending a shit ton of money on vapes, took like 2 small breaks. I was only a little bit concerned because he was doing it everyday and spending a lot of money. He opens up to me a lot and yesterday he went to the local hospital saying he had a ""little heart attack"" on Snapchat. He said he drank to much monster and was vaping and said he got diagnosed with a heart condition. I was assuming he just got diagnosed with it today and then I started to get worried by a lot.  Then he opened up to me and said he had it for a long time. Now I'm extremely worried. He drinks the big cans of monster a lot or any energy drinks, vapes everyday. He says hes getting nictione gum tomorrow but how do I believe he isn't gonna start vaping again!? The last time he quote on quote ""quit vaping"" he didn't he was just hiding it to everyone. Because I saw him vape 30 mins after he said that. 

How the fuck do I get him help? He also smokes weed I'm not 100% sure if it's good for you when you have a bad heart or not. I mean weed cures cancer so idk. But he always says he's gonna quit but doesn't. I think he should tell his guidance counselor tomorrow but god only knows how many times he got ISS for vaping. He told me once but I think more. So I'm afraid the counselor will call dcf if they know it's an ongoing problem. I know the mom doesn't let him vape but the mom works long hours so how the hell is she supposed to know when he's vaping? You could ground him to the house but knowing him he'll sneak out at 3 am to buy a vape. I'm thinking about him giving the Vapes to me now so in his head it isn't wasted. Please help me out here I'm afraid he's on a road to early death. Also it anyone says rat him out I will never do that plus we go to different schools. He is my best friend and on top of that is depressed.",19Dec2019,1

My boyfriend really loves Harry Potter and I'm scared he would be so crushed if he found out, but if he has to find out, I think he'd prefer it if I was the one who told him instead of one of the transphobic people at his school.",19Dec2019,1
954,"To start this off, where I live the age of consent is 16, that being said I am **NOT** trying to get physical and **NOT** trying to start a relationship with her.

So one of my coworkers and i recently started talking quite a bit. It all started when she wanted to join her cousin and I in some video games, i didn't really think much of it at the time since I just saw her as another coworker that wanted to become friends, and basically just join us in some video games from time to time. Anyways we played for a couple of hours and she was actually talking for the first time, and it turns out she is super funny, so the 3 of us ended up having a great time. The next day i woke up and saw that she sent me a message over social media, and through that, we started talking quite a bit. Skip forward about a month and a half to today, as much as i hate to say it, i caught feelings for her, and i know she likes me too. I am well aware that she is 6 years younger than me and it would be absolutely disgusting if i were to do anything with her, especially since she has a lot of developing yet to do.

I am currently in no position to have a girlfriend, I am simply way to busy with my full-time schooling and work and just cant afford to have any distractions that require a lot of commitment. I have never had a girlfriend, i still have my V card and im not planning on changing either of those any time soon. But this has got me questioning if there is something wrong with me, like why am i even attracted to someone that is so much younger than me. Id like to think its not something physical, since i had 0 interest in her before i found out she had an amazing personality. But then again i know next to nothing when it comes to relationships and such.

So im just curious what your guy's opinion is on the situation. Should i seek counseling and figure out why i am developing these feelings? Should i stop talking to her just because she is so much younger than me?",19Dec2019,1

Hey I was hoping to get some advice on how to make friends. I’m a 24 year old female who has one friend I still talk to from when I was in school. Other than that, I just have a boyfriend who I hangout with.  I don’t have any female friends and have always had a hard time making and keeping them. At the moment I’m not in school and just work. I don’t really see anyone I work with who I think could be a potential friend, and my job is stressful so it doesn’t leave any time to chat with coworkers. If anyone has any suggestions or anything that could help me figure out something, it would be greatly appreciated.",19Dec2019,1
