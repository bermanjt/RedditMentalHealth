I will have to be gone for an entire week. I know that the job market is quite competitive, and it took me so long to even get an interview for this fast-food chain, so I've given myself a bit of anxiety surrounding this because I don't want to lose the job over this.

2,"i am 16, in a year long relationship with a girl who is my literal everything. surprisingly for as young as we are, i feel we have been taking this relationship very seriously, which could possibly be a bad thing. 
unfortunately, after this summer in 3 months, my girlfriends mother refuses us to date next year.

 (i do not understand her reasoning one bit, but im a lot younger and probably wont understand why she wants this for another 10 years)

we wouldnt be able to date until my girlfriend gets into university, and she is in grade 11 at the moment. only when she starts going to university can we start dating again. the problem with this is she is going a province over, about a 8 hour drive away.
(i live in calgary canada, she is going to saskatchewan) 

 i am a grade below her (grade 10) so we would need to wait 2 years minimum, not to mention i am a lot less financially stable then my girlfriends family so if i were to move to where she is going to university, itd be extremely difficult and risky for me. 

i am trying to come to terms that i may need to let her go and just stay friends with her after this summer, but it is extremely difficult for me to imagine her moving on, falling in love with someone else, and me living without her. 
im really not sure what to do, or what to expect. i am heartbroken even thinking about it. 
do i convince her mother to let us date next year?
or do i let her go, staying friends?
if i try to move on, what are things that can help me do this?
 

if this is a stupid thing to ask advice for, i understand.",19May2019,1
3,"(Writing things like this are not my strong suit, so if anything is unclear feel free to ask. TLDR below)

Like two months ago, I met a girl on an application that is designed with the intention to share travel stories and suggestions. She is pretty cool and very easy to talk to. Since the application is nowhere near perfect, we added each other on Snapchat and Instagram. We continued talking here daily for over a month now (and we are each other’s best friend on Snapchat, so we’ve that special emoji next to our names).

We have shared very personal information at this point, but for some reason I felt like something was off. I felt like even though she shared so much, she was still not telling me something.

I decided to do some digging and found out that she has a boyfriend. It says so on her facebook page and after going through her insta page, it also became clear. 

This surprised me to be honest. Our conversations are nowhere near sexual, but after all these days of talking I don’t understand why she hasn’t mentioned him even once.

I know she went on a city trip a couple of weeks ago and I know he was with her. So I asked if she went alone on this trip, or if she went with someone else. She ignored this question (but answered other questions I asked at the same time).

Al though she is very sweet and good looking, she lives in another country. So thinking about a relationship with her hasn’t crossed my mind and like I said, our conversations aren’t really like that either.

I am not sure what I should do tho. I’d like to keep talking to her, but I don’t understand why she hasn’t mentionder her boyfriend once in two months of talking. Should I straigth up ask her about it? Why wouldn’t she mention him? Any advice or explanation would be appreciated.

TLDR: After two months of (deep) conversations with a girl from another country I met online, she never mentioned her boyfriend. I wonder why and if I should do anything about it.",19May2019,0
4,I honestly believe I have serious problems in my head. Let me just list some symptoms or just name the things I find to be wrong with me. My anxiety has been  9/10 literally every single day for the past 6+ years. I’m seriously paranoid and overthink absolutely everything even the smallest of things. I feel like everyone watches me. I have a problem with trust. I’m always tired. But I can’t sleep most nights. Maybe 5/7 days I don’t fall asleep until 3-5am and sometimes I wake up two hours later or not until like 12-3pm sometimes. I don’t like to talk to people. I smoke a lot. I have the urge to drink and try drugs. I’ve been depressed for a long time. I self medicate with Valium’s and xans SOMETIMES. Not lately. I’m extremely careless. I’m hyper sexual. To the point where I get anxiety if I don’t have sex. I need atleast 5-9 rounds a day just to feel “normal”. My mood changes all the time. I have some health issues I can care much less about. Idk these are just some things off the top of my head. I can get into better details but I’d need to be asked very specific questions about certain situations or feelings. Any tests ? Any suggestions ? I use to paint and I dropped it. I use to be a wiz at math but skipped out on college. General info about me I’m 20(m) from New York. Yo I just need to get a picture of what may be my problem. Idk. I have zero motivation. I just like to fuck a lot and go for walks and smoke my cigarettes. I wasn’t always like this tho.

6,"so i work with this guy and i’m getting some interesting vibes from him within the last month and it has escalated within the last week.

two fridays ago he gave me a sheet of paper to have random people sign and i was confused as to why but i figured it was a joke. since then, he has asked about the piece of paper every time i have gone into work and i think it’s a “secret joke” between us.

lately, he’s been asking me about my life, which is fine but i’m not a super open person. he just asks me random questions and i usually answer. but yesterday he asked me “who my best friends are” (we are both in our early twenties)- so kind of a weird question. i named some people and then he’s like “can i see a picture of your friends” and i was like ... idk i didn’t understand his intention so i said “no that’s kinda weird” so then i said they’re on facebook and he said he doesn’t have a facebook and i said i don’t have one either.

so ya, idk i don’t know if asking to see my friends was a). an attempt to hit on them b). he doesn’t believe i have friends or c). an effort to get to know me

i also don’t know if he likes me like they’re vibes like he is really nice, asks personal questions (seemingly only to me), and compliments me sometimes on my sweaters idk like “i like ur sweater” or whatever. he also was singing my name yesterday in a song and was like “oh does anyone know (insert my name).” 

so idk and i’m gonna see him monday so i don’t know if i should show him my friends then ???

12,"TL:DR - Strange coincidences led me to believe that my supervisor was spying on me via company phone. How do I get over this?

&amp;#x200B;

I worked for an engineering firm that supplied a company phone which was setup with an internal company app. I now believe the app allowed the company to monitor employees location (possibly more, mic, video). They did not notify me of this and I had the phone with me at my home and during lunch breaks in case someone from construction or scheduling called.

I value my privacy because it gives me a moment to be free, to be myself and not worry about being judged. I sing with the radio or talk to myself. I know doing this can look strange, but that's why I do it in private, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of a backstory and some reasoning:

1) I went to a coworkers office, \*Bill\*, to discuss a project. As I was leaving, I heard another coworker, \*Ted\*, go to Bill's office and greet him. My office was three doors down from Bill's. Ted asked Bill a question that I overheard as I sat down at my desk. He asked, ""How's the Popeye's king doing?"" 

I suspect they were talking about me, mainly because of the following: the others in our group all looked down at eating fast food, I had left a mere ten seconds ago, and I was a regular at Popeye's. If they were talking about me, how did they know? I didn't go around announcing, ""I'm going to Popeye's again."" 

2) I asked a coworker, who was relatively new, where he was going for lunch. He told me he was going to Popeye's and then made a comment, something like, ""Don't worry I'm not going alone. That would be weird. I'm meeting a friend.""

I realize this isn't proof positive, and this must sound paranoid to some of you. But I'm only being paranoid if I'm wrong, right? I really feel that at some point, my supervisor noticed that my phone's gps was always going to Popeye's. He must have talked to others about how funny it was that I always went there. 

There were also strange coincidences, probably too many to list by now. Anyhow, how do I get over this? I quit the job several months ago and have some fear about going back to work.

14,"I met this guy, he works with me and I took him under my ""wing"" to teach him everything I know, he wants to do what I do and I'm trying to mentor him and get him rolling, it's a long process but I really want him to succeed so we can work together more since he's starting from the bottom.

He's alright, a bit flip floppy though, that's the best way I can describe him. One day we will be talking real deep and about all the things we can do together and the next he will be completely different, but he doesn't seem like he has ""serious"" intent.

I hang out with him and some friends every week and just talk. Just recently a really high up superior started coming along each week, every time he's with us, I notice that he starts to become really passive aggressive. He knew this superior long before I met him, it seems like he's almost annoyed at the fact that i've met him.

We have fun and laugh as the usual, he just starts saying really weird stuff, it's a bit awkward but it's just him, so it's fun, he is always the one saying something and trying to be the center of attention. But whenever I add to the conversation he will just question me on it. I'll make a joke and he will say something like ""No, it really isn't"" or ""What do you mean..."", even though it's just the regular joke to have fun. I tend to talk a lot less, and he just sort of ignores me. Then he also makes excessive jokes about asians (I'm the only person who isn't white, i'm asian). I always have no issue with race jokes or the sort, because they're always fun and not meant to offend. In this case he will just make asian or asian country jokes excessively, a lot more than the usual. It's not directed to me or anything but it's just something mentioned. I never react to it.

What should I do? This guy seriously respects me, as a worker. He talks about how he wants to be just like me after I give him advice, but it seems like he sees that i do everything ""better"" than him and resents me for it and thinks that it doesn't bother me and that i'm the type that can handle it.",19May2019,1

16,"Okay some background information, me and my current gf went to a small private school which did not have a prom. We have been dating for 5 years. I am a freshman in college now and she is a senior in high school. About a month ago she tells me she wants to go to prom at the nearby public school. I didn’t know how prom worked so I though it would be her and some friends going and having a good time. A couple weeks later she tells me that she’s going with another guy. So now I’m a little confused because she left that out the first time she told me. Now she won’t tell me his name or how she knows him. She swears that it’s nothing and he’s “just a ticket to the dance” and that I’m being paranoid. I really don’t like the situation at all, but I can’t do anything about it. Idk it has just been really bugging me, but every time I bring it up, she ends up making me the bad guy.

All I know that if I told her I was going to prom or a dance with another girl, she would have a big problem with it.

17,"Sorry for any mistakes, I'm on mobile and xamt take too long. 


I work at a new entertainment place that opened up recently (basically a Dave and Busters type place)


When I applied, we got to pick our groups (each manager is in charge of a few different areas) and that's where we'd work. 


I picked the group that works in the toddler area, prizes, and front desk. I realized during training it wasnt the right fit, as I'm mildly autistic and can't handle social interaction quite well. (If you're wondering why I'd pick that group, its cause I thought working in the toddler area would be better and have less social interaction, but I was wrong.) 


The manager of that group agreed that it wasnt. a good fit for me, and said she would see about moving me  

Now the bs is that she asked me ""how would you feel about working in maintenance, and just helping where you're needed?""
I said sure, and guess where they put me?

Janitorial. Which I didnt even know I was in until the first day we were open. 


So for the past month I've been working as a janitor, sometimes till 2am, and I cant take it. 

When it's slow, it drags out minute by god damn minute and it's horrible. 

But when its busy? 100 times worse. 

Its loud, and it's so loud I can feel it in my skin. It puts me on edge and makes me so anxious and wound up. I cant hear anything, I dont know what people are saying to me, and it's so uncomfortable.  


And janitorial is understaffed, so it's me and 1 other person, which isnt remotely enough for a building that big and busy. 


I hate it, I'm nasueos half the time from all the gross garbage and toilets, and I hate it. 


Right now I'm working 6pm to 2am, and its 8, and I just cant fucking do this. 


I've asked to be moved, more than once. My new manager (who's actually really nice) says shell talk to the GM, but she said I have to wait a month, but I cant. 


I know it sounds like I'm being whiny, but its loud and my head hurts, and I feel sick, and all the loud noises and crowds and bright lights make me sick and give me headaches and I honest to god dont think I can get through this shift, let alone a whole month. 


I know quitting mid shift is a shitty thing to do, especially since they're understaffed, but this job makes me feel horrible, physically and mentally. I feel drained before I walk through the door, and even when its busy it drags out minute by minute. 


My only coworkers are a nice woman who seems super chill, and a kinda 'slow'guy who's a dick and is unbelievably unsanitary. (I'm pretty sure they're gonna fire him once they hire more people)


Another coworker joked about quitting on the spot and I've been contemplating this for a few hours. 


Financially, I'm safe for now. I've paid my bills for the month, I have a good amount of money left, plus savings, and I still live with my parents. 


If I can't land another job within a month, I can go back to my old fast food job (they've asked me to come back, and I'm friends w the manager there); but i have good references so i could probably land job somewhere else. 


My issue is how to quit. If i could get through this shift, god knows i would. I'm very non confrontational and cant talk to people worth shit, but i cant finish this shift. I'm sick to my stomach, and stressed and shaky, my head hurts, and being out there with all the bright lights and noises and large crowds is horrible. It's a nightmare for me. I cant go another 6 hours of this. 


So what's the best way to quit? I dont have the courage, but I cant stay. I'm going to pull either the GM aside, or another manager if shes not here.


 However, I'm horrible at talking and wording what I want to say. 
I dont know how to say what I want to say, and I know I'm going to seem like an asshole for this no matter what I say, but I want them to get that i cant do this. 


TLDR; I need to quit mid shift because this job is making me feel horrible, physically and mentally. I cant get through this shift, so how can I quit mid shift despite being non confrontational and horrible with talking?",19May2019,1

It was a 2 year long distance relation ship, she lives in europe, I live in the US. It was never going to work out, obviously, but hindsight is 20/20 and all. Problem is, I have an awful tendency to bury my emotions and not deal with them. When the break up happened like 3 months ago I felt awful. I did my crying but never really was able to moved on. Then, a week ago I find out she has a new boyfriend, and all these feelings came right back. I still love her to bits, but obviously being the dumpee and not the dumper, her feelings aren't the same. I've removed her off my social media, done the whole phone picture purge, asked my family not to bring her up anymore, the works. But this overwhelming sense of depression and loneliness just won't go away no matter how much I try to ignore them or face them and move on.

31,"My sister went to jail for aggravated assault (3rd-degree felony) after beating her husband while drunk. After getting a lot of great advice here, I decided I wasn't going to bail her out because DV is simply not okay and she needs to clean up her own messes. When I visited her, before I could even tell her that I wouldn't be bailing her out she broke down and expressed what I believe to be an extremely genuine desire to get sober and clean up her life. She asked for my help getting into a rehab program. I felt being in rehab was more productive than being in jail and so I bailed her out and had her checked into a program a few hours later. This is her first time acknowledging her drinking problem let alone getting help for it.

When I was asking on another sub about whether or not to bail her out, I received a lot of advice not to help her unless she is making active changes for herself or else I would just enable her addiction. Now that she is making those changes by committing to rehab, I want to help clean up her legal situation for her while she is in the program. I know she made the mess, but I am concerned that if I don't help and she has this massive legal disaster when she gets out, her sobriety will be in real jeopardy and she may spiral out of control. I want to give her a good situation to get back to so she can focus on maintaining her sobriety. At the same time, she committed a serious crime against her husband and I don't want to shield her from the consequences of that entirely.

I have spoken to a lawyer who believes he can get her charges significantly reduced and keep her out of prison given that she is already seeking treatment. Am I enabling if I help pay for this lawyer and help get these things taken care of while she is in rehab or am I doing the right thing to support her and protect her sobriety so she can focus on getting well? FYI, her husband has independently expressed to me his desire to keep her out of prison and reduce her charges (but advice regarding their relationship isn't the question I'm asking here).

It's just that the stupid fucking plot twist is that they're the same person and I have no idea what to do because it's beginning to be genuinely hurtful to my mental health (which wasn't exactly fantastic to start with) because she does not like me back. Which is fine, it's just that she's still my best friend and I can't just stop loving her because I spend all my time with her but I don't wanna leave her because I still love her.

34,So I’m 18 I got the car when I was 17 we got the title in his name cuz I was 17 now I’m 18 I’m graduating highschool next week and I got to renew registration in a couple months so I thought might as well bite the bullet pay the $100 now and get it over with now that I’m 18 and graduating. He won’t sign he it said it’s a waste of money. I was gonna pay for it anyways I have more then enough money to pay it and not go broke I make good money at the part time job I have and I’ve been very smart with it. I don’t know if he genuinely doesn’t want me to pay the $100 or if he has other motives like giving it to my atep sisters when they can drive. (He practically will do anything his new wife wants and she would want them to have the car if she had the choice). The older one is like 13.

35,"I’m in a Canadian High school right now I’m male 16 and play football. Whenever I go to school everyone’s always saying hi and making jokes and stuff. But that all changes when I leave school. No one texts me, snaps me or asks to hangout. Our friend group consists of 6 people 1 has a girlfriend and the others usually hangout together. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong and whenever I ask to hangout they all find some excuse not too. My mums always at work and my dads at home. My relationship with my parents isn’t close they seem to feel no empathy towards other people and overall don’t care how I’m doing mentally or emotionally just my grades so I always hate staying home. It’s gotten to the point were I don’t want to make an effort for social interaction and instead watch YouTube and go to the gym (these have been the only things keeping me happy lately). I’ve been wanting to get into a relationship so I have someone reliable I can talk too and hangout with but I don’t think it’s going to happen any time soon.

37,"Me (16M) and my best friend (16F) have been friends for upwards of 10 years. We always enjoyed each other's company and have never fought or argued in the slightest and our families are also very good friends. We text and face time constantly and i've been secretly in love with her for the past 5 years although I doubt she feels the same way, which just makes this worse. We also don't go to the same school anymore so I can't see her in person as often as I would like to. Anyways, everything is fine until about a month ago when in the middle of a conversation she stopped responding to my texts, but was reading all of my messages. At first i thought she was messing with me like we always do with each other, but after a couple of days I started to get confused and asked her why she wasn't responding to my messages, again she left me on read. Not long after, she made a post on instagram somewhere along the lines of people not getting the hint that she didn't want to talk. This is when i really began to worry, I panicked and sent a **lot** messages asking what was wrong and if she was ok, again left on read. A couple days passed and she made another instagram post which said that nobody asked how she was doing and meant it anymore, under which I commented ""..."". Her response, still in the comments, was that spamming her DMs did not show that I cared (which she couldn't be more wrong about) and that I only spoke to her as a last resort when I was bored. I then responded by messaging her that she was anything but a last resort and that I cared about her only to be left on read again. She then made a third and final post on instagram directed towards me saying to stop messaging her. I was really hurt by this but wanted to respect her wishes, so I sent her one last massage. I told her that I was sad that she didn't want to be my friend but its ok and that I would be there if she ever wanted to talk, and that I would miss her. I also apologized for possibly inadvertently making her feel like a last resort. One last time she left me on read. Where do I go from here?

41,"To give a little background to a story that may seem (unfortunately) too common, I (20, M) dated this girl also 20) for about a year. Everything was great until a couple months ago, when returning from a study abroad it had felt like I was coming back to a completely different version of her; cute dates, texts, phone calls all faded into absolutely nothing over the course of literally a week, and her depression took over in force. To put everything into a brief summary, she dropped out of college, cut off contact with most everyone, and after the anxiety and confusion that came since then, I decided it would be in our better interests to recuse myself from the relationship (it was more a formality; the actual relationship ended the week the change began).

Flash forward to now; we still communicate over Snapchat, but no other forms of media. I know that the reason I ended it with her is because things weren’t healthy and my emotional needs weren’t being met, but I miss her terribly now and don’t know what to think/feel anymore. I’ve fallen into unhealthy and obsessive behaviors, like checking her snap score (was cheated on previously in a relationship and found out partially through that; I know it’s not healthy but I haven’t been able break from it since the breakup conditions have very similar), and I don’t know how to put it all behind me. It genuinely was the most perfect relationship I could have wanted until it wasn’t, and the abruptness and lack of warning on it ending have left me confused, anxious, and with no idea on how to cope.

TL;DR: Broke up with my depressed girlfriend once a perfect relationship quickly turned into nothing, and I don’t know how to move on.",19May2019,3

I (18M) find it easier to talk to people now, but I'm still clueless on what to actually say. A girl (17) approached me and got my snapchat, and we're ""talking"" now. Really, all that's happened over snapchat is I worked up enough courage to ask her out. The date was fine, we're going on a second one now next week. We don't really send snaps or chat otherwise.

My problem is I'm completely clueless on what to say and even being aware of the problem I don't know how to fix it. Looking at it from a third person view she's talking, I'm going along with it and ask some questions based on what she says but I have 0 skill at initiating conversation and changing topics. It's probably frustrating for her. We work together and see each other regularly but again, no idea what to say. I can tell when the current topic is done, but am at a complete and utter loss at what to say next. It's a problem in text and in person.

Her house is filthy and nasty and I have firsthand witnessed her children picking up a number of concerning things that have just been laying about (items like pizza cutters and food that has been sitting out for days, as well as food that would be too sharp/too big and therefore dangerous for those who aren’t old enough). Her oldest is 5 and can barely talk. They are concerned for her and I am too. I have never seen her children intellectually stimulated. I have never seen a book or learning game— they just throw on the tv and leave toys sprawled about. I went to dinner with her brother the other night and was horrified to learn that my cousin guilts him into ordering her pizzas by complaining that the children will have to eat dry cereal tonight then sending short videos of the children saying “Uncle I want pizza, I’m so hungry”. Then he agrees to get the pizza and my cousin starts asking for breadsticks and soda as well. Are you kidding me? If you need money ask for it and go grocery shopping.

50," 

hi all, i hope this is the right place to ask this kind of question.

let me tell you a bit about myself, im an 18 year old male from the UK and i really hate myself. i dont think i have depression but im not sure anymore, im just a very negative person in every way but i can enjoy myself and be happy in the right situations. despite my negativity i like to be uplifting to others, i feel like im a pretty good source of advice for people and i have a lot of friends who come to me with a whole variety of problems that i feel like im quite good at solving, i just cant do the same for myself. like for example, if a friend came me to and told me ""i hate myself"" id try to help them see why they shouldnt. but i cant do this for myself.

i hate the way i look physically, i feel like no matter how much effort i try to put in to making myself look better and the way i want to look i just get nowhere. i know how to look good i just cant. im a skinny short white guy, im like 5'6. obviously height there is nothing i can do about that, but to get bulkier i gotta hit the gym, but thats easier said than done, for a start despite wanting these things i dont really have the motivation to actually do them (does this mean i dont actually want to do it?) because i hate myself i cant really just go in to a gym, everybody else there is already ripped and shit, id just feel out of place and that would only make me more sad and hate myself more.

i have a really weird face shape, like i have no jawline whatsoever, my face looks fat despite the rest of me not being fat at all and it just looks really fucking ugly, i cant even grow a beard to cover up my dumb shape cos i aint got them genes.

my skin isnt too great, though i went to the doctor and got some cream and medication and my spots cleared up quite well so it doesnt look as bad as it once did

the one part of myself that i like is my hair, i have a good head of hair and ive always been told a lot of nice stuff about it :) i like to dye it and style it different every now and then, right now the quiff is kinda a dull blonde while the rest is brown which im not a big fan of but ill get it dyed again soon :)

im not very smart in terms of intelligence. im really good at having knowledge in useless stuff but not in stuff that actually matters. all my friends are at uni or getting apprenticeships and stuff in good companies and im just planning on working in a shitty place because ive got no motivation and know thats as best as im ever gonna get. im really good at my current job but its just not something thats worth being good at. i look around at all my friends who are so good at stuff that actually matters and it just depresses me because i know ill never be good at any of it. ive always been the stupid one and ive just come to accept it and own it, its just a regular joke between me and my friends at this point that im the stupid one, im not offended by it or anything because its true

i have almost 0% success when it comes to dating. i think this is where a big part of my self hatred comes from, my cripplingly low self esteem. is it normal to have never received a compliment in my life about my appearance? ive had people try to give me compliments but i just dont let myself accept them. once i was talking with a few good friends, one of them was a girl that i was really in to and we were talking about rating your friends. we were speaking about being attracted to your friends or thinking your friend were good looking or something like that, i cant remember exactly it was a long time ago. i think the discussion turned to how you can still appreciate how good looking someone is without actually being attracted to them. i remember her telling me that she thought i was quite good looking and was definitely not the worst looking friend she had. i then told her that she was just saying that to be nice but she kept insisting.like i just couldnt believe what she was saying, i wouldnt allow myself to, i just kept telling her that she was only saying it because we were friends and you wouldnt say something bad like that. on a side note thats not really relevant but the reason i used the word ""almost"" in my ""almost 0% success"" quote was because i had an intimate incident with her once that ended up really confusing and probably contributes to why im so unsure when it comes to girls nowadays.

i feel like when it comes to relationships and that i know the right thing to do, i just cant do it myself. a close friend of mine always comes to me for advice and that and she trusts me a lot and often follows my suggestions. i think i give pretty good advice but i could never follow it myself.

im a believer in fate and the way i see it im just destined to be single and ugly forever, working in a shit place earning shit money and absolutely hating life. not even a quarter of the way through my life and im already 3/4 of the way there in terms of fate i think.

thank you all for taking the time to read my story and that, i hope some people can take some positive stuff from it in some way, my DMs are open if people want to ask any more stuff about me or just ask for some advice because like i said i think im alright at that.",19May2019,1
51,"So there's a girl that died nearly a couple of years ago, and I can't stop thinking about her. It affects all of my relationships as I can't stop comparing them to an immaculate dead girl that I will never have. It's very strange but I wonder when I will ever snap myself out of it.

She was the most amazing woman you could imagine, and the average or even above average woman just can't measure up to her.

55,"Hopefully I put this in the right category. I'm 28. 
I  just got ICL surgery to fix my eye sight.i used to be at -12 before the surgery.  Now I'm at -.50 which is close to perfect but still have astigmatism. Lasik would fix this. My doctor said allot of his patients get their vision perfected with the Lasik after the ICL surgery. ICL is really expensive but I get Lasik included free only within a year of my surgery. After paying so much for ICL surgery I feel like free Lasik is tough to turn down. 

On one hand you shouldn't mess switch your eyes if you don't need it. If the Lasik wasn't included for free I wouldn't bother but it's free! And my mom had no previous surgery before she got cataract surgery and that surgery went bad. So I'm don't know that two eye surgeries is a big deal since what happened to my mom happened without any previous eye surgery.  Why not enjoy my perfect vision while I can? I'm also probably going to need a touch up with Lasik at some point since your vision still changes as you get older just slower. Might as well get my vision perfect now.  My eye doctor said most of his patients do get the Lasik after the ICL surgery but it's not good to mess with your eyes and because my astigmatism one eye sees better close up. So one eye sees better closer and the other far away. I'm not sure what to think about that.. Would I need reading glasses after Lasik? I mean I just want my astigmatism corrected. I also kind of feel like financially the doctor doesn't get paid if I do the Lasik so of course he would try to be persuaded me not to bother. 

Anyone do ICL surgery than Lasik?

Terms:
ICL surgery they cut a hole in your eye and put a contact lens in and it's for people with really bad vision. Lasik is with a laser for people whoose vision is under -9. Cataract surgery is for people with glaucoma and like ICL surgery except they also scrape the original lens in your eyes. Astigmatism from my understanding is caused by the shape of your eyes. It causes you see slight halos and makes it difficult to read some text. Even though my vision is nearly perfect the astigmatism makes it difficult for me to read text unless it's closer up.",19May2019,1

I just recently quit drinking again and every night I can barely sleep because I have a paranoid thought that someone is lurking outside my house ready to break in and kill me. Having increased anxiety and some paranoid thoughts is nothing new to me days after abstaining from alcohol use. But this is almost crippling at this point.

If its past 12-1 in the morning and I know the only other person in the house is sleeping upstairs, I am continuously unnerved and startled by any little sound. I try to avoid walking up the stairs to use the bathroom or get a snack because I have to walk by my back door and a couple of windows that are always pitch black. I can't look at them, I don't want to see a possible face staring back at me.

I've lived here almost 10 years without incident, we never locked our doors and never had any issues or things stolen from our always unlocked garage. I have no enemies, no possessions of value, etc. Crime in this neighborhood is practically nonexistent so there should be no reason for me to feel like this out of the blue. Now I'm constantly locking doors, avoiding windows or even going upstairs when it's night time which is causing horrible insomnia and fear.

This still doesn't make sense to pay someone when they weren't even working.

63,"Hey, so something that doesn’t happen often between me and my dad has left me perplexed. I’m 22 and I’ve been studying abroad since 2014. 5 years later I’m finally graduating and going back home next week. I live somewhere that is 15 hours away by plane from home. So it’s sometimes hard to go back for the holidays or summer. But I promised myself I’d go back home every summer and spend my summer break with my family. I did that every summer (2015,2016,2017) but after July 2017 I’ve never been back home. I’ve not seen my folks for almost two years now. I’m the eldest child so I know it’s killing my mom. Ive always slept in my bed in my house for 17 years then suddenly I leave for college. She broke down and cried when I said goodbye and left for the airport in 2017. Well, fast forward almost two years and I’m going back home for good (kinda!)

But my dad, he’s ex airforce, always been hard, tough and emotionless. Funny thing is, he isn’t the serious stuffy type. I mean he’s gotten pissed off at me in the past, and I deserve it since I was a handful growing up, but I know he loves me. He’s super laid back and open minded but he’s like a closed book. He’s never outright told me he loves me, or misses me, or showers me with praise. I don’t know how to explain it.

Well, anyways, as I graduate and embark into the real world, it only makes sense to apply for jobs. Well I’m applying somewhere that isn’t home, it’s not 15 hours like now, but 5 hours away. Not that bad imo. Anyways, I tell my mom and she doesn’t complain. I tell my dad, and he just let’s out all his feelings. He’s telling me things like how he misses me, how it’s killing him that his boy isn’t at home when he comes walks in through the door, but the line that really killed me was “Don’t apply there, I want you next to me.” After I closed the phone I just broke down in tears since I’ve never heard him say anything remotely close to this for 22 years.

I don’t know what to do, I know it’s my life and I shouldn’t put things on hold because of others, but it’s killing me that it’s killing him and I’m really confused here.

Please, parents, help me out here. It’s so much easier than speaking with other family members as I just feel awkward asking for their input on this matter when it really isn’t their business.",19May2019,3
64,"I'm a senior in high school and lately I've been feeling like everything I'm doing is on autopilot.

At school I've been having a lot of fun playing poker but it's only a small rush of adrenaline. I hang out and talk with friends during and after school but sometimes it just feels like a chore. Sometimes when I'm in the city I just walk around and do nothing. 

At home I don't really do anything except play on my computer. I live in the middle of nowhere so there's nothing for me to do and my parents won't give me a metrocard to go to the city. Lately I've only been watching hours of poker online and playing games that I've kinda gotten bored of but still slightly fun. Everything feels like I'm just passing time. 

What should I do to prevent this feeling? I figured I would hang out with my friends more but not everyone hangs out everyday and they're fine. I've been losing a shitton of weight by taking long walks but it didn't really help the feeling. I was thinking of a job but I don't think it would do anything except pass the time.",19May2019,1

And every time when that happens, I always think to myself that someone broke into the house, but it's always just me.

Whenever they say how i could help them, i forget it fairly quickly. I have to write down how to help or how to treat someone so that i make them feel good and dont hurt them but somehow i always end up fucking it up. I have no idea how to take my awareness of my downfalls and actually change them, especially if when i practice being better, i either forget that and fuck up, or i fuck up even trying to help/change.

recently i told her i liked her a lot, she liked how i liked her and she said “i like hearing your feelings, you should be open more, and tell me more of your feelings.”

she puts like smiley faces and like cute faces after she texts, misleading me.

today i’m like “i’m on thin ice, and you know this.”

and idk how the conversation went but you have to know it ended like this; “i mean i still wanna be your friend :)”

69,"I’m sorry for all the spelling and grammatical errors. I’m not good at this whole writing thing. 

My mother and I have a very... difficult relationship to say the least. She is very petty and controlling. I love her so much and constantly hope to have a relationship with her. She just finds a reason to be mad and stay mad for weeks. For example, on Mother’s Day she asked me to move a basket from one table to another and I didn’t hear her. She then stomped over and grabbed the basket and slung it to where she wanted it. I was obviously very confused. She continued to be very rude to me in front of the rest of the family which ended in a screaming match(which I was in the wrong for being rude back) and my fiancé and I leaving the family gathering. And she is STILL mad over this incident that she started. If she would have simply gotten my attention and repeated herself I would have gladly done it. She is still making passive aggressive comments and using my dad to communicate anything that needs to get to me. She has a history of making a scene at almost every big event I’ve had causing many tears and heartache on my part. I have a feeling she is going to make a big scene on my wedding day and ruin the day for my fiancé and myself. 

On the other hand, I have a fantastic father and adore him. They are married and obviously living together. He is constantly defending me and correcting my mom which has also hurt my relationship with my mom as she feels that he chooses me over her. Which is not the case. I have an older brother that she thinks walks on water and she would never treat him the way she treats me. My dad just thinks my brother and I should be treated with the same respect. I want my dad to be a big part in my wedding since he is the biggest influence in my life. He has encouraged me and helped me succeed. I’m so thankful for him. I couldn’t imagine him not being there on this special day. 

So my question is: Would it be wrong to not invite my mother to my wedding? Especially with me wanting my dad to be very much involved.",19May2019,3

75,"Hi, thanks to anyone taking the time to read this. I grew up as a Christian and never questioned it until recently. I’m 23 now and just a year or so ago I realized that I don’t believe in it. There are many parts of the Christian faith that I don’t agree with but mostly I dislike the idea of sinners going to hell. I remember when I was young and going to religious ed classes I would always ask questions about hell because it scared me so much, and I don’t believe an all-loving god would “threaten” for lack of a better word to send people there if they broke his rules. Obviously this is my personal opinion and I’m not trying to insult Christianity- this is just how I feel. 

Anyway, I’ve turned my back on it but I still go occasionally with my family to support them and I still like a lot of the morals they have. But now every time I walk into a church I get very emotional. The story of Christ is so beautiful and part of me wants so badly to believe in it and be a part of it, but the other part of me just can’t. I’ve been crying whenever I walk into a beautiful church lately because it looks so pure and magical, but I feel so estranged from it. I feel lost.

77,"I'm 38/F. Long story short, I got a really shit deal in life. I was abused and neglected as a child, used for hard labour and improperly socialized. I didn't have freedom nor did any extended family visit because they hated my father. My parents never had friends either. I was a very lonely and depressed child. I started to get sick and wasn't taken care of properly and really struggled with the isolation and work along with the abuse. I still have PTSD despite being in therapy for over 20 years. When I was in my 20's I became engaged but it was a very abusive relationship and after 6 years I left, 2 months before the wedding date. I then tried to start over but couldn't seem to get it together. In my late 20's I started to get really sick and it destroyed my life and the stress caused a nervous breakdown and I lost my ""friends"". I tried to hold on but a few years ago I just couldn't handle the bullying at work anymore. I had tried really hard to get healthy and happy and my body just gave up on me.

Now I'm in my late 30's. I've been working my ass off for years to heal from serious health issues and also work through emotional traumas. I've worked with so many modalities but the anxiety is so severe I finally decided to go on medication in December. The anxiety has reduced slightly but I'm still afraid to get a job or to talk to people because I still have very intense anxiety.

I have no friends, no family of my own, no job, no nothing. I'm living in a dump and can barely get the energy to do anything. I make lists each day to get things done. I get overwhelmed easily, and my body is still in significant pain. I believe that physically I can handle a part time job but the thought of getting a resume together is so overwhelming. The thought of finding someone to help with my resume is even overwhelming.

I'm really scared. I'm scared I'm never going to be comfortable enough again to talk to people in a normal social setting. I'm scared I'm not going to be able to handle a job. I'm scared I'm never going to be able to live the life I dream of because I'm so tired, in pain and afraid. 

I'm one of those people who has tried ""everything"", so I'm not looking for advice like ""join a group"" or something. I'm looking for a way to wake up inside myself and just make it happen. I feel so depressed and dead inside. I have no one to live for except my 2 cats. I need human companionship but I'm so paralyzed with fear. I'm literally paralyzed with fear.

There's a 4 way intersection in my town where cars going one way must stop, but cars going the other way (down the main road) can go freely, although they have to yield to any cars pulling out, provided they did so when they could.

I was stopped at this intersection, and tried to cross it - I had stopped, and checked both directions thoroughly. As I was crossing, a young female driver whipped around a corner and slammed her perfect, new Jeep into my poor HHR, causing my front left tire to detach and flatten, my center console to pop out, crunching my front passenger door, etc. My airbags did not deploy, witnesses gave statements over the phone to police, and I'm currently safely at home, my chest feeling a bit bruised on the impact side.

The other driver was, in kindest terms I can say right now, a complete bitch. She tried to insist I ran the stop signt (""You have to stop at a stop sign!"" Were her exact words, and she was only concerned with her precious prom date, rather than my health, her own health, or her passenger's health.

93,"  

(23, M) (Denver, CO)

Before I start, I need to explain myself as briefly as I can.

I found out I was transgender when I was seventeen, but looking back on life, I noticed I subconsciously knew years before hand. When I was fifteen, I discovered my bisexuality and when I turned sixteen, I knew I was gay. Around the same time, I dropped all Christian faith for personal reasons. With all this, I lived in Alabama at the time. And if anyone understands how the south is, they would know that it is irrationally bigoted, racist, sexist, and unkind. So, it was actually impossible to live a normal and happy life. On top of this, I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which means I have loose and unstable joints that are prone to frequent dislocation, pain, and early onset osteoarthritis. I'm also clinically proven to have depressive anxiety and Autism Spectrum Disorder. This has caused me indescribable emotional/physical pain and dysphoric distress. I feel that this has something to do with my inability to live a normal everyday life.

Whenever I explain this to anyone, regardless of who it is, they all say, ""Just take medicine,"" or ""Just learn to deal with it."" And it aggravates me to my very core because no mental/physical disorder is something you can ""just get over."" I know it's because they don't understand, but I need actual help. Not someone passing off my disabilities as anything lesser than what they truly are or handing me a half-assed ultimatum to my crises.

Ever since I started working my very first job, I've been told by everyone I've ever worked with, including managers, that ""I'm too slow.""

I have only been late a few times and every time I think I'm going to be late, I make sure to call in advance. I've always done my best at work, no matter the job, and my co-workers have told me I do better work than others who have been working there for years. Yet, when it comes down to my speed, apparently it's a deal breaker. I've never been fast, and I don't think I ever will be. And why I say that isn't because I'm not willing to get better. With utmost honesty, I don't believe 'speed' is something I was born with.

I find it strange that I've worked a plentiful amount of jobs in different fields, yet I've--for lack of better words--*failed* at all of them. I'm not physically strong enough to work a warehouse job because of my EDS. I'm not good at all with talking to people and human interaction is just about 90% of all jobs on the market. The reason why is not because of my anxiety as many people may believe, but because of my autism.

It's very hard to explain because autism is such a complex disorder, but every time I'm confronted by someone I *have* to talk to vs *wanting* to talk to, I become frazzled and want to find a corner or go to my 'happy place'. To be very clear, it's not anxiety or any other emotion that makes me do this. I feel displaced, vexatious, or just plain uncomfortable, and there isn't really a reason for it.

Despite my disorders, I've tried putting them on the back-burner and just working through my pain. But that turned out to be a huge mistake. The duration I worked at the warehouses I was employee for, I ruined my body. I can't sit on the floor crisscross anymore because my legs fall asleep within literal seconds and my hands have become extremely weak from succumbing to untreated carpel tunnel. This was all in only a few months. Other jobs that involve speed and people, I've tried doing the same and pushing through the pain yet again. But that turned out to be even worse for my psychological state. I've suffered through so much stress I put myself under. The excessive amounts of stress has made my vertigo worsen--It feels like I'm spinning around in a washing machine. And I recently was told by a doctor that my high stress levels have been causing me small seizures.

Can anyone give any advice on what I can do?

Are there any jobs out there for me?

If you can, for my sake, go easy on the replies. I'm only asking for help, not to be yelled at for being stupid.",19May2019,0
94,"I was the one that broke up with her. We argued so much with one another that I was physically getting sick from stress. What made it so hard was when we weren’t arguing I was so happy with her. And I do still love her.

We had moved down to Texas together and the arguing got even worse. When I told her I wanted to break up she took only some of her things and drove back home to her parents. I wanted her to take our new apartment and I would leave, but she wouldn’t talk to me and just up and left.

We didn’t talk for months after that. I made sure she made it home okay by talking to her friend and that was it.

I recently drove back home and brought the rest of her stuff she left. And I could tell right away she was a mess. She looked stressed, she had been drinking, and I can’t say this for sure but going off what her friend has been telling me, she’s been sleeping around as well. And before she dated me she was quite shy about sex.

I don’t know what to do. I love her, but I know we won’t work. We tried counseling, talking things out, and we always ended up still arguing. Main reason being is she’s bipolar, I just did not know how to handle that. I couldn’t tell the difference between manic/depressive and when she wanted to argue I always fired back.",19May2019,1
95,"This has been a ongoing issue for the past 8 months , my husband and I had a son our living situation wasn’t the greatest my parents offered us to stay in a secondary home on their property that wasn’t being used. We made the choice to move in which could have possibly been the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life. We were asked to pay 700ish dollars a month for a one bedroom one bath “apartment” like home with a studio like living room /kitchen area . Every day someone would come banging on the door while the baby was asleep and wake him , random “tours” would be given if our “home” unexpectedly without notice to my parent friends that visited. I’m a stay at home mom and my husband works full time at a third shift job so while he was sleeping the banging on the door would be occurring and wake him , on occasion he would miss work due to being so exhausted from not getting any sleep between our son and the constant door knocking of my family , if nobody would answer they would continue knocking keep in mind they easily could have called to see if we were allowing company at the time , on another occurrence I had the windows open with a fan in the window as he refused to put the air conditioner in and it was hotter than hell in there and someone came knocking on the door i didn’t answer shortly after I noticed a Lysol smell which I recognized almost immediately as it gives me headaches , someone had sprayed Lysol in the window it blew on the baby and that was a mess in itself , we fell behind and couldn’t pay rent my dad told us to “pay what we could afford” so we did months past and we realized we never had food , and on occasion would even rub out of toiletries and dish soap and laundry detergent the basic stuff you need to survive , after being told for months to just pay what we could afford he confronted me with “if you can afford to stay , move out “ we made the decision to move , moving day comes we pack our stuff and it’s the beginning of a war , everyone’s telling me to divorce my husband , file for custody of our child , pretty much doing anything to brainwash me to get me to leave him , I stand up to my parents and tell them how I feel and make it clear I’m not leaving my husband , my dad pretty much told me to fuck off and not worry about being part of the family anymore . Am I the asshole and in the wrong for choosing my husband and son over my parents?",19May2019,0
96,"So I started talking to this girl in one of my classes a few months ago. It started off as a pretty distant friendship. We weren’t talking all that much, but we got as close as you might realistically expect from a friendship in college over the course of two or three months. For some setup, she told me early on that she can’t date guys during the semester cus she’s taking too many classes and can’t split her attention. No worries. That’s been a recurring theme throughout our spending time together; she’ll bring that up a lot. So, I asked her earlier this week to come with me to watch a school play this weekend because I have to for a class. She pushed her response back a couple days because she has a busy schedule this weekend. That’s also a recurring theme. We don’t ever hang out because there isn’t enough time.

I call her up on the day I’m going to buy tickets to the play and I say, “Do you wanna come with me to the show this weekend? I really need an answer.” She says, “Do I wanna come, like, in what context?” I said, playing dumb, “What do you mean by context... like on which day this weekend?” She’s like, “Yeah, I mean, I don’t know if I can.” Eventually she comes to the conclusion that she could come after work on Friday (yesterday).

We end up sitting in the car chilling and chatting a few minutes after that because we were both still on campus. She says, “I told you I don’t date during the semester.” I said, smiling, “Then this isn’t a date. We’re going as friends to hang out. And we’ll keep doing that, then when the semester ends, if I still like you, I’ll tell you I wanna take you on a date and I’ll get my answer then.” She has no response to this. She’s just like, “Okay.” Later she mentions that the friendship we have is closer than she’s used to because she really has social anxiety and she doesn’t talk to anyone really as much as she talks to me, whether it be calling me or texting me or hanging out with me on campus. I said that’s good, but she was like, “But I don’t actually like to interact with people that much. And this friendship we have is definitely strong. I just don’t wanna risk ruining it.” That’s the killer phrase.

Fast forward to later that night at like 11pm. She calls me up and says, “I invited my gay friend to come tomorrow. He also has to go for a class, so I told him he could tag along.” That pissed me off, but I didn’t say anything that night.

Then yesterday, day of the show, I call her up and just go like, “I need to tell you that I felt it was rude that you invited someone without asking me after I invited you to hang out as a 1-on-1 thing.” She says I’m blowing it out of proportion and that because I said it wasn’t a date that I should be okay with it. I said that’s ludicrous. I don’t wanna get third-wheeled. That’s just not fun to be alienated out of the interaction, regardless if it’s a date or not.

I then rapid-fired her with a bunch of qualifications because I’m about done playing games: “If hanging out with me alone makes you uncomfortable, just tell me now and I’ll stop trying. If you really only can think of me as a friend, tell me now and I’ll stop trying. If you’re not attracted to me, just tell me and I’ll stop trying.” She had no response to all of these (the most curious thing) and weaseled out of it by changing the subject and saying, “Okay, look, I’m sorry that it offended you. You’re right, I should’ve asked you first. But now I’m not sure I even wanna go to the show. How can I have fun?” I said, “Don’t come if you’re uncomfortable with coming.” She said, “But I know you’re gonna say it was rude that I didn’t come because of this.” I said that no, it definitely wouldn’t.

She ended up coming. Sat next to me, uncomfortable for most of it. Really private and guarded body language. The show was so absolutely hilarious that the laughter barely stopped for the entire show, and she barely smiled. After the show, she met up with the friend and chatted him up and, just as I expected, I got third wheeled all the way back to her car. Shout out to her friend for not looking out for the homie, though. Douche :/

Went home pretty frustrated and now I’m fairly certain I fucked up by telling her before the show instead of waiting until today and telling her how I felt. But I also really am done playing games and working around her ruleset. There came a certain point where I felt I just needed her to stop hiding and face how she felt so I could choose to walk away or not.

Now, it’s kind of uncertain what’s going to happen between us. My gut feeling is telling me that I need to run as fast as I can now while I still can. But I’m also pretty sure that if I run, my conscience will tell me that I was the one who caused it and I also can’t live with that. I’m the type of dude who owns up to his mistakes quick as hell. Then my boy who knows both of us is telling me that she’s just afraid to say how she really feels and this is just a game that’s a waste of time so I should walk away. Really don’t know what to do. Was this really a mistake? Or is my gut feeling right to just cut ties here and now?",19May2019,0
97,"So a month ago, my girlfriend broke up with me and basically said it was my fault, blamed me for our issues and such. In a months time I heard all these rumors about her, but I was unsure. She was gone over spring semester but came back home. I asked to meet her and we talked. I found she cheated on me with 5 guys, multiple times. I forgave her and told her that I loved her and wanted to be with her. She told me she loved me too but was afraid of hurting me again, we kissed a bit and she left. Later that day her friend texted me and tells me to be careful that shes moved on and was seeing a new guy. I call her and ask about it and it was true. She was seeing this guy she always hung out with while we were dating and told me not to worry. So after I forgave her for cheating and lying, she continued to do it. I messaged the guy and told him my whole story and he broke it off with her. My thing is I'm a loving and forgiving person, but I'm just filled with vengeance now. I want her to face some kind of justice for all the lies and deceit. I told her I was going to tell her family the kind of girl she is, but I feel like I'm going to far and I just want to let go but cant. How do you handle this situation?",19May2019,2

100,"As long as I can remember, my grandparents have been distant. 

My parents told me that when I was born (as the third child in our family), my grandmother said “Oh, I’m not sure I have it in me to love another one.”

To avoid a large post, I’ll just say they were never nice to my dad (their son). He recalls a time when he was just a child and his mother wished he was never born, to his face. 

Years ago, my dad has aired his grievances over treatment like this and MANY other similar (or worse) instances and it ended poorly, without any apology or conclusion from my grandparents. Instead, they moved several states away.

Communication has been cut off entirely on my part for nearly 8 years. That is, until my dad decided to visit them when they were concerned about the state of their affairs if they were to die.

After this visit, they sent me a very impersonal letter (exactly the same as sent to my two brothers) and included a $1000 check for my college graduation. They gave my brothers checks as well, for their weddings. My brothers, who are more well-off financially (they’re significantly older than me), have refused to cash their checks.

I have no intention of renewing this relationship as, quite honestly, they have never been grandparents to me. Do I take the money?

TLDR: my grandparents were never grandparents to me and treated my dad poorly his entire life. They’re trying to bribe me back into their lives with a “graduation gift” of $1k. Do I take it even though I have no intention of building a relationship with them?

Thanks!",19May2019,3

102,"My friend and I are planning a trip for this summer. We were looking at hotels today and she fell in love with one and I fell in love with another. She pointed out how I wanted to go to the other one that she didn’t like as much, but I told her that there was also cons to the one I liked. I sent her a link to her hotel versus my hotel just to see the differences. She said how people were saying bad reviews on hers but also a few negative reviews on mine. I checked the flight times after we got off the phone for my hotel and her hotel and noticed it wasn’t good for hers, (we would get home super late at night). I told her how her flight time wasn’t good, and she brushed it off saying “oh wow”. I feel really bad now that she may think I was doing it on purpose and not wanting to go to her hotel, even though I was just looking up the times and do want to go to her preference.

105,"To try to give a brief summery of the backstory: 

I was with him for five years, he lived abroad so the plan was to marry in order for me to immigrate, I gave up my life for him - it didn't work out, he started treating me badly and it wasn't until years later I found out why : despite knowing I wanted kids he didn't, he lead me on and rather than admit it he turned on me to push me away. I ended-up back home with nothing, it's been two years and I'm still not on my feet...depression, unable to get a new job due to the gap in employment, no friends here any more, etc. and given my age it looks like I've lost my opportunity to have kids. 

When we broke-up we cut all contact - I had zero interest in talking to him, and a few months on he started dating a nut-job who insisted he and his kids have no contact with me and she erased any trace of me from their lives. 

He was supposed to send my things back to me but it never happened and I found out about a year ago that it's because the woman he dated after me destroyed it all - thousands worth of things, some with sentimental value. He started harassing me online 6 months ago, I finally responded and that's when I found out about why we broke up - he was completely unaware of how bad his behavior was, or the impact on my life re. that I'd sacrificed everything for him thinking we'd have kids. He turned this on me, making me the bad guy for not wanting to get back with him again. 

Last week I found out he's been harassing a friend of mine, asking her about me and badly bad-mouthing me to her - she let me know as she said his messages were becoming scary and obsessive. She's been talking him into paying me for the things that were destroyed, he was insistent he wouldn't pay me back unless I talked to him - this is manipulative but I'm desperate for money so can't turn it down. My friend has dealt with a lot of drama from him because she wants to see me get some money from him given the position he left me in, and been encouraging me to play nice until I get what's owed. 

Current situation:

He's emailed me saying that my friend told him if he reached out I'd respond and telling me he plans on sending a few grand but he can't pay it in one go (it doesn't cover what he owes but it'd help me a lot, he's not as well off as he was and two years on I don't feel like I can argue with him over this). I don't know how to respond to this, it's not in my nature to lead someone on or be dishonest, I feel I have nothing to say to him at all so not sure how to respond to him. 

The question is...how do I respond to him?",19May2019,0

I sometimes use the floor broom to knock debris off the seats to make sweeping easier, and on a few occasions, I used the bristles of the floor broom to knock large debris off the edges of some low tables, but ensured that the floor broom did not touch the tables. This was only a few times when I was rushed and used the long broom to do so, when I had been sidetracked by other tasks and traffic and the busy influx of customers toward closing. Someone complained and a manager asked me to not do it.

113,"A little background of myself, I am a 22 year old guy from India. After schooling I went to a community college to pursue mathematics with delusions of grandeur that I will someday end up solving a millennium prize problem somehow and will get a Phd.

&amp;#x200B;

Reality is, I never made it to graduation, as of now I am working in a call center. Recently I was pondering over deep questions about myself, my future, my past and all the people who made me who I am. I watched the young sheldon Season 2, Episode 22 A Swedish Science Thing and the Equation for Toast. I felt lonely before but after watching this and looking at the character Dr. Sturgis who never married(though he never intended for this) but was just too innocent and childish to care about himself to have a partner and instead gave all his energy and life to academic pursuit, in quest for knowledge, an attempt to do something that will last, for that which he will be remembered, something that will help humanity as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to know from people who intentionally by choice or otherwise say just like Dr Sturgis didn't intend to remain single but their pursuits were such, it was just impossible for them to find a partner.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not just talking about people who are so into intellectual pursuits that they find the only meaningful pursuit is the quest for knowledge. I'm talking about anyone and everyone who is a single, alone. The reasons can be anything and not just because they were pursuing something. It could be poverty, it may be a disability, it could be because you belong in the LGBTQ+ and it was really hard to find the right partner that you gave up or because you are extremely introverted or because you are just another person like me who fears someone would leave so much that I don't even try getting into a relationship. I really don't have many friends. I have friends but there is not a single friend who I can call best friend or close friend. Maybe you are alone just because you don't know how to communicate with people. Maybe you are an orphan and being treated as such or went through psychologically scarring events that even the idea of having a partner or any kind of relationship looks alien. Maybe you had a partner but they left or they are no more and you choose to move on, alone.

116,"Hi guys. I made a new account because I didn’t want anyone from real life to find this post. I’m gonna write a lot and I just need someone to listen and understand please. I feel so lost in life right now. I have friends my age who are married or engaged and I’ve never been in a longterm relationship. The majority of people meet their spouse during college and I have never met someone relatively interesting these past 3 years no matter how much I put myself out there. I have friends who have jobs lined up after graduation and not just any job but ones they actually want and ones that have to do with their careers. I have no idea what field I want to go into anymore and every day I absolutely regret choosing the major that I did. I have friends who live out on their own, even if it’s just a tiny house or apartments meanwhile I still live at home and I’m 21. It seems like everyone around me has a best friend and I do have friends I’m incredibly close with but I don’t have a “best friend.” I feel like no one understands how shitty life is because everyone has at least one thing in their life to be happy about, or something that they’ve achieved, or to be proud of, and I have absolutely nothing. Everyone either has a relationship, a best friend, a good living situation, a good career, or a huge achievement to be proud of except for me. Things aren’t going to come together. In elementary school people told me I’d find love in middle school, in middle school people told me I’d find love in high school, in high school people told me I’d find love in college and now look where I am. When I was 5 I told my neighbor I didn’t know what I wanted to be when I grow up and she told me “you have time to figure it out” and it’s been 16 years and I still don’t fucking know. My life is a series of trying my hardest and always coming up short of achieving my goals. I don’t want to be told it’s going to be okay because it’s never been okay. I don’t know how it’s possible for someone to be such a piece of shit. The only thing good in my life right now is my job. I love what I do, I love my customers, and it’s the only place where I feel somewhat loved. I have good friends there and my thoughts simmer down a little. I don’t necessarily know if I want to work in this field forever (but I guess it wouldn’t be too bad) but I’d like to work here until I know what I’m doing for sure but for the position I have requires for you to be a student. I graduate next year and now that I’m officially done with my third year of college it fills me with anxiety knowing at this time next year I’ll have to leave. I know I still have a year, but I think about how quickly time has gone since this time last year and it makes me freak out to think how little time I have left. I can apply to get a promotion but I might have to go to another location and I don’t want to leave my coworkers and the bonds that I have at my location. I feel like I only have one good thing in my life right now and that isn’t even going to last for too much longer. My suicidal thoughts have gotten worse lately and I told my therapist but life still seems pointless. In addition to all this pain and anxiety, I just feel like life would go on fine without me. I don’t think people would be happy necessarily but just kind of unbothered. Some days I wish I would have just killed myself the first time the thought went through my mind. I grew up with an alcoholic mother, people bullied the fuck out of me, and I was sexually assaulted, and I don’t know why I should have to suffer through more shit well into adulthood. I’m a fucking nobody. I want to self harm again but I’m scared I’m going to regret it because I’m over a year clean. Someone please help me. I can’t behind to explain how shitty my anxiety about my future feels and how badly my depression influences my self-esteem. I feel myself getting bad again and I don’t know what to do.

126,"Backstory: for two years (2014-2016) my mom and I were in an emotionally abusive poly relationship. The man of the relationship abused her and the jealous woman who didn't like my mom abused me. We got out early 2016 and haven't looked back since.

However, last summer a cousin moved into my grandmas house (who my single mother and I have lived in ever since) with her mom who moved in the year prior. Up until then my mental health was doing pretty good and I was really recovering without the help of therapy (didn't have reliable transportation to one and the one I had gone to was mildly homophobic).

Then the abuse came in

At first it was little hurtful comments about this or that, but then anytime I was mean back suddenly I was the asshole and I always am. Keep in mind before she came I was a good kid who never got in trouble. Now this cousin is very entitled, and I mean very entitled. She is constantly asking her mother for money and essentially driving her bank account to empty. And if her mother says no she whines and moans until her mother gives in.

She is completely crushed my self esteem. I am a bigger person and I am more disgusted by my body now than I had been in awhile, I no longer believe I deserve friends because I'm an asshole, and I just generally feel like shit. I know I should see a therapist but my mom is so busy with life I dont feel like I can ask.

It came to a boiling point today when she begged her mom for money to go to the store (keep in mind our moms + myself went earlier today and her mom got her something) and my mom gave money for me. She spent my money on lottos for my mentally disabled uncle to scratch and then when I got mad she called me a baby and blamed it on my fault for apparently saying yes.

Now my family thought I was upset over not getting anything and offered to get me stuff after the fact but it wasn't that. It was her entitled attitude that made me upset and I ended up telling my mom how I feel. I no longer feel safe or happy in my own home, she belittles every little thing I do and my mom can't afford to move us out. Everyday i think about ending it but i dont want to, I just see more escape. I'm trying to get a job but no one will hire me thanks to it being a college town. I just feel helpless and I don't know what to do anymore. Any advice?",19May2019,4

128,So I was finally working up the courage to have a conversation with my boyfriend about some things he’s doing that bother me just a little bit. These things include still talking to girls he met off tinder or tried dating in the past but in a “friend” way and refusing to have protected sex. I was going to have this talk with him today but then his dog died. He was very close with his dog and it crushed him. he’s not in a good place and I just don’t feel like it’s right to come at him with this right now. how long do you think I should wait? It’s been bothering me for some time now so I feel impatient but I really don’t want to be selfish and kick him while he’s down.,19May2019,2
129," Hi, I (21/M) met this girl (19/F) on [r/r4r](https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r) and we agreed to meet up at a coffee shop. I'm not sure if it's a date but I think we're just going as ""friends"". I'm not sure what she'll think of me and also I have trouble coming up with things to say in small talk, especially with girls i get really nervous. I haven't had any friends that were girls in a while, I usually just talk to my guy friends. Even just snapchatting her makes me nervous. I've only been on a couple dates before and no real relationships. I'm also really short so that makes me worried about what she'll think of me.

Here's the problem...

A few months ago he tried to convince me to meet up again. It was 3am, my mom was still awake (meaning there was no way I could sneak out of the house), I had harmed myself that evening (serotonin struggles), and I wasn't in the mental state to see anyone. He didn't seem to take no for answer and was impossible to reason with. I ended up turning my phone notifications off because he didn't seem to get that nothing in the world would convince me to sneak out of the house.

Last night at 1:30am he messaged me saying that he was on his way over and he wanted to meet up. I was like dude I'm about to go to sleep, contact lenses have left my eyes, I'm exhausted af, mom is awake...it isn't going to happen. He was like ""you know you want to"", like dude I actually don't.

135,"My anxiety most often manifests itself in a seeming inability to take deep breaths. My body feels like it desperately needs them, but my attempts to get ones deep enough leave me feeling panicked because they're not satisfactory. I end up feeling like I can't breathe, and it hurts my ribs to inhale as deeply as I need to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for more short term suggestions, as i think the only long term one is to be in therapy for anxiety (which I am). I struggle with this on a lesser degree almost constantly, but there are times (like the last 3 days) where it is so intense that I'm constantly and painfully aware of my own breathing. It's driving me mad.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is fairly common, so i'm hoping someone has some words of wisdom to help me manage it. I can distract myself with music, a book, or a tv show, but as soon as I pause from those, it returns fully.

I get along alright with my boyfriend and I get along better with his mother. I have lived with them ever since I turned 18. My parents are emotionally abusive, and I left their place the first chance I could.

I work with him at one job and his mom at another. We dont work side by side but we work at the same place. I love him and I know he loves me, I've seen him cry at the thought of losing me.

Luckily my family is well off enough to pay for me to go to college and so I currently have no debt. I dropped out because I realized wow i fucking hate programming and if i do this as a career i ll blow my brains out at some point. Due to my family background I have heavy expectations to go to back to college and get a degree. I reapplied to schools with with the idea of doing something in the very category broad of business. I chose this because I am actually interested in being a business owner one day but honestly I do not want a boring job where I am in an office doing something that doesn’t get me excited. I have this everlasting internal struggle between whether I should do stuff I don’t want to do for 10 years, save as much as possible and reach financial independence, or whether I should just pursue my passions and be okay with being poor. I really believe that if I tell my Dad I don’t want to go to college I will be kicked out of the house and receive no help from him whatsoever. Its also very hard for me to have honest good conversations with him bc our relationship isn’t great; we’re totally opposite people.

151,"I’m a F - 20 years old.

I’ve always had quite the rocky relationship with my mother - I do love her, she’s kind and caring and intense. She’s quite protective and overbearing.

I’m the oldest, she expects the most out of me. She expects me to treat her the way she was with her mother, but generations are different, we’re taught differently, our mentalities are different. I try to love my mother the only way I can, and to do my best at it.

She gets mad at the slightest deviation - If I get upset at her commenting rudely countlessly on my weight or on my ‘hideous outfits that make no one bat their eyes at you’, she calls me out and says that she’s my mother and I have no right to do so.

If I ever try and answer back, she gets even more angrier. She had anger issues, major ones. 
She always uses derogatory terms like ‘donkey’, ‘idiot’, ‘fucking stupid’ whenever she argues with me. And it’s impacted me mentally, I always think everything’s immediately my fault.

She expects me to shut up, let her talk and continue verbally abusing me, and not say a single word back. If I get mad, and reply back (which is often since I can’t always handle it and I’m human), she goes batshit on me. 

It’s normal in our culture for parents to ‘hit’ their children, as in slap them, or just repeatedly hit them. My mom’s done that before, I shed a few tears, I have to apologize and then we act like nothing ever happened.

She did it tonight - hitting me, because I told her that I didn’t even talk to her badly, I did what she asked me to do.

152,"This is gonna be long. Apologies for the format, I’m on mobile. I mainly just wanted to get this out and see what I could’ve done, for future reference. I’ll try to keep it short!

So I work at a small local coffee shop and this afternoon, I briefly came into my work to record my tips (I forgot to my previous shift) and I was just about to leave. But then, my co-worker, who I know likes to joke around, started to tell me about a particular person in the shop.

He said that she came here with no shoes and no phone, and was stuck in an abusive relationship. He put his hands on her, but she didn’t want to call the cops, and my coworker really wasn’t sure what to do. I completely thought he was joking, so I was smiling at him and insisted he was just jerkin’ my dick (I even said that) but then the other person working said that he was being completely serious.

Now, I’ve never really had to do something like this before. I’m a freshman in college and I don’t have training for this type of thing, but I’ve made it a point in my life to help however I can, and to educate myself on different ways I can help especially as a person with no training. So I went to the back office and looked up women shelters near me. I found one that was really close and was ope the weekends, and wrote down the number and address on a sticky note for her. I put on an apron (so I wouldn’t have to explain that I really do work here, just not right now) 

I slowly sat down in front of her and introduced myself, and immediately noticed and said that I recognized her as a regular customer. She was totally competent, not emotional, said that even though he got physical, she wasn’t even emotionally hurt. I told her that my co-workers made me aware of her situation, that she didn’t want to call the cops even though he did get physical, and gave her the shelter information; she borrowed one of my coworker’s phones, so I told her to perhaps call first, to see how she should proceed and that someone more experienced could help her. I apologized for perhaps seeming invasive or overwhelming, but she thanked me profusely and seemed genuinely okay— Maybe a little shocked, and she even said that she couldn’t believe someone put their hands on her— But still, okay.

159,"So I noticed I have problems and I just need some advice on how to deal with. 
I’m an male still in his teenage years btw

1. So i suck at communication. I can think about all the good things to say but when it actually comes to talking my brain is blank. It just shuts down and everything I have prepared for goes down the drain. 

2. Because I suck at talking I often simply keep everything in my head and bottled up, and when I have enough I go from looking like 0, very chill to 100, physical in an instant. There is no in between, it’s all chill until I erupt like an volcano. 

3. I often find I take out my anger on my family. I have always thought family is the most important people in your life but I always take out the anger on them and inconvenience them (I don’t get really physical with them but I do throw stuff around) this gets worse when I don’t want to tell them how I feel and now it’s just me looking like I’m very unstable. I’m kinda questioning if this is really the case now. 

4. I find that I would rather take out my anger on the people who annoy me the most but often what they do is so small and simply annoys you. But that builds up and I don’t know how to deal with it. 

5. I hold unto my grudge for long periods of time until I can get revenge. I do notice it’s bad but it’s simply how I am. 

6. I often try not to make a big deal out of something even though it bothers me (maybe it comes with me being asian and the culture of chill, it’s not an big deal, just move along)

7. I sometimes like being alone and having conversations is something I’m not good at and don’t like. I don’t know how to do small talks and stuff. 

8. The only thing I’m good at is at debates. I can argue and I usually excel at more organized debates but that’s about it at speech. I can’t “roast” or say something smart unless it’s an text where I have time to think but even then I suck. I think logically and really anything other than logical I suck at. 

9. I’m quite the nerd. I’m not really into trendy stuff. 

10. I’m actually quite obsessed with control... in that I want to feel dominate but again I’m socially retarded. My ego can be big but telling me to not give in to ego is easier said then done. 

11. I’m addicted to my smart phone. I’m practically born with it at this point. I use it for everything from what I learn to entertainment and I do find it useful but I’m questioning it if has an negative side effect on my personality, like anger ego and stuff. Is the dopamine released from learning clouding my daily enjoyment of life and simply being human?

If you have an answer to my questions please make it logical or philosophical whatever that means but yeah I just want to find the roots of my problem and deal with it. I wanna improve myself now even though I do hate to admit I’m not perfect.",19May2019,1

161,"Hello! First time posting on Reddit here.


Let start by saying I love pitbulls. My favorite kind of dog by far, they are the most caring, loyal and fun dogs and I would LOVE to rescue one from a shelter. I have been researching training, dog parks nearby, shelters and the cost of keeping a dog healthy for months now.

However, I just found out the apartment I live in has breed restrictions and you know pit bulls are an ""aggressive breed"" so of course they're on the list. I still have until April on my lease and moving isn't really an option(yet), so I did some research and found that sometimes if it's the landlord, and not the insurance company who puts the breed restrictions in place, they'll make exceptions if the dog is well behaved. 
How do I ask them? I want to be respectful about it...

162,"Also posted on r/friendshipadvice but my phone won't let me crosspost.

I (24f) and my cousin (also 24f) have been best friends for years. Best friends doesn't even cover it, I could never survive without her. Her mother and my father came from an abusive home and turned around and became perpetrators. I got kicked out of my parents' house when we were 17 while she was financially manipulated by her parents to stay home and not move out until she finally broke free at 20. 

As a result, both of us have severe depression and she has more deliberating symptoms than I. 

Both of us have been actively suicidal for the last year. My depression was fueled by attending school 3 hours away from my husband and my support system and living in a dorm, and hers was accelerated by living in an isolated town with no friends, and a job where she is bullied by management and other coworkers. 

We live 90 miles away from each other. I have been medically diagnosed with depression, I take anti-depressants, and I see a therapist twice a month. I am able to do all this because of my husband's income and insurance. 

With my depression, I have had more people to confide in and it's my husband who bears the brunt of my severe self-loathing/self harm/suicidal ideation, but with my cousin, I am the only one she confides in. And I never feel like I am helping, or making it better or anything so I kind of started to withdraw because I was so terrified that I would fuck it up and she would kill herself because I couldn't help her. And on top of that, I was commuting every week to a town and dorm room I hated for school so I started to withdraw from everybody in my life.

As a result, my cousin has been the one initiating our whole friendship for a year and both of us know it. 

I graduated last week so I finally broached the conversation and I sent a Marco Polo where I acknowledged that I had fucked up and I was sorry for not putting in energy in our friendship but I didn't know if I had the emotionally energy to be who she needed me to be. 

She took that as me saying I didn't want to he apart of her life anymore and said some pretty hurtful things, which I got angry and responded but ended up in tears as I told her I was terrified that she would kill herself because I fucked up.

I think at this point both of us are hurt, and frustrated, but this relationship is so vitally important for both of us that we are willing to put in the work to fix this.

Does anybody have any advice about how we can build a friendship where both of us can focus both on each other and self-care?

I hope all this makes sense.",19May2019,1

166,"I work as an IT Engineer, responsibilities ranging from the boring tech support to managing and purchasing technical assets. My workplace includes 2 different business towers.  So, last week, I observed it from 3 different people in my workplace. It goes like, I am in an affair with a girl from Tower A.

First time I heard, a person from the group that I usually have lunch asked me why I was not having lunch with that certain individual. I didn't understand the relevance of the question.

Second observation, I was in HR department in which someone was talking about that girl, then after a while, noticed my presence and said ""Oh, I didn't know you are here"". I let it go once more cuz it could also mean that person was simply not paying attention.

Third observation, the office door was locked with biometrics. As I headed to the fingerprint device, someone behind me said, ""Hey, she's right there. She could open the door for you"". I was like ""Wtf does it even mean?""

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I don't really understand how these gossips begun. The poor girl involved in this stupid rumor is always stationed in tower A. While Tower A is where my department at, I spent most of my time in tower B.  I have lunch with only a handful of people, which does not include her, at outside both towers.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that since I arrived to this company, I made special effort to keep my professionalism straight and not get too friendly with anybody in my company.

Therefore, I want to become an exchange student in my high school years, both to experience another culture, as well as to figure out whether I would like to make the country my permanent residence in the future.

Anyway, here are my current goals:

\- I want to achieve grades that get me into a position where I can pursue a higher education in a good university, likely in the field of technology or math.

\- I want to sign up for an exchange program in Japan.

The obstacles that currently face me are, as follows:

\- I have issues with work ethic and concentration, symptoms of my ADHD.

\- Though I have attempted to learn Japanese, I stopped for whatever reason near the end of ninth grade. This has left me with virtually no understanding of the language.

\- I suffer from clinically diagnosed OCD, though it is an issue I believe I can control.

169,"I've been struggling with depression for nearly a decade - been through extremely traumatizing experiences and couldn't let go of them. I attempted suicide, when I thought it wasn't worth struggling anymore, and stopped half-way only because I suddenly realized that I didn't want to hurt my father, who's very precious to me.  

However, I managed to turn everything around after meeting my girlfriend. I did my best to stop being worthless and become a better person for her, and, by God, I did (literally, I converted to Christianity). Many great things came my way, and by the end of last year I got into a **really** damn good university. I got in, it's all great and then my (by that time) Fiance told me she never really loved me and left me.

Long story short, I broke. I drank a lot, and I did a bunch of stupid shit while drunk. My University marks never dropped - I'm as excellent as I can be, but nearly every night I'd drink myself to vomiting. After seven months of this experience I finally stopped, and didn't have a drop for three months. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then everything went to hell again. I found out that several people have recordings of me doing drunk things that can easy-peasy get me thrown out of the university. I approached a good friend of mine, and they refused to delete anything. Afterwards, I didn't risk talking to others, because they could've guessed that it meant a lot to me and, who knows, maybe they'd blackmail me.

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago my father has developed a heart disease. To explain how bad it is: after I left for university (in another city) he was so nervous that he nearly had a heart attack and had to spend time in hospital. If I get thrown out because of those vids, he will surely die from stress. He is so dear to me, more dear than anything in the world, and I am mortified of what may happen,

&amp;#x200B;

I feel trapped and lost. I have nightmares of seeing my father dead and being expelled nearly every night, and I'm constantly on the verge of mental breakdown. I know I can't kill myself, because the stress will kill my father, but if I live he may still die. It is all hopeless and dark, and I have no clue what to do.

So my neighbour \[who lives across from me in my building\] was caught stealing a beautiful portrait from a framing place along with his glrlfriend/sister \[Odd but I'll explain later in this post\]. They claimed they were the owners, paid 300$ \[they're not too bright tbh\] and left. The original owner questioned the worker and gave her a description that oddly fit my neighbours.

They stole the frame and put the picture in the garbage room. My mum found it while taking some trash down and took it, wondering why the hell someone would throw out a perfectly pure picture.

Turns out they tried throwing out the picture and kept the frame for some dumb reason. The owner posted it as ""missing"" in an FB Sell group that my mum is in, so my mum contacted the woman and told her she had found it in our buildings garbage room.

So what happens when something is stolen?

The police are called.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was taking a nap until I heard voices in the hallway. I'm anxious when I'm home alone so I check through the peephole to see who it is. Surprise! It's police. Happy birthday to me.

Just kidding. But after a couple of minutes, the police leave and my mum walks in with a clipboard. I thought my mum did something wrong because I didn't know ANYTHING about the picture up until then. I thought she did something. So I ask, ""what's that in your hand?"" and she replies ""police report."" She grabs a pen and walks downstairs.

I was going to go back to sleeping because I'm a dumbass night owl who has insomnia until the neighbours knock on my door. They look pissed, asking me if I knew anything. I just told them I saw my mum holding a police report and that was it.

The sister/gf gives her brother/bf a dirty look before thanking me and going back into their apartment. We were given an award for returning the painting. The owner is a wonderful woman. 

It was supposedly in her family for decades and her mother was incredibly worried. I'm glad to know she got it back safe and sound.

Here's the thing, though - the owner is speaking to police on Monday and I've decided to talk to them to give information. But in the past he's tried giving signals that he wanted to have intercourse with me. I was 15. I fucking hate seeing people get upset, even if they did something terrible, so if I do happen to do so It'd kill me. Even if he committed mass genocide; if he gave me a saddened look I'd cry.

&amp;#x200B;

In Canada, the age of consent is 16. I was 15 \[like I mentioned above\] so if we did 'it' it'd be statutory rape, with or without consent.

&amp;#x200B;

The first encounter I had with it was really odd. He asked me to help his girlfriend with the ""emo"" type of style. I just wore a bunch of black but if that's emo....ok.

Before I went to his place, my mum told him that I was 15 and he just said ""oh? we thought she was 20.""

?????? Mkay.

I look older but fuck. I obsess over Blues Clues and Barbie still, motherfucker. For nostalgia trips. Leave me alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I go over to his place expecting to see his gf. Nope. No one there except him. I'm forced to write down ""emo"" related bands and fashion to the best of my ability as he's watching tv. I frantically text my mum after a while and ask her to lie about me needing to watch my dogs or something.  She does.

Second encounter is when there was a power outage in my town. He invited me to go over to his place and my stupidass went because I didn't want to be alone in the dark. My mum was out fishing and she had the keys so I couldn't get in.

That's when things got creepier. He invited me to SLEEP in his bed, and I declined, obviously. Then I went onto the balcony to get tf away from him, but he followed me and asked if he could ""cuddle"" me because it was cold.

??? I would've gladly given him my coat. Creepy dickweed.

I questioned him about his gf and he just told me ""we just have sex"". That doesn't make you sound cool, dude. Makes you sound like a tool.

When my mum came home, she unlocked the door and the fuckhead followed me into my house. Seeing as he stole a picture, he probably would've stole something from my place if I wasn't looking.

He has offered to watch and take our dogs outside multiple times, which every time we declined.

I ranted to my mum. In the dark. While eating cheese. It was an experience, I'll tell you that, motherfuckers.

Now, onto the ""sister/gf"" thing.

My mum and I did our research and found they both have the same parents, same grandparents, same last name and they look a little alike. She calls him ""babe"" and shit like that.

I’m living with three other boys and for the first week, I’d say we were all on friendly terms. We played games with our female friends, partied, cooked together, and even wrote up a constitution together.

Today I invited my roommates to play a quick game of Monopoly and we played the first two turns before having to drop the third roommate because he was preoccupied with something else. It was a fun couple of turns and got the other two into actually playing for real. We started a new game with just the three of us and were prepared for a long game. 

About ten minutes into the game, the other two roommates formed a verbal alliance to help each other out after the first roommate (E) was about to have to mortgage to pay the second roommate (J). From then on, they would purchase properties at auctions for low prices and trade each other for benefits. That was cool and all since I consider myself to be an adept Monopoly player. I allowed them to continue on cheating throughout the game. 

Coming toward the climax of the game, E traded me the last red property I needed in exchange for the last orange property he needed much to the chagrin of J, who would’ve rather E not traded with me. At this point, J disowns E and stops letting him land on his properties without paying. The team broke up and I was free to play how the game should be played. 

In the end, E became strapped for cash after landing on J’s boardwalk and having to mortgage properties for a chance to still win the game and as J became even more confident that he would win after finessing E into trading him the last yellow in exchange for chump change, J lands on my red property, costing him all his money.

Instead of declaring bankruptcy and ending the game like a civilized person, he traded E all his properties for $1, but after figuring out he was not allowed to trade housed properties, he quits the game after I told him several times not to and declared he didn’t lose because the game didn’t technically conclude and proceeds to leave.

We played the game for well over 3 hours and the prize I get for winning against all odds was a sore loser’s tantrum. I told him I would never play a game with him again an he tells me “good game” before he walks out. 

 Now, I am actually quite upset that he acted the way he did and am prepared to stop talking to him on a social level entirely, but I want to know if I’m overreacting first, blinded by my anger.

My brother who is 13, has always had questionable behavior with pets and animals in general. There was one point where he got caught sticking his finger in our cat and my (17F) mom and dad were told about it, but didn’t care. They figured it was just curiosity. 

About 45 minutes ago I snooped on his phone (I know that wasn’t right of me..) after telling me about his relationship with a 17 year old boy (my little brother is gay.) As soon as I opened his phone it was on facebook messenger, and the first thing I saw was a nude of my little brother that he sent to this 17 year old boy. The 17 year old was telling him to make our cat do sexual acts with him because it would “turn him on” and by the messages it seemed like he did.
I’m just .. at a loss for words right now. I can’t even look at him. I feel like there is something that I can do, but I don’t know if reporting him to the police is right, or human services..I need to do something though. 

He is 13 and I want him to grow into a good man. However, my parents won’t put him in therapy (I don’t know why.) 
I feel like he is like this because of the abuse that we have gone through years ago. Our mom has felony child abuse on her record, and while I was put into a temporary ‘foster’ home, he was not. He stayed living with his dad (who is referred to as my dad, but he is not my biological dad, he’s my brothers dad.) 

Where do I go from here? Anything I say to my parents about this will fall on deaf ears. I’m worried for him, and our animals.

My mum left me to look after my autistic brother. I have had to work tirelessly to support him and it’s taken away any thought of ever having a baby or buying a house as all my money goes on keeping us afloat. Mum and I keep in touch but she recently admitted to cheating on my stepdad, while she lives in a mansion he bought for her and leaves me and my brother struggling to survive. This is not the first time she’s cheated on him. The list of all the fucked up things she’s done over the years would fill the internet. She always had food on the table and a bed for us to sleep. but when your mother trying to have sex with your boyfriend when your 16 you start to realise that there’s more to being a parent than just providing food and shelter. 

My dad is around but isn’t interested in being a parent or any sort of support to me or my brother. 

The only person I have left is my partner. My fucking rock. The best man on planet earth and the only thing stopping me from necking myself.

186,"Hello everyone, I linger a lot but I thought I'd post something finally. It's a bit different than some of the awful stories I read on here so hopefully I can get some unique replies. This is actually an issue I've had with several girls. I have no problem at all with talking to girls, or going out with them, or really just being friends. I make better friends with girls than I do guys for what ever reason. I believe it's cause I lean more on the sensitive side and don't have much of a problem vocalizing my feelings. However, with this pretty new and most recent girl I've been talking to, and clearly flirting with, she likes to tease me a lot. Like, A LOT. I've noticed this as a pattern with many of my ex-girlfriends.

 We'll be talking, smiling, giving each other our full attentions, but she likes to tease me about anything from how long it takes to do my hair, to being passionate about more femenint things, to maybe the paleness of my skin; a lot of apperance things. My ex liked to keep me out of inside jokes her and her friends (also my friends) had, and that I ""looked cute"" when I didn't have a clue what was being talked about. I've also been teased about not being a hard worker ( I think I am ) and being a pot head ( I don't smoke that much ). This was such an issue with that particular ex that I confronted her multiple times about how this actually made me feel shitty. Her response to me was that she didn't know why she did it, she understood it hurt my feelings, and yet she said she couldn't help herself. Granted she'd stop with the overt teasing, which became borderline insulting, for a couple weeks but than she'd slip back in to that pattern. When I'd finally asked her, she said she couldn't actually point out why she liked me.

Don't get me wrong, it's not like I hate it. Because of the teasing I usually do a lot of teasing back. But I always try to segue the conversation into something different, like current events, or passions, etc... Literally anything but teasing, but she just keeps going with it. I haven't said anything to this new girl yet about how I don't particularly enjoy it when it's 100% of the time. We were smoking weed and watching Thrones at my house for the first time yesterday and I actually had a good time hanging out with her. I enjoy her company and want her to know that I'm interested, but I feel like if I told her I didn't enjoy the teasing she'd see it as ""oh we aren't connecting"". Words of affirmation mean a lot to guys too. Being so young and relatively inexperienced with long term relationships, I don't know if this is the norm or not. It makes me feel like a boytoy, and that my opinions are second only to my appearance and what I provide in a relationship. I've tried avoiding this by slowing down how quickly I can go from being friends with someone, to being in a relationship with someone. But I'm not sure if that's helping or not.

I like this girl but maybe I just shouldn't pursue anything and wait for someone to enjoy my company without it being at my expense. Why is this and how do I avoid this again?",19May2019,0
187,"Having just finished the first year of my undergrad, I’m kind of in an internal debate as to whether or not the value of the degree I am currently in is worth it or not.

So I’m currently in a double major in Business and Computer Science at a fantastic Uni, it ranks in the top 20 best comp sci programs world wide and the business aspect is a pretty sweet addition, although I will admit I would never be able to pursue solely a business degree as I find too many things to be bullshit as to what they teach you. The comp sci is great though.

As my dream of being an entrepreneur, this program is fantastic. But it’s costly, and I’m beginning to question whether or not I should leave and go to a local university which would be a fraction of the cost.

If I were to move universities, I’d drop business and comp sci and pursue electrical engineering (since I already know a lot of CS from teaching myself in high school) as I feel it is the best engineering for creating things and make businesses out of them.

Should I make the switch? I have the option of either using my 150k on a double major that is regarded as one of the best worldwide, and set myself up with fantastic opportunities with Google, Microsoft, and a whole bunch of companies that I’d be able to gain experience in and then go off on my own, or I could make the switch now to engineering at a local university, and start my entrepreneurial career with 150k in my pocket.

I know i’m sexually deprived and that probably plays a big part, but i’m also desperate for love and affection. Growing up in a Middle Eastern household, I was never given much affection, and have never had the best friends as well.  The idea of someone loving me, as well as me giving love to someone, makes me happy, and I want that. I’m also so tired of feeling there’s something wrong with me because i’ve gone all this time with not so much as my first kiss, while literally everyone around me has done any and everything. I just hate feeling this deprived. It feels desperate and pathetic, but i’m human and have needs too, ya know? idk i just feel like i’m missing out on so much in life, and i know i’m young and still have a long time but i cannot help but feel like i’m gonna die alone. It feels like i’m just unlovable, which isn’t too hard to believe because of my incapability to express emotion, but I cannot help the way I was raised. That’s just how it’s always been in my household. Mental health has never been a priority in my family, it’s always grades, college, and career. It just takes a toll on me mentally and I never have anyone to talk to about any of this. I’ve also never experienced normal things most teens experienced other than relationships, such as going to parties, being a part of a friend group, etc. It just sucks to think about, and the more I think about it/ go on like this, the more numb i become. Life is short and I wanna make the most of it, my biggest fear is looking back and thinking of what could of been.  I just want a good group of friends and like someone who thinks of me romantically that I can kiss sometimes,  ya know?",19May2019,1
190,"Ever since I was a kid and had that awful dream of my mom dying, and when I woke up I was in daycare so it would be hours before I saw her again. To my grandparents dying when I was growing up, to both of my dogs, my sisters dogs (who after I touched them they ran in the road and got hit) to my guinea pig all dying. I hate death. 

All I do is worry about my parents, I don’t want to move out because as long as I’m here I know they’re ok that they are not just laying down unable to move because they fell. I can’t help but go through all the possible scenarios in my head where they could get hurt. I don’t want them to die. I really don’t. I’m 19 they’re like 60.

192,"I want to say I used to be worse with this but I’m not really sure I’ve gotten better. Maybe better at hiding it and bottling it up until I explode. I want to start this with, I have an amazing boyfriend who does a lot for me, buys me nice things, spends most if not all of his free time with me wether it be coming over or spending hours on video calls with me when I’m doing homework. 
I think problem stems from being stressed and tired but I guess the second something doesn’t go my way I get really upset and to a degree I lose control. Usually when my bf leaves to hang out with his friends I get sad that he’s leaving and I try my best to remember I can’t control him and he’s not like me; I’d be satisfied if he was with me 24/7 and he thinks the amount of time we spend together is unhealthy. We often tend to argue about stupid shit and it always ends up being my fault, usually it is but I wish he would handle things better. Usually I get upset about something he does, I like things that are routine and it puts me at ease but I get upset when it’s broken and today it was already off because he wouldn’t be spending time with me until late tonight, and then said something that I thought meant he wouldn’t talk to me at all tonight and it made me really sad. He was going to a family dinner after work and I know he was busy so I thought he would call me after work like usual before he went to the dinner and he didn’t, I called him because he sent me a message that was concerning and made no sense and he told me he was fine and couldn’t talk Bc he just got home and there were lots of ppl and hung up without saying he loved me so i tried to ignore it even tho I was sad and texted him asking if he was going to call me on the way to dinner and he didn’t respond and then I started to get really mad an hour later I called him a bunch of times and angrily texted him asking him why he’s ignoring me(he was already  at the dinner at this point though, so he was busy) he went outside to call me back and apologized a bunch of times and me being AWFUL at these kind of things just kept bitching at him and wouldn’t take the apology as sincere as it was. I just couldn’t let it go. He ended up coming home way earlier than expected and I was playing games with my friends Bc I needed to distract myself and try to be happy bc I was livid. He joined us and played some games but then he told a story involving a girl he works next door to and he usually says bye to her when he leaves Bc they’re friends and only recently have I been able to accept that they’re friends and not be jealous (we had an argument a few weeks ago Bc he ignored me to tell her that her car window was open when I only had 10 seconds to talk ig I was being selfish tho) but his story was funny and I laughed but a few seconds later I threw a shot at him saying “oooh so that’s why you forgot to call me on your way home from work” but it was meant to be a little joke, sarcasm whatever u wanna call it and he got mad. In the game we were playing I was trying to impress him Bc a few weeks ago he implied I couldn’t play a certain thing and I was doing it now, and super well too and I did a really cool thing in the game that he saw but he took some of the kills and i got mad and just pretended and jokingly said  “wooow damn you’re trying to steal all the glory I see how it is” and he did a little snide action in the game and I got kinda mad and was like hey don’t do that, that’s mean and then he got mad and me and took his headset off and I got upset and left the call because I was trying my best not to freak out and get mad when he did something that upset me and I thought I handled it well and then at that point I just had enough with pretending to not be mad and I went to bed. 
He called me and we argued for half an hour and I promised him I would stop starting arguments and freaking out over little things. So here I am seeking advice on how to stop overreacting, how to let things go, how to keep myself happy because it’s really not fair to him that I want him to spend time with me and only me all



TLDR;
I promised my bf I would stop arguing with him. On the verge of losing him bc of it. I need help learning to let things go, cope with anger,  stop overreacting, and miss him less when he’s gone and find ways to distract myself because he has a life and friends too and it’s not fair that I try and keep him all to myself",19May2019,1

His wife recently switched bipolar medications due to finding out her body was having allergic reactions apparently to one she had been taking.

Ever since she switched medications she seems totally different. She’s quieter, somewhat colder, and weirdly she’s blatantly more open to other men and has even somewhat flirted with them right in front of her husband, and yet she seems less interested in him. I noticed this especially when we went out to dinner the other night and she was very friendly with the waiter. I’ve known these two for years and she was never like this.

I don’t know how bipolar works exactly, but is her medication doing this to her and making her act like this? Is this something to do with manic phases and she’s more into other men during them?

All I know is my friend is really stressed about this and he’s tried talking with her and she gets offensive.",19May2019,1
195,"Hi, this might not be the right place to post this but I am at a loss. My elderly cat had surgery earlier this year on the left side of his place. He had massive infection from getting into a fight with another cat. I took him to the vet and 800$ later he had a large drain coming out of his head draining all the fluid from the infected site. Took him home and gave him the antibiotics. The vet removed the drain and he was healing. Once the wounds were closed I assumed he would be okay and I removed the cone he was wearing. Then he would scratch the area and the old wound plus the surgical area where the drain reopened. The wounds were not deep. I would cleanse them with sterile NS and keep him indoors with the cone on. At one point after he healed after his happened he got out and I didn't see him for a few days. I assumed the worst but he did come home but his face was a mess. Took him back to the vet and got him antibiotics and home with the cone again. He healed but the site is hard underneath. He gets irritated in the area and scratches the hell out of it. 

There seems to be a new cyst that developed and I can't afford to take him back to the vet. The cyst did drain itself and i have him indoors with the cone on. 

I feel terrible about this. His face seems irritated and I'm concerned that he is going to scratch his face right apart because of the irritation in the area. I try to keep the site clean and to engage him normally so he isn't depressed with the cone on.

The cone is a flexible blue one (from Kong) that is washable and comfortable for my kitty. It has an adjustable drawstring on the neck that is never too tight. I do wash his face and give him time with the cone off to groom himself. But once he starts to scratch I put the cone back on. 

Has anyone ever heard about something like this happening to their cat? I can't afford to take him back to the vet right now. I love this cat dearly and no I won't put him down. 

Looking for advice or why this is happening.",19May2019,1

And I’m just comatose wondering wtf am I hearing, and then all of a sudden he grins and says. “Nah, I’m just joking lol.” This sounds short, but it actually scared me. I genuinely thought he was tellingly me because he was annoyed. 

Also, my friend and I were in the school library, and I grabbed his phone to take pics. We ended up making weird faces weird faces, and because I was such a noob to Snapchat, I ended up recording a video and posting it on “Our Story” for SC. Apparently a friend from my physics class told me that video was sent in their physics group chat (which I’m not part of) by that dude. He probably found me and was like “lol.” Idk I was really weirded out. 
He also tends to look in my general direction often. Like I somehow sense it with my peripheral vision (unless it’s all in my head). And when I turn to look back at him, we end up meeting eyes, and I have to hurry up and look away beaches then it would turn out awkward (this has happened a lot btw).

Keep in mind that we only share one class together and we have hardly ever spoken to each other. Like we don’t share each other’s contacts.

208,"Hey,My best friend of 13 years husband of 3 years this sept has been messaging and seeing trans women. We have had the perfect love story and perfect marriage thus far. It is pure he loves me so much does so much for me and I have shaped him into a better man. We have never had any issues EXCEPT shortly after marriage our sex life was quite dull. We would only have sex once or twice a month but when we did it was good it was passionate. I just figured he's not much of a sexual guy and I didn't mind once or twice a month as that's what I got accustomed to with our busy schedules. Early this week we had finished up playing tennis and I needed his phone to transfer a picture to myself on Whatsapp. I noticed a chat with a picture of a woman a unknown number and I proceeded to open the chat. He asked her ""hey how much for your time"". I immediately asked him what is this "" He was hesitating and said it's just for waxing which I knew he was lying because he doesn't wax nor did he need to at this point. He was panicking and starting to drive fast at this point I wanted to get home safe. I googled the number and it turned out to be an escort off a local 'shemale escort' website. Once we got home he admitted this is something he does when he masterbates to finish off. That he messages and blocks immediately after the message. Ofcourse I don't believe him I'm furious I checked his blocked list on whatsapp and there are several more local escorts he had messaged and blocked. I could not retrieve those messages. He went to work that night so I decided to check his emails. I noticed five years ago he was subscribed to 'shemale porn'. I also noticed an email from 3.5 years ago before we got married .. in that email he had responded to a Craigslist ad that said 'horny shemale looking for young student ' he sent his pics and number. I confronted him and he continued with the same story but was crying begging and pleading that he will seek help to not leave him that I'm the best thing that has happened to him etc etc. He assured me he didn't see anyone during marriage and it was just once before marriage. He's unable to explain to me why he goes to a trans women. He says they look like a women .. I know that but they have a penis so explain. The following day I told him I'm going to have you do a lie detector test so it's better you tell me now if you have seen any trans during our marriage. He admitted to seeing one in November 2018 and one in April 2018. He said nothing more he swears. I am broken and completely shattered. I feel like there's more but at the same time he confessed everything in detail and wrote me a wrong letter of how he feels and all the realization of what he's done. Today he completely broke down but says he will respect my decision if I choose to leave him because he loves me but ofcourse he wants me to stay. I feel like this can continue how can a man suddenly drop and change his habits "" He said he went to them just to penetrate them from behind nothing more. He said they have big breasts and are curvy. I said thanks because I'm none of that nor do I have a penis. I let him penetrate me from behind just once when we were both super drunk and I did not enjoy it and he acted so grossed out next day saying it felt really weird. He knows I'm not going to be the same person and he's willing to live with that but I'm not sure if I am. I don't want to check his phone and location constantly for the rest of my life. I don't want to be this miserable person. I don't know if I can forgive him though my heart sank when he broke down and cried. I don't know if I eventually should. We were planning to start trying for kids soon I am turning 31 but there is absolutely no way that I would want that now and it makes me furious that such a big plan of my life is being put away. He says he's attracted to me like I said when we have sex it's great but then why is he going outside and seeking something else "" I am so lost I don't know who to talk to because everyone loves him and is close with him and it's an embarrassing situation. I just need to know you think this is something that will continue"" Do you think I should walk out while I'm young and successful and not dependent or have any children "" Please help me !

221,"Tonight, I was relaxing and having fun playing video games with my friends. Everything was going wonderfully until my sister sent me a text asking me to come upstairs to talk to her. When I went upstairs, my sister told me that she caught my mother sending and receiving inappropriate messages with a guy who was twenty years younger than her. My mom - who is disabled and morbidly obese - is using old pictures of herself effectively catfishing this man. The worst part is that my mother was trying to set this guy up with my sister. In retrospect, it is clear that she only wanted my sister to date this guy because she wants to date this guy and get to know him. When my sister confronted my mom, she said things like ""stop eavesdropping"" and ""leave me alone."" If and when my step father finds out, he will likely kick us all out of the house. I still have a year left of college, my sister is working a retail job and has a kid, and my mother is physically disabled and unable to work.  
What the heck should I do? I have lost so much respect for my mom tonight and I don't know how I can look her in the eye tomorrow. How do you deal with the realization that your mother is imperfect? How do you deal with the realization that your own mother is a cheater? I'm sorry if this sounds like I'm ranting, I'm feeling very distraught and upset at the moment.",19May2019,1

223,"Let’s start by saying I that at first I didn’t want to believe she was treating me like this.  I thought she was trying to give me some advice. I suppose it was intended like that at first. However, since recently I feel like she is criticizing me.

Ever since I can remember, I’ve had lack of confidence, few friends and obeyed my parents most of the time. I know there are things I need to change but that’s not the point.

My sister on the other hand is a social butterfly and has a great personality. She has always been like that, but recently she got a new boyfriend. I don’t have a problem with the relationship, but she became overconfident.

I’ve been secretly jealous for her ability to befriend anyone and maintain a good conversation. This motivated me to improve myself a little. Still, sadness gets the better of me sometimes.

In the  last few months I feel like she sees me as if I am the lazy, dependable one in my family.  She started to criticize my interests and my social skills at the dinner table. The comments are directed to my parents :”(OP’s full name) needs to do this...”, “OP shouldn’t do that..” it seems as if I don’t have an opinion while I’m sitting beside her. There are few times when she does talks to me directly but she raises her voice and talks slowly. I get that she tries to make me better, I know I need improvement , but there are better ways to give me advice without fueling my feeling of worthlessness.

Whenever I try to correct her on her responsibilities in private she tells me to shut up and stop repeating what my parents told me.  That I need  to stop caring so much. 

She is looking down on me when we should be equal. Should I try to distance myself from her? What do I do about this?

TLDR: my overconfident sister gives me unsolicited advice.",19May2019,1
225,"I don't live in a very good area, every shelter in my county does not take in cats anymore because they are over crowded. I've already taken 4 out of this woman's 9 cats to get their shots and be fixed, including one who was missing an eye who desperately needed antibiotics. I bonded with the cat I have now, but she wasn't fixed so I've been keeping her indoors until I can get her fixed. I fixed my neighbors cats first because she is careless and lets them roam around outside unfixed, and because of this she keeps having more cats, one of which I have now. 

I keep a constant supply of food and water outside my door to ensure they are fed, they were all heavily malnurished, including my own. I assumed she was gaining weight so quickly because she finally was getting a healthy amount of food but it's now been verified she's pregnant.

Again, I don't live in a good area and my apartment isn't big enough to keep however many kittens she has. I tried contacting EVERY shelter in my county for tips on how to adopt out the kittens when she finally has them, and none have been helpful. They no longer take in cats because their inflow is so much higher than their output. I'm not about to adopt the kittens out online to people in my area willy nilly because the thought of putting them into the arms of someone who will neglect or abuse them terrifies me. 

I'm looking for options now so that I have time to plan, maybe set up some meetings but have been unsuccessful in doing so. Kittens, let alone full grown cats are incredibly hard to adopt in my area because there are already SO many stray cats wandering the streets and the shelters are full.

228,"First off, i typed this whole thing already and REDDIT WENT INTO MAINTENANCE AND THE WHOLE THING WAS LOST BUT ITS OKAY I’LL TYPE IT AGAIN. This is a semi - long story but its been bugging me for the past few days and wanna know if I am being paranoid or if I made the right choice.

So, I got a new job a few days ago and met this coworker, we’ll call V. He seems like a cool guy and a couple days ago he asks me to drive him home. This isnt really an issue as he lives pretty close although living in a bad neighborhood and I live around the corner from the store. He offers on the ride their to give me money, but I decline. He then asks me if I smoke weed, which I responded yes to (because I do). He then offered to throw me a free gram which I accept because free weed is free weed and he claims he has so much because he is a dealer. So i drop him off and he gives me the dimebag and thats that.

Fast forward to later that night, a completely unrelated friend, P, asks me to hang out and smoke. I decide itll be a good time to bring the free gram I got from V and smoke it there.  After one bowl, I am completely fried, but I shrug this off because I havent smoked in a while and just figured my tolerance just dropped. But what was weird was when P went to go smoke. See P is a heavy smoker, and smokes a couple times a day, everyday. He claims that it usually takes 4-5 bowls to get him high, which I dont doubt bc he smokes a lot. But when he took one bowl of the weed that V gave me, it knocked him on his ass. I shrugged it off thinking that the weed V gave me was pretty strong and didnt really give it a second thought. Keep this in mind as this isn’t relevant now but will be relevant later.

The next day I work a shift with V and he asks me if after were done working if I want to smoke a blunt w him. I hesitate a little because his weed was mad strong as I know from the night before but agree anyways because why not. So after work we go to a park and smoke a blunt solely made of V’s weed. After smoking it, V gets a call from one of his friends to hang out, on speaker he agrees to hang out soon and once he hung up, V asks me if I want to come. Im on the fence bc im pretty high and am uncomfortable being retarded around people I dont really know but it sounds like itd be a good time. He describes that at night, sometimes him and his friends sometimes go and ride and drive fast on a pretty dead parkway. What is creepy too is that it semeed like he really wanted me to go. He told his friend that I was going before I even said I wanted to go. He texted him that I was coming after repeating his text while he was typing it out loud, but I didnt say anything because i was still on the fence and i was high idk lmfao.

I then get mad paranoid that V is drugging me and is going to take me to this parkway and do something to me like maybe mug me or beat me up. Idk for what but ik theres some messed up ppl in this world and I dont really know this guy too well and plus he has only been working at this place for a couple more weeks then I have and its an easy job to replace (minimum wage job w no prior exp needed). It made sense that the weed could be laced bc P was pretty high off of the one bowl hit and he usually needs a good amt after that to get high. I thought maybe he could handle it better because his body had a higher tolerance to whatever the substance coulda been and it would make sense that they would get me high so I would have less barriers to say no and less of a chance to fight back against 2-3 guys, let alone one guy. Also the high was like no other. Ive smoked a good amount of bud before but ive never had a high like this, it was very weird as it was harder to hold convos. This guy has also given off bad vibes before with a few other flags that popped up but I just shrugged off because they werent big red flags, just small ones that popped up in my radar if that makes sense. I decide to go home and not go out. My street smarts arent that good but I couldnt tell if this was a bad situation or what, but it really sent bad vibes my way, so I dipped.

Was I being paranoid or was me going home the right move?

229,"So I've changed college majors 2 times already. I'm almost halfway through my current major (computer engineering, although it's more like computer science in my college) and I'm starting to feel like I don't know if this is what I want to do.

First of all, I like this major a lot. I have good grades, I'm above average in my programming skills, I'm in an algorithm solving team for ICPC and we're number 2 in our school. 

But lately I've been feeling bored with my homework. I don't have the same energy I had in my first semesters. And the thing I mostly looked up to was learning AI. I am currently working with some professors at school in a deep learning/gravitational waves project and been learning this skill on my own. Suddenly, the mysticism and novelty of AI and the science fiction idea I had of AI is gone and I'm kind of disappointed. I'm disappointed when my teachers tell me most of the mathematical work is already done with Python libraries like Tensorflow and I don't really need to understand how it works. This has been bothering me a lot, so I actually went into the real mathematics involved and I feel like they might be right, maybe all I have to do is copy the code, move some parameters here and there, and boom, you got a neural network. That's not sci-fi, that's not complicated, that makes me depressed. It's like discovering Santa Claus doesn't exist.

And I'm scared that I might get disappointed with another major as well. I'm 22, people my age already are finishing their college degree, and I'm here kind of procrastinating on life because I can't get satisfied. 

I've been looking and physics of mathematics. But I don't want to start over again and what if I'm wrong? What if I actually do like CS more and I'm just being dumb? I will just waste more years.

I also do not like pure programming. As you may have noticed, I like math a lot too. And leaving CS would bd a huge waste of time because I had prepared for this major one year before applying for college. That's the only reason I'm more advanced than my classmates. Because I had took some long online courses beforehand. If I change major, I will be average and just older. I think that would make me feel very bad about myself. I don't know what to do.",19May2019,1
230,"Sorry, this is long.

My mom (54), is a frequently relapsing alcoholic with Borderline Personality Disorder and Disassociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personality Disorder +). Pretty much the only time she ever talks to me it's to ask me if I'm mad at her. I mean I get 3-6 calls a day where she asks me this (it's part of her BPD). I get even more texts than that a day

I stay with my dad most of the time. He's actually a pretty good dad. Wasn't really around when I was little but he's kind of pulled it together since he got sober. My mom was married seven times all to pretty abusive guys. My sister (29) and brother (31) don't talk to her anymore. The thing, other than the constant calls and stuff, that makes me want to stop talking to her, is the dangerous stuff.

So she's been in and out of rehab (like 6 month long trips to rehab) for pretty much my whole life but most recently the past two years. She's had two rehabs that lasted six months and one that lasted two in the last two years. And when she's back it's horrible. I'm not sure if she's worse when she's sober or drunk... It doesn't help that the brain damage caused by her alcoholism (since she was 8 y/o) prevents her from really grasping her own situation.

Some stuff that happened that really scared me was with her splits. She has at least two personalities that we know of... And she doesn't know when she dissociates or changes personalities. What happened last year was that we were talking and she slowly stopped responding. Then she started looking at me weird like she didn't recognize me. I started to get really freaked out.  I'd never seen this personality and didn't know what it was capable of. She became totally unresponsive and looked at me like a wild animal. I started to think she might hurt me so I called every family member I could. They were all busy. I ended up calling the paramedics and waiting far away from her because I was scared. They showed up and she started yelling. Not words... just like yelling. She ran into the bathroom and they had to break down the door. I was standing, watching. She started screaming and stabbed herself with a pair of scissors in the arm. I was 16 w/o a license at the time so they gave me a ride to the hospital in the ambulance and she screamed the whole way there. She didn't remember a thing a few days later and they sent her home (shitty health insurance).

She also dissociates randomly. Once it was when she was driving and ran a red light, another time she made a U-turn in the middle of the highway almost killing us all. I don't know what she's capable of and when I do actually get to spend time with her, it's just manic energy and compulsively asking me if I'm mad at her. It's not my mom anymore... I can't stay with her if I want to keep growing up. I'm a junior in high school.

This is the most recent time I had contact with her a few minutes ago. She texted me:
""Jacqueline. I wanted to tell you that you were not abused by me. I was sober most of your life. I love you all of your life. We have a lot of good times. I realize the times I drank I was not emotionally there for you. I am so so sorry ❤️""
This was out of nowhere because she thinks I'm mad at her. I keep telling her I'm not... It's just constant.

So what I'm asking is... What should I text back? Should I tell her I want to cut contact (I don't live with her as it is, but I told her it was temporary)? Should I tell her in person? Either way, I'm scared I'll just end up back at the E.R. for another suicide attempt from her. 

I don't know what to do... I could just really use some advice.",19May2019,2

232,"Hello guys and girls!
First of all, I am thankful for every one of you that spends a minute of their time to read my post.
Second, I don't know how long this post will be, but I will try my best to make it as short as possible and in the same time put all my feelings in it.

Me (19M) and my girlfriend (18F) started our relationship at a long distance. We would text at every convenient time of the day and talk on the phone for 3-4 hours each night before we go to bed for a period of seven months. During the first 7 months we haven't seen eachother (except video chat) all I knew about her before we started our relationship is that about a year ago she texted me every day and tried to get in a relationship with me, but I was in a very dark part of my life and most of the times I didn't respond.
Everything was going great, we used the months that we were apart to get to my eachother better, so when we meet, we have a solid foundation for our relationship. She told me a lot about her past, the guys she dated and the one time she had sex with her Friend with benefits. So did I. I told her everything about my past. My girlfriends before her, the one time I had sex before her, my porn and substance addiction (which was hard for me, because nobody knew it) I was basically crying and sharing my dark past with her.
Fast forward 7 months, and the time that we see eachother arrives. Everything is more that great, we are extremely happy and I really think she is the love of my life and hopefully my future wife.
Three weeks go by. We are drinking wine and talking, and she randomly grabs my phone and starts going through my messenger texts. I have nothing to hide from her, so I just let her do her thing. She goes through all the texts I had up to the point we started our relationship and gives me back my phone.
I asked her if I can do the same and after a bit of thinking she gave me her phone I was looking through it and was astonished by the amount of guys that texted her and she left them on seen. I got to about 4 months in the past and she grabbed her phone saying that I saw as much as she did and didn't want to ge it back. So I just accepted it. 
The next day I jokingly told her ""ok you deleted some of the messages, that's ok, but can I at least get to the point that our relationship started"". She taught about it, I told her that it isn't fair and she let me see the other texts. (As you can see I am extremely jealous).
I start going through her phone and I stumble on a discussion from about a month after we told eachother that we are in love, I start reading it and after the first flirty text that I saw and red outloud she just looked at me and said nothing. I continue reading and saw that she was sending him sexual memes and flirting with him, and it wasn't him that started all the flirting and began the sexual texts. It was her!
She told him about her friend with benefits.
He asked her to go for Netflix and chill, and she just giggled.
For a brief moment they were talking about her but and she told him that it can make him cum real quick.
I was furious, I didn't want to see her. I felt betrayed and unwanted.
I told her go leave me alone but she kept following me and trying to explain to me that they were just ""JOKING"".
There was no way I would believe that. Then I got drunk while she was explaining to me that all that was a part of the past and has no meaning.

About her FWB
I didn't know that they were FWB up until two months in our relationship when he texted her to go out. Then she told me about him and said I will see him and tell him that everything is over. I let her do it.
She told me that they were in his car, that she told him she had a boyfriend and for some reason she told me that he was extremely horny.
I didn't say much about it after all their ""relationship"" is over.

About two weeks after we saw each other, we were out at a restaurant and he texted her. She looked at me guilty and just deleted the chat. (That's the case with all the boys that she had something with) when I ask her, why is she deleting them, the answer is that it's a part of her past that she wants to forget and she does it by deleting it.

Fast forward to her 18th birthday (7 days ago)
I asked her if I could believe her and if she had anything to hide from me. She said no, so I gave her my phone and asked for her's. She didn't want me to look through it so she told me that it's toxic and just not right. That she felt pressured, but I told her to let me have a look if she has nothing to hide.
I start looking in Snapchat. When I open certain discussions, she starts shaking uncontrollably and can't explain why.
I saw 3 other guys that she flirted with during the time we were ""together"" and one of the discussions was just two months old.
She almost cried, telling me that it's nothing and that they were only joking, I also found out that she was lying to me about some sexy photos of her (bikini photos), that she told me that I was the only one who had seen them, and I saw that she sent then to two other guys.
All the texts happened while I was away and while she was swearing that she loved me.

Now she is trying to tell me that I'm making a problem, from something that's in the past and has no significant meaning.
That I am f*****g everything up by ""digging"" trough her past.

But all I want is for her to tell me the f*****g truth. To share me her past, the exact same way I did. 
After that I feel like she is lying constantly. Like she doesn't care for me, and that if she did it in the past, she will do it again.

TLDR
Am I going wrong by wanting my girlfriend to share her past with me, the way I did?

Please help me!
Do I just let it be?
Am I ruining our relationship by wanting her to do the same thing that I did? (To share me her past, no matter how dark it is)
Please!

Thank you!",19May2019,2

242,"Addiction #1: Caffeine 
So a little over two months ago, I had a flare up with my GERD and was having issues with bed wetting. After a visit with the urologist I was told to give up caffeine. (Addiction to Coffee &amp; Soda) I was drinking 3-4 cups of coffee a day, and sometimes 1-2 bottles of Coca-Cola. It’s been over 10 weeks and I still have cravings for both coffee and soda. 

Addiction #2: Marijuana
BWFORE I get people telling me “you can’t be addicted to pot,” that is completely untrue. I definitely have a dependency. However, I found out on Monday that my current job (that doesn’t drug test) is becoming obsolete and was told to start looking for another job. I have been smoking consistently (damn near everyday for 5 years, my longest T-break being 30 days). This one is really difficult. Between the tremors, headaches, nightmares, extreme fatigue and irritability— I feel miserable. Not to mention the boredom due to all of the free time I have now that I would normally be spending smoking weed and being high. It’s been 5 days and I know it will get better but it’s rough right now. 

Addiction #3: Facebook 
With recent news about my job, I have began job hunting and don’t feel that it’s smart to have my Facebook profile out there for future employers (regardless of my privacy settings). Along with recent political decisions and the EXCESSIVE  amount of time I spent scrolling through Facebook on a daily basis I decided to deactivate my page. It might sound ridiculous but I feel lost and constantly find myself wanting to reactivate it. 

I’ve given up three things that have been such a huge part of my life. I’m bored, scared and tempted to cave but I know I can’t. Being that I have depression and severe anxiety I know that giving up all three of these thing is probably for best, but that still isn’t helping my urges.

From that, I've advised him to start building a portfolio for himself. He decided he wants to start with being a full-stack developer. He's working on that and seems to be doing okay.

He's into GRAIN (genetics, robotics, artificial technology, nanotechnology) and as the title says, wishes to create technology to better serve humanity. He wants to be an entrepreneur and I'm wondering what can he do to grant him the most success?

Any info would be greatly appreciated. And if you have any further questions regarding his situation, please feel free to ask.",19May2019,1

250,"Today my father came home after drinking and started yelling for our dogs to go to bed. He put one dog away and kept yelling for the other one, it wasn't like he was searching and yelling, he was really mad. I think he was made from something that happened earlier but I'm not sure. My dog was sleeping on my bed but is supposed to sleep in his pen and so my dad came into my room and saw him. He started to yell again and I told him he needed to stop yelling at the dogs because they won't listen if he does and he's only scaring them. My dad started hitting my dog because he wouldn't walk to his pen and go to sleep, so my dog bit him, not hard but more like a nip. He became so angry and so I held my dog back and I told my dad to not hit my dog because he won't go to bed if he does that. My dad yelled at me and said,"" Let go of him before I beat both of you."" and so I did and he picked up my dog and threw him (the floor in my room is concrete because we are having new carpet put in). Later my dad came into my room and told me he has been lenient and won't allow my defiance anymore.

Cut to a bit later and he's talking to my mom in the kitchen, I don't know if this applies anything to the story but I don't want to leave any details out, and she's mad because he yelled at me. He says he doesn't care and he just wants to be alone, he wishes everyone would die or disappear starting with me. then I heard a door slamming some banging and my mom went to stormed into her room. 

I really don't know if I'm being a spoiled brat or not. It's always like this and I don't know, I feel horrible. Am I being defiant?",19May2019,1
251,"I sell ice cream at those small booths scattered all around the city. It's a summer job and I have to do 60 hours of work for 365€ (~400$). (so the money's not much of a motivator and I'm mostly doing it for experience) 

So yesterday I had a 7-hour shift and I worked alone (usually I had a partner since this is my first summer). It wasn't super hot, but it was warm (around 20°C (68°F) and in Finland, that means people are walking around in t-shirts and shorts). So I think it's needless to say that it was crowded.

The line was almost up to the road (like 10-ish meters (33feet)) and I started to feel a bit claustrophobic because people were telling me their orders the second the previous customer got theirs. It was non-stop for like an hour.

Being a fairly inexperienced ice cream seller (?), I could feel myself starting to panic and felt like I needed a moment of peace (having a history of panic attacks, I was nervous about having one there). I had two small breaks during the entire day. 

I also got a headache about 30 minutes into my shift and it got worse every time I went in to scoop ice cream. My wrist started cramping and hurting, and I was also getting the ever so frequent scratch from the tubs of ice cream, and the lids, etc. 

Also as it became close to closing time, one of my bosses came to help me. He was really efficient at getting the last customers out so we could close, but he also scolded me about everything I was doing wrong, so I felt really insecure.

As I got home, I just started crying (which made my headache worse, which made me want to cry more, and so on) It took me 1-2 hours to recover from the day. And after, I didn't have much time or energy to study (I have exams starting from Tuesday).

Today I woke up almost in tears because I have a similar shift today (starting in about an hour) and it looks like today is going to be even warmer than yesterday. I don't know yet if I have a partner today, but I don't think I do.

TL;DR I came home crying yesterday with a splitting headache and I'm afraid it's going to happen again today.",19May2019,1

A couple weeks ago he stopped by my stand and we were talking. I ended up saying his name and he goes “wow I didn’t know you knew my name, I’m excited” and kinda smiled. 

Last week we worked together in back. It was my first shift back there and he said he was glad I was working with him. During that shift he kept placing his hand on the edge of my shoulder. At one point he rubbed near my neck and poked my side later. I didn’t mind. I love any attention he gives me lol.

Then tonight he came up to my stand at the start of my shift. I had a recent incident at work and he asked me about it. He noticed I got my nails done and pointed out that they look nice. The whole time we were taking we were standing really close to one another, at points out arms were straight up touching. Neither of us moved though. He said he would come back but it got busy and he didn’t

In general while he’s there he’s nice to me. Like when I buss he’ll take glasses from my arms and help me out. He also gets me off of work when it’s late. He’ll go ask my managers if I’m good and help me get out of there. I don’t know. I love being around him, no one has made me feel this way in a while. He’s the sun, he’s great.

254,"And it confuses me because she supports me. I know she likes me as... Something. She wishes me luck in school, I know she cares about my health and she cheered me on and was genuinely happy when I beat depression. There are times where she hopes that I'm doing well. Even her actions mirror things I do sometimes. Today, she even thanked me for driving and being with her, and we hugged each other. Today, we played as a team in Mario Kart because we're both bad at it, and we shared a controller. And out of all of our friends besides her brother, me and her text each other the most, and we seemed to like talking each other.

But sometimes it gets under my skin when I say something in a group setting and she just negates it. Gives a better alternative or tells something that she (from her experience) that is more than what I said. 

Like an example: ""All I ate was steak and guac today."" Her: ""Oh, that's nothing. One time, I eat only steak for a day."" Stuff like that.

And the thing is I feel like it's just with me. With her brother, little to no rebuttal. With our other mutual friends, it may be a ""Why did you do that?"" when my friend say something stupid they did. Sometimes I just feel like I'm an idiot. It also confuses me that she also laughs at everything anyone says.

256,"Hello, this is my first post here, I'm kind of new to reddit, and I don't usually post things on the internet, but I don't know what to do.

Since high school I planned I wanted to be a doctor, I liked the subject and it looked interesting, also, my parents told me that I needed to choose something to start to plan things up.
In my school you can choose one propaedeutic, I chose something related to health.
The problem is, that before choosing this field, I was really interested in space,I loved it ( and I still do it), I felt amazed everytime I discovered something new about it. It became one of my favourite subjects. I started looking to the stars every day.
Since then, my dream was to become and astronaut ( I think I was 14 at the time) 
So, my plan was to study medicine and then study aero space engineering, It was a great plan for a long time, I liked medicine and if I became a doctor and got a specialization (neurology) I could make some money to study what I loved. 
But the fact is, I just realized I don't want to spend  12 years of my life waiting to do what I really love. 
Don't get my wrong, I really like medicine ( especially the neurology part) but I feel like what I really love it's aero space engineering. 
The problem it's that I don't want to dissapoint my family, everyone It's really supportive about me studying medicine.
I tried to talk with them about it, but I think that they don't take it seriously, they told me I wasn't made for that, and that I shouldn't have such great expectations.
Before you start hating my parents, I have to say I live in a third world country, so space careers are kind of useless here, also, main problem it's the money, I don't think any space related fields could make any money here, and yes, I know that money isn't the most important thing in life, but I want to eat.
I could go to another country to study, but the fact is that we don't have resources for that.
I applied for a university to study medicine and I have an exam in less than 2 weeks, and I feel really fucking nervous, It's a hard exam and there's a lot of competence. I have studied since the beginning of the year and I don't feel prepared. I have studied a lot, but I'm feel horrible. This literally gives me insomnia.
I have studied to the point were I have worsenned my health (physically and mentally) but right know I feel without any motivation.
I'm literally sacrifying my health for something I don't really want to do. When I try to talk to my parents about how I'm feeling stressed they just don't give a damn or joke about it. I feel so lonely. I feel so confused. I feel so scared. 
I wasted 2 years of my life on one field I really didn't wanted and I feel like an idiot.
I don't want to dissapoint my family, they seem really excited of me becoming a doctor, but I just can't anymore, this exam is killing me. 
Please someone tell me something, probably I will not get a solution, but support will be more than enough. I feel like no one takes me seriously.

Thank you if you read everything, I really appreciate it.

 Thanks for listening to me.

So awhile back my girlfriend (now fiancé) got pregnant and I was afraid at first but became happy with becoming at dad even though I was 18 (19 now) but after a few month she miscarried and we lost our child only a month in. 

Fast forward a lot  of grief and hardship and jobs later It’s all behind me, or so I think 

So I admit here I am a thief I take stuff that isn’t mine not peoples things but just stuff and not going into detail I took something I shouldn’t have way before any of this happened and I told myself “why don’t I tell my brother this I can trust him” so I tell him about my stealing and he doesn’t seem to fazed, now my brother has a odd moral high ground about a lot of things. 

So my brother does what I didn’t expect and told my parents for so reason only because he couldn’t “bare to see my path” and he shows up at my apartment and starts getting all teary about how he loves me and blah blah. We exchange heated words and he tells me I need to pay for what I did. So I respond and say I payed with the life of my child. I said this because I felt God punishes me for my wrong doings when this happened and he responds with” what proof is there?she is playing you” at this point I unlocked my door and calmly said you may leave which was the hardest thing I’ve ever done after what he said.

259,"I once had a great love for her, then I grew to resent her. The main reason I did was because she seemingly used my kindness and friendship, and she manipulated me. She would tell me she wasn’t interested romantically, which is fine, that’s how it works. Yet, in the next text she’d say things to keep me under her thumb. It was all very confusing and even led to me going through a whole emo period and shit, then I came through it and I began to harbor a strong distaste for her. 

Over time I calmed back down to my normal state and I stopped being so hot headed about it all. And then I felt bad because the last time we’d talked I’d cursed her out. She was crying. It was bad. But I felt... justified. It felt right. That is until it didn’t.

I decided that I should apologize. This was due to the fact that I was trying to be less of a prick and be more calm. So, I did just that. I apologized, she responded. She said she wanted to start talking again. I was fine with it as I figured it shouldn’t be a problem. However, I began to feel really nervous, and not like, butterfly nervous. More like an animal who hears it’s predator. Which is to say, I was afraid I suppose. I didn’t want to talk to her and so I decided it’d be best for me not to. Now I’m having doubts. 

I don’t often ask for help or make posts about it, I have a very bad man complex and I have trust issues, so if this is poorly put together and doesn’t convey the message well, I apologize. 

Finally, do you think I may be instinctively correct and that I should perhaps keep away from her, or is it just something that I should keep down and push through?",19May2019,1

261,"(Weird formatting - mobile!)
Partner and I are in an LDR. We tend to see each other once a month - he copes with the distance better than I do.
Both of us are full time university students, and I work a casual job (usually 3-8 hours a week) while he works a full time job that can be anywhere from 30-60 hours a week.
I’ve gone down to see him, and he’s currently in the final stages of a work project - so working a 60 hour week. I’m here for 4 days, and he has to work pretty much all day everyday to get the project done - he was up until 8.30 this morning completing it. 
When he takes breaks, he doesn’t particularly want my attention nor affection - which I understand to a degree, but I can’t stop myself from being visibly upset over. On top of this, we’ve probably spent a total of 3 hours together in two days where he hasn’t been working. This isn’t his fault - a lot of things have happened causing delays and he did warn me before I came that it was going to be insanely busy for him, but I had already booked and paid for flights at this point. 
Just wondering how people deal with lack of affection in a relationship? I don’t think this would be an issue if we lived in the same area, but we don’t and when he isn’t actually affectionate when I see him it really feels like a rejection. I can’t help but feeling like it would be better for everyone if I just took an early flight home, but then I feel guilty for leaving him when he’s under so much pressure. I just miss him even though he’s right in front of me, and I’m currently not sure how to cope with this.

270,"I only speak and get along with my immediate family. We have our flaws but I love them so much and am forever grateful to have them in my life. A problem that we've had for the past 10 years is we stopped communicating with our extended family, more specifically, on my father's side. He has 7 siblings, all with their own families, making our blood family members large in quantity. We used to talk to them on a regular basis. We would do normal stuff like spend Christmas together, have BBQs on the weekends, and spend time together just hanging out. We were around each other so much that when we had parties, we would have another party the next day to eat leftovers and enjoy each others company again. As a kid, this was amazing. I was so happy to tell my friends what me and my cousins did for the weekends. I dont exactly remember when we stopped hanging around each other, but it probably happened when I entered 7th grade. I always wondered why but I never asked my parents, as they would never mention the extended family members in good terms. It would always be things like the rumours they spread or how hypocritical they were. There was this one cousin I was particularly close with. She is 4 years older than me but I was able to relate to her so much. We liked a lot of the same things and we would just vent to each other; it was nice. But I remember we slowly started to drift apart. We stopped going to their house, stopped calling, she wouldn't even wave when we saw each other (we were neighbors). This cousin then started hanging out with other cousins that I didnt particularly like because they were very pompous but at times were tolerable. This cousin told me how she felt the same about them, so I found it odd that they were hanging out. I remember one of the last times I hung out with her was when we were playing video games and her mother (my aunt) asked me if I took money from them. Being a shy pre-teen at the time, I obviously told them no but I think they didnt believe me. Looking back, I might not have believed me either, but idk. Anyways, the absolute last time I was there was at this cousin's graduation party, where the extended family was. I was in 8th grade at the time, so compared to the other cousins, I was very young. They were all drinking and I felt awkward, uncomfortable, and out of place. They were all chatting and having a good time, but I wasnt. I was there but not with them, just looking in. This was the first time I felt truly unwelcomed at her home. That was the last time I saw her. Ever since then, my family has continued to tell me how entitled they are and how we dont need them in our lives. They've done many things to hurt my father but it would take way too long to explain. Maybe I'll edit this if I need to add them. Anyways, the only thing recently that we've had to connect with them is funerals. I hate how fake they act and how they act like they're much better than our family. They're definitely richer than us, but I dont understand why they dont treat us the same as they do with each other. I've made the mistake of adding them on social media and I'm cursed with constantly seeing them hang out like we used to. In the captions they'll add ""I love hanging out with all my cousins"". It never used to phase me but it has been after every post about a wedding, a vacation, or a family reunion. It doesn't bother me but I hate knowing that they hate me for no good reason. Even if my father did something to them, what do our parents problems have to do with us? I've discussed this with my sister and she says they might be jealous of us. Our extended family are significantly more overweight than us but that seems too stupid of a reason.

Sometimes, it seems like they know I'm watching these posts and they post it for me to see and feel left out.

I LOVE it. but I also compare my stuff to it a lot, and my stuff is crap next to hers.

275,"This may seem strange but I've had this since I was little. 
Every time I was in the car or at someone's house and they'd put on AM radio, my stomach would get so twisted and id feel like throwing up, sometimes I actually did throw up.

I know it's not all in my head because I'll be in someone's car, in the backseat unaware of what station is on because I'll have my earbuds in, blasting music or something and my stomach will start feeling so twisted I'll take my earbuds out and see they have AM on, tell them to turn it off and the horrible naseau goes away. This has happened even when I'm in another room let's say and someone is tinkering with a radio in the other room. I'll have earbuds in, unable to hear anything and my stomach starts churning. I then go to the other room to see if someone has a radio on AM and they do.

Every time I'm in a car or anywhere and I see someone turn it to AM, my stomach immediately churns and I'll feel like vomiting, I'll even have some come up the back of my throat and sometimes have to deal with it because how do I tell people I'm allergic to AM radio??

Any idea on what this is? Do you have or know of anyone who has this?",19May2019,1
276,"I'm 31 years-old, and honestly I'm feeling pretty frayed at the edges. I dunno, maybe life just didn't prepare me for this kind of stuff; I never had much stability growing up, and I can't quite tell if I'm just working harder to compensate for that, or if I'm just mentally conditioned to ""quit"" because of it.

I'll just lay it out there.

I'm 31 years-old, living near DC. I make about 60k a year, and think super highly of the company I work for. Problem is, I'm single, and by all indication, will probably remain single, possibly indefinitely (not even gonna go down *that* rabbit-hole right now).

I've been living with roommates the past few years; first with my friend and his wife, then with a friend and other roommates, and finally back in with my friend and his wife (they *asked* me to move back; long story), and now the wife's sister.

There's not been any ""one, specific issue"" living with them. My job can be pretty stressful sometimes, and for the past two or three months, has felt especially so, because we've basically been overloaded, on top of training a new guy (who I'm really not liking, but that's neither here nor there).

My friend and I work together, so we've *been* commuting together. We've gotten in countless arguments over it (ie. I want a specific time to leave work, even if it means staying in traffic, he wants to stay at work until traffic clears up, with zero indication when that might be). I decided this past week, I'm just going to roll into work by myself, even if it means losing 2-3 hours every day sitting in traffic.

So far, that 60k/year salary... hasn't gotten me very far. It took *forever* to pay off *part* of my debt, and I've had a pretty rough run of things (constant, *expensive* problems with my car, trying to take a trip every year to see family, which usually winds up running like a thousand bucks, *more* car problems, etc). I'm *hoping* things will eventually start to stabilize, but... I dunno.

It's just been wearing me down. I feel like I'm just starting to question my own sanity. My friend and his wife make all this shit look so easy, and I can't tell whether it's simply that they make (a lot) more money than I do, that they just have a more stable living situation, or if I'm just mentally not ""in the right place"".

On top of the financial stress, there's also just a feeling of being fucking *lonely*.

I'm 31 years-old, never been in a relationship, and I honestly don't feel like I have anyone ""in my corner"". I mean, my friend and I have been just growing apart; when I first moved up a few years ago, we would watch movies, play video games, board games, go out with friends, all sorts of stuff. Now, there are days we literally don't even *speak* unless it's about work. Him and his wife constantly go out with friends or to events, but it's this weird, awkward thing now where they pretend they aren't ""going anywhere in particular"", not even make idle chit-chat like ""Oh you guys are dressed up nice, what's the occasion?"".

Which, I'm not putting that squarely on my friend, *at all*. I've pretty much always struggled with depression, and I feel like I've been slinking into that a lot more the past couple months. I just don't know how to get out of it.

Like... the weather was super nice today, but there's nowhere I actually want to go. But I also can't just ""hang out around the house"", because my friend and his wife are doing stuff and tend to make me feel guilty about not ""being more productive"". So I just stayed holed-up in my room all day.

Making matters worse, I feel like I'm in a state of ""yo-yo dieting"". I've done Keto in the past -- and seen major success with it -- and when I started back in December, I dropped about 20 lbs fairly quickly. But then I stalled. And then I got stressed, which led to stress-eating, put on a few pounds, lost those, stalled the *exact* same spot again, started working out every day, didn't lose anymore weight, then my friend bitched at me for ""using my lunch-break to workout, when I still have work to be done""...

So basically, I've gone into this completely useless cycle of ""diet for a few days, have a bad guy, eat some sort of junk from taco bell, beat myself up, start the diet again"", rinse and repeat.

I dunno, man. I just don't know.

Part of me just wants to *quit*. I don't even know what the repercussions of that would be. But I seriously think about just putting in my notice at work, and just ""winging it"" and seeing where I wind up. There's no version that ends with me in a better place than I am, but part of me just feels like ""maybe it's better to be in a shitty situation on your own terms, than feel like shit even when you're trying your hardest to make things work"". Like, maybe there's a point you just have to stop *trying* to make things work, and just accept that things aren't going to get better.

But then I think back, and wonder if that's what my parents did. Maybe that line of thinking is why they're so miserable now, and neither of them will probably ever be able to actually retire.

I dunno, just a lot of shit going through my head right now. Wondering if my hard work is ever *actually* going to pay off, or if I'm just spinning my wheels for nothing.",19May2019,1

Never letting my guard down makes me feel secure. Unfortunately, it’s gotten me into a lot of trouble  in the past, especially with authority figures who thought I was challenging them, when I was really just trying to reason with them.

It’s really hard to accept allowing myself to change, even for my own sake. I’m too fucking proud. I feel like Sisyphus trying to work through my stubbornness.

I’m worried that I might be seen as irritating or bossy in the workplace instead of powerful. There’s no getting around it. Physically, I’m small and nonthreatening with a shrill voice. It’s futile trying to make a good impression on people if I continue to act like this.

Now I’m swallowing my pride and taking a different approach. Maybe if I somehow tone down my aggressiveness, people won’t react so strongly and I’ll still have some redeeming qualities that I haven’t recognized yet.

I’m afraid of losing the upper hand, though. If I don’t speak up for myself, opportunities will pass me by. I won’t climb up the chain of command. I want to be a CEO or a CFO, but I don’t know of any way to get there besides being astute.

281,"**Background:** I designed and teach a program for 14/15 year olds that deals with identity, purpose, social justice and how they could better the world - pretty much helping them to discover who they are, what their strengths are, what they care about, what positive change they can make right now, and how these blend together to point them towards meaningful, purposeful careers that better our world.


**The problem:** Without my knowledge, my boss signed me up to speak about the program I created on a panel at some pointless conference where people in leadership go to waffle on and feel important. I was told that my boss (the principal [50s? M]), the vice principal [40s? M], and the head of teaching and learning [40s? M] wrote the application and will be on the panel. They have nothing to do with my program, which immediately had me off-side. I have yet to see what was in the application but I guatantee it is inaccurate because everything has come directly from my brain. 


I was angry that they had done this without my consent. The school I work in has huge issues with sexism, 70% of the leaders are male when 80% of the staff are female, they offer paid leave for new fathers but no paid maternity leave, so as a woman I am making plans to move on and in the meantime I would *never, ever* be willing to participate in the furtherance of their brand. Obviously, there is no HR department I can go to and there is no union presence because the Independent union is a joke, they have failed us every time. 


What made me breathlessly angry was the way my boss told me (not requested, told me) that I was going: ""It's on a Sunday and you'll be there because the conference wants a gender balance."" Then he turned on his heel and left before I could say anything. 


Not: ""We would like you to speak about the program you designed, because you are the only one who can speak to it."" Oh no, it is not about my knowledge and capabilites, it is about my gender and being decorative. If I don't go they will be humiliated, have to pull out of the conference, and I will be in all sorts. 


There is no opportunity for me to speak to someone before the day, as we have absolutely no contact in our day-to-day, they are all at another campus from me. The irony is that the groups I teach are split into genders and we unpack explicit, implicit and causal sexism in detail, so if I go I will feel like a fraud.


Please help. This is making me so cranky and I've spent all weekend feeling frustrated and skeeved off and powerless.


**TL;DR:** Boss wants me to speak about something only I have knowledge of, on a panel of my other male bosses who also do not know anything about the topic, not because I have that specific knowledge but because the conference has asked for a ""gender balance"".

I was like hmu sometime and he said sure but hasn't mentioned it the last few times I saw him in class. Anyway, a few days ago our class had a group assignment and I asked if he'd like to join my group. His face went red and he mumbled ""I don't mind"".

I thought his awkward reaction combined with how he doesn't seem that interested in hanging out on lunch breaks meant he didn't want to be friends but was being polite. But later on, he offered me some of his soda in class and started joking with me. And then another class we shared had a different group assignment and he asked if I had a group already for that, which I did.

I have wanted to do it for a long time and now the time has come and I just started the process to enlist. My parents were iffy at first, but then eventually were happy for me. Then my mom called me and told me that I shouldn’t be joining the military unless i’m going straight to the academy because I am “too smart” to be not going straight into education. Although I dont agree with the opinion that enlistees are stupid, I am now second guessing myself and wondering if I should try out for the Academy.

Upside: I go straight to college in the Academy and come out with a higher pay and more college experience than if I were to enlist. 

What should I do?

299," Please note the full history.   


* Colleagues A - Gossip, the same city as me
* Colleagues B - Snake, the same city as me
* Colleagues C, D and E - in another country
* Colleague F - same committee at work as me
* Manager A - Pushy, the same city as me
* Manager B - Cool, in another country
* Manager C - Cool, left the company  


1. I joined my current team early last year via an internal move. I secured this role via Manager C, B and colleague B. However, I ended up reporting to Manager A who has been quite intense. She treated me like her PA and I could tell you an endless amount of horror stories (e.g. telling me not to sit at a desk because my colleague wasn't in, tell me her shoes are under my seat \*implying I should get them for her\*, not turning up to meetings, using trigger word adjectives like ""angry""). The list goes on. So since last year, I have been proactively looking for jobs.   

2. Colleagues A, B and I used to have a good relationship until they stabbed me in the back. I sent an email to a small group of colleagues in a diversity committee in the company, which they are not a part of, that read ""Hey, does anyone know if there are any opportunities in XYZ? If so, could you please get in touch?"". Colleague F doesn't like Manager A, like colleagues A and B. So colleague F forwarded the email to colleague A who then showed it to colleague B who told manager A. This was shocking to me. Manager A went off and that was the beginning of me and manager A's poor relationship and her beginning to do the things mentioned in point 1 intensely. This was very horrible because I felt so betrayed as colleague A and B were smiling in my face I wouldn't have known had manager A bought it to my attention. After that, I distanced myself from colleagues A, B and manager A.   

3. 1-2 months after that and serious prayer colleague B left the team. 3-4 months after that colleague C moved internally, 1 month after that manager A left the team giving me and colleague A less than 24-hour notice (manager A's resignation was driven by her not getting her promotion). During this time, I had gotten my promotion but was working in another office alone most of the time. Colleague A didn't like our new office we had been banished to by our former global head, manager C, and manager A needed to do facetime with other colleagues in the other office. It was tough at first but I learned to be independent (I am the most junior person in my team country/city wise). When manager A was in my team I ran a project she was supposed to do 100% on my own. It is usually done by 4 people and usually 2-3 corporate titles above me but whatever. A case for my next promotion. This project is a nightmare and the pushback is something else but by God's grace, I have been making it happen all on my own. This project though has nothing to do with my current team, and in actuality sits in manager A's new team. This project hasn't really allowed me to do anything related to my team as it is so time-consuming.   

4. On Monday, colleague A resigned which would officially make me the only colleague in my city/country. Manager B is our new global head and is also in another country with colleagues D and E. Manager B is my legal manager. In my company, if your manager is not in the same country as you, you need a local manager. Manager A was appointed.   
Due to the crumbling nature of my team, these are the options I currently have and discussed with Managers A and B:  
1. Relocate to manager B's country -- been discussed and pushed back by manager B  
2. Officially report to Manager A  
Not discussed with Manager A and B:  
3. Look internally/externally (loosely discussed with Manager A but internally)  
4. Quit   
I discussed these options, using Manager A as a ""sounding board"" on Thursday, she encouraged me to send an email on requesting her as a manager (wtf), on Friday she asked me where the email was and I told her I needed time to really discuss with Manager B and that the timing was not suitable given all these resignations. Now Manager A has put some time in my diary, being pushy as usual, to discuss this for the third time. The first time was in person, second on IM when she messaged me and third will be Monday. I don't want to SNAP on her but this is tew much! It is even my fault for discussing this with her but wtf?

What should I do? I am still applying for jobs and waiting to hear back from some. Any advice for Monday? I really don't want to feel pressured by her and she has a habit of doing this. It is so annoying and not what I need right now.",19May2019,2
300,"So after not being able to go back to sleep (even though I only slept 4 1/2 hours) the realization hit me that I should ask random people from the internet for advice so here we go :

I have this crush on this girl for the longest time, she is smart we have the same humor, she has damn looks...
And I would have asked her out but she had a boyfriend.
So I tried to forget it, but always low key hoped they would break up.
Yesterday I went to a party and she ate sorta weird, she said stuff like : ""(my name) I wanted to hug you the whole night."" and then proceeded to hug me.

I didn't think any of it until later that night when I was standing in the living room with a seeing her alone on the couch. I went over and asked if she was okay and first thing she says is that she broke up with her boyfriend.
This was not the first time we talked about her relationship once at a party we had an hour long talk about her problems so when she said this now I assumed she just wanted to talk to somebody. 

I tryed to comfort her and offered to be her emotional punching bag. But the living room was the dance floor at the same time so it was really hard to understand each other and the conversation died off eventually.

Now the right think to do would have been obviously to ask her outside to proceed talking but drunk me just sat there and went completely silent...

So after a while if just sitting there and watching two punks dancing she stood up and left to go outside.
Drunk dumbass me didn't follow her. When I eventually did get outside she was sitting on the lap of another dude in my class.

It made me furious but who could blame her she gave me signs all night and all I did was to sit next to her quietly.
So the night went on I got fucking pissed when ever I saw them together until he had to leave. She left soon after.

Now the next morning the first thing that shot into my mind when I woke up was her name. I can't think about anything else and don't know how to go from here.

I would like to wait a month before asking her out but maybe if I wait she will get together with the other guy and I couldn't stand missing my chance like that.

I'm still recovering from a pretty significant brain injury and because of that i have to be careful about getting upset or i will make my head worse and seeing her is going to reopen the progress i've made on distancing myself from Nicole. I want to know if there is an excuse or a way to tell her i don't want to see her without making her want to start more conflict. Thanks for any advice :),19May2019,1
306,"I’m 19, graduated high school last year and I just don’t know where my path in life is going. 

To cut my life story short, I grew up in Florida and went to school like a regular kid until highschool. 9th grade hit and that meant puberty hit hard and I was ugly so I got homeschooled for two years, then my dad moved to North Dakota to work, and I came along. I had my Junior year of highschool and my first job up here. Cutback to 2017, I moved back to Florida for my senior year of highschool, got my second job as a cook, then when I graduated I didn’t know what to do with my life so I moved back up here to “work” for a while. That was last year. It’s been a year now since I’ve graduated and I’m stuck. 

June will mark a year I’ve been up here after graduating. Besides my cooking jobs I had in highschool, I was working in a scrapyard, then the oilfield, and now I’m a security guard going on 6 months now. My life isn’t hard, I make enough money to pay the bills and work is easy and fun at times but I don’t want to be stuck up here past this summer! My whole family is in Florida, I still haven’t gone to college yet and I’m just don’t with it up here. It’s boring as hell, I don’t really have any friends anymore since I cut everybody off, and I just want a fresh start in my life. 

I was initially wanting to move back down to Florida (my family all lives in Ocala which is kind of by Orlando, Gainesville, central Florida) and get a decent job and a small place either house or apartment but I feel like if I do that I just won’t make enough to support myself or figure out what I’m going to do. 

If you’ve gotten this far, what I’m asking is are there any gold ticket spots in the US right now? I’ve never been much of a city boy but New York sounds like it could have a lot of opportunities for me (even though it’s expensive), I’d be willing to move somewhere for any free college, or great career opportunities. I just want a life where I can actually get a breath of fresh air, or some type of new opportunity. If I got in contact with the right person in the right place, me and my dog would be packed in my car in a heartbeat. I’m just waiting on the right moment. 

If anybody has any advice on this that’d be great! Seriously anywhere, I’m willing to take a chance and tell the world who I am, thank you.",19May2019,1
307,"This is some stupid drama so please bear with this story:

Andy is a coworker who has talked shit about others **to** me in the past. Andy is known to get overly defensive (""Why, you got a problem with that?"" is his catch phrase).

One conversation with him, I bring up a peer, Bob, but in a way that could've been misinterpreted as ""he's not even good at this"".

Days after coincidentally, Bob messages to me (he never really talked to me before), hinting at things that I talked to Andy about which made me suspect Andy said something.

In retrospect, I started to suspect that Andy has been bad-mouthing me to others about other things for a while now but no one ever directly confronted anyone about anything because it's too weird to air out any dirty laundry.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** Is anyone experienced with shit-talkers? How did you deal with them? 

I think I'm being painted out as a bad person and I can't really defend myself because everyone is just quietly judging rather than not saying anything directly.",19May2019,1

## How do you make huge changes in your life?

📷

Hopefully this will not be as cringe of a post as I feel it to be.

First, thank you for taking the time to read this and consider answering it.

I am going to be 26 in 1 day and I am completely unsatisfied with my life. I want things to be different but something keeps holding me back.

First, I managed to leave the house only to come back 3 times.

I have failed school a bunch of times as well.

I had a car and wrecked it driving while sleepy.

I have Credit issues.

I have Avoided Legal issues.

I have Avoided Tax issues.

I have had multiple jobs and been fired from them.

I am not an independent adult.

Everything in my life is fucked right now.

I have the worst work ethic imaginable.

I am lazy, and unmotivated.

I am a professional procrastinator

I dont even think I possess consistent self discipline.

I put myself and find myself in great positions only to self-sabotage by avoidance and procrastination.

When I start things, I start with so much bravado. I out perform and everyone likes me. Then i loose steam and flunk miserably. Then everyone hates me. This is in everything (Jobs, Relationships, School especially)

I start things but never follow through with them.

I have such big goals and dreams for myself. But I get in my own way and fuck myself up. EVERY SINGLE TIME.

I feel like its either because I dont believe in myself enough or that I feel that I dont deserve it.

I am told that I am smart and have the potential to achieve great things but i dont live up to my potential. That I sell myself short 100% of the time.

My relationships with people are atrocious. I feel as though I cannot effectively communicate well.

Sometimes I feel like I dont understand people well because people say that I ask the same thing over again. Or im not satisfied with their answer.

I hear a lot that I am not capable of things.

I constantly hear: your telling me you want change, but i feel you dont want it bad enough.

I dont want to go through another year of being a mediocre human being when I feel that I am more than this.

I honestly feel like I this is a symptom of me not understanding myself and what motivates me.

I really want better for myself but i have this extreme feeling of apathy.

I dont want to continue this cycle.

I just dont know where to start or even begin to fix this massive clusterfuck.

I appreciate any help you can give me.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and consider answering",19May2019,1
313,"So basically I like a guy but am unable to have any conversations. Like my first reaction to his text is to throw my phone as run away to a new planet. But it's NOT because I don't want to talk. I want to talk so much but I'm afraid if I do, the conversation might end.


I was in a relationship and acquaintances for 7 years and it killed my self confidence a lot. The relationship ended three years ago and I'm slowly gaining my confidence back. I was so blind that, I didn't even believe I looked pretty or beautiful, even when everyone told me and it didn't come from my ex. Everytime I asked to be acknowledged, he said I was overthinking, but when my overthinking turned out to be right, I was making mountain out of molehills. It was three years ago. I'm getting out of depression and getting my friends back and socializing and getting my work back.

I have met this man who is kind, caring, funny, and simply amazing. Not that he doesn't have flaws but they seem insignificant to me. 

But due to my past I find it difficult to maintain conversation thinking I'm not enough and maybe I should be in a certain way for him to like me and not leave me. 


It's scary, I don't know how to ask questions cuz I'm too afraid he won't want to answer. 

But it's not true, that I know. He stops whatever he's doing to talk to me. And encourages me to love myself. Which is why I like him.


But I find it hard to communicate. He doesn't know the full details of my past but the extent he knows he just told me "" there's nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about'' That I did what I thought was right at that time. 


But it still freaks me out that I can't even talk to a person who I like so much. 

I don't have any problem talking to my friends and even to him when we were distant friends. Now we talk everyday almost.

Plus it doesn't help that when I took the courage to talk to him, he said he was never in any relationship because he prioritises his career first. Another reason I like him, but it scares me even more to approach him and tell him how I feel. Although telling him is not a priority but me developing the courage to love myself is.


So I don't tell him much, just text him or send Memes. And he too reciprocates by randomly telling me stuff about him and sends me memes everyday. 

Tldr; I'm 25 F and he is 25M.

314,"So I took a couple home tests and they both came up positive. This job is a huge opportunity for me. I haven't smoked in about two and a half weeks and my interview is Monday.

They absolutely will not take anyone that tests positive for any substance.

315,"I am 27 years old and I decided that I will finally finish my m.a studies which I should have finished in 2017 and even that was prolonged due to my mental health. I am now 3 exams and thesis short of finishing and I will also start working due to the fact and I need now to pay around 1200 euro to finish my degree.

2 exams I have are fairly easy and I am not worried too much about them, mostly because I learn quickly and I am fairly intelligent person, if anything I am a bit embarrassed to contact professors due to the fact that I was very engaged student (I published scientific articles as a student) and then I suddenly just disappeared.

Exam I am worried about is German, because I forget a lot since lectures and I doubt I could learn it fast enough so that I could pass exam in September or at least try to get another term. It is generally desirable that I finish till March, because I have had scholarship which I would have to return if I won't finish till March.

So, I wonder if anyone was in similar situation what kind of approaches did you took that you really finished and started working.

316,"Not gonna try to post a big long story or anything but basically am depressed and have a hard time finding reasons to live. I do all the right things; I exercise, I eat right, take my medication, go to counseling, therapist, I have a great job, 1 year away from a bachelor's in computer science. But my brain just doesnt work. I got out of a 7 year relationship about 3 months ago but probably have had depression for the last year or so, it just got so bad that I felt bad for the tole it was taking on her and she felt bad cause she couldn't help so we just split up.

Anyway, I understand that a lot of people have it a lot worse than me and I don't really have any right to complain but I just can't fix my brain. I cant get it right. I feel like I've tried everything and the only thing I can think of to do is get a completely new environment.

317,"Okay so I’m gonna try to shorten it all out because I’d make a novel about my situation if I didn’t 

My dad is continuously getting my family in worse debt (maxed credit cards, almost a 10,000 loan, overdraft) and it’s getting to the point where internet and cable may start getting shut off. My family only has one car so I can’t get a job  and i live 1 hour from town so no one can pick me up and take me to a job. 


My mom and dad have been fight my whole life (19 years) and it’s not ending any time soon. It’s to the point that they may get a divorce. I’m not staying with my dad because how he is with finances( and he said he didn’t want me here because I use him for money), and my mom will go live with a friend most likely  and so that leaves me with one choice. 

My brother, he lives in an apartment with a roommate. If I went with him I’d get a free ride to my job a guaranteed job I could take classes for my ged etc it seems like the best option but here’s the where the dilemma comes in he does drugs (pot) he’s done cocaine and I’m pretty sure his friends do all the time. I’m so worried that if I move in the police will come do a bust and I’ll be arrested for possession of drugs  ruining any chances for a nice future  and going to jail. I don’t know what to do if I stay I won’t get a job and couldn’t take classes  or do anything but if I go I have a risk of ruining my life. 

I have no other relatives so that’s out of the question.  And no friends that live close enough for me to get there with out a plane. I really want to follow through with my brother it’s just kinda scary I’m really lost and I don’t know what to do. My friends say I should do it because I plan on paying of college via military so I’d only be there  temporarily.

Hello  on phone sorry for formatting.

So I recently applied for two wonderful jobs. I accepted the first offer thinking i wasn't going to get the better of the two. A week and half later after accepting the first, and going through the physical/background investigation. The job I preferred with slightly better pay and pension offers me employment.

I asked the 2nd job to give me to Monday to consider. The problem is I feel bad and since I'm so far along in the process with the first offer estimated start date in two weeks. While the 2nd better offer is 4-5 months out with a start date.

Would it be in bad taste to start this new job and leave for the other job, or just stay and decline the 2nd offer.
I'm extremely grateful for both offers just have a inner argument with my self and would like outside advice.

This Monday I met a guy we liked each other and on Tuesday he confessed that he was interested. We started talking but right away there were problems because he has much more experience than me having already been in two very long relationships while for me he would have been the first boy.

I insisted on starting to hang out, but already the same evening there was the first fight because I realized that he was much more emotionally invested than me, I asked him to close and when he understood the reason he was extremely angry. Being inexperienced, I thought it was my fault and asked him to forgive me. The next day I was sick and came to my house to support me he asked me to do things but I didn't feel ready and I told him that his behavior of the previous day had hurt me knowing that it was my fault. He got angry and I pleaded with him again to stay because I didn't want to be blamed for ruining the relationship again. He stayed to sleep with me and the next day we had a fight again because he commented on my parents. We went out and because I didn't feel so good I was extremely hurt and we went back to my house the same evening we had a fight again because he had made some embarrassing jokes and I was embarrassed, but it's not over yet and he's Once I forgave him because we still had to know at this point yesterday he came back to his house and I had to go back home for the weekend. He wrote to me saying that I missed him and I replied that we would see each other tomorrow, believing we could reassure him. He gave me a bitch and blocked me. At this point she was no longer willing to forgive him and when she unlocked me by rewriting me to love me and wanting to be with me I told her no more times to keep on writing to me interspersed with ""give me another chance, I love you"" a ""you are a bitch and wicked ""it ended with him telling me not to speak ill of him at university and that if I did I would suffer the consequences.

321,"I've been feeling really down about my future and I feel like every single decision I've made has been a mistake. So, first of all I'm a 23 year old college computer science student and I've recently transferred to a state school to finish out my degree. Over the pass week I feel like I've maybe made a mistake transferring to this school. It's a some what small school and there aren't a lot of tech internships or tech jobs in general. I don't know why but I feel very grim on possibly finding a job as a software engineer without having internships. The passed four years has it's ups and downs. During 2017, a very popular game came out and I tried to pursue that as career while going to school at the same time. I didn't have a job in this time period. I took easy CS, Calc, and  GenED classes during this time. I actually managed to get very competitive, but I didn't see a future for that game just based on the viewership and audience retention. That dream basically ended last January. I regret trying to have a career as an 'esports player' I feel like I could've used that time a lot wisely such as learning new skills that will help my CS degree. I did learn a lot about human interaction in general and being a teammate and leader. I guess right now I'm just very pessimistic about the future(finding a job). I'm scared that I'm not gonna find a job with my degree. At this moment I don't even know where to start finding a job for my field. I've looked into a bunch of job sites and there isn't any entry level developer or IT jobs that I could apply for. I decided to get a Lynda subscription to possibly add to my skill set and learn.

Currently I don't have a job and I am studying on my own for a language exam that will allow me to take the University entrance exam. I live with my boyfriend who is a native and also attending University. We had a ldr and when I graduated high school I packed up and moved. We've been having problems ever since the beginning but we always seem to address them and move on but new or old problems just keep cropping back up. This past week I have been feeling great while studying because it feels like I'm making progress but when my boyfriend gets home and talks to me, fights with me over really stupid things, I get really sad, like I'd just rather him not talk to me at all. It's heartbreaking because this is the person I love and I know he loves me too. Sometimes I get so mad that I think ""this is it. It's over. I'm going to pack up and move back to America."" But I don't because I love him and all the crazy political things going on in America make me really uncomfortable, I really don't want to move back.

On my residency permit I can only work a certain number of hours and it isn't enough to afford food or rent, even with room mates from the research I've done, especially when getting an apartment is really difficult on its own because of super friendly tenant laws, landlords are really picky. Should I move back and save up enough money to be on my own? Do I stay in my current living situation and try to keep the relationship going and healthy? Do I move back and give up on my dream here entirely? If I do move back even just for the summer my boyfriend has already said we wold break up. I just need help deciding what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I (20F) was very close with my mum until I was about 15. She was incredibly overprotective of me, sheltered me too much.  She had diagnosed post-natal anxiety and depression and it manifested as this constant fear that I would be kidnapped. I remember as a kid if I played outside the sight of the house for more than 10 minutes she'd have a breakdown and think that I'd been abducted. Because I couldn't understand why, it just gave me this idea that I should be afraid of everyone and everything. 

For context, I live in the safest place imaginable. A small village, never heard of any crimes being committed here, everyone knows everyone. There's been numerous times where I've accidentally left the back door wide open when I've been home a lone a night. But I wasn't allowed to place out of sight of our house until I was 10. The first time I went out with my friends (we were a 5 minute walk away from the house) they had to walk me home after 10 minutes because I was convinced that this man I didn't recognize was going to kill me; in broad daylight, in the middle of a street with tonnes of houses. Even now, when I'm out walking my dog, I'm constantly looking behind me, flinch at every noise, thinking about escape routes. 

If I was afraid or anxious about doing something she'd never encourage me to be brave she would just say ""you don't have to do that"". So I ended up never taking part in school plays, sports days, violin exams. 

I'll be going to uni in a few months, so I'm hoping I'll naturally drift from her but currently I'm finding life really hard. I always feel the need for her attention, even though I don't like her, I really *really* don't like her as a person. If she wasn't my mother I would despise her.

The problem with her is that she has no emotional sensitivity whatsoever, if she's in a bad mood she'll take it out on me full force. Say if I'm trying to make a conversation with her she'll say ""can you shut up for a minute, your voice is getting on my nerves"". Or she'll call me loud and annoying, and every time it really hurts me. I don't want to sound pathetic but I have cripplingly low self esteem and I care about what she thinks too much. 

I don't understand why she uses those insults because I've always been ""the quiet friend"" or the person who only speaks when they have something to say. In school that's all the teachers would say at parent's evening ""she's very quiet""

But then she'll be so lovely, just ridiculously kind and protective that I'll forget how nasty she can be. There is no middle ground, it's either she's being evil or the nicest person ever. 

She makes no effort to control her anger, when she'd get mad at my sister and I as kids, she wouldn't talk to us about why she was mad. It would be a full on rage/screaming fit and her eyes would go crazy and she'd hit us with a wooden spoon. A few times as a kid she tipped a bucket of water on me whilst I was in my bed, and she would drag me down the stairs by my hair. I can never remember what would make her mad, because she'd never explain anything, she would just rage.

 She hasn't hit me since I was a kid, now she just insults me and honestly I'd rather if she hit me. 

She works away from home as a nanny, she comes home on average 5 days out of a month. Now that she's out of the house so much, I've realised that I only ever cry when she's home. She's the only person who can make me cry. 

When she comes home she'll say something that'll make me cry 2-3 times a day. I've had a problem with self-harm since I was 11, and once when she was away from home for 5 weeks, I realised that I never once had the urge to cut myself. She can be so spiteful that the only way to distract myself from how sad I am is to cause intense physical pain. 

It's weird because since I was 15, I've been depressed and I cried everyday, because everyday she was home. That didn't stop until I was 19 when she got this job away and I suddenly began to realise that I was going weeks without crying. 

One time we had a massive argument in the car and I told her this, she had noticed my self-harm scars for the first time when I was 17, despite having had them since I was 11 and they were on my arm. She got really upset when she saw them, I never told her why I did it because at the time I never made the connection between my sadness and her. She would go on about how sad it was that I had them *all the time*. It was embarrassing, she'd sometimes just randomly grab my arm at the dinner table and look at them.

So when we had this argument, she was being so awful that I just wanted to hurt her and I said  ""every scar I have on my body is because of you"" and she just said ""yeah I'm a really terrible mother, aren't I?"" sarcastically and she'll say ""do you want me to move out?"" sarcastically. Basically, in her eyes she can do no wrong at all, instead of thinking about changing her ways she'll just make out that I'm being absurd and suggest absurd solutions. 

Really, all I want from her is for her to say sorry, that's all I want. For her to say she's sorry and that she won't insult me anymore. I don't want anything else from her. But she'll never do it, because she's never wrong. 

My dad for example, he works night shifts so he's tired and grumpy a lot. And he takes it out on me, but nowhere near as bad as my mum, not even close. But he will ALWAYS apologize. 

But for some reason, I need to talk to her, I need to sit with her when she's home even though every time she makes me cry I tell myself ""don't talk to her anymore"" over and over and over. I write it on my hands, I record myself saying it. But I always think it'll be different, I think she'll be nice this time. Every time she comes home, just her presence puts me into a depressive episode, I can't function when she's home. 

She used to love me so much, yeah she'd get angry with me but because I was a cute kid she'd spend most of her time fussing over me. Now that I'm not a cute kid she doesn't care.

In fact another thing about her is that she's always been upset about me growing up, a few times when I was about 8-10 years old I would cry myself to sleep at night because my mum would tell me how much she missed me when I was 0-5 and how I'm not her little girl anymore. I remember my pillow being soaked in tears because I was thinking about how upset I was making my mum by growing up. 

I want to not care about her anymore, I don't want to crave her attention anymore. I can't stand it.",19May2019,0

Hi! So I can’t stop trying to figure this out. So I had a boyfriend, and we were together for almost 3 whole years. We obviously became intimate overtime but only when we first had intercourse, three weeks later he broke up with me, and said he only wants to have sex pretty much. It’s obviously using me, I realise that, but I don’t understand why after 3 years. 3 years of loving eachother and everything, and I know he did not use me for that long just to have sex because we genuinely loved each other so I just don’t understand why only 3 weeks later after losing his virginity he decides that sex is all he wants.",19May2019,1

Things picked up with a new relationship, recreational drugs and just being away for some time. With better hobbies and interests, eg. yoga and reading, thought it was all over. But being back home again and dealing with a now strained Long-distance relationship, my coping mechanisms are straying back off the healthy range. 
I find a fight incredibly difficult but At the same time just being back to where I was 2 years ago scares me so much. How can I come to terms with a negative environment and increasing alienation?  I’ve tried exercising, distracting myself with books and movies, praying, meditating, new hobbies such as cooking, socialising, but at the end of the day I still feel like just a black mass.

She didn't know how to respond whenever he made those remarks.

I tried to convince her to quit this job but she has told me that she doesn't want to leave because it is easy money and he said anything to her this week. I respect her wishes and I do not want to force her to quit, so I am planning to join the tutoring center to work with her and look out for her.

341," 

It's in the weekends I realise how truly lonely I am. I've always been like this. I was never able to make true friends throughout highschool. I've always had acquaintances and very few people to go to parties with, but deep down I know they are not true friends. It feels like shit honestly. I can never call someone on the spot and tell a crazy story or ask them to hang out or have them over at my house. It feels like nobody cares nowadays... I don't know. I am shocked when I see groups of people on the street and I wonder how? What am I doing wrong? My social skills are crap, but not to the point where I can't hold a conversation. I've been rejected a lot in the past and this probably made me reject people nowadays... I don't know, I have such mixed feelings about this. Going to a 9 to 5 is the only thing saving me from falling into depression.

I work as a real estate market researcher and I am also a full time student, but it seems everywhere I go I can't create relationships with people. Yes we chat, but nothing ever builds into a friendship, neither at work or at college... I'm pretty bad when it comes to women as well. I haven't had a relationship since August when I broke up with my ex for the simple fact that I got bored of her. Yes, I get bored of people and things really quickly and I tend to abandon them.

I see myself as a very okay person and I can't understand why I am not surrounded by people. I do not think I'm giving off a bad vibe and I am certainly not hideous. I do not understand life... at all. It seems to be that everyone else is so different and I am the only weirdo who's always alone and doesn't have good friends. I go to a lot of parties, almost every weekend and I chat with the few people I know there, but I never end up talking to strangers and making connections....

WTF is wrong with me? Like... I do not understand. Why am I so careless? Sometimes I end up overthinking about why am I so lonely and sometimes I don't give a shit about people and want to be alone because I think most people are extremely stupid... If anyone can relate please let me know what you're feeling.

I've never been to a psychologist, would that help in any way?",19May2019,2

Up until that point, I thought she just wasn’t interested in me romantically which is why I broke up with her.

To make things even more complicated, his mom was and still is dating my father and have been for somewhere around 10 years. So, although we’ve had ups and downs in both our romantic and platonic relationship, at the end of the day, I almost consider him family. He is good friends with my older brother and has my younger siblings over to visit regularly. 

Although I always consider him a friend, we’ve kind of been on the outs since late last year. I don’t even really remember why or if anything happened, but we haven’t really talked since I got into my current relationship. 

My dad called me last night and told me his brother had killed him self. I was never close with his brother, and to be honest, I never really liked him because of all the stress he put on his family, but it’s no secret that he had a lot of problems, so I have always tried to empathize with him for that. 

My heart is broken for my ex and his mother and the rest of the family his brother left behind. I’ve cried thinking of the hell they’re currently experiencing. I can’t believe it’s real and he’s gone. I’ve watched for years as his mother has tried to save him, and I can’t even begin to imagine what’s going through her head right now. 

Although, I’m not as close with my ex or his mother as I was in my teen years (grown up, moved on and out), I still want to be there for them, even if it’s in a small way, but I don’t really know how to go about it.

He tells me where he is going, makes plans when we will see each other etc. I dont know what to say anymore i know i sound desperate like i wanna know does he have feelings for me, and maybe i do wanna know.

Every time someone upsets us, it probably took 10 seconds, so why do we throw away the other 86,390 seconds worrying about it or being upset.

373,"Hey reddit. So obviously, details are necessary :

I work at a dog care facility / kennel. I put in a hell of a lot of hours, tax takes around 17.5% I think, and I end up with a few hundred dollars each paycheck. So far, anyway.

A few days before my 20th birthday, March 14th, my stepfather and I got into a bit of a spat. He asked me an offensive and invasive question that I'd already begrudgingly answered the hear before, and he prefaced it saying ""You're not going to like this"". I didn't insult him or anything, I just said ""I'm not gonna take that question"".

After that, he flipped out, screaming about how I never take responsibility for anything, I have no empathy for anyone, etc. He kept telling me to leave, because he was having a breakdown. I told him I wasn't going to leave, just for us to calm down. I didn't raise my voice at any point, never called him names or anything.

He threatened to call the police on me. I did not bother fighting him on it, which he afterward claimed was me saying ""So call the police"", despite me never saying anything along those lines. He stormed upstairs and actually did it. My mother didn't step in, just texted me informing me that he was doing it.

I walked upstairs and got my shoes on, they told him he had to legally evict me in order to get rid of me. He flipped out, went on about how I ""had him by the balls"", how I'd spend my birthday in jail and ""that will be your present"".

He demanded I leave $65 cash on the counter the following morning as a tithe for my mobile data and Wi-Fi. Obviously with the situation as it was, I didn't, and before he cut me off I started a mobile plan of my own.

Over the course of the next two or three days, he just kept harassing me over it all. Telling me my pregnant mother was getting stressed about our conflict, and if she had another miscarriage, it would be completely my fault.

I reached out to everyone I knew, but I didn't have anywhere I could stay. So, being backed into a corner, I had to accept certain terms that my stepfather put in front of me.

I pay $500 a month, my own mobile bill, my own food, and I do their dishes, vacuum their house, take full care of their dogs, take out their garbage, get their mail, etc.

I've also been paying my mother $100 a month for my car, as she gave me a loan to purchase it to begin with. So $600 a month total goes to them, which is nigh my whole paycheck. I end up with maybe a couple hundred left to just feed myself, and to save up to pay them their tithe next month.

The whole reason we moved to this state, at least according to my stepfather at the time, was because it would give me an opportunity to create a life of my own. (It was because he got a promotion on the other side of the country, but still.)

And now he's preventing me from ever being able to do that. Claiming it's a reasonable rent for our huge house that I was forced into and had no say in choosing.

I've considered living out of my car until I can save up enough to make something work, but I worry. All my belongings would remain in their house, and I don't know how much I can trust either of them after all this. Not to mention the obvious stress that goes with all that.

I don't know what to do. I'm honestly looking for advice.

Please don't remind me of his legal right to do all this or anything, I'm aware that he owns the house and thus he can boot me out, etc.

I just want to hear any ideas.

Thank you so much for your time.",19May2019,0
375,"On the month of December in 2018, I confessed to a girl and waited for her reply for weeks. In the end she told me that she liked me too, but we cannot be an ""official"" couple yet because she had this promise to her parents that she cannot have a boyfriend until after college, also due to the fact that she does not want our communication and connection to be severed if our parents found out of our relationship. But we got around this by secretly being an ""Unofficial couple"" or in other terms ""MU"" or ""Mutual Understanding"" (I don't know if you guys know this term, but basically both of us know what we like each other and being an ""Official"" couple is on hold) 

&amp;#x200B;

But as time goes by we talked a lot, mostly her teasing me for being cute, hot or on how sweet I am to her, but usually because of my ""kinks"" (Yes we came across that kind of conversation), we even got the the point where we went out to watch a movie together with the alibi that we have a few ""friends"" coming with us. But recently, everything seemed to die down. (Well that's what I at least think.) Our conversations became lesser than what it usually was, but I think this was due to the fact that she interrupts our conversation so that she could do something for a while. I usually wait for the time to turn 11pm or 11:30pm so that I could say ""Goodnight""  to her and a short message saying ""Good luck"" with what she was doing. But recently I started to feel that I think she is not interested in me anymore, due to the reason that she doesn't reply much to me or see my messages through an online messaging application. I know that there are multiple possibilities why this is happening such as here internet connection is not good, or that she is focusing on studying or drawing, she could be playing a game on her device (But if this was the case she would have seen my message). I know that I am probably overthinking this issue. But my emotions took over saying that I am probably not important for her, I am probably not worth her time or perhaps she became annoyed with me and my goodnight messages (Even though I asked her if it annoys her, she just said that it is sweet and she is looking forward to it especially in college due to the fact that we will be attending different colleges and because of the expected sleepless nights for homework and projects).

377,"So i have this friend (whom i also got a crush on but that is besides the point) and we hang out a lot since we have this activity in common and we always talk and have a ton of inside jokes he keeps on refrencing, he always looks at me when he tells a joke to the group to see if i am laughing, he remembers details abt me i told him etc..

Recently we also talked via messenger outside of this activity which i was really excited about bc i want to be somebody who matters in his life (i have given up on the idea of dating him since he is taken currently). He also continued the convo with introducing new topics etc. so that i wasnt the annoying one. Then once he didnt answer me for a couple of hours and i was ok with that bc ppl just get busy. However i saw a post about something that he was worried was not gonna happen soon enough for him and it did so i send that to him bc i was happy it all turned out so well... thats when he ghosted me but at the same time he kept answering in a group that we are both in so thats just kind of... a dick move if you ask me...

In addition i saw that a comptetition we ware going to apply to as a team was closing its registration so i texted him abt that and he didnt even look at the message.

I am very confused as to why he did that i didnt do anything to offend him or similar.. it is true that he is often very akward and even rude (without realising it) through text but still does any of you have a clue as to why he is acting like that?
Also how should i act towards him now when we see eachother should i ignore this and continue being friends with him or should i confront him (risking an akward time with this activity we have where i literally cannot avoide him) or what?

I am sorry this is so omnious but the details arent really that important. I also realise that people in this group have bigger issues than this however this is really bothering me for a while and i would appreciate any advice possible😊",19May2019,1
378,"I’ve only known her for a couple months, but she is somebody I’d consider a friend. She doesn’t seem to have a sense of personal boundaries, which didn’t bother me at first, but now it’s just uncomfortable to be around her. Don’t get me wrong I think she’s a great a friend, it’s just every time I’m around her she’s invading my bubble like we’ve known each other for years.

And it’s just been getting worse? She’s a teachers assistant for my history class, and I have art with her right after. So on the way there she’s started linking arms with me. Which I guess is not to bad, but she’ll try to tickle me and she’ll rub my thighs like we’re an intimate couple and not new friends.  She’ll also just grab my hand and ruffle my hair for no reason.

It’s gotten to the point where I dread seeing her, just because I know she is going to invade my space. I don’t want to say anything because i know she’ll just be insulted, but I feel like if i don’t it’ll just get worse. 

Am I just overreacting? I don’t have very many friends, but none of them have acted like this before. I’m pretty sure she’s hitting on me, which wouldn’t be the first time one of my friends has by invading my space. Actually this has happened every time somebody has hit on me.

379,"I'm a 16 year old closeted guy who attends an all boys school. I have had a crush on an out gay guy in my year for a while now and I feel like i might have a chance with him. We have a good few mutual friends and have common interests in a few different stuff but the problem is that I barely see him in school as we're in none of the same classes and i'm pretty sure he think i'm straight af. 

A few months back i told my friend that i trusted at the time that i liked the guy and at my first disco asked him did he like me without me knowing. He said no and when i found out i was highly upset and embarassed as this guy i trusted would do something like that me. I started to panic incase people started to find out about the situation but it turns out that my crush was drunk that night and could barely remember what happened at it. A few months went by after that and my crush and i have started to speak a bit more and have become quite good friends/acquaintances. Every now and again i catch him staring at me and my awkward self just doesn't know what to do.

381,"Growing up, my dad was/is conservative to the bone. Him and my mom split up right after i was born but he still had visitation rights. If he wasnt passing out or watching baseball, he would get verbally and physically abusive sometimes, he would force kisses from me when i wasnt comfortable, he would smack my sisters asses while they walked by but not even to punish them. Just for the amusement. If i were holding his hand sometimes he'd squeeze them hard.. I'd beg him to stop and try to pull away but he'd just give me this evil look like i deserved it and would continue squeezing till I thought my hands were broken. I recently found out he started doing that because he found out I called my stepdad ""Dad"" as a joke one time when i was five. I think thats why he gave me that look like i was ungrateful.

 In 2005, Christmas eve, he decided to kidnap me and my siblings and keep us at our grandparents (his parents) trailer. Once my mom caught onto it, I'm pretty sure she instantly knew where to look for us because the next day she came to the trailer and knocked on the door. At the time I didnt know we were being kidnapped because he told my siblings they were keeping us longer than they were supposed too but he waited for me to go to the bathroom so i didn't get to know. So when she knocked on the trailer door I said ""I'll get it"" and right as i put my hand on the knob, my grandma yells ""dont open that door you retard"". But it was too late, my mom and stepdad barged in and started wrestling my dad. As thats happening my grandparents are still yelling at me about opening the door.. Me and my siblings didn't know what to do but crawl to the corner and cry in terror. 

  Eventually the cops were called by the neighbors but my mom didnt even get to take us home because i guess they didnt have proof on them that we were their children. My dad was actually able to go to court against my mom for some reason I dont understand. He didn't win tho. So he didnt see us for a couple years. I think till i was seven years old. So we'd go visit him like once a month and he cut back on getting physical but still had some slips. He never stopped being verbal tho. Once I got into my teen stage, my sister wemt to go live him because she had just gotten her first job and he convinced her that he would help her out financially. Instead he kept her paychecks and bought himself 3 flatscreens, 2 Xbox ones, a keyboard for his phone and left her the scraps of her checks. He ended up owing her over $3,000 which she never got back after she moved out. 

When I turned 14 I got into a fight at school so my dad called me and tried grilling me about but i snapped on him.  I told him how much he wasn't truly there for us, i thought he only owed my sister $400 so i told him that and he says ""i only owe her about $200, you don't know what you're talking about"". Then i asked her and she told me it was over $3,000. So me being an emotional teen, i told him to leave me alone. I guess i didnt actually expect him to but to this day he hasn't said a word to me. Going on almost 5 years now. He still kept in contact with all my other siblings except my youngest sister who was also done with his shit. My brother would tell me how our dad wants to talk to me but doesn't know how.

Now I'm almost 19 and i guess the problem im having with this is do I just message him and ask him why its gotten to this point? Or do i just keep waiting for him to grow the balls to talk to me? At this point i feel like he's given up the thought. I get that he was toxic and i probably shouldn't worry about him but there's this small part of me that wants to contact him. I want to tell him everything i feel towards him but i feel like I'd just freeze in the moment. After everything he put my family through, we all grew up with a lot of mental issues and i dont even understand everything going on in my head still. 

I'm just confused at this point about what to do about my dad and what's going on in my head. If you've read this far, thank you. I'm sorry this was so long i just felt i couldnt leave some stuff out.",19May2019,1

As you all might know, finals are here and I usually study a lot but I want to study even more for my final exams.

She asked me to help her with something, I helped her then went back to my room to finish my hw and she started yelling at me, insulting me and all of that. That really got me thinking and I noticed that it *bothers* her a lot when I study. When I tell her I have to prepare for finals she tells me ""fuck that, why can't you just relax"" and if I say no she accuses me of not wanting to spend time with her.

383,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a bit over a year, and normally he is very nice to me. He says he intends to marry me, he says he wants to be engaged in the fall. We are in our mid 20s. The problem is that when we go in public I feel that he tends to act not very proud of me.

I am wondering if I am crazy or what others would do in this situation.

What he does: so he will sit by me in public, talk to me, try to kiss me on the cheek however he does these things that I am finding it difficult to articulate why they bother me, Last night, he caught the garter at a wedding we attended the groom targeted him and he jumped away from it like it was a live snake and finally after a lot of coaxing picked it up. I didn’t appreciate that. It was like a ball-and-chain kind of scenario. 

Another time, about a week ago, I participated in an event where you can have someone in our field (of which i don’t have anyone in my life in the field we’re in other than me and him) important to you give you your award basically. When we got there I was like “oh you should have given it to me!” Knowing well and good it was too late and not even a real suggestion. Even in this hypothetical situation he rested up and was like “oh no no I am just your boyfriend” and was clearly uncomfortable. Other people had their significant others do it.

When we are socializing as a couple, even though I am not constantly around him by any means, he doesn’t say anything to me in group social situations nor does he introduce me and when it is me socializing with people he is familiar with they tend to not treat me like I am his significant other but more like a random.

He also tends to make bad jokes in these situations that I am going to be his “sugar mama” and he’ll be a stay at home dad etc. 

He says he says nice things about me behind my back and how much he loves me and wants to spend his life with me. I told him that I wouldn’t know that based on how he acts.

I don’t want him to cling to me in social situations just don’t act like I am a ball and chain.

He’s fine in private. Maybe I am being overly sensitive.

That is how I think it is with me but I haven't been in a relationship with anyone I just liked a boy for a long time and we would hangout and we were friends.

404,"Hello Reddit,

As the title says, I have been walking around with the feeling that I'm a pedophile. I'm ~18 years old and since some years I have always been attracted to younger girls. I think the age I'm attracted starts at about 12. I have always kind of had this. It doesn't mean that I'm not attracted to older women, but I just like seeing younger girls and frequently jack off to pictures of girls around 14/15/16. I know I am very wrong and I've never done anything beyond fantasizing, but sometimes I feel very disgusted about myself for this reason.

Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I've never really had any sexual intercourse with anyone, not even kissing or holding hands or something. I guess I'm a very socially awkward when it comes to girls but this is not a big thing overall (it used to be).

I wonder if anyone can relate to my feelings, or if someone might be able to make a good guess about their origin. I like the idea of having sex with younger girls, but on the other side I am very aware of the damage it would do to the girl so I don't think I could do it.",19May2019,1

407,"For starters, I’m 15. I know that almost every teenager probably says or at least thinks at some point that they’re “mature for their age” and it’s possible I’m falling into that same delusion but I don’t think so. 

I’m 15, I’ve had a girlfriend for 3 years whom I have been sexually active with (birth control and condoms, I’m not an idiot) I play 3 instruments, speak French and English, and have written over 30 piano pieces, some of which have anonymously (I’m kind of a wimp and I don’t like credit and attention) made their way into compositions for our school choir, plays, and band performances. I say this not to brag (this is a throwaway account anyways so) just to communicate the point I’m trying to make. Whether my multitalented-ness is a product of my maturity or if it is the cause, it’s extremely annoying to be, socially, academically, and generally, this mature at my age. 

At around 12 I got a girlfriend. I had had one or two before, but never anything serious. This girl was different though. Not only was our relationship serious in the sense that we would do actual relationship things like go on dates and spend time together outside of school, but it was also serious because we actually cared for one another. Over time this blossomed into a beautiful relationship that is now three years (and, just for the sake of bragging, many nights of fucking) strong. 

The problem is, she’s gotten involved in kind of a bad crowd. Started smoking weed and drinking. I’m not offended by drug use, in fact I’ve drank plenty myself, but every time I’ve used any type of substance it hasn’t defined my personality at all. In fact, most people think of me as kind of a straight edge goodie goodie guy. 
She’s not the same though. She’s entirely engulfed in this stoner, bad kid, rebel culture. Her entire person is defined by her adolescence to the point that my mom almost made me break up with her because she got suspended for using a dab pen in school. But, somehow she subverts all expectations of that persona and has a 4.0 and a part time job. Me and her are going sort of down different paths to the point that both of us are basically living double lives at the moment (we spend a loooooot of time together). Apart from this our relationship hasn’t changed very much, in fact I’ve grown to love and care for her more than ever.

I know that most people would probably just say  that her attitude and reputation has become a deal breaker, and that my staying with her and letting her decisions reflect on me is a very stupid idea (one a naive high school boy would make); but I greatly respect monogamy. I don’t want to just ditch her because she’s going down a different path, especially because I know it’s not a good one for her. And not to mention, I still love her. 

My maturity and no real motivation to be young and do dumb shit has become a curse in this relationship. I really honestly don’t know what to do.

I know the concept of “fixing” my girlfriend is pretty fucked both in its method of communication and it’s actual idea, but I don’t really know what else to do or how I’m supposed to do that. I refuse to leave her because I care for her so much and I doubt that she would just clean up her attitude because I told her to or think she should (especially because, how the fuck do you even do that). And I really need some advice.

409,"As the title says, I met a girl, and we hooked up. We'll call her G. Her boyfriend is aware this happened... mine is not. She wants to spend more time together, but I think she meant as friends, though i'm not positive. She was drunk when we hooked up and I got the impression that she frequently hooks up with people both with and without her boyfriend, because she picked me up from a bar and she mentioned having a threesome with her boyfriend and one of his male friends a week earlier. The problem is, I like her. A lot.   


Something about her is just so appealing to me. I find her so easy to talk to and we stayed up until 5 am the other night just talking cuddled up on her couch. She has a son and even though I hate children, I actually liked hearing her talk about him because she lit up so much. When she started talking about being self conscious about her stretch marks on her stomach all I wanted to do was make her feel like she's beautiful. There are a few things about me I usually don't tell anyone, especially a person i've just met, but I found that we have so much in common that I was able to tell her those things and I didn't feel judged at all.   


As I said, we are both in relationships with men. Her boyfriend is a fucking tool. She has a really nice, updated condo in a nice part of town and she pays all the rent. The boyfriend is an unemployed construction worker. He moved in with her within a week of them dating because he became homeless. They've only been together a month but he calls her his ""wife"" (she doesn't call him husband) and they tell each other they love each other. I've only met him once, but he's rude, obnoxious, and annoying. He actually asked me, a person he'd just met, to buy him $100 worth of blow and promised to give me his watch as collateral. I declined (I don't do drugs) and he got really, really snippy with me. He just strikes me as this typical unemployed loser with a drug problem and I feel like he'll do nothing but take her down with him. I feel like she can do so much better. He's aware that she and I hooked up because she told him, and when I met him I had to put my foot down when he started talking about the three of us hooking up. I do not find him remotely attractive and have absolutely no interest in any sexual contact with him. He got realllllly pissy about this too and insisted it wasn't ""fair"" that I would't sleep with him because ""he let G hook up with his friend and have a MMF threesome, so he should get to have a FFM threesome"". Which makes no fucking sense because I was not a part of the MMF threesome (obviously). I have absolutely no obligation to him to provide him with a FFM threesome, and I never, EVER will. As I said, I DO NOT find him attractive and I find his personality abhorrent.   


My boyfriend knows that G and I are friends, but he doesn't know we hooked up. He may have suspicions, as he knows that i'm bi, that I talk to girls on a few apps and that i've really been wanting to spend time with a woman lately because i've kind of been feeling like i'm denying that part of me while being in a long term relationship with a man. While my boyfriend would be open to a threesome with another woman, or even potentially us getting a girlfriend together, I don't believe that G would be open to either of those things without her boyfriends ""permission"" and I doubt he'd grant it. I'm not sure that's the situation i'd want anyway. I don't even know what I want. I just know I like G. My boyfriend and I have a good relationship for the most part. He's got some issues with anger that cause some tension, but he doesn't do drugs like Gs boyfriend and he's employed and responsible. I haven't told him about the hookup but I wouldn't lie if he asked. I do have a hard line that i'd never cross, which would be sleeping with another man. First of all, I have little to no interest in other men. I am only interested in women and my boyfriend. Second of all, he would never be ok with me sleeping with another man, but has mixed feelings about me sleeping with women (basically, he doesn't mind it, but he says the idea of me catching feelings is what makes him feel mixed. ugh. oops.)  


I feel terrible because I feel like i've betrayed my boyfriend, even though we've talked about me sleeping with women before and he's indicated he's cool with it as long as it's not an all the time thing (just every once in a while is fine, but he wouldn't want me running off to fuck girls every weekend) and as long as there are no feelings involved. He's also said he doesn't really need to know or know the details. This is the first and only hookup with a woman that i've had since we had that conversation, and I don't know if i'm obligated to tell him about it. If I do, I don't know if it's right to tell him about me having feelings for G. Since she has a boyfriend and (I think????) wants to continue spending time together but maybe as friends (honestly, i'm really not sure at all if that's what she wants, it's just the vibe I got).   


I don't know what to do. I am too afraid to ask G if she only wants to be friends now, because if she says yes, I don't think I could be around her. I could disguise my feelings by saying that i'm asking because I want to know if she wants to hook up again, not because I like her. My feelings for her would only continue to grow if I see her more. At the same time, I don't know if I want her out of my life. It has been years since I met a person that I connected with that much, who I could tell the things I told her, who make me feel safe and not judged. She's beautiful and I felt so happy and so myself being with her. But I think that continuing to see her if she turns out to only want to be friends and having to hide my feelings would be painful. On the other hand, if I ask her and then I tell her it's because I like her, I could end up losing her if that makes her uncomfortable. And also she has a fucking loser ass boyfriend that I guess she loves for some reason. I know the type of relationship they're in. I used to be in ones like it when I was a teenager. It's one that moves super fast (like them dating for only a month and yet living together already) and gets too intense too early, and then turns into a really bad cycle of unhealthy toxic shit. I can see it coming from a mile away. I don't want that for her whether she likes me back or not.

422,"So I'm Peruvian (M20) and I met this Moroccan girl (F21) online with the whole timezone difference and we have so many things in common and I fkn love and adore her. When I was a couple of weeks in of knowing her, she got jealous of my other best friend and said she wanted to be my bestie too so with that being said, I thought she didn't see me that way. 

The following week she asked me if I ever liked her or if I ever thought she would like me and I tried taking the easy way out and say no, that I was still trying to get over my ex but I meant to say the no to the her being interested in me part. She thought I didn't like her and she went on to date someone else wish was good because she was somewhat happy. She tells me there are times where he is a completely ass and doesn't treat her the way she wants to be treated and that pisses me off a lot. 

Last week, somehow she ended up telling me that it's a good thing that I never had feelings for her but she said it all sad and depressed and I told her that I had feelings from day one and it turns out she did as well. She says that she would have dated me earlier if she knew but she wasn't certain and thought I wasn't interested and tried to move on. Now, she says that she still wants to keep whatever feelings left she has with her bf and she if she could make things work out which is alright as long as she's happy even thought all on my mind is her. I told her, that I'll always be here waiting for her if something goes wrong between them. And that if things work out, I'll try to move on but will still be there as her bestie.

Right now, we are both technically besties who have crushes on each other and she's dating someone. I love and adore everything about her and she goes into detail about how she love and adores me with all the flaws I have (height being one of the main ones; I'm a shorty at 5'2) and she just drives me crazy (in a lovey dovey way). What I want to ask is: Is it alright what I did? That I even said that I had feeling for her? Do I have a chance in dating her (as in if her and her bf don't work out)? Is long distance gonna be a big problem? 

Btw: One thing is that her parents are Hella strict and she not suppose to use social media to begin with and she's been living alone for the last couple of months cuz of college but she's moving back home so she's going off the grid for a little until she either confronts her parents about that rule or until she gets and opportunity to message back.

428,"Hi
I would appreciate some advice on a situation I find myself in. I have a male friend who is showing a lot of resentment and anger towards me. 

I have a friend who has been a friend for over 15 years. We had a fwb situation when I was growing up until I met someone else and had my first serious long term relationship. Out early high school / college situation was just fun and I ended things respectfully because I realised I wasn’t growing. 

He wasn’t thrilled with me moving on and harboured a lot of resentment about that for many years. 

I went through a traumatic breakdown and breakup of said partner a 6 years ago which I’ve not been able to get over. 

6 years ago when this all happened he found out and was pushy and didn’t respect my boundaries. He once barged into a friends bedroom to see me when I was trying to avoid him. 

I stopped talking to him for many years after that and a year ago we started to connect and have a much healthier and mature friendship. 

He was a very different person and I grew to feel comfortable in his company as a completely platonic friend. 

However in the last 5 months I have begun to feel like there is some tension there and it has built ever since. 

He started to buy me gifts a lot, and when I would tell him not to give me gifts he continued to do so. On my birthday he spent a lot of money and I respectfully said i could not accept his gifts. He assured me there were not ulterior  motives or strings attached - he just likes giving people gifts. 

He has continued to buy me gifts and last weekend he dropped into my house to just randomly give me a book. When I answered the door I had just woken from a nap and was not in the mood to talk. He seemed rejected and was sulky. 

I have never been flirty or shown any suggestion of being interested in anything more than his friendship. 

Then yesterday he sent me a message saying that I should “pay him a visit” and that he had been crying because of some work stuff. 

I was kind of disgusted by his choice of words “pay him a visit” and when I said that he replied with “you didn’t even acknowledge that I said i was really upset”. He never used the words “really upset.”  

Today he messaged me that he would appreciate a visit and i messaged him about midday and said hello. I asked if he like to grab a coffee and he said he was working on stuff at home and he couldn’t go for coffee until he was finished. The tension was back again. 

I asked him when he would be finished and he said Later that night. He was clearly angry that I didn’t say I would go over to his house. 

I decided to call him and talk instead of texting. He said he thought that I could “buy some coffee” and come over so he could show me what he was working on. I really didn’t want to go over because he lives near my old home and it always triggers me and upsets me. 

When I told him that he said that he can’t understand how something that happened 6 years ago is “still affecting me so much” and was mean spirited when he said it. 

I started to cry because I’ve had a lot of ptsd and mental health issues related to that part of my life and he backed off. 

I decided to go over and show that I was making the effort. He was nice to me at first and then slowly the energy turned cold and he was pretty angry when he was talking to me.

I asked him about his rental situation and he said that “I should move in with you”. ( I live alone and have a spare room). He said that it would be “great” and continued to tell me reasons why it was a good idea. The pressure to say yes was put on me and he was listing all the things he dislikes about his current share house. 

The way he has spoken to me has become increasingly more and more resentful and mean. I feel cornered and like I’m a bad friend. 

He speaks to me with disdain and I don’t understand what I’ve done to end up feeling so low. 

I haven’t lead him on, I have been open about my struggles, I’ve kept clear boundaries and have thanked him for his friendship. 

He is so aggressive in his tone when he tells me something or I disagree with his opinion. 

My gut tells me that he has lost patience with me and can’t accept that I haven’t moved on from my past. He is frustrated that I am not interested in even though he says he has accepted its not going to Happen. 

What am I not seeing here? Am I the bad person? Please I need some advice.",19May2019,1
429,"I'm a 25/f and with my 27/m boyfriend. He is actually my ex from 6 years ago, and we had a nasty break up but he had been trying for the last several years to get back into my life, and we've been back together for the last 5 months. We love each other.

I am 10 weeks pregnant. I found out early, at 5 weeks, and he was very much in favor of me keeping the child. The only reason it was in question is because it happened so quickly (failed birth control), and we aren't financially ready -- we aren't completely broke, but we've both moved back home and were working on saving. I'm a bartender finishing my prerequisites for nursing school and he's a personal trainer. 

So I went with it, and accepted that I'm going to keep the child and make it work. I'm very pro-choice, and while I would never WANT to have an abortion, I as much don't want to bring a child into the world if I don't know 100% that I could be a good mother. With him wanting to be a father and him being a good person, and me being who I am, I was confident that we could make it work even financially, etc. and just through anything.

But we have been fighting so much since we found out I was pregnant, and our relationship has gotten frankly unhealthy. Because we fight so much! We still live apart and have plans to move in together, but it's been hard for me being separated from him (I have been battling anxiety and PTSD my entire life), especially when I'm feeling vulnerable in my first pregnancy. I have been taking a lot of my stress and anxiety and fear out on him. When I was 8 weeks, abortion was back on the table because I was so scared, just thinking about all the factors and the negatives, and he agreed that it might be the best decision. I was crushed, because I think in that moment I wanted him to be strong for me and to hear that same determination he had in the beginning.

At this point, his stance is that he will support me in whatever I decide, and that he wants to stay together but can see why abortion is maybe a good idea considering our relationship dynamic and all the initial concerns about finances, and would support me. And he would support me if I kept the child, but for the sake of supporting the child. I am grateful for that, but it just doesn't feel in my gut that he's 100% about doing this with me and has accepted that if the relationship keeps going south, we may end up coparenting separately. 

I do not think I can do this alone or that I would be able to single-parent. And I come from a broken home; it feels wrong to subject my child to the same thing. Should I have this baby if not being together is a possibility?

I'm so connected to this child and want to keep it, I've already accepted that I'm going to be a mother and won't be living just for myself anymore. Am I being selfish?",19May2019,1

Most of these events take place from last year this year I’m in an alternative education school .

I am a 16-year-old girl and I feel really stupid about being in special education.  I have an IEP also known as an individualized education plan from New York State. And what that does is I got to go to a place called resource room also I get breaks on tests due to anxiety. 

My classification is for emotional disturbance. 

Here are a few quotes from the packet under  social development 

 “Ember struggles with making friends in developing positive relationships at school she does have the desire to make friends and will bring treats to her classmates unfortunately her desire to make friends overwhelms her at times and she will become obsessed with an individual occasionally makes inappropriate comments were inappropriate actions when given a self assessment test Ember knows that she does not have a lot of friends and she has low self-esteem Ember participates in class discussions specially in social studies and she has a vast knowledge of in historical material”

I just never felt really that smart my mom would normally tell me stuff like this is for retards you shouldn’t be in special ed she would never be mean to me about it but should always be mean like in general about it and maybe it’s just her kind of like telling me all this and being so rude about it sometimes and she knows that I’m a smart girl and stuff but I don’t feel like that I feel stupidIn reading through that you guys can tell that I had really bad trouble making friends that was not written by me that was written by my school counselor. 

Honestly I’ve just given up on the whole school system I mean school was never really right for me anyways I just always been wanting to be something more with fame into it like a model or something that has to do with nothing school could get you to maybe a doctor but probably not enough so I don’t want to be a counselor last year but I decided not to be a counselor for certain issues and I am doing this text to speech I don’t need text to speech or anything. 
This whole alternative Ed thing makes me feel kind of dumb because I was placed with kids who didn’t know how to spell most words and stuff like that and I know how to spell I know how to do all of that the only thing I’m struggling with his math and it’s because something was wrong with my stupid brain.

When I was about probably about 4/5 I developed sensory processing disorder and that was all hell on earth I mean it was it was a nightmare for me and my mom it was a nightmare for my grandma and I think my dad  gave me The sensory issues because of how much lice treatment my hair when I have lice end it might’ve messed my way up with my brain I don’t know that’s what my mom thinks but sensory processing disorder is where the senses in your brain don’t calculate correctly like to go up and then something will happen with the senses end will communicate wrong so for example for me it’s different for all kids for me it was closing clothing but it was like clothes were very uncomfortable and I just would have meltdowns and stuff like that. 

Anyways I think I’ve typed up enough Mom talked enough because I’m using voice to speech or speech to voice whatever you call it and yeah I just don’t feel smart",19May2019,1
433,"My neighbor doesn’t work so he’s home every day and keeps odd hours. I have no idea what he does up there but it’s just so freaking loud. Sometimes it sounds like he’s rearranging his furniture, but it happens every day. All throughout the day (from as early as 5 am to as late as midnight) he’ll drop something metallic and heavy so the sound reverberates throughout our apartment. We actually lived on another floor in this same building for two years, and we never heard a peep from our old upstairs neighbors so I know the noise isn’t due to the integrity of the building itself. 

Anyway, I’m on mat leave with a newborn so we’re home pretty much every day. It’s hard enough to get her to fall asleep without the random clangs and bangs coming from upstairs. I can be pretty confrontational, so I understand my husband’s worry that I’ll say something too aggressive and make the guy retaliate, which is why I’m here asking for advice.

435,"Hello!

So as the title states, my parents think that I am much more innocent than I actually am. A big reason for this is because I was a late bloomer in terms of dating. I didn’t date in high school and most of college. I didn’t have my first kiss until I was 21.

My senior year of college is when I had an exploratory phase. During my last semester I participated in hookup culture and ended up having sex with 5 guys during that time. In total I’ve had sex with 6 people. 

My parents and my siblings think that I’m a virgin with no experience with any of this stuff. I really don’t mean to deceive them but I do still give off a naturally naive/innocent vibe. 

I went to college out of state so I only saw my family during holidays for those 4 years that I attended school. I feel like because of this, I changed so much during this time in many ways and they still see me as the 18 year old girl I once was.

Is it normal to have a part of your life that your parents don’t know anything about? Part of me wants to tell them that I’m not so innocent but it would really change our relationship and how they see me. How can I stop feeling like a fraud when I’m with them?",19May2019,1
436,"I (18f) work as a lifeguard and swim instructor at a fitness center. My work uniform consists of just a swimsuit and shorts, because more clothes means more drag if I have to make a rescue. It’s a lot less clothes than I’d usually wear, but for the most part I’ve gotten used to it. 

There’s this one man who appears to be in his 50’s who frequently comes in to use the hot tub. He’s there almost every time I work there. He’s very friendly, always wanting to chat with me whenever I have a spare moment. And he always tells me to smile if I don’t look happy, which is annoying but whatever. At first I thought he was just being nice, but then I realized he’s not nearly as talkative with the rest of the staff. This made me a little bit uncomfortable, but I didn’t say anything because technically he’s not doing anything wrong. 

Then, today, I was teaching a lesson in the main pool while he was hanging out in the hot tub. As he was leaving, he walked past the main pool and said directly at me, “bye, sweetie”. 

I froze up. The friendliness from before wasn’t so bad, but I definitely have a problem with being called “sweetie” by a strange man three times my age. 

I don’t want to tell him to stop, because I don’t want to increase the awkwardness of any shifts I’m on when he’s there. At the same time, I’m really not okay with wearing my revealing work uniform in the presence of this man. 

What should I do?",19May2019,484
438,"I've been wanting to get a tattoo on the side of my hip for years and now that I have saved up enough money to spare it's becoming more and more of a fixed plan.

Thing is that I'm not at all comfortable with being naked of any extent. Huge factor as well is that I struggled in my teenage years and have a few scars on my legs + never worn a bikini or even just showed my legs since then. I'm also not a very social person despite trying my best to improve there.

I very much realise that the problem is with me and that I need to improve on various things there + that the tattooist doesn't even care the slightest bit about stuff like that as it's obviously necessary - and that I need to show my hip for that!

But how do I go about this? And another important question for me is, what would someone wear for that? Thought about posting in r/tooafraidtoask about that one but I think it's more suited on here due to the other questions.

How do I get over this and stop continuing to push this off for any longer? It's just this that's holding me back from getting the tattoo. Otherwise I'm very content with my choice. I've been wanting this since I was very young and haven't changed my mind in any way regarding the choice since then. Not getting it isn't an option I'd like - just have been putting it off for a long time.
Thinking of visiting a store next week and discussing the motive/planning the appointments personally. I'm bad with telephone calls but I think I'd be able to do it once I'm there and can't just hang up and disappear. 

Some more info: I don't have friends that could help on this case/accompany me. My family has been against me getting a tattoo but accepts my choices due to me being legally an adult. No help from them either.

I'd very much appreciate any advice on what to do and apologise for my bad English, it's not my mother tongue. Took me a bit of courage to post this.",19May2019,2

I feel like whatever I do isn't good enough for my dad and stepmom. Even though I do all that stuff they say I half ass everything, I don't care about my family, and they constantly propose the idea is have a mental, social handicap or a learning disability. 

It's gotten worse over the past 5 months. My dad had a heart attack and left me to take care of the entire house while in school and working. I missed several small details among the sea of tasks I had to accomplish. We're in the process of moving (while I attempt to move out) and this is causing more stress.

As if I'm not allowed to express my emotions. 

Now typically, I'm very cheery, smiley, yet somewhat demure and accommodating.

458,"This is about my parents and their relationship with each other according to our circumstances and financial issues as well as the mental health of my siblings. I'm not expecting an answer about who is right or wrong. I'm trying to find advice on what I should try to do or what my steps should be in order to help this anyway I can. It's extremely depressing to feel like you're in a complicated situation and have no idea what to do so I'm asking for advice from you guys.

Currently, I (M) (19) am currently living with my brother (12) and sister (10) under my mother's care in Egypt. We are living in an apartment owned by my mother's sister as this appartment is considered her office but we pay the bills for it since we live here for now. My father is in Dubai and he is the one who is making most of the money and in charge of keeping us afloat. Works on the business side. My mom is a makeup artist but also a housewife to the kids so she is only barely making enough for the bills. Kids are in school. Plan is to essentially start over in Egypt by getting a new apartment, furnishing it, and keeping the kids in school the whole rest of the their years while I am to wait till my dad comes here (it's his job to come every month for a week) and then take me with him to dubai where I can do an exam and apply abroad for college. 

For background, we have been living in Dubai for the past 15 years. It was our home until last year when we moved to Egypt because we couldn't handle the new prices of living there. School was the big play factor here so we moved to Egypt to make it easier for my dad. We have been living here for the past half year and nothing has changed.

Now the gist of it: my parents were married for 23+ years and still are, at least legally. The issue is that my father is trying to make money to send to us but my mom feels it's never enough and that he is hiding some for himself. She has supported him for most of his life but because he has not made any significant changes and instead has made us all go downhill from where we stood financially. She doesn't trust him anymore and says that he is not sending money because he only cares for himself and using facts to help her argument like how he is always going out to a cafe, a restaurant, etc.. While we are at home staying alive off of my mom's cooking and her work. I know this is true because his reasoning is that he doesn't cook so he always goes out to eat. He is not eating in expensive restaurants unless he has a meeting there but otherwise he is always eating outside and my mom thinks it's still unacceptable because she is at home and all her sacrifices over the years are being put in vain. His defence is that he is trying his best to work his ass off and trying to manage the bigger projects like the new apartment. He is asking for support, from my mom especially but she doesn't believe his case so she doesn't accept it. That's the dynamic.

My dynamic is that my mom is trying to make me understand how awful my way of living is in the sense that I deserve much better than what we got. She wants me to fight because she wants him to feel ashamed of how we're living so he can do better. Feels he is relaxed so she wants make him understand he shouldn't be. I can't blame her and when I do try confront and get answers, he tells me what he is trying to do and trying his best so I have no choice but to believe him. And it becomes a circle of repetition.

I'm asking for advice now because they are crying. My mom has constant mental breakdowns and my dad just wants her support but she won't give him. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't know who's side is on or what even my first steps should be to figuring out how to help this. I'm just waiting to travel 😔.",19May2019,2
459,"Hi r/Advice 

I’m a 18 yo dude and I graduated from a private college, hence graduating at 18.  My diploma major is Mass Communications. I’ve been through depression since my high school years from 13-16. Bullying in high school took a heavy toll on me and I was on anti depressants that got me to my heaviest weight in end 2017 (81KG) 

From 2018-now, I did my diploma and I managed to lose weight till 73KG. I’ve also heard that my bullies and classmates that treated me unfairly had to retake their GSCE’s 2 times more. 

Now I have about a year to enjoy life before I do a 2 year mandatory army service. 

I managed to get a full time job for the press as a call centre officer in my country. I did this job just so it improves my resume, as in the future I can work with this company as a journalist or basically something I would enjoy doing later in life. 

I also do know what degree I’d like to take in the future and also what I would like to do in my 1 year free time (music) 

Despite having a full time job, working on my weight, and even working on my personality (used to be an introvert and now I’m trying to be more extroverted) 

I can’t seem to find a Girlfriend, I’m very stressed out about this. I personally don’t know why I want a Girlfriend so badly, it’s gotten so bad I’ve been having suicidal thoughts, something that stopped since I was out of high school. 

Also my parents are 58, and I’m 18. There’s a 40 year age gap. I personally am very fond in tattoo arts but my parents look down on it since they think it’s gangster shit, which is complete bullshit to me in my opinion. 

I’ve been wanting to get a tattoo for 5 years. I managed to create designs and I’ve held on to them for 2 years. However, after telling my cousins, they are probing me to not get a tattoo. My cousins feel that I would be betraying and breaking the trust of my parents if I got a tattoo. 

Why can’t I get a tattoo ? I love tattoos and see them as art, why can’t I be myself ? Why can’t I be myself after all the years of torture in high school. I’m paying for the tattoo with my own fucking money, why would my parents feel betrayed if I did something for me ? 

I’m honestly very frustrated, pissed and I often snap at my parents because they nag the living shit out of me despite me having a stable job and life. They want me to be an adult, but when I want to take life decisions like an adult, they think I’m a kid. 

They wouldn’t allow me to smoke and drink even though I’m of legal age. My dad smokes and drinks and yet he doesn’t want me to touch it. 

I’ve been feeling a lot suicidal and been having suicidal thoughts recently,  I don’t even feel  depressed, I just feel I should leave it all and go. Or sometimes I feel I won’t make it past my late 20’s. 

Please don’t link any Reddit suicide stuff, I just feel how I feel, I won’t actually take my life. 

Am I not happy ? Why aren’t I happy ? I’m doing better than my bullies, making money, have a stable job, been losing weight and I’m still like this ? Why ??? 

I’d actually appreciate it if a few of you guys can share what you guys think as I’m really stressed  and frustrated",19May2019,0
460,"I’m sorry if this is long. I’m (17F). Both of my parents are kinda difficult, one is less difficult than the other. My father moved away from us when I was 8 years old because of his “job”, he divorced my mother because of “taxes” and came back at the beginning of last year. While he moved away he was involved with women and took money from my mothers bank account without her knowing. He wouldn’t pick up the phone at all. We were almost kick out of our home because my mother wasn’t making enough money to pay the bills/rent. I was also molested by my friends cousin and I didn’t tell anyone. My mother had to beg people to give us food for free. Sometimes when I talked on the phone with him, he would forget to hang up and I would hear another woman in the background talking to him, I was a kid. I told my mother about this and she found out about everything he was doing, she got into a huge argument with him. When my father first moved back he would hit me when he was angry over little things. I ended up fighting him back and he stopped. I told him about being molested and he acted like he was sorry. He says that my art is terrible which is frustrating. He used to make fun of me when I was bullied in school and use it against me in arguments. He would say “Those kids should’ve knocked you out” and things along those lines. Now he blames me for everything, argues with me, apologizes and then does the same thing again. My brother knows this and tells my father he’s wrong but he doesn’t care. 

My mother and I get along nowadays. Sometimes she argues with me. When I lost my virginity because an older man took advantage of me she was very angry. She called me names, it hurt a lot. I told her about being molested and she was hurt that I didn’t tell her right away. She doesn’t hold grudges or “gets revenge” like my father does. When I argue with my mother she doesn’t use anything against me. She also don’t try to start arguments with me 24/7.

Roughly three weeks ago, I lost my job due to not wanting to take over the entire business for essentially minimum wage. Wanting to clear my head, I went camping overnight. During this time, the girlfriend was in a panic thinking I was going to break up with her as soon as I came home. 

Fast forward to three days ago, she says we need to talk. Long story short, we're breaking up because we're not right for each other. ""She thought I would be her forever, but I don't give her enough attention, and she wants to have babies and get married like tomorrow. She'd rather break up now while we like each other instead of ten years later when we're in the same place and hate each other.""

Things were okay and agreeable up to this point - We have had chronic issues, but I assumed, incorrectly, that our love would hold us together. 

The very next evening, she goes bar-hopping with her friends as a single lady. From what I hear, it didn't go well as she made a drunken slob of herself. Yesterday evening, she left to drink at a friends, saying she'd be home later in the night. Instead she slept over. 

Financially, I'm in a tight spot. I have enough in savings to pay rent for maybe three months before looking for work. Home-wise, utilities and such are split between the girlfriend, myself, and a roommate.

Reddit, I need your advice and input so I can stay sane. Is it 'normal' for someone fresh out of a long relationship to be so ..promiscuous? I feel dead inside, disappointed that the person I thought I knew would betray my feelings so readily. On top of that, I don't have any friends readily available that I could go stay a few days with - They're all at least 4 hours drive away. It seems like my only real option is to sell / trash all my belongings and start over somewhere new, but that's an extremely scary thought to me. 

I need wise words, please give them to me.",19May2019,2
465,"Boyfriend of 11 years cheated, back story below.

So last year I recieved messages saying my boyfriend of ten years is hanging out with a local bartender at the bar he goes. No big deal it's a bar, but I hear they after party. I have no proof he says hes friends with her boyfriend. Fast forward 6 months I get more messages saying they have kissed and get touchy at the bar, I ask him , he unfriends her says he wont be around her. Now 3 days ago i recieved a message from her husband, he claimed they have been having a affair for the last couple years. He doesn't know if they had sex but my man admitted it to him they shared a kiss, and apologized it went to far. I ask my man and he gives me the cold shoulder saying it's not true at all. I message the girl and after constant begging she admits they did Infact mess around but only kissed and it was a few times. One of the times being this Friday they ""hooked"" up. Should I believe they didn't have sex? This has been going on for over two years. I dont kkow what to believe , he isn't talking , just saying sorry and hes depressed. This was going on all through my pregnancy but they both claim just kissed and they messed up. I want to stay and fix this, I love him, he is the father of my kids, but I cant trust him anymore. Do you think there is more to this at all? Sorry I'm all over the place, I've been emotional. I blocked the girl and her husband. But I need opinions. .",19May2019,1
466,"Hi Reddit.

7 years ago now a very, very close friend committed suicide. There were no warning signs. From what has been pieced together, a group of leeches attached themselves to him after I and others of his friends moved away from our home town after college in pursuit of work. On the day, these people had him driving around everywhere, buying them food, smokes, booze and other stuff to have a party. Once he had a few drinks they started ripping on him (he was always self conscious as he had a stutter and thought he was unattractive. He just didn't recognise when people flirted with him.) And it got so bad he decided to walk home in the middle of the night.

He walked about 25k.

He got home, wrote out a note, went to the garage, made a noose and hung himself.

His body was found hours later by his mother when she came home from the night shift at a hospital.

His ""friends"" literally went to his house and ransacked his room. They took his electronics (including a high end gaming PC) collectibles, valuables, army cadets items and his goddamn fucking car.

I live far away. Across an ocean. But I have returned to that place several times since. Each time, I swear and plan on visiting his grave and saying my goodbyes. Every time, I can't.

I keep thinking it will make it too final. I secretly hope it's a long bad joke or an elaborate way to not want to speak to me anymore. Anything but that he is actually gone.

I never stop thinking about him. He's still on my Facebook. No activity since that date. He's on my Steam account. Last login is now so long ago it can't display it. His email is inactive. His mobile number is now someone elses.

It's killing me. He mentioned me in the note. He tried to call me the day it happened but I let it go to voicemail because I had just finished work and was having a couple beers and playing my PlayStation to unwind. I keep thinking of all the times I could have been a better friend. How I should have answered. How I should have checked in on him more often. How I should have offered to let him stay with me and get set up somewhere he could make a better go of it.

How do I get past this? Every time I start getting close to the town with the cemetery he is buried in I have to pull over and throw up. I get panic attacks. I just....can't.

How do I get past it so I can say goodbye to my friend and apologize for not being a better one?",19May2019,1

468,"Actual story below. TLDR, I've been talking to this guy for awhile. He treats me like his girlfriend and I'm really not interested in him. He's just become annoying now. He's got a lot of stuff going on in his life, so I'm not too sure how to leave. I'm quite a blunt girl, so I usually am the heartbreaker. How can I dip out without making him feel down? 

---

We met in an online game. Chatted a bit, became good friends until he started being a bit.. Odd. There's around a 7 year difference, I'm still in my teens while he's mid twenties. He'd always be using that hard L word even when I never say it back, I would just laugh it off and say ""awful decision."" Overtime, I became bored of him in a way. All he'd want was to listen to me talk, so much so that I felt like a Youtuber commentating and a fan being there in real time. I started to lose interest and not talk as much, causing him to almost freak out in a way? Our calls would always just be him asking what's wrong repeatedly until I left. I would always say nothing is the matter, because there really wasn't anything. And even after I told him how annoying and illogical it is to assume I'm sad because I don't talk for a split second, he still does it. Our calls used to be interesting, but now three hours feels like three days. I've told him what he does that annoys me so much, but he just doesn't change in a way. One thing is for sure, I'll probably make him want to isolate again if I tell it straight up, that the problem I have is just him in general, so I'm not sure how I can leave. Should I just say I need a break or something? And then ghost?",19May2019,1

470,"Im 16 and I’m in 11th grade. My parents, especially my dad, are very depressed. There are these moments that happen when my father gets really sad from not obtaining enough money from his job as there are not enough customers as the ecenomy is down. The payments for the rent and school bills really get him down as well. He starts to side to drinks to give him comfort and he becomes very angry and releases all his anger on me and my mother. He gets angry over the tiniest things and well my mom gets hurt (not physically) and starts crying. I act as a shield and try to reason with him and attempt to calm him but he just doesn’t stop. In those moments he either angrily goes to bed or just leaves the house entirely to sleep elsewhere. I know the alchohol and the tiredness from the job are major influences for his actions but its as if a whole other person comes in.

But ever since he’s been in the group, there’s never been more drama and arguments, usually starting because of him. He’ll start arguments about him making more money, having a girlfriend, having a car, pretty much will brag and show off about anything. He will be the chillest dude one moment but then be a complete toxic asshole, usually over text. Just now I had an argument with him because I left my COD 1 disc at his house. I asked for it back and he kept playing dumb like “dude I don’t have call of duty soldiers at my house”. I know he’s joking, but shit like this will just spiral into an argument.

486,"Alright, to preface im 20M in the Navy and currently far from home. My only sibling 16F has some issues with listening to my parents and they butt heads a lot (my sister and dad are both very type A so they both want it their way). This has obviously caused problems growing up, but nothing too serious until now. I love my sister, and support her with advice and protection whenever she needs it, and she knows it. I'm normally the first person she turns to when she is in trouble. This morning she woke me up with a call saying that my parents are kicking her out of the house.

&amp;#x200B;

She has been doing some questionable things online recently, nothing nude but for a 16 year old its really disgusting. She was making money and happy with it, but felt bad because as much as she goes behind my parents backs to do stuff she still doesn't really enjoy it. She just wants to do what she wants to do. I told her that she should absolutely not be doing it but if she understands the risks and wants to keep doing it, I won't stop her. ""It's her life"" I said to myself and if she wanted to do this and kinda whore herself out to creepy old dudes on the internet for money then fine. At least she isn't doing it in real life (Although I was very aware that was probably going to be the next step).

&amp;#x200B;

I was on leave at home for a bit and when I left she ended up talking to my dad about it and he seemed alright with it at the time. She explained that he was calm and talked about it like an adult, but I knew it was really fishy. My dad isn't normally one to be calm in situations like that (no he never hit us or anything but inanimate objects better watch out) and it really seemed like he was just taking in everything my sister had to say before he fucked her world up later.

&amp;#x200B;

She called me fucking bawling and it really hurt that I couldn't be there to help her like I had been for the past 16 years. She was begging me to help and talk to my dad who gave her a week to get the fuck out. She doesn't have a job, car, or any experience with being an adult. I was really lucky and my parents basically held my hand until I could do everything myself (as I believe a parent should) but they seem to be throwing all that to the wind with my sister. I get that they are not happy with what she did, and I understand my dads stance on that he doesn't want to support someone doing something like that (he was always the ""not while you're under my roof"" type) but I feel like doing that to my sister would be virtually killing her. He told me that the next step would very likely be on a street corner, but I tried to explain to him that kicking her out is only giving up on her and allowing that to happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want my sister to be the next ""hooker killed"" on the news or some shit. I tried to do everything I could but being 6 states away makes it really hard to be there for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? I really want to be there for my family but my dad basically said that it wasn't my problem any more and that they love her just as much as I do. He said he wasn't happy with this but he told me that it was his choice as a parent. Should I just let them be the parents? Should I step in and try to get her to stay at the house at least until she is able to go out on her own? Maybe try and support her on my military pay until she can do it on her own?

He was never interested in having anything but a surface relationship and always seemed out of it and now I know why..

Right after my Mom died he starting seeing a 30 year old (He was 61.). We had moved home to be a family. Instead of being a family, he started giving her money, providing for her, while refusing to fix the house, help out with groceries, be there for us, anything. He started going for all my Mom's money and took us out of her will shortly before she died.

He lied multiple times about being with this women all last year. He said he broke it off this January. Well after many stalking attempts, the 30 year old added me on Facebook under my Dad's mistresses name and showed their texts that showed they never broke up. She also sent me a message unleashing all my dad's secrets including the fact my Dad was with his mistress for over 10 years during both my Mom's cancer battles, that he went back to her right after my Mom did and was cheating on the 30 year old with his mistress.

I get extremely bad anxiety from past trust issues, however, and I know it’s not her fault but just an example- having her hang out with her friends without me makes me nervous sometimes. Especially because some of her friends were a part of her life when she was living that crazy lifestyle. I’m scared she’s going to get into some shit. I trust her but I don’t trust other people. I’ve communicated this in the past, she’s reassured me that nothing like that is going to happen, but still my restless brain won’t let it go. 

So reddit, how can I get over these trust issues? Please no rude comments.",19May2019,1
496,"So i had an after party for the biggest event at my school. School event was from 6:30-9:00 and then everyone would come to my house and we’d throw a party. My long-time friend whom i’ve known my entire life just sat on my couch with his girlfriend. They were isolated from the rest of the group and were just sitting on my couch away from the rest of the party. Everyone else was in the garage (where the party was) and my friend and his girlfriend had just sat on the couch for some 4 hours. Little did i know he was fingering her under the blanket they had and she came all over my couch. 

This happened just last night and i’m still shocked it happened. Should I confront my friend about the baseball-sized stain on my couch or should i just bleach it out and forget about it.",19May2019,1
497,"I’ll try to keep this general but basically I have worked in a retail job that I fucking hate for almost a year now, the wage is shit, the management is shit and I still get treated like I only started working there despite doing 40 hours every week for 8 months. 

I am going travelling in 2 weeks time for a month and I had planned to quit anyway but it has got to the point were I am considering quitting immediately and not going back. I get treated like shit and if I’m being honest I do not need this job at all and it means nothing to me.

498,"I’m a 19 year old musical theater student (baritone).  I’ve been best friends with this girl for almost a year.  She’s one of the sweetest most talented people I’ve ever met, and I think I’m falling in love with her.
The short version of the question is, should I tell her this?

The long version has a lot more context.

She ended a very serious relationship about three weeks ago.  I’ve been helping her through it.  She doesn’t miss him as much as she feels guilty for breaking his heart.  He was a friend of mine, too, so I sympathize.

The reason I don’t know what to do, is I value our friendship very much.  I’ve never met anyone like her.  In all my years of knowing how to be a regularly social human, she’s one of the only people I’m unafraid to be myself around.  We have so much in common, that we introduce each other as “the guy/girl version of me.”  That’s the dynamic of our friendship, and it makes me very happy.  Thats something I’m afraid of losing if I confess.  I’m there for her as much as I can be right now, as her friend, and I’m afraid that if she knows, she’ll think I’m only doing it to win her over.

I also feel confident enough that if I continue to do what I’m doing, (having fun with her, performing with her, being there for her,) and wait, that my chances are good.

But, I also can’t shake the feeling I’m doing something wrong by keeping this from her.

What do I do?

Thanks in advance, Reddit!",19May2019,1

501,"Just wanting to know how others would handle the situation.

Tldr: boss is unprofessional, cannot keep things to himself, bitches about colleagues to eachother, tries to pit people against each other, insults staff.

Had this guy running the store since July last year, he is autistic which is important to the story. Due to this he doesn't have any empathy and speaks about people in a very inappropriate way. 

First month or so of him running it he has upset that many people that his boss got called in, and people were queuing outside of his office to complain about him.

If you go to him with something in confidence he tells other people. He doesn't acknowledge or greet people in the morning. He slates one colleague to another and vice versa, calling them dick heads and other inappropriate things behind their backs. He does not praise anyone for a good job ever. He will ask something of you or tell you how to do something, and then go back on it and say that he didn't say that. Blatant gaslighting and he does it to multiple people.

I cant think of a good thing to say about him. If he has an issue with you or something you're doing, he will tell other people but not you, and wait for the news to reach you.

I have been debating whether to email his boss and explain how I feel,  because I am really struggling right now. I love my job and I love my colleagues but I dread going in if I have to work with him (which I do, every shift). 

But what if that bites me in the ass and he finds out it was me who emailed, and makes my life difficult?

If I email, what more can his boss do? Last time he came in, listened to everyone's grievances and then my boss got a slap on the wrist nothing more.

This man should not be in charge of people. I have been applying to other jobs, I dont necessarily want a new job but if it's what I need to do if hes not going anywhere, then it's what I need to do.

What what you all do in this situation?",19May2019,1
502,"I don’t want to get too far into things here but for context I will do my best. 

My best friend was not close with his biological family, they kicked him out at 18 and ceased all communication with him. My family took him in and for over 5 years considered him a part of our own. He was my brother. My parents son. My sisters’ brother. Losing him was the hardest day of my life.

The funeral was a shit show as his bio family were legally allowed all the day in what went on - he never had anything done legally to make sure they wouldn’t have a part in his death as much as they had no part in his late life. The most he ever did was write on a piece of paper that if he ever passed then I would be in charge. However, this of course wasn’t a legal document and did nothing - to him it was more of a gesture to say “you’re my family”. 

Much time as passed and much healing has been done, but now it’s come out that his accounts have blocked all of his friends, and my family. We all tried to reach out to show our heartbreak, but his cousin has made it clear she doesn’t care at all. She even told my sister that we “need to stop posting on social media as if we’re special” and “what did you do that was so great? He passed. Good job”.

This is well after everyone’s made their peace with his careless family and we’ve all accepted what his post life is (they have claim to all of his belongings and had claim to plan his funeral and much more). Though we all know he wanted nothing to do with his bio family, we’ve all accepted it. But this is too far and I’m not sure what to do. I want to accept this as well as it’s just data and the true memories I hold are in my heart.

But this is just too far. It’s too much for me to handle and I’m not sure what is right anymore.

TLDR; my best friend died last year and had no connection with his bio family for over 5 years and no they’ve gone and blocked all of his closest friends on his social media and told everyone off in a very disgusting way.",19May2019,3
503,"The other day I was poking fun at him for something, in my head thinking I was coming off as joking as we often tease eachother. For some reason though my joke didnt land, and he took it seriously and became defensive. He insulted me a couple times as well, insults that cut a lot deeper than my joke even if I had been serious.

I tried to broach the subject with him. I asked if my comment had come off as an insult and if he was upset. He exclaimed that I was just annoying. I told him that I was just trying to joke around and didnt mean to come off as insulting, but that he had said some hurtful things. Again he brushed it off and said I was being annoying and that was that.

I'm still upset, but he obviously had a limited capacity for this kind of stuff. Do I just have to stop teasing him from now on in case I hit another trigger?",19May2019,2
504,"Long time lurker here but actually found myself needing some advice. I live with 4 other roommates in a house, my bf and I share the biggest room (he has a huge bed that won’t fit anywhere else and we have so much stuff together) and the other two have their own rooms and one of their girlfriends just recently moved in with her undisciplined dog (there are now 4 dogs total and we did not know she was gonna move in later) 

Recently, the girlfriend just found out she is pregnant and is expected to give birth in January. The roommate (we’ll call him K) and his gf now want my bf and I to completely switch rooms and our bathroom with them (they have a rather smaller room but still enough room to fit a bassinet or cradle in there) and have us completely rearrange everything. We have absolutely way too much stuff and our furniture will not fit into their room. We still have an extra empty bedroom that they could use for a nursery. We have been in this house for 6 months already and our lease isn’t up until June of 2020. I had suggested they get their own apartment come January and the rest of us can pay their 5 months rent (we all have good paying jobs and split rent between 5, if they get apartment it will split between 3 which is still very manageable). This way not everyone has to deal with a new born for 5 months? 

Guess i’m more so just asking if i’m being a bitch for not wanting to rearrange everything because their the ones who are having suddenly having a baby and she moved in with her dog and now we have to change everything. any suggestions? i’m very open to constructive criticism. maybe i’m just highly irritated with everything and the fact that i live with too many ppl already and truly don’t want to deal with this baby.",19May2019,1

My Bf has been friends with G for a while now and I on the other hand just started to get to know G better at the start of this year when (after I lost some weight and started going to the gym) when I, Bf and G went out and throughout this I've observed that she's avoiding me she doesn't want to take any pics with me while with Bf she has a TON which I don't mind but still, and the only way she will hang out is if Bf comes or someone else doesn't matter, only if it isn't only the two of us.

510,"This is quite a long story . I was born in England but went to school in Spain when I was kid. Made some good friends there and returned to England for university when I was 18.  This past summer I was back in Spain seeing some friends. I met up with one friend in particular, I will call him John. John comes from a rich Spanish family, he loves drinking, partying and smoking weed. He was studying at a university in Spain but he was kicked out for failing his classes (He told everyone that he just chose to drop out) because all he would do is smoke weed and party. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the summer he told me how he wanted to change universities/courses and how cool it would be for him to come to the same university as me. I was excited so I helped him sort everything out. Eventually he was accepted into the university and in August he came to stay with me in England while he sorted out some accommodation.

&amp;#x200B;

John assured me that he would only be here a couple weeks. He would fine a place to stay and he would move out. It was around 2 months before he moved out. In that time he had managed to start arguments and alienate all of my housemates. He would sit around doing nothing all day except smoking weed and playing videogames. I saw a very bratty and immature side of him that I had never seen before. If we didn't get to do what he wanted he would throw a strop, not saying a word to me for hours. When he moved out I tried to keep friendly with him. This is where I made a big mistake. He asked to borrow some money for bills. Just £40, so I thought that was alright. A couple days later he had to borrow some more money for his 'bills'. He kept promising me how every penny is going to paid back and that I can trust him. Eventually John owed me around $500.......

&amp;#x200B;

Through a lot of messages he finally says he is going to send me half of the money. That never turned up. He also borrowed $20 off another friend of mine which he still hasn't paid either.  I was messaging him everyday asking for the money. Eventually he snapped at me, threatening me and my housemates with violence. At this point I realised I wasn't going to get my money back so I said fuck it and cut all contact with him.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont hear a thing off of him for months. I see he posted something on his snapchat story one night. It was a video of a bottle of purple liquid with jolly ranchers in it. Can only assume it was codeine. I messaged a close friend of Johns and told him to check his story. The friend asked if he had drank any of the codeine. John denied it but after a bit of prodding he confessed he had 'tried' his friends. Me and his friend realised we couldn't do anything really, it was on him to stop this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hadn't given it much thought until today. One of my housemates works with a girl that John lives with. According to them he has started selling crack. People come to their house at all times and buy off of him. Some people have been sleeping on their sofas for days now. He has smashed one of the girls windows, threatened to kill her and her boyfriend. They couldn't find any knives in the kitchen so they went to check in John's room. He had hoarded all of the knifes in the house. 

&amp;#x200B;

His behaviour over the past months has seriously scared me. He is going to get himself seriously hurt and hurt others if he continues the way he is going. I have messaged his friend again in hopes that he can talk some sense into him. Sorry for the long winded paragraphs. I want everyone to be able to see how fast he has spiralled into an addiction. I really dont know what to do here. Any help would be really appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr:  Childhood friend goes to the same university as me. Alienates all of my friend group. Borrowed £500 of my money to spend on drugs. Lied about paying it back to me. I think he is now selling/doing crack. He has become abusive and violent towards the people he lives with.",19May2019,2

516,"To give some possible reasons for why I am the way I am now, I’ll give some info about the “recent” huge events in my life.

About two years ago my parents started to separate. I’m now in high school, so they’ve been together for all my life, and ever since I was a kid I always saw divorced people and thought “oh but that will never happen to me.” But now it has. When they started to part it was very stressful as my mom got an apartment and my dad stayed in the house and me and my sister would go from staying with my mom for a day or two, and then my dad, and so on. There wasn’t really a schedule so it was pretty chaotic. Skip a few months and we stop seeing my dad. He was a former police officer and had/ has very severe PTSD and also ADHD. ( I also have ADHD). He did many things that he shouldn’t have and today he is in a not very good place. Back to when we stopped seeing him, at the end of my eighth grade year, on the very last day of school, my mom picked me up, and we left for Georgia(we originally lived in Ohio). We left all of my friends and family and my three dogs which I loved more than everything. That summer in Georgia we pretty much did nothing but stay in our apartment because we literally didn’t know anyone except for some non blood related family. I, a teenager, had to go through a whole summer without seeing anyone. It was the loneliest summer I have ever had. Then the school year starts and I’m lonely for pretty much all of it. I now have a few friends, but none of them were in any of my classes so the whole year I was still lonely for most of it. Then my mother got a boyfriend who is super nice, but he’s an alcoholic and when he gets drunk he is scary and violent. He went to a rehab place a few times but he didn’t change. He’s in one again right now. I have been traumatized from a recent even from him. No one got hurt but I will forever remember it. Then my mom lost her job. The first time in her whole career, she was let go. This has never happened as my mom is extremely experienced and very good at what she does, it’s just her new job here wasn’t treating her well and they didn’t appreciate her. Everything in my life is going downhill. I also had scoliosis surgery this year in February and missed three weeks of school. None of my teachers(except one) pitied me and expected me to do my work while I was always healing (mind you that I was one multiple pain meds and couldn’t even count to ten cause of all the drugs yet they expect me to work.) ever since then all of my grades have been down at least one grade letter if not more. The school year is over and I still wasn’t able to get back to where I was before the surgery. I hear that colleges look at the freshmen grades specifically, so now what is no one accepts me cause of my bad second semester grades. I’m also terrible at Spanish and am barely passing. I have a final in it this week and idk what I’m going to do if I fail it. My (ex) best friend completely ignores me. I have severe ADHD, depression, and anxiety which gives me many “tics” (little things like blinking a lot or popping my jaw) and I feel very self conscious when I do these tics but I can’t stop. I’ve started lashing out and yelling at my mom and it makes me feel even sadder. I’m very empathetic and it’s not good as I feel like I bear the burden of everyone around me. I have never been at a lower point in my life. I’m so so sad and scared that I will have no future. Please help me. I want a therapist and I know my mom would get me one if I asked her, but like I previously stated, she lost her job and I don’t want her spending money on me. I have a very bad fear with money and how it is spent. Every time we go to the store I get anxious. I’m so terrified we’re gonna run out. We’re already in a terrible apartment( not that they’re all bad, just our complex is bad), what if it gets worse. My moms already gonna pay for me and my sister to do marching band next year which will be over $2,000. I love marching band but this makes me feel so bad.

I have pretty bad luck with girls. It’s probably my fault though so I’m not blaming anyone. When I have to talk to girls or they have to talk to me, they usually start getting uncomfortable ie avoiding eye contact, acting cold and some have even had what I think was a scared expression. 
I’m in trouble right now because this one girl is spreading rumours about me being an obsessive creep because I asked her out twice. I thought she liked me because she would hint towards some sexual stuff (motioning blowjobs, groping me, asking me about dating.)

I only asked a second time after she escalated with me again when me, her and her best friend were in the same room alone and she started toying with me.

521,"Well “Hate” is a strong word, it more like “My step dad who still sees all animation as something only for kids.” 

My step dad is a bit of an old fashioned man (no not in THAT way) and as such is very much convinced that any animation is strictly for children. He’s gone on record as saying that he hates animation targeted at adults (to be fair he is probably thinking of shows like South Park and family guy, shoes I’m not really partial to either.)

He also really likes balls to the walls action flicks, like John wick, the born identity, and a decent amount of the MCUs output. 

Because of this I thought I might be able to get him to see a new perspective on animation by introducing him to Shonen series like dragon ball and JoJo two series that I think have a lot of things that he likes in his action movies.

The main issue is that I don’t think he really gives them a fair shake, often he won’t even pay attention to the movie or show and just look at his phone till it’s over. My and my little cousin watched into the spidervers a few weeks ago and he just used Facebook on his tablet. 

Do you guys have any idea what I can do to convince him to really watch a animated show. I still think some sort of Shonen is my best bet for finding something he likes.

Other things he likes. Lord of the rings, the Michael Bay transformer movies, the matrix, the final fantasy games (specific 8).",19May2019,7

523,"Throwaway account because my friends know my other.

I realised yesterday that I’ve spent 30 days out of 31 having consumed at least one drink. There would always be a reason - I went on holiday, I visited friends out of town, it’s been sunny, there have been celebrations/parties/birthdays/pub quizzes etc. I also work in a pub so we drink the mispours/have a free drink after if it’s been a particularly hard shift. It’s not that I’m drinking at home on my own - it’s always out with friends and in the afternoon or evening. 

I’ve just noticed that I’ve started to feel relief when someone suggests going out for a drink, and I like the way I feel after one. I’m going through a hell of a lot right now, and have been in therapy in previous years for PTSD and an eating disorder. I’m worried that I’ve just replaced one unhealthy coping mechanism with another.

As for my job - I trained to be an EMT and underwent my medical check a couple of months ago, which was all fine. However,  I worry that if I go to the doctor about the alcohol, my notes will then have ‘worries about alcohol dependency’ forever recorded on them. I’m not sure how much my employers can see of my medical history, if any. I know that if they can see it however, I may be subject to further tests. I know I’m worried, but it’s not affecting my day to day life. I’m not turning up to work drunk, or unable to go in because I’m hungover. I don’t start fights or get absolutely wasted. I just want to nip this in the bud with some therapy.

Any experience or advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",19May2019,2
524,"\- As per title. This has been going on pretty much since we started seeing each other 1.5 years ago, but only really aware of it happening 0.5 years in.

\- She recently wanted to do a secondment at work for six months abroad from March to September. We explicitly agree to reserve about 10 days of annual leave to see each other in these 6 months with about 1 week in June and 1 week in July, together with the odd weekend every month or so / bank holidays.

\- We've subsequently had about 4 or 5 arguments with her booking off all her leave with friends - now she has three days of her 15 days of annual leave available left unbooked in these 6 months to see me, and this is at a very specific time in July when all the kids break up for the summer and all the prices have gone up. No other time because every other weekend is booked with other people.

\- She previously booked off her April bank holidays with other people, before we argued and she cancelled to spend with me.

\- I understand she wants to see friends, but feel behaviour is incredibly disrespectful and thoughtless. Then again he who is without sin cast the first stone.

I'm on the brink of telling her she can book the three days remaining with other people as she wants to see them so much - I won't be relegated to a 15th place afterthought.

We don't really see each other at school but we take the same bus in the morning and in the afternoon, so we talk during those times and sometimes we text when in school.

It’s gotten to the point where I make sure to wear clothes that cover me up whenever I see him and I keep distance between us. Maybe I just wasn’t close with my dad, but it shouldn’t have me wanting to run away from him all the time.

I’m feeling bad for avoiding my dad when he’s done nothing wrong or suspicious, but I can’t get close to him without feeling uneasy and scared.

530,"A little background, I am a 20 year old college student with absolutely no knowledge on cars. My only expenses are food, some utilities, and fun money. My parents pay for rent, books, etc, but I will be on my own if I want to purchase a car. My job is only throughout the school year (August-May), I’ve been applying for summer jobs in the meantime. 

I would like to hopefully save up till December, but I’m not sure how to go about it? Is it smarter to save up a down payment on a car or pay in full for a used car? I get discounted car insurance through one of my school organizations so I’m not too worried about that. 

The kind of car I’m looking for is something reliable that can get me from A to B. I don’t really need the extra add ons, just something simple to get me around. With that, what’s a good amount of money I should be saving up in the next 7 months?

534,"Hi, 

It seems that everytime my freinds have an outing to anywhere, they always seem to leave me out.

It all started sometime around last year. We met in the usual spot at break and they started talking about their plans to see Infinty War. I'm not a marvel fan so I didn't mind, but it did seem as if they were planning it for a while without telling me. When I mentioned this they apologized and that was that.

After that it was one of my friends (Lets call them ""Timmothy"") was organizing a meet at the woods. (We live in a Semi-Rural area). Another freind (Lets call him ""Steven"") Mentions that they have another group chat specifcally for organizing meet ups. But after saying this Everyone gives ""Steven"" ""that look"".  I then ask why I wasn't invited to the group chat. This time they tried to play it off as being my fault, even though this was the first time They had told me. Not only that there was no way for me to find out. To add insult to injury for about a week after they went on and on about how fun it was, and when I politly asked they don't, they seemed to again blame me for not being there.

I was invited to ***a*** group chat after that, two of them in fact, however neither of them was the outing group chat.

&amp;#x200B;

Next was ""Timmothy's"" birthday. He was planning a party/sleepover thing at his house. Once again he had seemed to have told everyone exepect me. As soon as i found out, I knew for a fact that I wasn't invited. I asked him politly why wasn't I Invited. He said that all of the Sofas were being used. I said I would be fine with sleeping on the floor. And another freind (""Dave"") piped up and said it was in planning for a while. I asked if they had a while, why wasn't I at least told. They just told me again that I wasn't invited and it was final. Another friend (""Phil"") exclaimed that they was never invited to things either. (Remember this, it'll be important later) And again they tried to play it off as being my fault.

&amp;#x200B;

By this point I had come to expect that I wasn't going to be invited to anything.

A Similar situations happened for ""Dave's"" Birthday, similar situation with Timmothy's birthday, but the thing that gets me is the fact that ""Phil"" was invited, yet again I wasn't. During the resultant discusion, ""Phil"" had the nerve to still tell me he gets invited to nothing even though he was invited. Again, they tried to play it off as being my fault.

But they did something different today.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I only found they were going to the woods again when one of them posted it on their private instagram. By that i mean they had never talked about it in real life, or told me, and I expect them to talk about it endlessly while I'm there at break tommorrow. (It's Sunday today.) Not only that I also expect if i bring it up that they'll say its my fault.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be genuinly greatful if someone could tell me how get them to stop doing this.

Thanks.",19May2019,1

I should give her family a letter kept in her drawer. I asked her for the reason. Before I tell it to you i need you to know a few things about her life. 
She is a god loving, religious person, very caring, helpful. Inshort she is super good at heart. She doesn't care about herself to protect her family or relations with other people even though it may cause her great discomfort. 

So the reason she told me was that she was too tired of life and that she wanted to run away from everyone. She always thinks about others and doesn't consider her own good and wants a chance to think about herself

I don't know what to do? Should I inform her parents about this. Or one of her family friend who is a year older...

543,"Don't be fooled by the title, this is a horrifying experience that I'm going through as of the time of writting this.  

Some things y'all might need to know:  I'm a 21  year old male living in Texas, I share an apartment with my older brother, and I also have a UTI at the moment and am taking a tablet that stains my pee orange.  The apartment has only one bathroom and is in the second story of a larger building.  
So, here is how it happened.  I was up pretty much all night peeing constantly and drinking a lot of water to help the UTI situation.  I went to sleep at 6am so I didn't have much sleep in me when I woke up.  Woke up at around 5 hours later with an incredible urge to take a massive piss, and decide to run for the bathroom.  As I approach the bathroom door, I see the light under it shine, which means that my brother was already there.  In my moment of desperation and poor judgement I went for the balcony.  Mind you, these balconies are huge thick planks of wood, but there is a tiny bit of space between the planks.  Anyways, I go outside searching for any onlookers so I don't get arrested for public indecency, and since there weren't any, I peed about half of what I was holding onto the balcony.  I felt super ashamed and disgusted, but in my mind, that was the only solution.  As I am ready to clean my orange mess, I hear the orange piss drip below onto the neighbors patio...where they have some furniture.  My brother and I concluded that the best course of action is to not say anything, but in case they ask or knock at our door, well say that I dropped my vitamin water on the balcony by accident and didn't realized it had leaked below.  

With that in mind, what do y'all think I should do? :c  
Can they call the police on me?  Can my lease be voided?  Im broke at the moment and can't pay for the furniture, what are my options, wise people of Reddit?",19May2019,3
544,"A little bit of explanation: I'm a 16 yrs old student from Poland. I don't know how education works in other countries but here when you start high school you have to choose your major - subjects that you want to focus on. So, my school has five types of majors and I chose maths and physics. Time goes on and about half year later I decide that I want to become a vet (which means I should change my major).

High school here is three years long. Near the end of the third year you write an exam called matura which basically decides whether or not you get accepted into university. As for now I want to do four subjects on my matura: english, maths, biology and chemistry.

I obviously want to change my major to biology and chemistry but there's a problem. If I do that I'll end up with the worst maths teacher in my school (his students borrow notes from me and my classmates just to understand anything that guy teaches them).
I have two choices: 

- stay on my current major (maths and physics) and try to catch up with biology and chemistry by myself and at the same time get good grades in physics (which I absolutely despise...)

or

- change my major to biology and chemistry and learn maths by myself 

So, what should I do? Will I be able to learn maths/biology and chemistry by myself or would that be too much?",19May2019,1
545,"TLDR at the bottom

Background story: I live in Tulsa and have gone to Tulsa community college for the past 2 semesters, right out of high school. I failed pretty much every class I took because of severely declining mental health and skipping class. TCC has a policy where if you fail a class, you can attempt to retake it once and it will completely replace the failing grade with the new one. In the midst of a massive depression/anxiety spell, I decided I was going to change shit and signed up to start retaking all the classes i failed and get my life back together. I was finally feeling happy again until those motherfuckers kicked me out before I could start on any of it, and ive been in such a dark place ever since. I feel like my life has no meaning because I no longer have a reason to keep going. No friends, no job, no educational plans.  Ive applied for a few jobs and even had an interview yesterday, so maybe I have that going for me, but if I do nothing but work a minimum wage job for years I would probably end up killing myself and that’s a serious statement. I don’t want to die, I want to have a higher education and a future. I want to succeed at something and live out a long life knowing I am successful. Anyways, before I start rambling too much..lmao

I haven’t told my mom that I got suspended because that would increase the hellishness of my mental state tenfold, even though that doesn’t feel possible. I am an adult, so I can apply to schools and apply for federal grants on my own, if they’ll even give me any money now. I am going to try and mess with FAFSA on my own, even though I know it will be hard and there’s a lot I don’t understand about it. I have a specific community college in mind that I’m going to apply to and actually started an application for, but since it’s in Oklahoma City, which is more than a hundred miles away, I’m wanting to do coursework there online. I wouldn’t even mind the occasional drive down there since I like driving and it’s pretty much 90% the I-44 turnpike, which isn’t bad. There is the occasional issue of my anxiety, however. Sometimes when I leave for a long drive by myself, I enjoy it up until I start thinking a random health emergency will happen while I’m out in the middle of nowhere, even though I don’t have any kind of ailment that would cause a sudden life or death situation (besides a severe peanut allergy but I don’t eat peanuts obviously). I feel like I could probably talk myself through that, though, because this is a problem I’ve had since I was very very young and now that I’m an adult I can better rationalize things with myself.

Idk. Sorry this is super long. Once things come to my mind, more and more things pop up lol. Thank you so much if you read this.

TLDR: I failed out of community college, haven’t told my mom and don’t plan on it any time soon. My mental health is horrible when I don’t have anything to do with my life, so should I enroll online in another community college that’s an hour and a half away?",19May2019,2

Recently, I went out to get drinks with her and some of her friends to celebrate a 21st birthday and while we were there, I got a text from a girl I had been talking to on tinder (Emily). She said she was out getting drinks at the same bar district and invited me to come get drinks with her and her friend. When she asked me to get drinks I was already drunk and happily agreed to go meet with her. My girlfriend was angry that I left, as was her friend who had just turned 21.  While I was with Emily, I got blackout drunk and do not remember what happened during that time. Apparently later that night my girlfriend and I met up again at a bar but her friends would not let her stay with me as I was extremely wasted and she knew I needed help but her friends knew I was being a douche. They forced her into a car and as they drove off her friends yelled “Fuck Jess” as I was sitting drunk in front of a bar.  I did not even remember that happening, I barely even remember going to meet Emily from tinder earlier that night.

551,"###I'll try to be a brief as possible, but here's a tl;dr
1. Two professors have acted extremely unprofessionally towards me, with one seemingly trying to taunt me about having gotten a lower grade when resitting an exam. The other brought it up in front of other students and told me I ""should be punished"".
2. The latter professor received my home exam with my name on it, so it's not anonymous. I feel that he may discriminate during the grading process. I also suspect he has interfered with exam accommodations.
3. These two professors are the only ones in the department with experience in my thesis subject to pose questions during the presentation of the thesis and contribute to the grade.
4. Assuming I pass the thesis, I'm done with my degree. I don't know my thesis grade until I have the presentation, but I think that if I wasn't going to pass, they'd have told me to revise it already. It's also significantly past the deadline for the department to organize the presentation.

###Should I appeal to the student adviser, asking if I can skip the presentation, citing personal mental health issues? Should I just bite the bullet and hold the presentation, knowing I'll likely pass even if I absolutely bomb the presentation? Or should I bring up the professors' conduct with the department, even if there may be backlash?

Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I'm in a master's program at a university in Northern Europe. I submitted my thesis nearly a year ago, but because I hadn't finished the rest of my program, I haven't gotten a grade or credits for it, nor have I done the defense/presentation.

I spoke with the student adviser who told me several months ago that the external examiner has already read the thesis and was wondering when there would be a presentation. According to university guidelines, the presentation must take place within a month after submission (although all courses in the degree must be passed) and that the deadline for grading the thesis is 3 months after submission. I assume that because I haven't been told to revise it by the examiners I have at least passed.

The reason things are so unusual is that I needed to extend my program due to personal reasons. For an additional year, I have been resitting courses to improve my grades.

During one such course, I needed to take an oral exam (as opposed to written) because two of the exams were scheduled by the department at the same time. The professor was kind enough to arrange an oral exam. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to prepare as much as I had hoped and I already passed the exam before, but ended up getting a lower grade than before. I knew this going in, but I didn't want to waste the professors' time, so I just tried my best, and excused myself for my lack of preparedness afterwards.

According to university policy, it is the highest grade that counts towards your degree grade. All other attempts are thrown out. Despite this, I hear laughing from the office shortly before the two professors grading the oral exam came out to tell me my grade. Professor A told me that I had gotten a lower score and that ""If I'm not mistaken, it's the last grade that counts, right?"" Before I can open my mouth to correct him, he snidely declares that he will have to report the grade nonetheless--almost as if he'd assumed I would beg him not to and he almost seemed to relish it (although I might be projecting).

I simply told him that I would not expect him to not report it, that I would never ask him to do something like that, and later confirmed that it is, in fact, the highest grade that counts. He never ended up submitting the grade, and the result simply says ""failure to attend"" in my transcript.

Professor B, the other examiner, is the lecturer for another one of my courses. During a break in the lecture, the students tend to step outside the classroom and stretch their legs. I was speaking with another student when professor B interrupts our conversation to ask me what happened.

""Most students try to get at least a B, right?""

""Well yes, that was my goal.""

""But instead you got a D?""

Hoping to end an incredibly unprofessional and incredibly awkward conversation, I just shrugged my shoulders and said something along the lines of ""it happens"", but he refused to drop it. Finally I just say ""it doesn't matter"", to which he sharply says ""you should be punished"" before *tripping over himself to rush off*.

This professor also includes a home exam as part of the final grade. He does not give any feedback about the exam and does not include a breakdown of the scores. I believe most students write their student code on the home exam submission (sent to him by email), the same code that is to be written on the anonymous exams. He never included any instruction about this.

I asked him if he would need this in an email a few days ago and he simply replied ""I'll manage"".

I also believe that he has somehow managed to stipulate to the exam office that no student can get extra time on their exams (which I need for personal reasons, and which has been automatically provided for all other exams), but this is just conjecture.

-------------------------------------------------

My gut tells me to just skip the exam, focus on my other courses. I've spent hundreds of hours between lectures, the home exam, and general studying, but I don't feel confident about the exam even before professor B's shenanigans and I'd rather spend the time studying for other exams. The professor would ultimately need to go to a completely different location to see if I have any questions, only to find nobody there, annoying him even more, but it really might be worth it.

**But the main problem is that Professors A and B are the only professors qualified to be the internal examiners during my presentation of my thesis.** While their say is not the final word on the grade (and in fact, if I've understood correctly, the thesis is actually already graded), the thought of having to defend my thesis in front of the people who have treated me with such a lack of respect is downright crippling. I am seriously considering pleading with the student adviser to allow me to skip the presentation and tell him that not knowing the grade has been so stressful for me that I don't think I can deal with the anxiety of actually doing it. An older student who is now doing a PhD in the same subject read my thesis and told me that he thinks I will get an A. All of this has sincerely made me feel that there's a possibility I won't even pass.

I have considered bringing up the professors' conduct, but for what? There's a paper trail and there are students who have witnessed these encounters, but so what? Even if the department acknowledges the issue, someone will still need to evaluate my thesis, and they don't have anyone else to do it!

I just submitted a home exam for another course and I feel very confident about it, so in theory I am ""done"", assuming I passed the thesis. That's all that's left for me to complete my degree.",19May2019,2

554,"So, I've been talking for the longest time with one of my friends (probably the best one) about moving out of our families' houses and into an apartment, together.

I'm not that old, (I'm going 19 this year), but still been thinking for a long time how much I wanna move out, for reasons I'm going to list later. Now, the reason I'm hesitating (and also the reason I wanted to move out in the first place) is my mom.

Some backstory: My mom recently (about 2-3 months ago) got out of a toxic relationship with an asshole, about whom I might write in another post, since he was kind of an EP. They were together for two years, and during that time, my relationship with her weakened a little more than it already was . The reason would mostly (but not only) be that she was ALWAYS with that guy, and they both sort of neglected me and hardly ever listened to me, even if I was in the right on something (I know, sounds like childish ranting, but it's also true; that attitude stuck with my mom to this day) because they would side with each other. 

Looking back, this made me, for the good part, slightly more self-sufficient and a bit more of a ""I'm not taking your shit"" guy, and for the bad part, I felt lonely at my own home, where I would almost always stay in my room, and kind of lost sense of how family should be in the house (regarding emotional aspects).

Okay, now back to the present: 

Yesterday, my friend told me he got more serious about moving out of his mom's house, and asked me if I wanted to tag along, and get our own place in about a month (before July arrives). We thought it was a good idea because: 1) We get along really well, 2) Sharing a small apartment (not too small though, we don't swing that way) would make it very easy to keep up with rent and services, and 3) last but not least, we CAN'T STAND OUR MOTHERS.

As you read before, my mom got out of a toxic relationship, so she's not having a perfect time. She's not as bad as she was before, but since the guy still lives in our building, right in front of us, she gets kind of flustered every once in a while. What bugs me is that she usually takes it out on me, getting angry and lashing out because of stupid things, which is just an outlet. She's never in the house, and when she is, she does do some chores, but mostly just smokes or watches Netflix or TV. We don't go out together, save for groceries, and we don't talk that much.

As it was also stated above, I've been looking forward to moving out of here for a long time (probably shortly after my mom started dating the asshole, because of how they were treating me; I actually have an old post-it note in my wall that says ""Move out ASAP"" with a small drawing of a building and a stickman with wings \[metaphorically, me\] flying out of the building going ""Weeeee!"", for motivation), and this whole attitude's not helping me want to stay.

Thing is, I know my mom's not that bad mentally, but also I don't know if I should actually leave, since I don't know how it would affect her, or just tell my friend I would wait a bit before moving out of my current house and into the new apartment (which I told him might happen, and he was cool with it).

Basically, I can't stand dealing with her, but I'm not sure if I should leave. Any help?",19May2019,2
555,"I have never had a gf or had sex. Im 24 years old and missed out on the college experiences because I kept getting lead on, used for attention or just rejected. I never got to have fun like others did, there wasnt a girl I got to experience anything with like graduation, vacation, birthdays, holidays, etc. I pretty much hate my life because of it, Ill never get to have been with anyone in my prime and its not something that can be made up now or ever, my life is a waste.

I was seeing a girl earlier this year who was great but I could not keep pushing away the doubts I had. I just wasnt fully attracted to her, I feel like having sex would have gone horribly because I dont think I would have been able to perform, and I knew I didnt see us lasting long because that romantic part or the part that makes you want to be with someone wasnt really there for me. She was an amazingly nice and caring person who overlooked many of my flaws but I just new it wasnt what I wanted so I ended it before we got into a relationship or had sex.

Yet I am still thinking about her almost 2 months later and we were seeing each other for 4. It doesnt affect me like other girls have but I still think about how she isnt in my life anymore, we dont talk but we still follow each other on social media. I have to keep reminding myself that I didnt want it unfortunately and it helps me remember how it all was and that she deserves better. It seems she was able to let me go very easily from when we last spoke, which Im glad but I still have these small regrets which I just dont understand. I just know we wouldnt have worked out and I would feel guilty and would want to end it even more every day if I stayed with her.

Im not sure what to feel or think about dating overall now though. I feel lost, I look at girls I want to date but I feel like Im not good enough and it wouldnt work out. I dont even know how to get a date now, Im not using dating apps they suck and I never want to hear about them again. I dont talk to my friends about these thoughts, I dont really think any of them would care or would really know what to say. Im not really sure what Im looking for but I just wanted to ask for advice.

Im keeping myself busy with work, working out, hobbies, everything I can think of but I just feel lost. I dont think its specifically because of her but because of where I am in life in general in regards to dating and how I dont want to be here. I have accepted my life will never be what I want it to be but its all just empty now. Any advice?",19May2019,4
556,"This may not be as interesting as many other posts here, but I really don´t know what to do and I hope someone here has good advice on how to deal with this. (Also I´m sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes I may make as I am non english native)

So, the problem is that I am very clumsy and scatty. I´m often deep in my own thoughts and not paying enough attention to my  surroundings and I am generally very bad with anything motorical. I´m not good at aiming or at putting a plate down without making noise. Almost every day I spill something or leave staines somewhere.

I know that this is very annoying to my bf, who is very sensible when it comes to doing any damage to his furniture (almost all of the furniture in our house is his, as it was his house before I moved in with him). I mean like VERY sensitive. If I would cause a tiny scratch somewhere he would hold it against me for months.
I try to be very careful, but it happens all the time anyway. 

He uses to tell me he knew I would be able to change and that he didn´t expect me to change from one moment to the next but that he would want me to be more careful and to make sure it gets better over time. But I really don´t know if I can do better that I already do. I feel pressured and unsure and I feel like a burden to him. 

There are many questions about this that I would like to ask you guys. Is there anything I can do to beat my clumsyness (I feel like the more I try to do better, the less I archieve)?Has anyone been in a similar situation? Is he in the right to be mad at me? Or is he maybe just a little over the top? How would you react to your SO not noticing many little mistakes made by them? Would you think I may be disrespecting his stuff by damaging it by mistake (He has stated this once)?",19May2019,2

He is always an hour or more late to anything we do, and he usually picks me up. He won’t text me or give me any warning until 10-15 mins before he’s supposed to pick me up telling me he’s going to be way late. And it’s never his fault apparently it’s excuse after excuse about his brother or his mom. I’ve just been dealing with it but it really hurts me because it feels so inconsiderate to me or my time. Just this morning we had planned on meeting at noon. He texted me at 11:50 and said he will pick me up at 1pm. No “sorry” or anything. I had already gotten dressed and ready to leave.

559,"So i had to take a long break away from her family. i needed to sort my health out and my girlfriend understands only slightly about it(We live together) and on her 21st birthday couple days ago, i made the effort and come visit the inlaws, to go their and out that neither her family spoke to me at all. Right, I have aspergers and ADHD, when i take my medication for ADHD my aspergers really strikes and i cannot at all start a conversation at all, and when someone starts a conversation i struggle to carry it on, But i was at the party and i was just sat on my own, my girlfriend was trying her hardest to be around me and her family at the same time, But i told her its her birthday to go and enjoy, But the whole time, none spoken to a word to me.. They probably now think of me ""miserable"" ect.. but my girlfriends brother &amp; sister are supposed to have the same conditions as me, so i don't understand why they didn't understand why i was finding it so hard to communicate. 

I'm struggling to think if me and my girlfriend is going to workout due to her family being the way they are, I don't want to speak to her about it, but its like her family declines my conditions or not even KNOW a thing about aspergers and ADHD(even tho in her family, siblings have the conditons) i'm just literally so confused and i just don't know what to do, its going to be like this all the time and i don't think i can just sit there, watching them give me dirty looks and basically ignore i'm visiting because i can't communicate.",19May2019,1
560,"I [18M] got into a lot of fights with my sister [20F] when we were younger. At a point i realised i didn't want the fights, i just want a good relationship with my sister, but you know how siblings are, fights just happen. Sometimes she'd start them sometimes i would. I eventually came up with this idea that if i just give up mid way through a fight it would all end up fine right? Play it off with a laugh and just let the whole fight go off as just stupidness. This mostly led to fights ending in me giving up and she realising that no matter how much she hits me I'd eventually let her release her anger onto me. It actually worked out fairly well, for the most part. This all continued up untill last year, when we got into a fight, she threw a bottle at me, it hit me in the face and then landed in my hands. At that point i just lost my shit and i was going to throw the bottle right back at her with full intent to destroy her but at the very last moment i got hold of myself and threw it onto the floor instead. Since that day I haven't talked to her. The longest conversations we have had are ""mom's calling for dinner"" or something similar to that. It has been a whole year since i last talked to her. After a month or so of not talking she realised that something was different this time, because I didn't laugh it off, because she didn't get to end it with hitting me a couple of times or mocking me. This time i just gave up on trying to get that better relationship. She did end up being like ""oh you think i give a shit if you don't want to talk to me? I DONT EVEN WANT TO TALK TO YOU."" But that went away after 2 months of silence, then she just realised that she did something that hurt me and i didn't want to forgive her. She did try to get my parents to convince me to resume talking to her again but i always just told them that everything was fine and i would start talking in a while but that was always a lie. Soon enough everyone realised that i was not going to talk to her. Now it has been a whole year, they all tried to persuade me but i was just too hurt to even consider that. But i started this in the first place just to have a better relationship with my sister and only now i realise that all I've done has led to make it worse. I don't know how i justified it to myself that this was the only way.

I want to end all of this now, get back to the way things were, but i dont know how or if i should do that. I hate to admit it but i actually did enjoy this period of time. I dont really have friends, the 2 that i did have i just suddenly stopped talking to months ago. So for the past at least 6 months I've been basically all alone. And i dont regret doing that, i did genuinely like being alone. 

So, i want to be alone but i also want to have my sister and friends back. I have no idea what i should do, so i thought i should ask someone else, but i dont have anyone to ask other than my parents, which would be rather weird, so here i am asking you for help.",19May2019,1

565,"So I work at a pizza place, I’m a teenager (not 18 yet), and I like my job. I do pretty much everything, make $8 per hour (plus tips WHEN I’m phones... more on that later), and it’s a good environment. Except for the manager. 

Since our location opened back in November, a woman (we’ll call her W) has been the “General Manager.” She was not supposed to be General. That job was meant for the Kitchen Manager (W2). However, W steamrolled her out of that position and has pretty much taken over.

This would be fine normally, but W does not know how to manage hours properly. She moves shifts around, she began cutting my hours when I started working so that she could take over TOGO orders and tips (which I what I was initially hired to do), and most importantly, she is just unreliable. My mom (who also works here) usually does Bar or Serving, but a lot of times she ends up filling in for W when she had stuff to do. This would be fine, but this means that W takes good shifts that make a lot of bar money from my mom to compensate for this, and more often than not, my mom is jerked around. This has gotten worse over time, 

Also, she is terrible at hiring people. We started off good with about 12 strong servers and a bunch of kitchen people, but now we’re down to 6 servers and even less kitchen workers (especially the ones who work on Line doing everything except Pizzas). To fix this problem, W tried to hire more people, but all were flaky and eventually quit, meaning the others had to pick up more hours. She also hired a shady person who ended up comping customers’ orders for sexual favors. Then, recently, she hired a new Kitchen Person who is absolutely incompetent and has NO IDEA how to cook. He’s a bit slow mentally, and probably shouldn’t be working in such a fast-paced environment. Not to mention, he is also perverted and has made MANY sexual comments and inappropriate comments to me and a female coworker (also underage). But W insists that he’s a good worker because “she trained him.” Keep in mind, Kitchen Manager W2 Hates him and had absolutely no say so in hiring him. So she’s just terrible with hiring, and people keep leaving because of her. 

Most importantly, W is a rude and manipulative person. She will yell at anyone for anything, even in front of customers. She is constantly finicky with making decisions. She is always mad because when people are schedules for double shifts on weekends (which aren’t busy), they get all prep done and sit around because there’s nothing left to do. The hypocrisy is, she sits around at a table in the corner shoe shopping for HOURS. She is also verbally abusive, having cussed everyone (including me and the 2 other underage kitchen workers) out. She has referred to us as “Fuckers.” She had told me “Fuck you.” And she has told us MANY times to “stay the Fuck away” when she I inevitably decides to take over kitchen (did I mention she likes to micromanage kitchen too?). This should not be said to me or my coworkers who are underage, and this is what bothers me most. I just don’t know what to do.

So basically, she is a terrible manager, doesn’t hire people and drives them away, and is very abusive. I don’t know what to do. My mom won’t do anything about it because W keeps giving her titles like “Second in Command” and “Keyholder” to butter her up. There was a time back in January when my mom was angry at W and tried to tell the owner of the store about it, but that time is gone. Idk what to do now. I can’t fend for myself out of fear I will be fired or persecuted for it by W, and idk who to even go to. I don’t want to leave because this is my 1st job, it’s not corporate run, I have good pay, and I have flexible hours and like my coworkers. I could bring up claims of Harassment of a minor, but would that work in this case? I just need advice on what to do. Please help.

574,"I'm 14, 9th grade and I'm depressed. I mean actually depressed, with a reason for it. I'm in a family with my mother, my father and my sister. My father has bipolar. Type 2 I believe. He was a very nice happy man and still is if you don't live in my house, but has recently stopped taking his pills for it. This has greatly changed him. Just pointing out now, my sister (who is 18) is unaffected by any of this. He leaves her alone. Anyway, he argues with my mother and me every day, (but it's mostly me) about the stupidest things. Money, e.t.c. I argue with him alot more than my mother as I stand my ground and argue back. (I am in no way a bad kid, but when he is clearly wrong I will fight back). It is slowly getting to me. I am depressed because of it and it is affecting my learning. I am very soon starting my GCSEs. I just don't want to do anything. Not even play video games or watch TV or read a book. The only feeling that lasts in the one I get lying in bed on my own. It's the only place where I'm happy and I'm sure it's because of him. I don't even talk to him anymore. I've been going to jiu-jitsu 8 months and I've been loving it, but now I've stopped just because he takes me there and does it the same time. We argue on the way there, one the half hour drive almost every time. It was today I lost it. Yesterday me and my father went camping with my best friend's family and two others we knew. He was horrible the entire time. I was mostly sad because of it. It was on the drive back that I lost it. He was telling me how horrible I am to everyone and I have no respect for him. I exploded. I told him, he treats me and my mother like shit, I'll never respect him again. (I'm never going to respect him again as the Wednesday the week before, he strangled me after he lost his shit when I couldn't fix a cable and was telling me I was saying it on purpose. He still thinks he was perfectly right in doing so.) and I will never love him at all unless he changes some way. I know that really got to him, but he's not changing. He just thinks I'm being horrible again. He never considers being wrong when in an argument with me or my mother. Like he's above us but equal with my sister. (Mind, my sister is a lovely girl. Not stuck up or anything.) I don't know what to do. We aren't talking right now. I'll admit, I just want to get on with him. For ages I was angry at him for the way he acts. Now I'm just sad. I keep asking myself, ""Why does he act like this?"", ""How can I stop him?"", ""Am I really in the wrong here?"". The latter he often tries manipulating me into believing. I just want him gone, or to change or I'll go live with another family member. I don't think suicide is going to happen but it can, if he gets worse. I'm worried he will. He almost beat with a wooden stick the night he strangled me. I was in the corner of the kitchen, but my mother and sister (who were upstairs) stopped him.

575,"So I’m a lesbian myself and recently my sibling (dont wanna specify since it might be an asshole move to them, I don’t wanna out them without their consent (in regards to if they’re ftm or mtf)) has come out. I’m very certain that they aren’t a trender and would like to know from trans folks (and any other if you got any tips!!!) what the best way to support them is?? I’m trying my hardest not to misgender them (they came out yesterday, misgender them once and then apologized profusely) and have been calling them by their new name. As for my parents my mom is trying to understand it (I warned her beforehand even before they came out because they were showing pretty big signs, and I didn’t want them to experience a distraught reaction from my mom) and while she does misgender them (apologized the first day, doesn’t apologize when my dad is around) she wants to go to professionals and loves them unconditionally. She still has some misconceptions though (like how they might’ve been “influenced by media”) but she hasn’t said it to their face only to me personally!!! I’m right now translating some videos of Sam Collins (v good youtuber 10/10) into spanish (mother tongue, not very good at english) so that she can maybe have a better understanding of everything. With her I’m not very worried since she was kinda unknowing with me at first too but she really came around me and hasn’t treated me any differently (same goes with my sibling)!! The problem would be my dad. He doesn’t express his emotions with me f.ex. He knew I was a lesbian for a year and a half but didn’t directly adress it (he was completely ok with it, but still I had to adress it). Now being trans is a whole other level for him. He hasn’t talked about it with my sibling and keeps misgendering them. He seems more strained (f.ex. In the mornings he would greet us but this morning he didn’t greet my sibling, didn’t look their way). I know it’s a process an especially long one for him, but I want to know how to let my sibling know I will always love them and support them (also in hopes that it can “replace” the whole dad thing). For the record they have been out since yesterday and my mom has already bought something to ease their dysphoria. 

I would also like to know how to make the school environment safer for them. They’re only 13 (they’ve noticed since they were 11 but ofc had an internalized process of acceptance). Currently we live in Germany in arather small city which has 2 supportive teachers but no lgbtq+ program or anything of that sort.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been raised Muslim, and I currently am a Muslim. However, I've run into a small problem.

I personally believe if there is a benevolent God, he'd be open to sending signs to guide you to his path. So a while back, I asked him for a sign for if Muhammad was his messenger, and I got one that was fairly obvious almost immediately.

(when I ask for a sign, I also ask that if i'm being misguided, that I be pointed in the right direction)

Recently however, I've found that I'm starting to be skeptical of my religion. This has affected my worship in a significant way, so I tried the method again, and gotten a lot of mixed results, nothing conclusive. It's been two days now.

I'm confused as to what to think if I don't get one soon.

On one hand, maybe God/universal guiding force sent me a sign in the beginning because I would have gone down a worse path if I hadn't received one, so he kept me in blissful ignorance because it was the better of the two options. On the other, maybe I only get one, and it's wrong to ask for another. On the other other, maybe it was just an accident in the first place?

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this isn't the subreddit for this, and I'm sorry if it isn't.

580,"A long time ago (10-15 years ago) I went to college for a while and I fucked up. I lost my scholarship, grant, and financial aid (though I am able to say I never fucked up by getting a loan). It is my fault, no way around it. Now, try as I might to return I just have no way of affording trying again on my own. Then much as I've tried getting a job in recent months, I have nothing.

I am going this Thursday to register, in hopes that come day to pay for this upcoming semester my family will be able to pay for it. But I can't expect anything and the only thing I can think of is trying my hands at GoFundMe in hopes of people feeling pity. Otherwise, I feel like I'm just continuing down a spiral.",19May2019,1
581,"I posted about this a while ago, you can find the full thing on my last post, since this is a throwaway with only 3.
TL:DR from last time,my girlfriend broke up with me for ""religious reasons"", less than a week later she's going out with my best mate who I was suspicious of beforehand

Since that post, there's only been a few events for backstory
1: I found out she did actually cheat on me, though she insists that he initiated everything and she didn't want it
2: taking some advice from the replies, I took a while to break away from her. We started to get back on better terms, and were what I considered to be friends

Since then, we've become closer again. She's begun confiding in me, saying she feels alone with her mates and she isn't happy with her new bf. The real bombshell came when she said she'd been *exually assaulted by him. As I've stated before, she's a very religious girl, and didn't want to do anything physical with me past kissing. She said that he's done it a few times, and has been an all around shitty bf. Over Easter, she said she'd finally had enough and broken up with him, and once that happened she started to flirt with me again, lean in for cuddles and kiss my cheek on occasion. The only problem is, about a week ago I saw them going out into town and being just as coupley as in the past. When I questioned her about this, she admitted that she lied about breaking up with him, and only flirted with me because she was afraid I'd leave. She doesn't want me as a bf anymore, but knows I still have feelings for her. She also admitted various acts she claimed he'd done were also made up to buy my sympathy and prevent me from leaving. She adamantly denies that she lied about the *exual assault.

I've become practically her only support point. Any time I try to tell her to get help from outside sources, or set up contacts with outside support groups she breaks down and says I don't care or want to help her. I'm terrified that if I leave and she's telling the truth, then she's lost her only support point and is stuck in an abusive relationship. But at the same time, the lies that she's told and the fact that she's still capable of manipulating me so callously has taken a toll on my mental health. Ive already been taken to some dark places because of this, and I can feel myself beginning to slip into the same mental state I was in immediately after the break up. It's seriously impacting my trust in everyone in my life.

I know there isn't an easy solution, but I'm looking for any kind of advice. I've searched all over the internet, but websites are impersonal and haven't given any advice that's worked, and since my last post on Reddit got me some advice that helped this might be worth a shot again.

However, I feel kinda lost on where I stand in the family. I feel as if I can't do anything right. For example if I fold some sheets and put them up if they are not the way my stepmom likes them she takes them out gets grumpy and complains about how I did them wrong and refold them. On the other side If I don't fold them then she complains how I don't help clean stuff up. My Stepbrother does nothing to help and he never gets in trouble for it the way I do.

584,"I posted this somewhere else but I want to hear from more people.
Sorry for the long post..

I(20) ended an abusive relationship. A friend, I'll call him Q, helped me get out. To be honest I had feelings for Q during the last month I dated the ex. Q was kind, thoughtful and helped me during a difficult time. I felt terrible, as this is mentally cheating. A week after the breakup, Q confessed his feelings to me. I was a bit hesitant to get in another relationship so soon, but we started dating. I thought I could finally be happy in a normal, healthy relationship.

But I am miserable. We recently had a fight. I was supposed to stay at his place after a date, but his drunk friends asked for a place to stay and I went back home alone. He didn't apologize. The next morning, he did something that upset me again, something minor but I felt so sad. He wanted to talk to me but I couldn't say anything, doubting myself and wondering if I was just being needy and stupid, if it was nothing to get upset about. He got mad I wasn't talking and went out to drink with his friends and then went to his hometown. The whole time he didn't talk to me and I felt so anxious and sad. I kept getting thoughts that he didn't care about me, that he didn't like me anymore. I got a sad feeling that he wouldn't be the one to ever text first.

I finally sent him an apology message and we made up. We were supposed to go on a date when he got back and I went to the station to surprise him. It turns out he has to help a friend hold an event. I was upset again but didn't say anything. He says he can be a little late, and we go to his place.

On the taxi ride, he asks if I heard anything from my ex and to see my phone. I feel like crying and my heart started beating so fast. My ex always checked my phone. Q was probably just worried about me but I get this feeling that he didn't trust me and was suspicious.

We get to his place. We cuddle but the whole time I feel like crying. He wanted to have sex. Sex was the last thing I wanted that moment but I went through with it. He left soon after we were done. I felt miserable and went home alone, again. I couldn't help but feel he just wanted the sex.

I can't trust Q anymore. I get this unreasonable feeling, maybe not unreasonable, that he doesn't love me and doesn't care about me and my feelings, I don't even know now. I don't know what is okay and what to get mad about. I am scared of Q, and scared that he will use me or hurt me. I felt like crying the whole time I was with him. I feel like he doesn't trust me. After all, why should he? I mentally cheated on my ex and he knows that.

Q is kind and tells me he loves me and buys me flowers and I used to feel loved and I loved him too, but suddenly I don't know what happened.

My friend tells me Q is better than my ex, but that doesn't mean he is good either.

I don't know what to think anymore. Am I being paranoid? Is Q not a good boyfriend? Is what he doing okay and I am just being needy? I know my mental health is in a bad state right now. Should I trust Q and talk to Q about my feelings? I want to cry.",19May2019,1

I'm 15(M) and the person who I thought was my best and closest friend (15, female). Actually isn't. I figured out a couple of days that she's been abusing me. Physically and verbally, for the last two years. It didn't start that way. It was a normal friendship. But about 4 months, when we really knew each other that's when everything changed. She started insulting me. I thought of it as little jabs that were jokes. I didn't think of it as anything bad. And it was every so often. Then a few months after that, that's when the physical stuff started. She started slapping me and punching me and kicking me along with the insults. At that point, I tried to leave, which I did for a week. I didn't see it as abuse. Then I came back. Then the cycle started all over again. But gradually got worse. The verbal and physical stuff happened more often. She started publicly humiliating me (before it was in one-on-one conversations). Then the physical and verbal violence happened almost every single day. Publically in classes, and lunch. I've started talking to her less recently. But the damage has been done I think. I almost never talk at my lunch table now (she sits at the same table), I have depressive episodes (I almost never have depressive episodes). I can't think straight because I'm thinking at this point ""what am I gonna do"",  ""what is she going to do to me"", ""what have I done to her"", and ""how can I get it to stop"". I don't know what to do at this point. She's made everyone at my lunch table turn on me, and she acts like this to nobody else, so it isn't something that she does normally.  I feel like if I tell (principle or someone else), she'll do it even more and it'll get worse. I just feel like I'm stuck with what I can do.

592,"Yesterday, I learned that my Grandfather passed away.
We weren't very close, but we liked each other. I only got to see him a couple of times a year, and I kinda regret not talking more to him.
The funeral will be held at the end of the week, and it's abroad so going would mean missing three days of school (the last tests of the school year are tomorrow though, so I wouldn't miss anything overly important). My parents aren't sure if I should go, and I'm not either: the thing is, I wasn't even sad, or surprised (just have even more trouble concentrating than usual) when they told me the bad news. I knew it was coming, he's been very sick since last year. Still, I feel a bit guilty about that.
I would like to go tho, because last time I saw I was hoping to see him at least once more, and I feel like if I miss the funeral, it'll be as if I missed some step, missed the occasion for a last goodbye. There's another reason too, but it feels super wrong, and I feel guilty about it too. I've been feeling terrible lately (may be why I didn't feel sad), exams are coming in June, and I feel like if I don't take a little break my family will soon have to deal with another loss.

593,"I will try my best to keep this to cliff notes. I also only have one day to make this decision because I have to go to work tomorrow, so spelling may be lacking.

I've worked for this company for some time. I built my way up from a seat along the wall, to a cubical, to an office (from a temp, to document specialist, to Sr. on site service specialist). I did this by making sacrifices and having good attention to detail. My next promotion would be technical specialist which I have been training for since November. 

Back in November, I had been the head of my old department. But with my technical backround, the plan was for me to train this girl to do my job while I went on maturity leave. When I came back, I would be working strictly with softwear. 

This all came to fruition. My boss had printed out a promotion path for me to check off before getting this 12% raise to become the technical specialist. I got about half way through cross training when my boss started giving me mindless work ( work a temp would do). The whole time I thought is was temporary because of the lack of workers vs jobs coming in. Then I come to find out that he wants me to take full responsibility for these busy work jobs. 

I stated my worry that with my other responsibilities, I did not have time to take on these other mindless duties full time. My boss started to get defensive.ni believe it was because he knew what he was doing to me.

Ever since the girl I trained got a supervisor position, my boss started treating me differently. He talks down to me, and sends me very passive egressive emails. He stopped caring, and he started to say I lacked focus, and when I would try to defend myself, he would cutt me off, saying ""no, no I don't want to hear excuses"" . He was convinced that I should have the time to juggle all of these things if I better managed my time. I convinced myself that he was right and worked just about 24 7 every day. Anything, to get my promotion my boss had promised me. And that is exactly what I did. And I never made a mistake.

Last week Thursday I was called into my bosses office and was told that he had gotten an email back in November saying that the position I had been working towards this whole time no longer exists. So I had been working towards a non position. 

There are lots of other positions available that I could strive for, but because my boss is convinced I can't focus (even though that is exactly what got me where I am today) he won't put me up for anything. He is making me move back to a baby cubicle (Wich isn't even a cubical it's a small desk along a wall) and I have to now work for the supervisor that I trained in the first place. I asked him what position I am striving for, he couldn't give me an answer. He is completely dismissive and careless of his actions. He didn't even apologize for putting me in a position where I am working towards a promotion that didn't exist.

I am very fragile and easily stepped on. And my boss knows this. I offered other better positions, but he denied them to me. And the only reason he is doing this is because he needs more people to do the busy work. But given my knowledge and experience, it is an insult from all directions. 

The way I see it, I have a few options:

Give 2 weeks notice and start job searching. (I'd rather not loose income for any mount of time. I have two children)

Keep working and bite the bullet and say nothing.

Write a formal letter to my bosses boss about my miss treatment and hope he can help. (He is not in the building but maybe once a month, so he does not see the day to day. I can see him taking the bosses side. But, he also knows that this new supervisor is the worst.)

Call HR and make a complaint (I don't know if this makes things worse or better).

If I have any other available options, please enlighten me. OR tell me what you would do and why.

594,"Hi so I’ve never actually posted before so bear with this shitshow

I work in an opticians but that’s not really important. My best friend at work just left to work in the busiest branch in city centre and I’m not sure if I should go to. 
You might think I’m following her which I probably am in a way but her moving got me to thinking about a lot. I will list the pros and cons of my current workplace and the pros and cons of the possible other workplace and please help me come to a decision because it’s getting too much. 

Pros of current workplace:

I am comfortable here and get on with everyone. 
I feel secure in my job here and appreciated. 
I work 2 days a week (sat and sun) and have potential to work a little bit of overtime (not got any for June/July however) in 4 month summer out of uni teaching and exam period. 
I could go down to 1 day a week probably in October for my busy uni schedule next year(5days uni). 
Have a free huge car park for whenever I start driving, hopefully this summer (And is max 10 mins drive from my house). 

Cons:

I get paid £2/hr less than I’d get paid in the other place (and I’m a student so every penny counts lol). 
It’s still very quiet and not busy although it’s 7 months  since it’s been opened. 
I don’t have a proper laugh with anyone really anymore it’s boring, my day drags and I don’t have very much fun anymore. 
Difficult to get to right now as I can’t drive and have to take 2 buses which are quite unreliable. 

Pros of possible other workplace:

£2/hr more. 
Very busy in city centre. 
Lots of fun. 
I THRIVE in a busy environment. 
Easier for me to get to- straight bus up that comes regularly but takes 50mins. 

Cons:

HAVE to work 2 days a week no leeway (apart from holidays but don’t get many). 
I have holidays booked in my current place of work for July but I’m not guaranteed these at my next place. 
Nowhere to park if I start driving but I can still get the bus(should be happy about helping the environment though right).",19May2019,1

Last summer she invited me to the beach but then i found out i was her last option as her other friends cancelled, now this made me feel really bad but at least she thought of me. Now this year she is in my class and surprisingly we didnt become closer at all. This past month we barely have spoken she even removed me from her instagram close friends ( i know this because she basically posts something everyday and now suddenly no more posts). The thing that hurts the most is that i get a feeling that she doesnt really care about our friendship at all. I also get this feeling that she is embarassed to hang out with me and just had me as a ""backup friend"".

597," 

So, I don't know how long this story is but any advice is much appreciated.

I have this coworker who got fired last Monday. To me and everyone else it seemed pretty out of the blue, and both the employees and the clients of our workplace seemed pretty devastated. She comes off as a very kind, caring, warm person. She's an older woman and everyone somewhat sees her as their work mom. Anyways, management was slightly suspicious when they fired her. My GM did not include the AGM when firing her as they are ""friends outside of work."" That made it all the more upsetting.

I texted the coworker as soon as I found out, as many people know that her and I speak over text quite often and assumed I just knew. She told me that it was an out of the blue firing and manager has been out to get her for a while. Anyways, fast-forward to about mid-week on Wednesday or Thursday, she called me and explained to me that she's fighting her termination, she doesn't necessarily want the job back but wants to make sure this doesn't want this to happen to others. She asked me to write a letter on her behalf to the regional manager basically stating that she didn't deserved to be fired, I was told it would remain confidential and that I just have to state how I feel.

Basically long story short, I sent the letter, I only wrote kind things about my manager as I decided to keep it 100% honest and I love my manager. I had my sister help my friend with her resume and offer advice and my friend had the audacity of trying to offer my sister cash for a resume which I found highly inappropriate. (It was inappropriate to me as my sister had already offered her resources and she hadn't even looked at them. It was a response that came less than 2 mins later. Also my sister wouldnt have charged her, as that's my friend and it's not my sisters job.) Then I thought about it and wondered if she only sweet talks people so that she may manipulate and freeload off of them. I had a bad feeling when I sent this letter even after the regional manager assured me it would be confidential. I realized even the couple times I've worked with this woman she has been lazy and I would do all the work and she just stands and texts. She also calls in sick and needs her shifts covered often enough that it can be problematic. My manager is often complimented on our workplace by upper management, especially in regards to the quality of staff, so maybe my manager wasn't so unreasonable, and I acted impulsively.

Although my letter may not make a HUGE difference, it's still there and someone knows I wrote it. How bad would it look if I emailed the Regional Manager asking to take back my feedback letter, and how should I word it? I just don't feel at ease having my name attached to this AT ALL, in any way shape or form. Do you think when the situation goes away cause I doubt she'd win, to be honest, will the letter go away too?

599,"Sorry for the format, I’m on my mobile. 

Not really sure where to start, so I’ll go back in time and describe my childhood. I’m 23 now. 

I don’t know my dad, never met him. He wasn’t present at my birth. From what I know about him, he was an ass who abused my sisters and my mother. He was fine with my brothers. We managed to escape my dad just after I was born, my mother said she did not want to risk a young baby getting hurt. I’ll also mention, my mother is AMAZING. She hasn’t been the greatest mother, but her whole life has been filled with trauma and to this day she is still someone who lives by “never look back”. I’m not quite sure if she’s dealt with her own traumas, hence why she hasn’t been the greatest mother, but she did everything she could for us. Her parents died shortly after her birth, she has lots of brothers and sisters, but I haven’t met any. My sisters and brothers have all met their aunties and uncles at one point. I feel like I missed out, but it’s not something I think about often. 

My mother met my step dad, who is also amazing. He’s done a fantastic job raising us all. Which is a pretty hard job stepping into 7 kids lives when they’re at various ages. My mother makes jokes about how when she first met him and years later I would “always try to get in the middle of them, and I did not like to see them close to each other”. I’ve never known what that’s about. I’m completely fine with it now, but she says I was like that until I was around 15. 

I was bullied a lot as a child, so my mother never really let me out the house unless I was with a brother. I don’t think the bullying is something I ever think about anymore. It stopped when I turned 13. 

One brother in particular was pretty horrible to me and I was pretty horrible to him. He’s older and way stronger, to sum it up he used to beat the shit out of me. Even when I turned 19 he was still trying to beat the shit out of me. I learned to defend myself, but my mother would ALWAYS side with him. Which resulted in me becoming very resentful towards him. We’re on a better track now, but he’s jobless, lazy and just pretty much a scumbag so I try not to associate myself with him. 

My sisters have always had toxic relationships. But I was always too young at the time to understand how toxic it truly was. One memory that has always stayed with me is when my sister and her boyfriend came home drunk at like 1am. We were pretty poor growing up until my step dad started making more money, so we shared rooms. I shared a room with this sister, and when she came home she kicked me out and I went to the sleep on one of my brothers floors. He was fast asleep and I heard a lot of banging coming from the room. I assumed my sister was having sex, as any child would and I tried to sleep. Turns out, they were actually fighting and I’m pretty sure I heard him pin her against the wall and beat her, I know I heard her crying and asking him to stop. I know it wasn’t sex. Obviously I was a kid, so I began to scream and it stopped. My mother came to see me and I explained what I had heard and she went to see my sister who said everything was ok, she said it was an argument and that was it. My mother told me I was having nightmares. I’ve never mentioned this to anyone ever since. 

I’m very protective over my older sisters, as I’m the youngest one. They faced a lot more than I did in childhood. But fast forward to teenage years. My mother made me get a job very early IMO. Younger than any of my siblings (some of them don’t even have jobs now because they don’t want to). My mother became VERY strict as we got older. She said if I didn’t get a job and earn money, I’d be kicked out. I was 16. Which is fine, I did this. But I feel like I got forced out of childhood very quickly. A lot more happened in my childhood that I’d prefer not to bring up, but I feel like getting forced out of childhood so early meant I didn’t have time to make these fun memories, fun experiences and stuff that would’ve helped me forget about that stuff. 

We’ll fast forward to now. I have a great job. Own house. Great partner. Lovely puppy. But I’m not happy, and I’m not sure why. When I first met my partner, I was confident, fun, happy, all the good stuff. Ever since she moved in and got a new job and stuff, I’ve become really insecure and occasionally jealous of some of the people she talks about. This is not me. I’m not that type of person. But I don’t feel like enough. I got to bed every night with bad butterflies in my stomach, having immense panic attacks. We don’t know what to do. She told me a few weeks ago that I should see a therapist about my excessive cleaning. Now, I don’t think it’s excessive. Admittedly, I do have a bit of an “obsession” with hygiene. But I just ENJOY cleaning. I’m working on the hygiene side of it. 

My partner also said I should see a therapist and talk about my childhood, how my mother raised me, what happened when I was a teenager. All these things that I’ve never really saw as a big issue. It has upset me at points throughout my life, but I never thought I should see a therapist. I feel like I’d be wasting somebody else’s valuable time. My partner says she thinks something is stuck within me that I’m not remembering or talking about. I do feel like I need some help, but has anyone else been in this position? What did you do?

TL;DR: my childhood was fucked, my teenage years were fucked, now I’m fucking up my relationship and my partner is insisting there is something I’m not remembering or talking about. What do I do?",19May2019,1
600,"I woke up to this message this morning and I'm not sure how to proceed and how seriously it will be taken if I report it to the police. From how it sounds, he may do this to other people too, but I have no idea where he got my number, and if maybe I met him once, or if he saw me somewhere and somehow got my number. Here's the message: 

Hi Mary Elizabeth
You are beautiful talented and I’m interested in connecting with you. It has taken me 35 years to get over body shame resulting from being sexually violated at 9 years old at exclusive boys camp outside Dallas Texas. I’m not circumcised and the other boys let me know in ways that made me ashamed. In reality now and after toning up after my divorce 8 years ago, I’m very endowed but I have always wanted (albeit terrified), to strip down to my undies or naked and be sketched. I think I’m ready and if you will do this for me Mary , I will offer you a reward both financially and otherwise that I stand strong you’ve never experienced primarily because most guys your age expect you to spoil their needs first. You see in Texas , a man always celebrates the Goddess feminine women first because of several reasons. The cliff notes version is that when a guy orgasms , the Mount Everest amount of GABA released in our brains makes the pillow way more attractive then your spread eagle shaved pussy that is only going to orgasm if you have a VIP private party with your vibrator. 



I always celebrate a great woman like you first because after gently lying you back , slipping your panties off with my teeth , spread eagle your luscious legs , and then with my warm mouth tongue mouth and lips celebrate your shaved magic kingdom until you orgasm so intensely that your legs sway back and forth like buildings sway after an earthquake. I love love love going down. After a woman orgasms , you could care less if there is even a pillow in the house given the norepinephrine and dopamine generating and pulsating through your pussy. It’s not that I’ve had a ton of partners ; it’s that I knew I had culpability in not understanding women in my first marriage and so rather then pointing fingers and blaming , I looked In the mirror and asked what did I do wrong ? 



It gives me a emotional vicarious pleasure to go down on a wonderful awesome woman so well that her Metallic loud OMG’s may draw noise ordinance violations. Ha. If we meet and connect and you choose to experience what I doubt you’ve ever experienced before , you may need to get a line of credit in place from your bank to cover such noise ordinance fines Marylicious. I don’t drink. Don’t smoke.  No drugs. Never any disease. Not a bar guy. I am a good guy from Texas living in San Francisco. 



These are my thoughts on why I like going down on a woman I respect and admire.

Not only is oral sex a pleasurable experience for a female, but it makes her feel more comfortable before sex, can help make penetration less painful and give her multiple orgasms before actual intercourse takes place. Oral sex is as important to women as it is to men, and not only due to the pleasure aspect.

 

When you give your girl oral sex, you give her a sense of security, confidence and relaxation. You give her a sense of worship and the idea that you care about the way she feels and that you want to please her, not just you. And most importantly, you're showing her that you love and want her so much that you're not disgusted by her genitalia because you're comfortable around her.

 

Agree not. ? Lol Can I make the presumption that me going down on you won't send you into deep depression? One last comment on oral sex. Hair tickles my nose so if you shave your pussy I have no distractions and I can just focus on giving you San Andreas fault felt orgasms. Finally. I love just normal fitting panties on a woman not thongs.

 

When I say I can't wait to go down I mean go down on your mind. Soft suck on your thoughts as I slide my warm tongue into the wetness of your intellect as I circle the clit of your emotions before I tongue fuck your shaved spread eagle magic kingdom sloooooooooo and deeeeeeeep as I suck on the nib of your clit blow job Texas style (uppppp and doooown, uppppp and doooown, until I give you a mindgasm that feels like a warm gentle earthquake moving throughout every nerve in your body causing your beautiful spread eagle legs to shake uncontrollably like buildings move uncontrollably during an earthquake.

 

The question is are you really woman enough to handle the aforementioned Texas loving ?

 

I will always spoil you first and take care of your orgasm. Here's why. When a guy has an orgasm,massive amounts of GABA and Serotonin are released in his brain. Those are sleepy brain chemicals. That's why the pillow becomes more attractive then your pussy. The opposite medical effect occurs when a woman orgasms.

 

Massive Mount Everest amounts of dopamine and norepinephrine are released in your brain. When you orgasm , you don't give a shit if their is a pillow for you on the planet. You become energizer bunny. Those are brain stimulants. You want to start working on orgasm 2 , 3 , 10, etc.

 

So unless a man is narcissistic or just oblivious to basic science , a guy should always take care of his honey first.

 

Granted , it may seem nice but surreal for you at first. That's ok. Your orgasm is all about you. It's not about me.

 

When I celebrate you this way and eventually get you to realize how awesome you are as a smart lovable adorable woman, so that you're thanking God in your prayers he made you woman, I never ever have to worry about another man taking you away cause less then 1% think like me.

603,"My niece has terrible parents, they take away her toys and either hide them or just throw them away. Her mother has thrown her toys out of the window and into the bin before because she was ‘naughty’.  

They have cut plugs off TVs, they have broken electronics like tablets and game consoles as punishments. She’s been told that she’s not getting a birthday party this year because she’s been naughty. 

If I buy her craft kits they will just put them in the bin because they can’t be bothered to help her do them. 

Last year I bought her a hamster (with permission) I got it loads of accessories and a ball, and its cage is just put on top of the fridge, out of the way, and then her parents complain that “she doesn’t bother with the hamster.”

I got her a bike when she was 6, and it got left in the garden to rust. 

Last Christmas I commissioned my neighbour to make wooden rocking chairs with their names carved into them for her and her brother. Their parents shoved them in a wardrobe and wouldn’t let them be used. 

Her younger brother is the favourite child who is never disciplined. 

I don’t want to get her clothes, I want to get her something she’ll enjoy, but something that can’t be taken away from her. If I got her sweets they’d make her share them with her brother, they would not let me take her for a day out without her brother either. (She’s 10, he’s 4.) but they won’t let me take them out on my own because “I cant handle them alone” - I can - but any day out I end up having to pay for the kids and their parents because they never have any money. 

They spend their money on fags over food, because they know the family won’t see the kids go hungry. 

They are awful people but because they are fed and clothed, social services won’t do anything.

I was 18 (now 20) and had to leave for Italy for medschool (in English) and now I live here alone. 

Been that way for almost 2 years now.

Barely ANYBODY speaks english where I live outside my friends from university as they're all in the same situation as me and I've come to find that Italians get very impatient when they're trying to communicate but going nowhere.

 I've learned a bit of Italian here and there but at the end of the day, I'm a medstudent and I can barely find time to breathe, let alone learn a whole new language. 

My friends in university are from all over the world as it is an international course. They are amazing and we hang out a lot but again... At the end of the day... We're medstudents and we're always busy as hell.

I love medicine but there's no denying it's very very tough, stressful and overwhelming. I'm always stressing about my exams. 

Sometimes due to the nature of my studies and the way the timetable works and how different the exam formats are, I can go on for weeks barely making human contact studying my ass off at home. 

Coming back to my friends, I love them and everything but I never feel attached because at the back of my mind I know that as soon as we get our degree (four years from now) , every person will travel back to their own country and even if we stay in contact, It will never be the same or ""real"". We've talked about it before and they all say to me and each other that ""of course we'll be friends forever and we'll visit each other etc etc"". But we all know the truth. 

When I'm with them, I feel very happy. We play soccer, make big dinners, hang out, stay over, go to parties etc.... 

but as soon as they're gone I get this overwhelming feeling of sadness that comes over me. When Im alome in this silent apartment at night, I feel so alone and sad. 

I feel isolated in a country where I:

-can't even understand what the people on the street are saying

-hang out with friends that are temporary

-miss my family and old friends that too are now in different countries that I will barely ever visit.

-even in the future when I move to the US, I'll have to build a whole new circle.

-And to top it all off, the stress from studying is colossal.

613,"Me, a friend and my bestfriend had a  few drinks at my bestfriends sisters house on Friday. 

We’re all having a good time, it’s like 1AM when their brother calls and asks if we want to have some drinks at his place. We all go and party ‘til about 5. They were doing coke in the bathroom at the brothers house and decided they need more. I don't do drugs and I was trashed and beat from work so I passed out on the bedroom floor. Last thing I heard before I closed my eyes was their dealer come through the door.

I get woken up a few hours later by them being super loud but I pretend to still be passed out when I hear the four of them talking about possibly having a foursome. It dawns on me that this dealer doesn’t want money for his cocaine, he wants pussy. Now, my bestfriend and our other friend are 19, 19 and 21 while the sister is 26 and the dealer is around the sisters age, probably older.

I was stunned, I thought I knew my bestfriend. She struggled with finding a good guy in the past until she met the guy she is with now who couldn’t come out for drinks this night because he was staying in Toronto.

I became good friends with this guy so when I heard this all going on I reached for my phone and started recording them talking. I knew if im going to tell him, I’m going to need proof and in 2019, we all have cell phones. They have no idea awake right now recording (which I did feel like a snake for doing but I was still half cut) the audio is pretty quiet as I had my hands under the pillow so they couldn’t see my phone but I was able to pick up them making out and feeling eachother talking about having sex. After about of hour laying there I had had enough and got up and went to the living and slept on the couch. I believe only the sister ended up sleeping with the dealer as my other two friends we in the living room when I woke up.


The reason I made this post is because I haven’t told anyone yet and it’s killing me. I want to tell him but on the ride back home she began feeling extremely sick and had to go to the hospital (she’s okay now but I saw how much he was worried and cared for her so I couldn’t do it then) plus her birthday is coming upc they’re going to a rave and I don’t want to ruin it.

April 2018 my best friend and i had a huge fight over something minuscule and she ended our friendship. Her birthday was a few weeks after our fight and i had texted her happy birthday and we had a good conversation that went back and fourth for only a few texts and I told her my cat died (that morning on her bday) and she of course said she was sorry and sad (she loved my cat v much).
Then a week later my birthday passed and she texted me happy birthday and we texted 1 or 2 texts back and fourth and that was that. Everything went smoothly and I thought maybe she wasn’t as mad anymore and things could be fixed. 
So I had texted her about a week later about a new song that came out by our shared favorite band and she replied and then I replied and then she never replied after that. 
I then texted her about 2-3 weeks after that a photo of her and my cat that I found (since my cat died and she loved my cat) and she never responded, and that was that. I haven’t heard from her since June 2018 and she still has me blocked on all social media. 
Her birthday is this week and I’m low key freaking out on whether it would be okay to text her happy birthday. I’m scared of the fact that she might have blocked my number, or she may have changed her number, or she deleted my number and we have to go through the awkward “who’s this” “hahaha it me whaduup” 
It would be so much easier just to *tweet* her but she still has me blocked so like texting is my only option. 

This sounds like such a ridiculous problem and some of you will just say “just fkn text her who cares” but I can’t help of think if I do text her she might get upset and if I don’t she might get upset, i have no way of knowing how she feels about me because we don’t have any mutual friends and she has me blocked on social media still.

My friends in university are from all over the world as it is an international course. They are amazing and we hang out a lot but again... At the end of the day... We're medstudents and we're always busy as hell.

I love medicine but there's no denying it's very very tough, stressful and overwhelming. I'm always stressing about my exams. 

Sometimes due to the nature of my studies and the way the timetable works and how different the exam formats are, I can go on for weeks barely making human contact studying my ass off at home. 

Coming back to my friends, I love them and everything but I never feel attached because at the back of my mind I know that as soon as we get our degree (four years from now) , every person will travel back to their own country and even if we stay in contact, It will never be the same or ""real"". We've talked about it before and they all say to me and each other that ""of course we'll be friends forever and we'll visit each other etc etc"". But we all know the truth. 

When I'm with them, I feel very happy. We play soccer, make big dinners, hang out, stay over, go to parties etc.... 

but as soon as they're gone I get this overwhelming feeling of sadness that comes over me. When Im alome in this silent apartment at night, I feel so alone and sad. 

I feel isolated in a country where I:

-can't even understand what the people on the street are saying

-hang out with friends that are temporary

-miss my family and old friends that too are now in different countries that I will barely ever visit.

-even in the future when I move to the US, I'll have to build a whole new circle.

-And to top it all off, the stress from studying is colossal.

630,"Recently I made a rather unwise decision to just not do an English project which counts for a large portion of my overall grade. I am at the point where I can no longer request any more extensions. This is the third trimester of this year, and in English I have maintained a B average for the entirety of the year. In other classes I have maintained all A's and B's, and am a fairly good student. If my calculations are correct, if my grade for each trimester in English, assuming this one will end up as an F, is averaged, I will end up with an F average for this year. What consequences does this entail?

I am in 8th grade, and have already been accepted into an honors class for this subject next year. To my knowledge, my school doesn't have a summer school program and does not hold kids back. However, this situation will still worry me to no end, even if it probably shouldn't. I live in a fairly liberal state, meaning the school is more laid back in its policies, but there must be some regulation as to what grade a student needs to move on.

Im 27 years old and live in Sweden, I have been depressed for as long as I can remember, bipolar and never got any meds for it.
I have tried to take my life a few times but it finally seemed to get better! About 2 years ago I met a girl and fell in love, she lived about 2hours away from me in a small town, and I had my apartment in Stockholm, about half a year went by and I kinda disided I needed to get closer to where she lives.. I sold my apartment, quit my job and went to live with her, just a few months later we started to look for a home together, I made quite a lot of money from selling my apartment and houses where she is from are very cheap, we finally found a place december 2018 and bought it right away! There were a few suprices and cost me a bit more then I tought, and now it feels like life is finally getting back to me, I live in a new town, I know nobody and I have no job and my money are soon gone.. I have no clue what to do? Im ofcorse searching for Jobs but with no luck this far..

635,"I went to 2 different major U.S. car rental companies and they both denied my a car rental. Neither could find my credit rating, even though I'm a natural born U.S. citizen. I offered to make a deposit with my debit card matching the entire value of the vehicle I was going to rent, and they both said they couldn't do that. It feels like I've been so good at my finances that it's impossible for me to rent a car due to the arbitrary rules the rental companies have come up with related to having to be in debt. I have never owned a credit card, taken out a loan (other than margin trading on my brokerage account), or been in debt for any amount of time. I pay no utilities; they are included in my rent.
So I just applied for a credit card with a certain publicly traded bank, and they denied me because I have no credit history.
How can I ever rent a car? I imagine any credit card I might be able to obtain would have a low limit on it (~$1000), which is way less than the value of any vehicle I would rent. Could the rental car companies be able to figure out that the limit is low and then possibly keep denying me a rental? Why will they take a credit card but not a cash deposit up front? Are these just arbitrary rules they've come up with or am I missing something?",19May2019,1
636,"My daughter was very healthy. We introduce her to soccer when she was 7. We thought “maybe she likes it “, and she did. And for the past 7 years she like it. She was part of a soccer team and she was very good. We also watch what she eat, being sure she didn’t eat junk food.

But a month ago we saw that she was gaining weight. We thought it was puberty and we ignore it. But it never stop. We also saw how she had started eating more. And in top of that she said she didn’t want to continue in the soccer team.
Me and my wife were shocked. Our sporty girl had gain weight and became lazy. We told her that she needed to lose weight and that she needed to do exercise. She yell at us, saying that she never liked soccer.

We decided to restring her what she could and how much but it didn’t work. She stop doing soccer ( she would literally do nothing ). We restring her food but we think that she is eating junk food in school. After we learn that she was eating pizza and burgers in her friends house ( even when we told her not ) we prohibit her to go to their houses.

638,"That sounds terrible to say I know, that I am frustrated with the support because so many people with mental health problems lack a support system. I am diagnosed bipolar, and my family is extremely supportive of everything. The problem is that everyone thinks that is it just about the food and just about the way I look. I lied to myself for so long saying that I just was too busy to sit down for a meal and just made excuses for everything. I was in denial, and now that I am not my support system is worried that I am now just starting to believe these things because they are said to me over and over. That's not the case. I knew this was a problem for the past year and a half, but I am recognizing it now. The wake up call was 2 days ago when my blood work came back and I am dangerously close to my organs shutting down. My electrolytes are completely off. I now have hand tremors because my muscle is using itself for energy and wasting itself away. That also means the fat protecting my nerves has diminished as well. My heart murmur has gotten significant because of the muscle I lost on my heart. The thing is, I'm a bio and psych major, I know all this and yet I still did it. It is really hard to explain why I did it to everyone because I know why but I also don't know why. My self-esteem is terrible. I have never looked at myself and thought ""I'm pretty"" I've never thought of myself as a fun person, or intelligent, or likable. It's too hard to say those things out loud to the people closest to me so I just say ""I don't know why"". Everyone watching what I eat and how much is stressful, but I can't blame them, I would do the same if it was someone I loved and cared about.

Cons
- My manager has a horrible track record with people she has an instant disliking to and has treated a lot of coworkers (present and former) poorly, while putting others on a pedestal. She easily knocks your confidence (look at these three people you started with, look how much more successful they are compared to you), demoralizes you (the sheer stupidity of what you did) or makes you feel hated (no-one wants to work with you) and useless (I don't know what to do with you). She's extremely materialistic, if you don't look good (bad teeth, lack confidence in yourself, are quieter than the average), or have instagram followers, you have automatic strikes against you and are looked down upon by her. 
- Supervisor, not much better. Though her tactic is to make you feel worthless if you make a mistake, like you have upset her to the point of anger (I thought you could do better).
- Lack of career progression available.
- Not an easy job to just leave, it's a very unusual job to have, wouldn't be able to just go and apply for the same job elsewhere.

Pros
- People I work along side are so good to me, they raise me up and make me feel like I'm good at something.
- I love the job itself.",19May2019,1
652,"Some backstory, since early high school I’ve been close friends with a group of 4 or 5 other guys. Four years later and we still do a lot together. We are all good friends. I’ll refer to them as “The Group” to make things easy to visualize in this post.

As one can imagine, over time doing the same things over and over can get old. And I’m finding that I’m interested in branching out, doing new things and meeting new people. I don’t want to stay still, I want to grow as a person.

The problem is, The Group gets upset when I do *anything* without them. As an example, I recently met a few new cool people through my school, a guy and a girl who are dating and they’ve invited me over a few times to hang out and whatnot. I enjoy hanging out with them because they are quite different than The Group and give me a new perspective on things and different experiences. I consider the two of them good friends now. At one point they hosted a party, they told me to bring a friend or two. So I brought two friends from The Group, so now The Group knows I’m friends with these new two people. Anytime I’m invited over to their place to watch a game or something, and The Group finds out about it, at least one of them gets mad and says to me  “where’s my invite?”. To something I didn’t even host. 

I just hate feeling like I need to keep my life private from them now sometimes. How if I do anything without them, they seem to take it personally. It would be exhaustive to have every single social thing I do be an organized group trip with all 6 of us. Honestly, I just want to meet new people and be able to do things on my own and live my own life and not have to feel obligated to bring The Group along with me every time.

This is not to undermine my friendship with them at all, I enjoy hanging out with them. But understandably, I don’t want to do everything I ever do with them. It feels too cliquey for me, I want to be a person with many social circles to pick and choose from depending on what I want to do and etc. But I also don’t want to lose these guys as friends.",19May2019,1
653,"Quick background:

My parents are high up in their professions respectively, so they were working 7-5 during the week. My older brother was his own version of Dennis the Menace, so daycare was no longer an option. My parents hired a day nanny, we’ll call her Kay. At the time, she was 57, and had just been divorced. She has 1 child, who married and had 3 kids. From what I understand, her daughter in law and Kay did not get along so well, so it caused her and her son to grow distance, but it was always okay because she always had my brother and I. 

She loved my brother and I unconditionally, and was with our family every day until I turned 14 or 15 (I’m the youngest) but the relationship we developed was like having a 3rd parent, or even having a 5th grandparent. Even after her time with us ended, we always remained in touch, and I would still visit her whenever I had a chance, and call her a few times a week just to chat. She always came to our birthday parties, and just became a part of the family. 

Fast forward to now: I am 22 years old, and her health is in decline. To clarify, I knew her health was declining, but I didn’t know how bad it actually was. 

Kay did her best to shield any details from my family and I, but I returned home for spring break and actually took her to her primary care. She always had problems with her knees from an injury she sustained some time ago, and now it pains her to walk. 

She had a BP of 202/97, was diagnosed with non-diabetic neuropathy, and is in need of a double knee replacement. Until I had gotten on her case about eating, she would only eat 1/2 a meal every day or so, so she currently is dealing with chronic weight loss. (I didn’t know she wasn’t eating.) She is also clinically depressed. Her doctor has prescribed her antidepressants in the past, but idk if she is taking them, along with a slew of other meds she’s on, but she assures me she’s taking all meds as recommended. 

I call her every day, and she is always down, and often crying; fun fact, the saddest thing in the world is listening to a little old lady cry on the telephone. 

She needs people to help take care of her. I’m currently away from home on an internship, so that greatly effects my ability to see her. My brother goes grocery shopping for her, and her neighbor cuts her grass, and helps her around the house, but she needs someone there all the time. I contacted an organization that has been providing her with some PT, Occupational Therapy, and a nurse to come twice a week, but they won’t see her for much longer, as they specialize in post surgery care. They have referred me to an agency that specializes in care for the elderly, but it’ll be another 2 weeks before anyone can come interview her to see if she meets requirements. 

She is currently on Medicare, and has a very small monthly income, but not so small she can qualify need based (even tho the money she gets equates to a working person receiving $9USD/hr.) 

She is currently an extra $200 a month over this organizations monthly income limit from being accepted on a needs based standard, but the woman from the agency assured me that there might be something they can do. 

In the event that she doesn’t qualify for the in home healthcare, I really don’t know what to do. 

Her son is so apathetic to the state of his mother, in my eyes one of the kindest people to walk the Earth, that it feels like he’s just waiting for her to die. I just don’t understand how someone could be so apathetic to their own mother. I understand that no parent is perfect, there is no way he could be getting enjoyment from watching this little old woman suffer, regardless of what may or may not have happened between them. 

A retirement home/ assisted care facility is also not an option for her (she can’t afford it.) 

I live in the US, so if there is anyone out there that knows a way to get care to the elderly, when they desperately need it, please help me.",19May2019,66

656,"Hello! This is my first post so sorry for any errors. 

I have been in situations in which people may have needed my help, but I was too scared to approach them about it. There have also been situations in which I was simply too scared to do anything. 

First time I've noticed this, I thought I had caught some guys my age stealing fuel from a car. I didn't call the police as I never had been in such a situation and didnt want to be involved in a big thing. absolutely wrong of me and the next day I went to the police station and they told me it's probably fine since they didn't receive any call for stealing fuel in the area I saw it in. 

Another instance was when I was in a bus. I always listen to music anywhere I can and don't pay much attention to my surroundings. As im sitting on the bus I hear some faint noise and once I pay attention, I see a kid, most likely 5th grade, crying and being really hysterical. it had a back pack on and we were one stop away from a school that is located near the bus stop the bus departes from so I assumed the kid took the wrong bus and got scared. I would have been really worried, but we were only one stop away from said school and the kid got off the bus crying and running back. 

Now the thing I am scared of when it comes to showing courage: I'm very scared of recieving backlash by the person I'm approaching or the people around me witnessing the situation. I was actually scared the kid was gonna yell at me and people would look at me weird. It feels terrible to type this. 

Yesterday when I was out with friends it saw a woman walking by herself, smoking. She looked pretty calm but mascara was smeared all over her face. She didn't look like she had been I a fight or anything, clothes all in tact, just like she was dealing with something hard. For a second I thought of approaching her but also feared that she didn't want anyone bothering her. This made me write this post. 

My question is, how do i overcome this fear of doing something wrong? I'm always scared of somebody viewing my actions as wrong or bothering people. But I am more scared of not being able to step in in a situation that is dangerous but absolutely requires me to. 

If anybody has some advice, I would appreciate it so incredibly much. Thank you for taking your time!",19May2019,2

660,"So I met this friend when I was 17 towards the very end of senior year, more so into the summer. We started hanging out at least twice a week, but it was only because everyone (like 6 other people) would go to our good friend's house and play cards,  smoke weed, joke around, stuff you'd expect from recent high school grads.

Anyways, we never really hung out one on one until a year/year and a half after meeting. We'd go to dinner about twice a month, go for walks a couple of times a year when the weather was nice,  and went to the strip club probably five times together and were just having fun. 

Anyways, the more we hung out, the more it turned into just us hanging out when it was most convenient for him,  granted he was working 40-50 hours a week and truthfully was very busy. However, a trend was starting where we'd make plans to do something, then he'd get off work and tell me he was way too tired to hang out, and it was honestly getting annoying. Plans would be made at like 1 to go to a party, 6 he'd say he can't wait and  just a couple more hours,  then he'd stop texting, then text me 30-60 minutes after close and say he's way too tired to go to the party. Am I being too sensitive for getting pretty damn aggravated about this?

Anyways he stopped smoking weed which is totally whatever. The thing about both of us smoking is we have always been great students and hard workers, it never heavily negatively impacted us. But from there he turned very money hungry...He had always talked about how he wants to be rich yadda yadda, and I thought whatever, then when he stopped smoking he became significantly less available and all he wanted to talk about was how he's opening a business in two years and how he's gonna be so rich. 

Anyways, we made a plan to go to a NYE party, and he seemed super pumped, well close time came along and he called me and says ""I'm way too tired to go to a party, I made plans with family and it's way too late (8PM, lol),"" I gave a very annoyed ""No, it's not,  but whatever, have a good night, bye."" Anyways, woke up the next morning, saw his snap chat story from 3 AM (?!?) and he was at a party 45 minutes away, chugging vodka...I shouldn't have said anything, should've just blocked him,  but I responded to his story and said ""8 PM sure was too late,  looks like nice family fun"" and he messaged me and said ""I can explain, it's not what it looks like"" and I just blocked him. I agree,  immature handling on my part. 

Anyways, four days ago our mutual friend calls and we're just bullshitting and what not and he brings up the ex friend and says ""I heard you're mad at him,  and I heard what happened and I'd be really pissed to. I can see why you blocked him and I told him you're gonna lose friends acting the way you do....He told me he was only at that party because it was nearby his family's house."" I told him it was very aggravating, but I don't necessarily hold a grudge,  which I don't,  just no intentions to see him.

Well, two days ago, he re added me as a friend on Facebook, clearly wanting to re start the friendship... I'm not sure how to feel about this,  I really feel like he's going to be acting exactly the same, but maybe not now that he sees he can lose friends by lying and mistreating? Would you give him another chance?

People say “but you are not black” or they say that it is offensive to compare it.

1.) They are not the same, but they are both bad because they are both the principle that someone cannot do something just because it is theirs.

2.) It is not quantitatively nearly as bad as something racist or sexist, but still qualitatively bad for the same reason why it is bad.

666,So me and my girlfriend have a really good relationship but sometimes when we go out to bars or parties with friends I go a little overboard and become moody. It's like a switch is flicked and one minute I'm fun and goofy and the next I'm paranoid and nasty. This always sucks because a good time becomes a shitty time and half the time I can't even remember what happened. My gf and I talked about this today and I promised her that I would do a better job keeping myself in check when we go out and if that means having a hard limit of how many drinks then that's fine. I also told her that if she ever feels like I need to slow down when we go out she can tell me to chill or I can drink as much as she does and that's it. I told her how awful I felt after stuff like this happened and I explained how much I change when I've had too much. I think she felt a little better that we set some ground rules and that I explained that I can't even remember what happened. What else can I do to show her I care and that I'm tired of this stuff happening?,19May2019,1
667,"Hey im a virgin and have been looking at tinder lately to find someone to enjoy myself with, i found an attractive girl who wants to have a mmf threesome with me and her fwb on the condition that me and her guy friend mess around a little bit. this Initially caused alot of excitement because the girl is attractive and i have sometimes thought about guys, but as it gets closer and closer i am continually nervous and scared and just second guessing myself. so any advice on whether to go through with it or not or my first time should be with someone i care about and not dive into bi threesomes immediately, sorry for the rant and poor grammar",19May2019,1
668,"My fiancee and I have been on a lot of holidays.

In just the last 3 years (in no particular order) we have stayed in:  
Ibiza  
Venice   
Amsterdam  
London  
Lapland  
Disney World and Universal Studios in Orlando  
New York (where I proposed)

I have loved every second of every holiday and don't regret going for a moment. I want to carry on going on all of these trips with her but they're incredibly expensive.  

Approximately 1/3 of my paycheck every month goes to these holidays and has done consistently since we started paying for the first one in 2016.  
With another 1/3 going toward saving for a house that leaves me with 1/3 for myself, including food, phone contract and insurance, petrol, motorcycle insurance and tax; the list goes on.

We're going to Egypt in July, haven't even finished paying it off yet, and my fiancee has requested a quote for a safari in Kenya.  
It's got to a point where I can't save for anything else.

I can't afford necessary parts for my motorbike, a new helmet or gear.  
When I bring it up with my fiancee she offers to go with someone else but I don't want to miss out on the experience with her.  
She doesn't want to miss out on the one life she has by not doing everything in her power to see as much of the world as she can.

Outside of winning the lottery, I don't see an easy solution to this.  
1. I don't go on every holiday and miss out on what I know will be fantastic experiences.  
2. We stop going on as many holidays and she misses out time she can put towards her life goal.  

What can we do?

P.S. Sorry for complaining about holidays, I know there are worse problems to have but this has been a real issue in our relationship.",19May2019,1

670,"I'm writing here for advice as I have nowhere else to go. 

My fiance and I have been together for 2 and a 1/2 years and met through mutual friends. We used to live at opposite ends of the country so we would play online together (PS4s) to bond and have a laugh until we moved in together.

I noticed a problem straight away, my fiance would still spend all his time on his ps4 even when we were living together. 2 years on and it's still the same. We barely ever go out together which is depressing as I'd love to be making memories together.

He will log on in the afternoon and spend around 12-14 hours a day online (GTA, Titanfall etc.) It's creating an issue as he's keeping me up at night due to the noise but when I speak to him about it it's always ""It's no big deal, it makes me happy"".  

We've had fairly heated arguments about it as I've said it's not fair moving in with me to then ignore me all the time or to ""shush"" me if I try to speak to him when he's online. 

I'm at breaking point as he just doesn't see it as an issue and hasn't changed these past 2 years. I love him to bits and he was never like this until we moved in together. He's so withdrawn and snappy with me. I'm a fairly clingy girl and know that's something I need to work on but I never get any attention or romance anymore, every day is just watching him waste away online.

679,"We´re a group of friends who are very close. There´s me, Person (AL), Person (DA), Person (HI) and Person (SO). I´m concerned about AL which is struggling mentally. He´s depressed and bi-polar. And in the past, he has shown responsibility by saying no to LSD when the rest of the squad tripped, he just smoked during the sesh. He´s smoking weed every day, multiple times and is always asking us to join. The rest of us smoke during the weekends. Sometimes he´s not himself while high. One time, me and SO took LSD and he smoked, Al was kinda moaning and laying on the couch ""dying"" to the level where it almost made me bad-trip. But, he´s a fucking great guy most of the time.

So AL´s mom is one part of his problem I will talk about later. He began smoking when he was 13/14 year (the rest of us started at the age of 16/17), he got caught and his mom made such unbelievable restrictions. She installed alarms in the house, if he opens up the door or the window a few centimeters too much, his mom will receive a notification and call him. And his phone was being tracked 24/7. It´s pretty fucking unbelievable, and not the right way to respond. He abstained from weed for a while, he smoked a few times when he could. 

A year ago, he turned 18, his mom loosened up a little bit. He got caught in cycles. He starts smoking, and later on, he is just smoking more and more and giving fewer shits about being caught, and he stops. This has happened so many times.  But recently, the peaks were getting higher and more worrying. His mom told him to sign up for an anti-drug program monitored by the police where they test you once a week, if you´re positive, then you will get a fine and lose your driving license and more. He signed up and is waiting for them to set up an appointment, so now he´s smoking until he gets a date. If you test positive in the first weeks, it´s okay because THC might stay in the body for a while. 

The last 10 days, he has started talking about that he knows people who sell Xanax and valium and he could hook us up. The rest of us don´t want to do antidepressants, we mostly do weed and occasionally LSD, and maybe Molly once a year.   And today, SO told me that AL spent 100 dollars on valium. And he asked SO if he would like to do Xanax with him. He is switching from weed to antidepressants which is a deep hole to go in and it is worrying us. He got a wholesome girlfriend who is pretty kind and smart. She has smoked with us a few times, but she dislikes weed. And now he is hiding his use from her completely.  He also told me that he can´t get through a day if he doesn´t smoke. 

We don´t know how to approach him. I´ve told him to not do antidepressants, and he says ""yeah, I won´t"", but now, he´s just hiding it from me. So, I don´t think, talking to him will work.  Telling his mom, will just make it worse for him. Is there any way to breach into him?

Feel free to ask about more details if something is missing or not clear.

 His doctor has prescribed him light medications, which aren't close to the effects of valium or xanax. I don't think weed is so great for him either, but antidepressants like xanax are just a whole new level which could do so much damage to him.",19May2019,1

683,"#Hello. 

I am Tom, a furry and something else that I’d rather not name, that lives with my mom.

So, I identified as being a furry about a year ago. I never told my mother though, just my tiny public school. 

But why wouldn’t I tell her?

#Alert, this is a long one.

My mother, despite being overall amazing, has decided that it is appropriate to limit me from doing things that she deems “embarrassing”, or “weird”.

Now, first of all, I am a pretty proud furry. Now, I’m not into fursuiting or that kind of thing, just drawing/animating, but I’m still quite fine with people knowing I’m a furry. 

However - I have never told my mother. Why so? Well, she is committing what I believe to be a cardinal mistake in parenting: she refuses to support my (harmless) interests.

Now, if I was saying I was an incel, thief, drug abuser, etc, I could see that being reasonable. However, being a furry is quite harmless (in my opinion). Yet, I cannot talk her down.

But, this isn’t the only time she has refused to accept a rather harmless interest. I have another one, a more private one. And, of course, since she doesn’t like it, she refuses to let me do it. 

#Now, I must clarify -

neither of these are sexual. I have no sexual feelings towards anthros or the other thing. So it really isn’t that extreme. However, my mom pretty much doesn’t care about that - she cuts straight to the stigma of both of these things - and their stigma is that they are sexual. 

Note - _stigma._ Appropriate to my mom’s study habits, (which are basically to read a few articles, a few books that are neutral or biased towards her views, then call it a day, as opposed to actually listening to those qualified to talk about the subject) she read an article or two about furcons, then decided that the majority of this community is sexual. Now, as to whether or not it is, I am not a sexual furry, however she doesn’t care. So that’s why she doesn’t like me being a furry.

But, about that other interest? Well...

It is private for me, but it’s still pretty harmless. But my mom doesn’t like it. Again, it isn’t the social norm, so she doesn’t like it. Now, she has a philosophy that I find to be bull****: “If you wouldn’t want everyone to see you do it, you shouldn’t do it at all.” Or something similar. She uses this to claim that me being a furry, and this other thing, is harmful. However, I would like to poke holes in her argument.

##1: Masturbation. No, mom, it’s not weird to masturbate. No, I would not want to scream *”I MASTURBATED LAST NIGHT!”* anywhere, nor would I want to do it in front of anyone other than a close partner.

##2: Bathroom things. Would you think it normal for someone to state that they have, or for them to - urinate, excrete, or vomit in front of you? No.

##3: Hormonal/Sexual topics. “Hey, I fucked Jenny last night!” Sure, something like that might sound like a bragging right, especially if Jenny -is flaming hot- has some attractive characteristics, but it’s probably more appropriate to keep that in between you and Jen. Or, if you are, say, a closeted LGBT+ (I support you guys through and through) in an area where that isn’t quite accepted, such as in most of the rural USA, would you just go scream out that you’re LGBT+? Probably not.

Okay, so I feel that’s good enough.

There is more I could say, but this post is getting long, So I’ll leave it. Sorry if my formatting was atrocious, I prefer the layout of mobile and am using it currently.

TLDR: My mother doesn’t support me being a furry or my other, more private secret, I don’t believe her to be in the right.

#So, what do I do?",19May2019,0

686,"I've never posted here before, but I've been agonizing for days over this and I need some outside opinions. Thank you in advance!  


I (F) have started seeing a man (M) who is from Canada. I live in the US and we’re on opposite sides of the continent. I’ve known him for the last 3 years and have gotten to know him really well. I got out of my last relationship with a European and that was pretty sucky. He helped me get through it and eventually, we started feeling more for each other. We have the same interests, we’re both in school, and we get along amazingly. We spend a lot of time videoing each other because we enjoy each other’s company even if we’re doing other stuff. I know his mother, who is the mayor of their town and we message back and forth a lot. I know his situation exactly. Cut to the issue. We said that we wouldn't date until we met, but our feelings, late night talks, and general compatibility made that hard for us. He asked me out a few months ago and it's been amazing since.

We decided between the end of school and when he starts his summer job, I would come to visit him so we could finally meet in person and truly know if things have a chance. We bought the tickets months ago, which we have split since we are both university students, and I let my family know.

A week before I’m supposed to go and my brother calls me and tells me he isn’t comfortable with me going and I should reconsider. He hasn’t asked to know anything about the man I’m going to see or what we will be doing or anything. Apparently, I might be sex trafficked. My Dad then calls me that night and yells at me telling me again and again that this is a terrible idea and he “is NOT okay with this.” For 20 minutes, he is pressuring me to cancel the trip, which I think is rash to expect from one 20 minute phone call. I'm also very non-confrontational and have a hard time explaining my side. I at least tell him that I want time to think, which makes him angry.  In this call, he chastises my decisions to date people who aren't from the area. I'm not at all attached to where I live and distance is not a problem for me. Also, I don't apparently talk about my love interests enough. I'm an independent woman and from the upbringing I've had, there's never been a positive place to talk about my relationships at all. 

I hang up and cry about the situation as I don’t like upsetting my family. I then get a ugly text from my step mother giving me an ultimatum: I stay here or they won’t co-sign on my student loans, they’ll stop paying my phone bill, car insurance, and health insurance as well as taking my car away from me. On top of this I’m called a “paid wh\*\*\*” and “ignorant sl\*\*”.

At this point, it’s not even about the trip anymore. I refuse to be belittled in such a way and given such an awful ultimatum. I slept on it and I’ve decided that I don’t want to be in this situation anymore and would take the ultimatum. I know that with the public transportation around me and the jobs readily available, I can live quite comfortably, minus health insurance. I want to save as much money as I can and then leave this area. I refuse to be bullied and belittled and treated like this.

The next night I call my father and tell him this. He calls me a child and that I'm being stupid. I'm a liar about my relationships. It escalates and I end up telling him that I never feel like I can talk to him since I was severely depressed and anxious in high school and starved myself. No one talked to me about it. No one tried to get me help. I just struggled on my own until I went to a doctor as an adult on my own. I've learnt to take care of myself and do not feel like I have any place to talk. I wish that I could have said that without being aggressive, but I was emotional. I still hold it true. He knew how I was and just brushed it off. He even dismissed when I told him I was suicidal in high school. He hangs up on me telling me to do what I want.

I get another call the next day from my brother asking me what happened. He brushes off our step-mother's message like that's okay and moves on. I'm not given much of a chance to voice how truly hurtful that was and how I refuse to be in an ultimatum. I tell him that no one has asked about the guy and he says it doesn't change anything. No matter what I say, there is only the idea that I'm going to be hurt in this scenario. He rambles on about how everyone just cares and that maybe I said things I didn't mean. We hang up. 

That night, my brother's girlfriend and a close friend of mine calls me. Usually, she is patient and understanding and kind. Someone I can finally speak to without feeling like I am being talked over. Instead, she does like everyone else. Aggressively telling me I am rude, disrespectful, ignorant and that I just need to ""bite the bullet"" and do what they want. She says I'm disappointing her and that she's never seen this ""disrespectful"" side of me. She tells me that I'm giving her awful anxiety because she takes a test the day I leave and I'm going to ruin it for her. She tells me that I'm going to fuck up my mental health and I've done so well since my breakup. I had been talking to my current boyfriend then, platonically, and learning to accept my pain and understand it better. He is a big reason why my mental health is better. She also didn't understand how I could know the guy for around the same time as my ex. Apparently, you can't have relationships with people who you aren't dating. She tells me my father is beside himself and my brother can't sleep and how could I be so selfish.  She cries twice and when I apologise for her crying, she quickly tells me I'm being insincere. I give up talking since I have nothing I believe I can say.

My boyfriend wrote a very lovely word doc about who he is and his side of the situation to my father and sent it to him, my brother and his girlfriend to make sure someone read it. My brother called him and they talked for a while. They have no problems with him coming here, but me going there is a no. My boyfriend had listened to all the conversations and told my brother respectfully how aggressive he was and how I actually felt. He even told him how I don't want to stay here, which my brother didn't reply to. None of this was done with my knowledge until afterward. He's his own person, and he's helped me more from that than anything. Nothing changed though.

So, here I am now. That last phone call was 4 days ago and my flight is set to leave in 2 days. No one has contacted me and I haven't contacted them. I now need to make the decision to go or stay, wondering if I need to distance myself from my family either way. My heart is heavy and I need some guidance.  


Tldr; Told family I was going on a trip to Canada to meet someone I've known for 3 years but haven't met in person. Everyone freaks out and is aggressive and calls me a lot of awful things and I'm given financial ultimatums. Trying to decide to go on the trip and if I distance myself from my family either way.",19May2019,2
687,"Alright. Hello Reddit. I'm just going to jump into it. 

I have a friend called.. A. I have a friend group of about eight people, A included. However, it's been brought to my attention that nobody really likes A too much. 

You see. A is... is something. She's boy crazy she's in our two years of high school she's already been in about four different relationships. One was an on again off again one and they dated like four times. It's been brought to my attention that she might get with him again. She tends to drag people into her relationship drama a lot. But the thing is she neglects a lot advice given to her. She's also the kind of person to not really listen if we have a problem with her and change the subject a lot. Another thing, she doesn't attempt to even take interest in a lot of stuff we like(The majority of our group loves anime and video games but she doesn't even attempt to even watch or even play anything). It really annoys the hell out of me and our group and also she's the type of friend that tends to say ""K."" When we're trying to explain something to her, then it's followed by an ""I'm bored"".

Why are we still friends with her? You might ask?  Well some of my friends don't really talk to her. But I'm still her friend because well, she's got a situation at home as well as she feels she's not paid attention to enough(even though we try and talk to her all the time) also she was the only one that helped me through a dark time in middle school. 

So I guess my question is what should I do. I think I'm probably the only person in the friend group that keeps her there because I feel as if we kick her out she'll be miserable.",19May2019,1

689,"Quick Background: I am F (17) and my boyfriend is M (17), we have been dating for almost 6 months now. Both high school juniors and have a pretty good relationship aside from getting into arguments frequently. 

My boyfriend thinks I am materialistic and he blames his own insecurities on the way I feel. He is constantly saying “You’re not happy with me.” “You don’t want to hang out with me.” “You don’t love me.” He also says that I am only in this relationship for his money. Whenever I point out something like an expansive outfit that I think is cute or when I got excited about getting the iPhone X, he thinks I am being materialistic. 

He believes that if he doesn’t spend money on me I will break up with him, I constantly tell him that’s not true, and I will remain with him as long as he has a worth ethic and can help support a family one day. I do love him and want to be with him, I definitely see that he is insecure and that he thinks all I care about is the next new thing. 

I pointed out a $500 purse that my mom had got and he really flipped saying “Who cares?” “How pointless!” ( it was a gift from her mom for her birthday ). Do I just stop pointing out the worth of items? Do I stop window shopping and pointing out nice looking items? 

He also saw me writing this post and said “You’re asking Reddit how to break up with me.” “You’re complaining that I’m a bad boyfriend.” Clearly he is insecure, is it something I’m doing? What makes a person materialistic, am I? What can I do...?",19May2019,2

697,"Example: I am annoyed that people removed from a Facebook group when I did not violate their rules, and they say that they can do it because it is their group. I compare the morality of it to how it is illegal for someone to turn away or fire someone from their business because of their race or sex, and they cannot turn them away or fire them because it is their business. People say “but you are not black” or they say that it is offensive to compare it.

1.) They are not the same, but they are both bad because they are both the principle that someone cannot do something just because it is theirs.

2.) It is not quantitatively nearly as bad as something racist or sexist, but still qualitatively bad for the same reason why it is bad.

3.) If I cannot say it, THEN WHAT IS A RESPECTFUL WAY TO COMPARE A PRINCIPLE TO GET MY POINT ACROSS?! Maybe I could compare minimum wage in that instance, but it still might not work, sometimes there are no other ways to say something, and everyone keeps nitpicking what I say.",19May2019,0

Everything was fine and going good until the one day I came to know that she cheated on me , I was too much devastated listening that , that I didnt knew what to do , 
But i forgave her and we became good friends, a month passed and she said that she still had feelings left for me and that we should date again , I agreed with that , but this time I became too much obsessed with her , *you all should know that she always ignored my texts and calls * and as a defence she said that I am busy and you should not expect from me that ,I will sit and text you everytime , but she remained online , and you all should know she talks to a lot of guys , A LOT .

After that breakup ,we became friends again.
I texted her everyday and said I care for her beyond every means and I wish that she always remains happy and that I will be always there for her whenever she needs me and I really did that , I always supported her every time whenever she needed me ,until last week when we fighted she said to me , that i am a stupid low key shit and I should get some respect and she accused me that I dont respect her , I had gone numb at that time I didnt knew what to do I only said her I always respected you and I will always respect and care for you.
Today I texted her again , we fought and she was rude to me again and said that she dont care and dont give a fuck , while I still said I will always care for you untill my last breath.

I am messed up emotionally , I dont know what to do , I know I should just leave her but I dont know why i cant?  Why is it too hard for me to move on and stop talking to her, I am too much obsessed with her , that it is effecting my university credits and my health , and she really doesnt care about how i am , or how much i suffer , its only me that cares about her and asks her how she is

He is a personal trainer and i am a 20 yr old female. i don’t pose a threat to him at all. and it seems like he is denying the whole thing. 

he is acting like i bought a work out from him and that i’m upset bc i didn’t like the workout product. apparently he contacted a lawyer and said if i contact him again i can get in trouble.

the thing is i believe i can prove he is lying if it comes down to it. he was very careful when it came to dealing. he used snapchat and the messages disappeared after we left the screen so i don’t have any evidence in regards to his dealings. but i know what gym he works at and i have never been inside and never had a personal training session.

and i have a couple baggies that he delt to me, so they all have weed residue and i’m assuming his prints? 

is there anything i can do? should i be worried?

710,"So a cousin of mine I haven’t seen in a few months is planning to visit this week after my exams finish (they finish on Tuesday) for a few days. 

My gran told me this last week but when she mentioned that the relative is coming to stay over, I assumed it’d be on the weekend. So I made plans for a few of my friends to have a sleepover, sort of a catch-up, since we haven’t seen each other in months also. They’re coming on Thursday afternoon and spending the night at my house. 

Well, today, when I mentioned my plans to my grandmother, she said that my relative is coming over the day before my friends do and said relative is only coming for a couple of days. She didn’t say as much, but I could tell she wanted me to reschedule my plans with my friends. 

The thing is, I made these plans last week and I actually had them shuffle their schedules to come on Thursday. And I’ve cancelled on them the last two times we were meant to meet up because of exams.

712,"We have a 70 pound dog. We were leaving on vacation for a week and needed someone to take care of him. In the past, we've always hired a dog sitter who stays at our house, and we book them well ahead of time from a dog walking/sitting website where we find someone with good reviews. We have security cameras outside the house, so we can keep an eye on things and we've never had problems in the past.

This time, a family member who was supposed to walk the dog canceled at the last minute. We hired someone who only had a couple reviews, but we met them in person and they seemed nice and we weren't that worried since we can keep an eye on things. We made it very clear that the dog can only be crated for 3-4 hours at a time, and they told us they only went into work for a couple hours in the morning and then work from home the rest of the day. Seemed like a good match.

The first day, we left the dog in the crate at 7:30AM. The sitter originally said they would come over mid morning, but texted us after we left that morning and said they would come over at noon. Not great, but still fine. Meanwhile, 2PM rolls around and we don't see the sitter having showed up yet. Wasn't replying to texts, so we had to send a kind neighbor over to let the dog out. The sitter finally showed up at 3PM and told us that they went over earlier to let him out to pee and then left again for lunch. Easily verified as a lie, since there is no evidence of that happening on our security cameras.

The next day, the sitter left for work in the morning and again wasn't home by the early afternoon. Texted and the sitter told us that their coworker's wife unexpectedly went into labor and so work is going to be unexpectedly longer hours. Pretty sure that was probably a lie too, but that's fine if it's true if they had at least told us so we could make arrangements, but never volunteered this information until we asked. Had to send a neighbor over again on the second day. We made it clear that he can't be crated that long and they need to let us know if we have to make arrangements ahead of time.

The sitter said they would take him to work with them the next day, which we're fine with. Sitter left with him in the car in the morning and then returned with him about an hour later. They said the dog wouldn't go into the building because he was afraid (which we'd believe, he's sometimes afraid of new places). So for a third day, we had to have a neighbor let him out again.

We suggested they try using his harness instead of leashing him on his collar, which is what they were supposed to be doing in the first place. With the harness, it would be easy enough to drag him into the building if he's scared. He usually gets over his fear after the first time. The sitter said they would try again and the next morning, the dog went into the car and the sitter said they were able to get the dog into the building and that he did great at work that day. The sitter sent us a picture of the dog supposedly at work, but we knew something didn't look right. It did not look like an office place. The trim on the wall in the background clearly looked like a house, not a workplace. Two more days of the same: the sitter would leave in the morning with the dog in the car and come back in the afternoon after work and tell us the dog did great at work.

Then, the last day we were away, the sitter put the dog in the car and left for work. About 45 minutes later, the dog wanders into our driveway, by himself. We didn't immediately notice, but about 20 minutes later, one of our neighbors was out walking their dog and caught him and rang our doorbell. We have a smart doorbell and were able to unlock the front door so the neighbor could let him back into the house. We texted and called the sitter who didn't reply right away. Finally they got back to us and seemed very confused. They claimed they left him inside in the crate and weren't sure how they could have got out. Meanwhile, I'm looking at all our security cameras and see no evidence that the sitter left the dog in the house. They clearly left with the dog in the car. I also checked all our security sensors we have on the windows in the house and all windows were closed. The sitter said they were heading home to go check on the dog.

The sitter gets home about 45 minutes later and claims that they accidentally left the guest room window open. Then sent us a photo of the window open with the screen knocked out. This is odd because the screen has clips on both sides that you have to unclip to push the screen out, which the dog could not have done. The screen would have been ripped, which it wasn't. I also checked our security sensor logs, and the window shows being opened *after* the sitter gets home. I also looked at our security camera footage, which has a clear view of that window, and I see no activity on that window at all until after the sitter gets home. Once the sitter is home, I see the screen popped out and I see the sitter's head popping out the window.

So clearly, the sitter made up this story and staged the photo of the ""accidentally-left-open window"". We thought for a while about what we think was actually going on. Our leading theory is that the sitter was not taking the dog to work at all. The sitter only lives a few streets away, so we're pretty sure they were taking him to their house instead and leaving him there all day while at work. We think that last day, he managed to escape from their house and made his way home. That's the only explanation that makes sense.

So now we're trying to decide what to do. We are home now and haven't confronted the sitter. A few things we're considering:

 - Should we confront the sitter themselves, giving them a chance to explain themselves?
 - Should we leave a public review on the sitter's profile on the dog walking/sitter site?
 - Should we even leave private feedback to the dog walking/sitter site that the sitter themselves can't see? I'm still always a little worried about retaliation.

We could also just do nothing, but we're worried about how irresponsible this sitter is and they are clearly a pathological liar. We're afraid that other people would hire them and have no idea this kind of thing was going on without security cameras like we have. Any advice is appreciated.",19May2019,2

715,"I got some new next door neighbors in my complex a few weeks ago and they seem like alright people. The husband is mid-40s with a mullet and a barbed wire tattoo on his arm, the wife is about the same age, bleach blonde hair, never without an orange box pall mall hanging from her mouth if shes outside. Both of them drive big lifted dodge trucks and they've got a little shorthaired mixed lap dog. They're nice enough, and they don't really cause any trouble but this dog barks at everything I do, all hours of the day or night. I literally cannot stick my key in the front door of my apartment without this dog losing it's shit. 

Today the husband came out when I was changing wiper blades and told me that that little dog of his barked every time she heard me make a noise and he hated having to yell at her so could I be quiet as to not disturb the pup. Well, I'm not there most of the day, I don't have my TV hooked up, my only speakers are my phone, and the only other noise I make is going to the bathroom, showering, dressing or undressing, snoring, cooking, talking on the phone, or doing laundry.  I'm not loud at all, and even the guy said he can't hear me but his dog can hear me and lets him know when I'm coming up the driveway, coming and going, or anything else.

 No joke, this dog will bark if I chop vegetables too vigorously. It also barks when the neighbor on his other side does anything, which is all the time because she's a jobless drunk who uses a very treatable medical condition as a crutch and an excuse for being a hateful bitch. She parties all the time, has music so loud I can hear it in my apartment 2 doors down, and constantly yells at whoever she's mad at that day. Anyway, this poor dog spends all day and all night barking her head off, and the husband won't quiet her ""because a dog's got a right to bark"" and her barking doesn't bother him. I love animals as much as anyone but he's basically asking me not to exist in my own apartment. 

Should I bring this up with my landlord? I hate causing trouble but I don't want the new neighbor to call on me for being too loud and get me kicked out when I'm basically an 80 year old trapped in a mid 20s person's body.",19May2019,1

718,"TL;DR: Confessed to a girl, was “rejected” but in a way that doesn’t suggest a definite end. Now I don’t know what to think.

I’ll have to preface this with a bit of a backstory. 
I’m a freshman in my college. I’m an introvert (a pretty big one at that) and it takes me time to warm up to people. Anyway, a few months back I started noticing a girl, which was also my course-mate and found her kinda cute (the type that makes you glance at someone every now and then but mot enough for you to make a move). I wasn’t really considering doing anything about her until one day, after an awful party, me and my friend decided to bail out 10 minutes after getting there and go to McDonalds so as to not have the entire evening wasted. So after we were finished eating, we sat there just to chat for a few minutes when out of nowhere I see the aforementioned girl along with her friends walk in and sit by a table a few meters away from us. I was laughing internally thinking how funny of a coincidence it was, almost as if “fate has brought us together”. We chatted for a bit and it turned out that those guys had the same exact experience as us. They got to the party just to leave in ten minutes. Me and my friend left shortly after.

After this fateful encounter I thought to myself. I have as good a reason as any to message her and that I did. We established similarities pretty soon and to my surprise our conversations went pretty smoothly.
 
Now here’s the thing. I’m extremely reserved when it comes to people and I tend to “respect others’ privacy” a bit too much.

...so. Even though the conversation had gone pretty well I decided to message her few weeks later rather than trying to capitalize on the moment. So this is pretty much how it went on for quite some time. I would message her every other week or so while virtually doing nothing in real life, despite us being coursemates and me seeing her pretty much every other day. Our weekly messaging sessions were always pretty good, but it’s safe to say my approach wasn’t exactly the best.

I want to emphasize that I’m not a “shy guy” and I am pretty open about myself with people I know. It’s just that the initial opening-up phase can sometimes be really slow and drawn out. 

It wasn’t until a few weeks back that I decided to confess as these, now biweekly, messages weren’t getting us anywhere. And so I did. She was slightly surprised initially and said that she would think about it. The next day passes without me hearing from her and at that point I thought that she most likely backed out and wasn’t going to follow up on her opinion at all. The next day after one of our classes she walks up to me and tells me she wanted to talk. 

In short she told me that she wasn’t ready for relationships at all, that she was concentrated on her studies but that she found me very interesting and would really want to keep in touch with me. 

After all was said and done she gave me one more regretful/dejected look and we just parted ways

I was very understanding of her words and tried showing that everything was fine and that I wasn’t sad about what was essentially a rejection. I just took it as a fact and moved on pretty much immediately. 

At this point I’ve stopped messaging her. I feel like just leaving it off is the best decision as neither of us would have to worry about something like this in the face of finals and I probably wont resume even after that.

However, every time we see each other I can clearly see her sneaking glances and whenever we approach each other we just exchange “Hi”s and go on with our days. But each of those greetings is accompanied with a slightly dejected expression of hers which has me thinking twice about the closure of this story. I really don’t know if I should try to do something or if I should just leave it be.",19May2019,1

She jumped over to my seat and hugged me and whimpered. I held her and told her she'll be fine, I'll protect her. She smiled and she told me I was cute. I thanked her and replied ""If anyone's cute here it's you"". She smiled and we hugged for the last 10 minutes of the bus ride. 

She will randomly put her hands on my face and rub my cheeks while she smiles and looks me in the eye. She messes with my hair daily and always plays with it on the bus. She has made it clear to multiple friends she likes me. The only issue is... She has a boyfriend.

I am genuinely convinced he is psychotic. He told her that he wants to get her pregnant and leave for the army. He is leaving for the army in 6 days and they have had sex multiple times. He has finished intentionally to try and get her pregnant. She has had days she will come to class, use the bathroom and cry because she's worried she's pregnant. Whenever she does this I somehow know. I always hug her and tell her she will be okay. I have told her to tell him not to but he does it anyway. 

Anyway, that's just random info to try to see what you guys think. I'm not sure what to do but I really want to be with her. But I don't want to cross any lines. What do I do?",19May2019,1

A little back story. I am in a military barracks and I've been here for about a month and a half so I've had many different roommates and I just yesterday got another roommate. So it's just me and her and she has been here for less than 24 hours.

As soon as she gets here she kept commenting about how disgusting my room is and how I need to clean it. This is military barracks they are always clean or else we will get our room privileges revoked.

She goes to shower and she locks her locker and then looks me in the eyes and says bitches be thieves. Then goes to take a shower. She walks out of the shower naked. And then keeps staring at me as if she expects me to say something to her.

Then she is on the phone with her boyfriend and she is the most shallow person I've ever heard saying how she is so beautiful and so hot and she puts people down for being ugly and fat. And her boyfriend says how jealous do you think people are that you are so beautiful and young and have a fat ass.

She keeps calling me a dirty bitch to her boyfriend and making snide remarks but not to my face but to her boyfriend.

724,"I'm (was) an all A student, I've been an all A student since 8th grade (6th grade I was a C average student and in 7th I was all As one B) just as the second semester started I dropped into deep depression (was going to see a therapist at the school and such) and during that I was called intellectually lazy, told i was never going to amount to much in college, and i was basically all talk no action (academically, even though I've been one of the top performing students sophomore year started and i'm extremely proud of all the hard work and bullshit i've gone through to get all As) once my english teacher noticed I stopped doing my work. My lowest grade drop was a D, which got raised to a C, and was a low B in my biology class and my teachers seemed to be indifferent to me being absent so much and not doing my work.

That was some background information, my grade in biology dropped to a C again. The teacher is notorious for never teaching well, no study guides, a brief lookover of the subject and no going over with the class if our lab answers are right or not (which leads to most of us doing crap on them). Ever since I saw that C, I bursted into tears and I feel like i'm falling back into the same stuff. Why try and learn when nothing's conducive?

Is there any methods of boosting my motivation up from this kind of situation? I'll admit I have become lazier post-depression and have a complete repulsion from doing work (which sometimes brings me to the brink of tears when I dont want to do it, I have no idea why).  I just need some kind of way to actually make me get past this part of my life without becoming a complete failure to my future with colleges.",19May2019,2

I grew to fear the darkness, even looking into a dark room makes me paranoid. If that wasn’t enough, during the night my attitude towards anything becomes much much worse. To avoid all of that I sleep most of the day in order to not feel anything.

I guess I don’t know what I’m doing anymore, I’ve given up and don’t know what to do with myself.

735,"I am a 22 year old women and I’m constantly scared of being perceived as ugly.
Whenever I post a picture on instagram, I get stricken by anxiety. I check my picture multiple times even after posting it which eventually leads me to disliking it. I also check whether I’ve been unfollowed after I post selfies and if I am unfollowed I assumed it occurred due to my ugliness. 

Before posting a picture, I feel the need to send it to my mom and four friends for approval. If half of them like it but the other half doesn’t, I decide not to post it. That’s why I rarely take pictures of myself or post them due to the fact that it tires me psychologically and emotionally.

The thing is that if I look at things objectively, I can’t consider myself ugly. I’ve been complimented many times during my life by men and women. For example, yesterday I was waiting for my sister outside of a store and I suddenly noticed a group of guys and a woman staring at me. The woman came to me after a while and told me that I am really beautiful and that her guy friends can’t stop staring at me because they find me really attractive. 
I’ve also got more than 400 matches on tinder (but I think it’s normal for women). I’ve also been liked by every single guy I’ve went out for a date until now. 
People have given me compliments about my body all my life as well. I ve been called thick by guys and women since my adolescence years. I am aware of the fact that I have larger hips, a smaller waist, and a large breast. The thing is that I am aware that I have some nice physical features and I am aware of the fact that I’m perceived as attractive by some people. It’s just that the features I don’t like about myself find a way to always win over the things I like.

What I like:
1) My hips
2) Breast
3) Lips
4) Waist
5) Height
6) Hair 
7) Eyebrows

What I dislike:
1) My eyes (I’d like to have smaller eyes)
2) My nose (it is small but it has a little bump)
3) My skin ( I had acne in the past)
4) My stomach ( Okay I have like the hour glass shaped figure but I want to have a completely flat stomach)
5) My cheeks ( even though people have  complimented them, I just don’t like them. I want to have the skinny type of face)


 I know that I have some good physical features but the negative ones haunt me. So I decided today with the help of my sister to post some selfies and to basically say fuck it. I’m trying not to check them multiple times even though it’s difficult. 
In the past, I have prevented myself from having fun because of my insecurities. I didn’t go to a school trip and university trip just because it involved the beach and I didn’t want anyone to see me in bikinis. I never go to public swimming pools just because I m afraid of seeing someone I know and being judged about my appearance.

So idk I want to stop being so overly critical of myself because it’s ruining my life. I can become a better version of myself without trashing my life with these stupid insecurities. 

Does anyone think that I should fight my fear of being judged about my appearance by posting pictures of myself even if I’m not sure that I like them? I want to feel free like other people feel. I see how some of my friends just post pics of themselves without worrying what the other person will say. What do you think?

737," 

Well hello there redditers.

I am writing this big ass essay is for everyone to know what im thinking. cuz im either scared or shy to tell my real life friends or family. so hoping for some good answers here.

Weill, ill start by introducing myself. I'm 19 years old, and I would like to keep my name anonymous, so for the sake of essay, call me Arman. I grew up in middle east but Im a from Banglaadesh (never lived there, only visited sometimes). lived there for 18 years, now Im in canada for my higher studies. so i had a good bunch of friends back then, i still have them, just we dont get to talk face to face. only through facebook mssnger. I am very keen on online games. Back when i was in middle east, i made a lot of online friends (from Bangladesh). I added them on facebook, we are frnds since then (meet them 2 years ago in Call Of Duty). Now my question comes -

Me and my online friends recently opened an online gaming clan with plans being the best in our home country and on going International (Esports). My friends have very good skills on the games we play. they already made a name of ourselves on some games. I stopped playing games when i came to canada The question is as Im an International Student studying in Canada, it take a huge toll on my parents to provide me the living expenses and tuituion fees as interntaional stundetns are not able to work for more thn 20 hrs a week and the minimum wage is $14. So i can barely cover up the food costs. Well i wrote this because, am i doing something wrong? Like i procrastinate a lot. at the end of the day i end up doing nothing other thn talking to my clan mates on what to do with the clan. I feel like im wasting my time on something that has very very very slime chance on happening and wasting my parents money. I want to stay in the clan with them but I wanna focus on my future more. How do i tell them that i wont be able to give them much time ( they migh get upset, dont wanna make em upset) and focus on my future more? and lets say i told them that i wont be able to give the same amount of time i used to give everyday, how do i make my self ready after doing so? I always end up procrastinating and end up doing nothing with my studies. I wanna f\*\*king study but I am not being able to, dont know why.

Anyone who answers please can you add a timetable like thingy on what to do in different times? I know i can but im not being able to find. so if you suggest me one, ill just go with that. might edit a little if i have classes during those times.

Im very sorry i went of the topics many times cuz i dont know what and how to express my feelings. I just want to study but not being able to. sorry for the mistakes in english. English is my 4th language and Iam self taught from the internet. so have mercy on my english.",19May2019,1
739," 

Now, as a disclaimer, I am 17 and prone to fits of irritation like any still-to-fully-develop person. However, I really and truly do believe that my parents are beginning to cross some lines from just annoying over to truly bad parenting.

M = Mom

D = Dad

• See me as a child and do not really treat me with respect

• Assume that because they are my parents that I should always respect them no matter what

• They are extremely emotional and over dramatic; if I criticize M at all she will get really upset and claim it is my fault she is so upset, which makes D really mad and start yelling at me and punishing me (in a not physical way, to be clear)

• They are really controlling, in most aspects of my life. I have no privacy - I have to repeatedly ask them for basic things such as knocking before entering my room. They regularly search my room, including all the drawers and in the closet, and call me sneaky when they find something they don't like.

• They must know the passcode to all of my devices, and get upset if I change the password and do not tell them

• Speaking of invading privacy, they go through my private messages (text, Discord, etc.) whenever they please, without warning. They see nothing wrong with this.

* They make me put my phone in their bedroom at 10 every night, regardless of whether I am still using it and whether I still need it for homework (which is frequent as I will usually do it with friends).

• They want complete control over all my finances; get upset when I make a relatively major purchase without asking, and don't give me a debit because they believe I cannot be trusted with it.

• They have stated multiple times that they do not trust me at all to make the right decisions, despite me almost being an adult. • My self-esteem regularly suffers on account of their actions.

• They guilt trip me by saying that any conflict between us is my fault and that the rift growing between me and the family is because of my isolationist tendencies, failing to see that I am this way because of them

• D regularly uses shouting and anger to try to intimidate me into making me see his way.

• Both can be very passive-aggressive when I do not agree with them about something.

• If my opinion differs in any way about something significant, in their eyes, I am wrong.  
• I constantly feel pressured to succeed in an unhealthy way. Nothing I do is good enough, and if I fail I will be a disappointment.

• If I am in the middle of a task, it universally does not matter what it is, if they decide that my time would be better spent helping them, then they demand that that is what I must do.

• Get really critical of me wanting to quit a job that pays decently, but I really do not enjoy at all.

• D is very two-sided; one moment he will be alright with me doing what I want, and the next he will suddenly be very demanding, aggressive, and critical of everything that I do

• D is a yes man to M.

• When they get an opinion in their head about how I should live or behave, they try to jam me into that mold with no regard for what I want or feel

• It often feels like they only want me to be successful because it will reflect well on them

• Reflexively, their first punishment for any supposed wrongdoing is to take electronic devices away, even if the wrongdoing had nothing to do with said electronics

• Set a bad example for spending habits: regularly go out to eat despite struggling to pay health insurance Bill's

• Only let me go out so often because ""why do you need to see your friends, you saw them earlier this week."" This also applies to my girlfriend, to both our abhorrence.

* Their excuse for why I can't do or have something is often based on need (you don't need to do / have this) but they frequently disregard this statement when dealing with themselves or even my sibling
* I am a forgetful person, and frequently forget to do things they ask me to do. They do not believe me, thinking that I am lying about being forgetful to try and get away with not doing the work, and get irrationally angry when I do forget to do things.

Please let me know if you think this behavior is considered normal and I am just being a paranoid rebellious teenager or if I do have reason to be concerned. I have been discussing this with some friends, and one of them believes that this could constitute mental and emotional abuse. I don't know about all that, but I would like to know if y'all think it goes this far.

740,"Hi all, not sure if this is what the site is for, but i thought I'd give it a shot.

I am....depressed. Suicidal. I'm currently living by myself in Silverthorne, Colorado, where i am always put down by my manager and supervisor every day that I'm ""not enough"" and harassed every single day, getting put down to be ""useless"" and that ""they can't wait to fire me"". And just tearing me apart every day. I don't have much for a support system or friends. Not only that. But my lease is about to expire, and do to the insecurity of the future of my postal job (even with my postal union). 

It's gotten to the point of where it seems like everything, listed above, as well as living a life of regret and sadness, has put me to the point of where there's nothing in my life worth living for. I've given up on my dreams, future, other people, my family, etc. I constantly feel like I'm ready to give up and kill myself to ease my pain and stop being a drag and bog down people's life with my negativity and overall presence. Like I'm not worth anything to anyone and everyone is better off without me.

I guess, what I'm asking is, what everyone's reasons for wanting to live and survive and be excited about the next day instead of regretting it or not wanting to be a part of it. If that makes sense.

741,So im 18. I recently applied for a credit card and got approved and my mom is mad at me for getting one. I got it because my dad reccomended I get one to build credit so when im out of college I can cut the intrest down a little on student loans and I can apply for a mortgage when I find a place to live after college. So I did and my mom didn't want me to because she says I could go in debt. My math class at school has a finance unit and my teacher taught us all about credit cards and how to be smart with them. We even had a financial advisor come in one day and he reccomends it cuz he cut his college debt intrest by a whole ton just cuz he used credit cards wisely Plus I am very conservative with my money I don't spend a lot so my bill will be very small. Plus I have more money in a savings then my credit card limit so worst case scenario which I believe is highly unlikley I hit my limit I have the money to pay it. I dont see myself spending more then $100 a month between gas for my car and going out with friends and I make $300 a month after taxes just to put into perspective how much I save vs how much I spend. My mom still thinks its a bad idea and thinks I disrespected her by saying I only did what my dad said to do cuz it benifited me. I told her well its not hurting her and its going to help me build credit so IDK how that is bad my dad who has very good credit and a lot of money says I am very financially responsible. My Dad told me credit cards can be harmful if used wrongly and can be very benifitial if used right. I wont even use credit all my life just now to build credit so I can get my life going then I wont use it at all,19May2019,2

745," need some advice and possibly second opinions on what i should do with my situation. My parents and I havent gotten along since I started my relationship with my partner. We both concider eachother endgame, but my parents dont agree with the relationship solely because of the race of my partner which makes me absolutely disgusted with them. This along with the fact that my parents, namely my mom, are the cause of my anxiety which leads to depression has pushed me to the point of wanting to disown them and start a new life without them around. Our most recent argument started because I did not follow a xurfew i didnt know I had. I am 20 and the past 8 to 9 months I was at college without a curfew and even when I came back for winter break I did not have a curfew. I did during the summer before I left for school, but I understood it because of the fact that I had not been away from home my freahman year of college. The only reason the curfew is placed now is because my partner is in the area and I want to visit them when Im free. I hadnt had a curfew for so long I dont want to go back to having one just because they are against yhe race of my partner. I tried to make myself pretend to be okay with their racism and be okay with the curfew just so we can have an okay summer, but I cannot make myself stand by such a disgusting mindset. I keep trying to but I just cannot. My mom has gaslit me about things shes said as well as use emotional blackmail and manipulation. My dad has just been very passive agressive and only concerned about his image in his community which would view him in a negative way if they knew my partner and I were together, or so he feels. I dont know his community as much so I cannot say that it will happen. 

I am at the point where i want ro permanently break myself away from then and start a new life away from them. The issue is that they forced themselves to pay for college when I didnt want them to and refuse to cosign for a loan. I want ro graduate from college, but I also made the mistake of picking a college with mandatory on campus housing which would put me in further debt with interest pilling up if I am even able to get a loan. Not only that but I dont own a car, I dont have enough for health insurance, car insurance if I do ever get a car, and no place to live during the summer if I start detatching now. I plan to get a basic flip pjonenplan from Verizon because its only $5 a month. Ive tried so hard to make things olay with them, but they won't change. Ive tried to be respectful of their culture and put up with them, but I cannot just let their racist beliefs slide anymore. They want me to be with someone of the same race and religion as when when i dont identify with the religion or even the culture because of the environment I grew up it. I love my partner and we have no intention of leaving eachothers lives.

Im looking for advice on whether this is a step I should take or not, and if so what are resources or tips I could use to get away from them. Im really just wanting to know if Im crazy for wanting to be done with them.",19May2019,1
746," I've never posted here before, but I've been agonizing for days over this and I need some outside opinions. Thank you in advance!

I (F) have started seeing a man (M) who is from Canada. I live in the US and we’re on opposite sides of the continent. I’ve known him for the last 3 years and have gotten to know him really well. I got out of my last relationship with a European and that was pretty sucky. He helped me get through it and eventually, we started feeling more for each other. We have the same interests, we’re both in school, and we get along amazingly. We spend a lot of time videoing each other because we enjoy each other’s company even if we’re doing other stuff. I know his mother, who is the mayor of their town and we message back and forth a lot. I know his situation exactly. We said that we wouldn't date until we met, but our feelings, late night talks, and general compatibility made that hard for us. He asked me out a few months ago and it's been amazing since. Cut to the issue.

We decided between the end of school and when he starts his summer job, I would come to visit him so we could finally meet in person and truly know if things have a chance. We bought the tickets months ago, which we have split since we are both university students, and I let my family know.

A week before I’m supposed to go and my brother calls me and tells me he isn’t comfortable with me going and I should reconsider. He hasn’t asked to know anything about the man I’m going to see or what we will be doing or anything. Apparently, I might be sex trafficked. My Dad then calls me that night and yells at me telling me again and again that this is a terrible idea and he “is NOT okay with this.” For 20 minutes, he is pressuring me to cancel the trip, which I think is rash to expect from one 20 minute phone call. I'm also very non-confrontational and have a hard time explaining my side. I at least tell him that I want time to think, which makes him angry. In this call, he chastises my decisions to date people who aren't from the area. I'm not at all attached to where I live and distance is not a problem for me. Also, I don't apparently talk about my love interests enough. I'm an independent woman and from the upbringing I've had, there's never been a positive place to talk about my relationships at all.

I hang up and cry about the situation as I don’t like upsetting my family. I then get a ugly text from my step mother giving me an ultimatum: I stay here or they won’t co-sign on my student loans, they’ll stop paying my phone bill, car insurance, and health insurance as well as taking my car away from me. On top of this I’m called a “paid wh\*\*\*” and “ignorant sl\*\*”.

At this point, it’s not even about the trip anymore. I refuse to be belittled in such a way and given such an awful ultimatum. I slept on it and I’ve decided that I don’t want to be in this situation anymore and would take the ultimatum. I know that with the public transportation around me and the jobs readily available, I can live quite comfortably, minus health insurance. I want to save as much money as I can and then leave this area. I refuse to be bullied and belittled and treated like this.

The next night I call my father and tell him this. He calls me a child and that I'm being stupid. I'm a liar about my relationships. It escalates and I end up telling him that I never feel like I can talk to him since I was severely depressed and anxious in high school and starved myself. No one talked to me about it. No one tried to get me help. I just struggled on my own until I went to a doctor as an adult on my own. I've learnt to take care of myself and do not feel like I have any place to talk. I wish that I could have said that without being aggressive, but I was emotional. I still hold it true. He knew how I was and just brushed it off. He even dismissed when I told him I was suicidal in high school. He hangs up on me telling me to do what I want.

I get another call the next day from my brother asking me what happened. He brushes off our step-mother's message like that's okay and moves on. I'm not given much of a chance to voice how truly hurtful that was and how I refuse to be in an ultimatum. I tell him that no one has asked about the guy and he says it doesn't change anything. No matter what I say, there is only the idea that I'm going to be hurt in this scenario. He rambles on about how everyone just cares and that maybe I said things I didn't mean. We hang up.

That night, my brother's girlfriend and a close friend of mine calls me. Usually, she is patient and understanding and kind. Someone I can finally speak to without feeling like I am being talked over. Instead, she does like everyone else. Aggressively telling me I am rude, disrespectful, ignorant and that I just need to ""bite the bullet"" and do what they want. She says I'm disappointing her and that she's never seen this ""disrespectful"" side of me. She tells me that I'm giving her awful anxiety because she takes a test the day I leave and I'm going to ruin it for her. She tells me that I'm going to fuck up my mental health and I've done so well since my breakup. I had been talking to my current boyfriend then, platonically, and learning to accept my pain and understand it better. He is a big reason why my mental health is better. She also didn't understand how I could know the guy for around the same time as my ex. Apparently, you can't have relationships with people who you aren't dating. She tells me my father is beside himself and my brother can't sleep and how could I be so selfish. She cries twice and when I apologise for her crying, she quickly tells me I'm being insincere. I give up talking since I have nothing I believe I can say.

My boyfriend wrote a very lovely word doc about who he is and his side of the situation to my father and sent it to him, my brother and his girlfriend to make sure someone read it. My brother called him and they talked for a while. They have no problems with him coming here, but me going there is a no. My boyfriend had listened to all the conversations and told my brother respectfully how aggressive he was and how I actually felt. He even told him how I don't want to stay here, which my brother didn't reply to. None of this was done with my knowledge until afterward. He's his own person, and he's helped me more from that than anything. Nothing changed though.

So, here I am now. That last phone call was 4 days ago and my flight is set to leave in 2 days. No one has contacted me and I haven't contacted them. I now need to make the decision to go or stay, wondering if I need to distance myself from my family either way. My heart is heavy and I need some guidance.

Tldr; Told family I was going on a trip to Canada to meet someone I've known for 3 years but haven't met in person. Everyone freaks out and is aggressive and calls me a lot of awful things and I'm given financial ultimatums. Trying to decide to go on the trip and if I distance myself from my family either way.",19May2019,2
747,"So, I've recently became overwhelmed with paranoia and don't know how to combat it. I'm sorry if this is cliche, but I'm paranoid that I'm making those closest to me hate me or, at least, start to not want me around. Trying to ask about it has only made it worse.

I'm terrified that if I keep asking, the paranoia may become reality and I don't know what else I can do at this point to try to get rid of it, other than continuing to mention it. Are there any mental excises that can help reduce it? Or should I just keep inquiring until it goes away?",19May2019,1
748,"My current job has been a nightmare. I’ve been trying to quit for about a year now and found a perfect opportunity elsewhere. I’ve applied, taken and passed the entrance exam, and now am awaiting a call for the interview. My bosses are aware of the application but my exit will come at a great loss for the company. I’m not integral but the company is small and my department struggles the most production wise. I’ve learned the processes pretty well in the 2 years I’ve been employed and I’m training new girls but they’re not ready to fly solo right now. 

Pregnant co-worker announced her news about a month after I applied to the other job. I work directly under her and I help her the most in our department. She is depending on me to take over when she goes on maternity leave. To be honest she has not been the best to me and others. She’s one of the main reasons I started looking for another job. She’s toxic and cruel. Every person who has come and gone from our department has had complaints about her but she’s been with the company for 10 years and the bosses need her so they look the other way. Even though she sucks, I’ve always been comforted by knowing I’m a good person and not like her. I try to go out of my way and lift the people she brings down since I know how she is. 

Second co-worker (also in my department and one of the new girls. She’s cool as fuck too) just suffered a terrible loss. Her mother passed away suddenly in a car accident. She’s been off for a few days and I’m not sure she’s coming back (don’t blame her if she doesn’t). We are 3 now (including me) in a department that needs at least 5. 

I feel terrible about quitting at this time as it’s bad timing but the process has already begun. I’m going to leave the pregnant co-worker with some months of intense stress and the new girls alone when she goes on maternity leave. I know it’s not my problem but I can’t help but feel like I should take some responsibility in making my exit as graceful as possible. 

Is there anything I can do? Am I an asshole for quitting?",19May2019,1

750,"I have always been an average student, got Bs and Cs. Somehow I made it into Alevels and completed both years (first year ages 16-17, second year 17-18) my school kind of pressured me into going to uni and tbh I had no other options. As a 17 year old I had no idea what I want to do and being 18 I still don’t know. I’m currently at uni studying accounting and finance and I hate it sooooooo much. I revise yet don’t understand anything which makes me not wanna revise anymore. Not only do I hate the course but I don’t feel like I’ve made any good friends. I feel like all my friendships with classmates are empty and I know if I left I wouldn’t continue being friends with them. I REALLLLLLY want to leave but I have no idea what to do instead. I feel like I have no interest or hobbies and I hate myself so much.",19May2019,1
752,"So, I guess I will try to give as much background information as I can (without boring you all to death). My mother gave up parental rights of me and my siblings (due to my biological father being abusive + drugs) when I was 6 years old. I then went into CPS, where I went from foster home to foster home. Eventually, at the age of 7,  a family that also had a sibling of mine, decided to take me in as well. I guess they liked me enough to keep me around until the age of 10, which is when they decided to adopt both of us.  

Shortly after, my adopted mom lost her childhood best friend, and she also started menopause. At the time, I was maybe 12 or so when her and I started to have a LOT of issues. Looking back at it now (as an elementary teacher and someone who has taken a lot of child development classes) I realized I suffered a lot of abuse from her. She was very mean to me, she would point out my imperfections and she never ever said nice things about me. Instead, she would point out that I had a zit, or say that I needed to lose weight, things like that. She also frequently called me a bitch and said I am disgusting. I would also like to point out the fact I was a teenager, so honestly, I probably did and said things that were mean too, but I NEVER called her names, and always tried to follow the rules she had laid out for me. 

 When I was 14, she threatened to give away her rights as my parent ""unadopt me"", so I actually ran away for a day. Instead of walking into the school, I waited until my adopted dad drove away so that I could go somewhere else. Since it was raining, I basically just stayed in a dumpster all day... I know, it's stupid, I was 14 though and scared at the thought of being abandoned again. Eventually, I came home. Police officers were there, and of course my adopted mom denied her ever saying that to me.

 That event caused a lot of issues with my parents, which is really sad because I am a HUGE people pleaser. I have always sought ways to show my adopted parents how grateful I am that they adopted me, I always wanted to make them happy and proud of me. I never did drugs, made straight A's, and I didn't even leave the house much as a teenager because my mom would say that me leaving her made her feel ""lonely"" and that she wanted me to stay home. 

At the age of 19, I came home from a long 13 hour shift and my dresser was knocked over. My adopted mother said that it wasn't clean enough, and that I needed to fix it right away. THAT was a HUGE game changer for our relationship. For the first time in my life, I unloaded on her. I called  her out for every wrongdoing I could imagine, (which included the fact she sold her wedding ring and went to go live with some guy she met online for a year back when I was 11 years old) . During this argument, my adopted mom was screaming at my adopted dad to come defend her. He didn't budge, and honestly, I believe it's because he knew I was in the right.  I couldn't take it anymore, so I packed up what I could and moved out to live with my boyfriend at the time. 

For an entire year, my adopted mother refused to speak to me. During this time, my adopted dad had to meet up with me at restaurants, or have me come to his work in order to visit him. I wasn't allowed to be at the house. After that year was up, my adopted mom decided to let me back into her life. I of course had to apologize for everything, she has never ever taken blame/said sorry to me for anything. 

A few years went by, and I felt like we had a better relationship, although it felt pretty artificial. I tried my best to never do anything that I knew would upset them, I brought them food and would try my best to make them happy. 

Let's fast forward to December of 2017 where I am 24 years old. I don't know if you guys have heard of the love languages, but I'm pretty sure hers is gift giving. Anyways, that's important because I told her that I didn't really care about the gifts, what I wanted was for us all to relax and just enjoy the holidays. I told her that the way she acts around the holiday season is hostile because she is so stressed, and that I didn't like it. I guess I was hoping for us to work on this, maybe make the holidays better, but NOPE. She told me to never talk to her again. I called her and my adopted dad nonstop for days, and neither of them answered. Eventually, she just blocked my number. After a few months, I quit calling my dad as much. Then, I just quit calling them. I figured ya know what, my mom did this before, so maybe she just needed another year of the silent treatment. I cried about it often and would ask others for advice, but nothing really helped. 

Because of this, they missed my graduation with a bachelor's degree. Even though I am the only child to have a degree (in their own family and  with my brother)  they didn't care because I chose to be a teacher. That was something my dad was always mad at me for. He wanted me to be a nurse, or something else that made ""real money"".  They continued to ignore me. In the fall of 2018, I sent them a card. I said sorry again, and updated them on my life. I told them that I loved and missed them (I moved to another state after college) they never responded to the card. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, just this last month, I finally had the opportunity (due to financial stress) to go back to my hometown. They didn't didn't answer the door. I then sat in my car and called my adopted dad maybe 6 times or so (I had a new number, so he didn't know it was me) he answered the phone, asking who it was. He told me that they are moving to another town and won't  be back for a week. He said that maybe I can see him when I plan on coming back in June. Throughout the conversation, I heard my adopted mom say things like ""don't tell her anything!!!"" in the background,she was very obviously upset he was talking to me. I told my adopted dad that I loved and missed them... maybe 8 times or so, and only said ""ok"" back to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that phone call, he never answered the phone again. I recently heard from a family friend that they want nothing to do with me or my brother. So, in short, they have decided to disown us. I have been having a very difficult time accepting this. I think back at the times I was in my room crying, looking at a picture of my biological mom, and my adopted mom would come storming in, ripping up the picture and telling me ""I'm your mom now,  get over her!"" just for her to disown me? Why would she do that to me? I don't understand it.  

The conclusion that I have come to is that they adopted us for the money. Apparently, in the state I'm from, that got about $500 per kid every month until we turned 18, along with big tax cuts. At the age of 18, my mom did buy me suitcases and told me I should think about moving out soon, so maybe it really was just for the money?  Maybe they tried to  be good people, and that's why they allowed me to be in their life a few years past the age of 18? Maybe they never loved me?

It's also important to note that my brother (the sibling they chose to adopt with me) has also felt this feeling of disconnection, as if they didn't really care much about us, or want to be close to us. Ex: Anytime I was super affectionate, they would act very weird about it and often turn it down and laugh it off, like it was weird or something to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

My biological mother  (biological dad was murdered) and I have recently started talking a lot more than ever before, so it is nice to have a motherly figure, I really do love her, however I am still deeply hurt from the situation with my adopted parents. I recently realized that I  DO have a pretty great life, I just need to change my mindset in order to enjoy it more. I need to somehow accept the situation with my adopted parents, and learn to trust others again. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I accomplish this?  Should I just focus on my relationship with my biological mom now? How can I accept this abandonment?  I have always thought of my life as an adult with my adopted parents. I envisioned them being proud of me, and helping them in their old age. I didn't take a gap year during college like I wanted to for my adopted parents. I didn't go out and hang out with people as much because it made my adopted mom feel lonely. I didn't wear blue nail polish because my adopted dad hated it (he said it was slutty?lol what). I didn't do drugs, make bad grades, be disrespectful all the time, etc... I feel as if I did everything ""by the book"" in order to be a good daughter. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I made my mistakes, but I have heard about way worse scenarios from my friends where their parents forgave them,, and the only thing I can think of is that they don't want me anymore and cannot accept my mistakes because I am their adopted daughter, not biological.  I guess the good thing about this is that the relationship I had with my adopted mother has always been very unhealthy, so it's probably best we don't communicate. 

&amp;#x200B;

BTW, sorry if me saying ""adopted mom/dad"" was a little much, I am working on disassociating the mom/dad title to them to the best of my abilities because it is helping me cope a little bit. A;lso, in case anyone asks, my adopted dad only yelled at me maybe 2 times and has always been understanding and nice, the polar opposite of my adopted mom. I feel as if he is just doing whatever he can now to make my adopted mom happy, especially because they are older and nobody wants to die alone.",19May2019,43
753,"I have been wanting to wear a head scarf like my beautiful African American sisters do. 
Only thing is, I’m Mexican. I sometimes wrap up my hair and enjoy it for a minute before taking it off before heading out. I am terrified about what they will think of me. In my head, I feel they will judge me and laugh. I haven’t really seen anyone else wear head scarfs like that and I love it. 

My husband is African American and Hawaiian. I guess I’m gonna ven more worried because I feel and always see people looking at us in not so happy ways. He loves you when I put it up but I cannot get past the fact that I am afraid someone will say something.
