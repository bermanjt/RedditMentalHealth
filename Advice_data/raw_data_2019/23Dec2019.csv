5 years ago a girl had a crush on me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me pon there) and I’m scared she won’t like me anymore",23Dec2019,1
1,"Essentially, I’ve been dating this girl for like 6 months now. Before dating we were good friends and had some nice time together. 

She’s kind of an anxious person who I suspect have a borderline personality disorder. Even though I asked her to get help, her parents can’t afford it right now. There have been some episodes when she got insecure or felt rejected and attacked me personally. One time she was really drunk and even called me really bad things like piece of shit, garbage and etc. 

This week she’s staying in her parents place in another city. I think that the distance got her really insecure and she started offending me a lot. Because of that, I cancelled a trip that we had planned and then things got really worse. I think she gets that I’m thinking about breaking up and is trying to get in my head, saying that maybe I broke up with 3 past gfs cause I’m the problem; that she’s gonna make me feel lonely at college and tell our friends I’m an asshole, basically. 

I’m really hurt because of all of this and want to break up. I feel things are getting really abusive, but I’m afraid of breaking up cause I don’t know what she’ll do afterwards. What should I do? 

Thanks everybody",23Dec2019,1
2,okay this may seem like a troll post but it’s not. my friend lives about 8 hours away from me and he always pisses off me and my other friends on xbox so i started jokingly saying that i was gonna send him my feces in the mail. me and his cousin decided to go through with it so my question is how do i send him my poop?,23Dec2019,1
3,"I'm relatively popular, and I think she's resentful of this. She makes passive comments on how she wished someone would acknowledge her and what she does and make *her* popular, and the likes. Can't help feeling like she's implying I should do this for her. We're both in our early twenties, so this behavior is kind of childish.

Maybe it's naìve of me to want to not think this way, but she's been kind of passive aggressive lately. I've encountered a few other people like this, though they were not at all subtle in the beginning. She had framed it as just wanting to be friends with me, and I like having friends! So I guess I fell for it?

I don't know. I've had people in my life be openly jealous of my success, like it's somehow my own fault they don't have what I have. I worked my ass off to get where I'm at, and there's still a ways to go. They seem to see it as just me being given everything on a silver platter, or I somehow got here overnight.

What should I even do? I'm lost. I really do consider her a friend, but if she's just trying to use me, than I don't know.

I'm sure if I confront her on this, she'll just deny it and be offended by my even suggesting it. I could be even more passive aggressive and make comments on how I hope people don't befriend me just for their own benefit and the likes, which is a genuine fear, but I don't want to stoop to that level.

Any and all advice is appreciated, thank you.",23Dec2019,1
4,"I was waiting on a station platform waiting for a train when a man approached me and asked if he could pull my hair, before giving it a sharp tug. I have long straight hair, but there is nothing unique or unusual about it.
I've been wondering, why would someone feel inclined to do this?",23Dec2019,1
5,"i really think I need my own room but my mom thinks I’m being materialistic.

ok, so basically I live in this regular sized house with 3 bedrooms. The master bedroom, a medium sized room, and a relatively small room. My grandma has the medium room, and my sisters and my mom and I have the master bedroom. My dad has the small room because he and my mom are pretty much divorced. They hate each other, so my dad refuses to share a bed with my mom. There are only 2 beds in the master bedroom. My bed and one like queen sized bed for my sisters and my mom. It’s a really tight space so it’s really messy. I’ve been trying to convince my dad and mom to give me the small room, so that my dad sleeps on my bed in the master bedroom. The problem is, I come off as rude and my dad thinks I’m crazy for suggesting that, and my mom calls me materialistic and selfish. I don’t know what position I’m in here.",23Dec2019,1
6,"TL;DR at the end.

I had an enormous crush on this coworker, who we'll call D in this story. A year later, D was promoted to a managerial position and often picked me to be his assistant. Helping him run the show, assigning me on special projects, etc. He was also never shy about complimenting me, when it came to my personal appearance and my work ethic. In short, D made it obvious that I was his favorite.

He found another job a few weeks ago. We agreed to keep in touch and hang out after he left. 

Now, let me tell you. D was a great person, but he wasn't the best manager. More on that next. 

This morning, my other manager and my coworker were talking about him. The District Manager called since D said some scathing things about his experience here. I remember D telling me this on one of our excursions, and I pretty much egged him on about that.

So my coworker said some more scathing things about him: how he always hid in the office and barely managed. He was always horrible at monitoring breaks and lunches, and often sent people home early when the store was trashed. *And even that he took pictures of women's asses and showed it to other guys.*

Ever had that feeling where just one moment completely changes your perception of that person? Well, that's exactly what I felt right there. 

Later on, another coworker aired more of his dirty laundry out to me. How he still has hang ups over his toxic ex. Chatting up most of the female coworkers, even the ones that he's talked shit about to me. Claiming that his toxic ex removed all his female contacts (which I did know about, but he ended up re-adding me)

In retrospect, maybe all that ""favoritism"" was just him using me so he can do jack shit in the office. What bothers me even more is this: What if he was aware I liked him and exploited that for his own ends?

I'm just lost on what to do next. Confront him about it? Cut off all contact? Pretend everything's fine and move on? 

TL;DR: Coworker who I had a crush on was a horrible manager, and allegedly did some sus stuff. I'm at a gridlock here and I already feel like I said too much. Just paint my clown makeup on, fam.",23Dec2019,1
8,"Hi redditors. In order for you to understand the situation I'm in and what I need advice with I will try to explain what happened as clearly as I can and with as few words as I can. Some parts of this might seem dramatized but it is exactly how it happened. You'll probably read a lot of corny shit but well, I guess that's how this stuff works...

&amp;#x200B;

So, in November 2018 I start attending a course at this place. There, and in another course that started some months earlier, there's this gorgeous girl. At that point she was just another beautiful girl and tbh she wasn't really my style at the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I only saw her like 20 minutes per day during breaks and I had never spoken to her but by around March I found myself thinking about her a lot... This was rather strange because as I said before I had never talked to her and I had been in love with the same girl for around 8 years at the time. I start to realize what was happening and how it made sense since she seemed really nice, she dressed super well and she was really pretty as well as smart. Few weeks after I started accepting the fact she had messed my head I decided I should talk to her. At this point two problems rise, we had been hearing that their course was ending soon and I'm as big as an introvert as it gets and I had never talked to a complete stranger and told her I was interest in her, all the relationships I built before were almost always with classmates and came in naturally and not out of the blue. For example, before telling a girl I was interested in her we would already have talked before and get to know each other, this time it wouldn't be the case.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing she would always get to the place we studied like 15 mins late I started retarding my arrival too to try and meet her so I could talk to her. It wasn't really working... Then comes a day in June where she's actually there when I turn the corner, for a split second I'm like the happiest dude on Earth but then it hits me that I have to talk to her. I decided I would do it another day so I get in the building, validate my presence checking card and stop there. Somehow, someway I actually got the courage, walked out and went to meet her. As soon as she looks at me, well, that's where it went to shit. Prepare to cringe and/or laugh at my misery:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""You're \*introduce her name\*, right?""

&amp;#x200B;

She: ""Yes""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Well, sorry, I'm just a bit nervous, never done this before so..."" (which is true)

&amp;#x200B;

She: ""Are you ok?"" (I probably looked nervous as shit)

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Well, yea, I just think you're really pretty (She interrupts me with an ""Okaaaaaay..."", this shit fucking killed me), you seem nice, I like your smile, your style and I would like to get to know you better...""

&amp;#x200B;

She: ""We can definitely talk but if you mean it as a date, I have a boyfriend""

&amp;#x200B;

She could have done/said almost anything and I would have an answer in mind, only thing I probably wasn't ready for was she telling me she was gay. In this case I would just say like ""Lucky guy he is"" but I was so in tilt at this point that all I said was ""Oh, sorry"" and turned away.

&amp;#x200B;

I take like 3/4 steps and she asks me ""What's your name?""

I turn and tell her ""X, not ""Y"" as teacher \*insert teacher that was common to both our classes\* calls me..."". She probably didn't realize why I said this but back in March there was a time me, she and that said teacher were at the place were studying's bar and he was saying she was really pretty, then he turns to me who was just on their side, calls me by the wrong name (""Y"", which is kinda similar to ""X"") and asks ""Don't you think \*insert her name here\* looks beautiful today?"". Of course my introvert nerd ass answered ""Yes..."" as if he was dying from a painful death.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, that teacher is kinda of a meme from the shit he posts and we both actually ended up laughing and she says ""Yea, he's kinda like that"". And right after, and probably stupid of me, I ask her if we could keep what happened just between the two of us, which she responds with ""Oh yea, definitely.""

&amp;#x200B;

From that point on every time we crossed we would always say ""Hi"" but we never really had any extensive talk, I never grew the courage to actually try and speak to her. In September her course ends and I thought ""well, maybe I'll forget her now..."". 

&amp;#x200B;

We're now in December and it feels like I like her more than ever, legit have never felt this way... Actually saw her in the 9th when I had to go to the place and take a test which probably didn't help.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now the thing I really wanted your advice on is the following: As I think we all do when we're interested in someone, I managed to find her facebook profile. What I was thinking was sending her an apologize note through a facebook message mentioning what happened some months ago, saying it stuck to me and that I shouldn't have put her through that (Which i vively believe in and that I wished I would have told her). And going to be honest with you, this would also work as a last ditch attempt type of thing and if she didn't answer or didn't seem interested at all I would just try to move on for good, thing that I really don't think I actively tried to be honest.

&amp;#x200B;

Biggest problem I have with this is the fact she doesn't have a profile pic, I know that is her facebook profile because of common friends and I don't want it to come across as if I creeped out or pulled some Russian hacker shit.

&amp;#x200B;

For what's worth I was 23 (she's like 2/3 years younger than me I would guess) and I'm an above average looking guy. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question if whether or not I should do it and if yes what you think I should say.

&amp;#x200B;

I could talk to my friends about this but I fear their opinion wouldn't be as rational as I would want it to be, I'm lucky enough to have amazing friends and they would just want to see me be happy and try this shit without thinking much about it so here I am, anonymously asking you people for advice.

9,It's a long story but here we go. So this pass weekend I threw a party and there was this girl I'm trying to get with. Well she rejects me and goes for my friend. She and my friend asks multiple times if they can fuck in my room. Well later I walk in on them fucking in my dad's office and I dont know what to do. I feel depressed not only did she go for my friend but later find out that she fucked my brother weekend prior. Another quick thing I should add is that my brother gets pussy whenever without trying.band if it's not really that they fucked but it's that I have a social anxiety And I'm not really confident to talk to girls in general. I have twice and both rejected me. They were both older than me 16f and 17f as me being a 15m. I know not a lot of people are going to see this but I want help. I don't know what to do. I'm not really confident about my self and how look.,23Dec2019,1
10,"So I’m 15 and around a year ago I got my first bank account and debit card. 

Long story short I’m absolutely addicted to spending my money and sometimes I will spend hundreds of dollars per week on useless things. (Take-out, in-game-purchases on video games, candy, donating to random fundraisers, etc) and now I’m actually starting to lose money fast and I really need to stop this habit.

Can anyone recommend how I could stop myself from spending so much money without having to disable my bank card altogether?",23Dec2019,1
11,"My best friend, we just admitted our feelings to each other, we talk everyday. We care, love, listen, offer advice, and are very honest with each other. Ever since he admitted it as well as I, I just can’t help but let my heart race and I just want to hug him for hours at a time. My love for him multiplied three times from before, because I had doubts that he had felt the same. Now I know the truth and I can’t help but stop thinking about him. Right now he’s biking in the pouring rain, and I just don’t want him out there, I want to know he’s safe I just want him right by my side. I feel like I’m being overprotective and I may be worrying too much. He told me that he would call me when gets back but I just can’t quit worrying!!! I’m so anxious right now, how can I calm down?",23Dec2019,1
12,"(I'm very sorry if this comes out as a wall of text)

Okay, to preface. I am still fairly young, 2 years out of high school. I have worked from factory to factory, job to job and haven't found anything meaningful that I actually enjoy doing. I want to help others and be the best person I can yet no one seems to agree with me. I recently got hired as a part time care giver, my fiance set me up with this position and she loves it. I figure that it can't be too bad. 

I haven't started this job yet, but something that pays, that will get me by and I can help the elderly would be greatly fulfilling! I am a big part of my church and I, along with my fiance, host fundraisers, parties, and events at church to see the smiles on peoples faces, the laughter of children, and knowing that I am doing something that means something. Knowing that I can be a positive influence for others is a blessing, just as helping people in need is. Not to get too religious, I know this is not the place for that, but I know that I'm doing the right things. This has brought me more joy than anything.

To get to the point now: My family, who is paying for my college (partly) does not agree with anything that I want to do that won't make me rich, or at least, extremely wealthy. I can't even talk about something remotely positive that I'd like to do without getting shut down with, ""That's irrelevant, find something that can make you money and we'll talk."" My family is not rich by any means but they view that as the epitome of success for some reason. I want enough money to be comfortable, but most importantly to do more for others. It may sound dumb or childish, but it's the only thing that makes me feel good inside. I'm not fulfilled by money or material things. There's nothing wrong with that by any means, but It's not for me. 

I am currently going to college for Cyber Security. It's been an interest of mine for many years now and the only thing that has a decent paycheck, I can get out of college fairly quickly with (without costing too much), and is actually interesting to me. 

It's very discouraging to be told constantly that what I'm doing is stupid, that I could make so much money elsewhere. No one understands how I can be fulfilled by good deeds rather than a big paycheck. 

I know that the answer to this is, ""Do what thou wilt."" I just need to get this off my chest as it's very frustrating when I do all that I can to be a better man and get talked down to for it. Any advice? I can't just tell my family off and leave forever. Thanks reddit, I appreciate it. \~Snow",23Dec2019,1

Assuming the person in question isn't a creeper, but a nice person that you just haven’t ‘clicked’ with initially. Is giving someone another chance just stringing them along, or is it best to cut things off after the first outing if you know deep down that you aren’t really connecting? Thank you ☺️",23Dec2019,1
15,"So today was my 18th birthday, which where I am means I can legally drink. I’ve always been really close with my Dad, and we’ve always had an agreement that on my 18th I’d buy him and myself a pint. Well the day came and went and it was an alright day, but I got home around half eleven (early but there were reasons which aren’t important here), and he was on the couch. We had been in the pub where he took me to eat as a kid, and he seemed mad. I then realised, I never bought him a pint. 

It seems like a small thing maybe, but I know it means to him. The man raised me on his own for a lot of the time. Gave up a lot to give me a good life. He knows I love him and I’ve said sorry as best I can but god I feel so shit, he’s given me so much and deserves better. I didn’t mean to hurt him I just wasn’t thinking.

I can get past 2 parts of it, but the 3rd and last part of it is impossible. That said, when others keep trying they eventually do it. One guy said ""It was really hard. It took me like 45 minutes to do it.""

So I'm not here to hear you say ""keep trying, just do this, just do that"" because that's not the point. I shouldn't have to go to anyone else. I'm supposed to do certain things on my own. And I can't for some reason. And it feels horrible, because when people say ""you can do it"" it's like they aren't listening to what I'm saying. I'm past the point of trying. I did try. The expected result was not reached. Changing things up, analyzing what went wrong, none of that worked. So why can't anyone believe some people are stuck?

Don't give me that ""Well if you believe it, it is true"" bullshit either. Fuck you if you do. Because when trying I did believe. And it still didn't work. 

Why can't people believe me when they say I tried? And what do I do about this?",23Dec2019,1
17,"I really need an outsiders perspective and advice.

So, I got a little irritated at my girlfriend but she said that I have no right to be.

I have depression and anxiety, I also have a condition called fibromyalgia. Now the past week I’ve had something called a flare up which is when my symptoms are really bad and I tend to be in pain and bed bound. For whatever reason, yesterday night I had a bit of a nervous breakdown and ended up in hospital following a ptsd attack and then a panic attack. The hospital weren’t really helpful so I felt kind of low and took a handful of sleeping pills, I had no intent to harm myself I just wanted to sleep for at least 24hours

Anyway, my partner knows I’ve been feeling a little low lately and she also suffers with mental health, last week she had a breakdown so I left my friends house at 5am in the morning and went straight to her to comfort her and be there for her.

When I spoke to my partner this morning and told her about what happened she agreed to come and see me, I really was feeling sad and needed a hug. I was kinda looking forward to seeing her and just feeling safe.

Anyway, she calls me a few hours later and asks if it’s ok if she spends time with a friend so I said that’s fine, she said she would see me straight after. So I’m like yeah that’s ok. It was no issue, I just slept some more. Anyway I woke up about 8pm and she calls me an hour later and asks if it’s ok if she goes and continues her night with her friends drinking. I mean firstly we planned to spend the day together anyway, secondly she’s been saying she would come and see me today all week and thirdly she rather get drunk then see me as planned. So I was like yeah whatever cool because I’d never want to dictate what someone does but I’m hurting and feeling super disappointed as we planned today in advance and hello I had a nervous breakdown and really need you right now?

I’m so hurt, am I overreacting? By the way we’re in our mid 20’s and it’s early days of our relationship but I have always been present on her bad days and I’d like the same back.

We read comics together, we went to the Star Wars premiere together too, we laugh a lot on each others jokes, we can speak about almost anything and never feel uncomfortable, etc. 

The thing is we already had sex. Pretty good sex, I would say (he's a Scorpio hahaha). And idk I just don't feel he is interested in me for a relationship. I really like him a lot, but sometimes when I tell him things like ""omg, today was amazing thank you for going to the party with me"" he just avoids the convo. Also, he just never tells me like ""pretty"" things. But, when we see each other he looks at me with those deep eyes and I can feel (or at least imagine I can feel) he likes me. We don't hold hands or kiss in public tho, and when we kiss it immediately turns into a sexual thing... Idk, that makes me a little bit uncomfortable 'cause I would like kisses without this sexual thing too.

When I've had fuck buddies it's a very sexual relationship (at least that's how things work in Mexico haha), we never go out on dates or talk 24/7 on IM or whatsapp like I do with him. They don't drive 1 hour to see me and meet my friends when I ask them, etc.

So, does he like me?, at least a little bit haha. What should I do to show him that I'm interested in something more sentimental? How can I ask him if he's just interested in being friends with benefits? 

I hope someone could help me with a good advice, thank y'all!!!! &lt;3",23Dec2019,1

Two years later, am 27 years old weighing 54-57kg and my mum isn’t happy. I told her that I am happy with my body but she isn’t.

Usually I'd eat at work one meal. (Pancakes/a small burger etc) 

Once I get home though, I'm too tired to cook and even feel full (despite not eating for five hours or more). Due to this I've lost weight quickly and my moods just drop.

What nutrition/foods should I turn to even when I'm too fatigued to eat? (Student budget friendly lol)",23Dec2019,1

26,"A year ago my dad and stepmother kicked me out of the house so now I live with my grandma. At first it was nice and I felt much happier without all of the constant fighting and arguing that was going on at my dad's house, but for the past few months me and and grandma have been fighting constantly. My grandma is almost 80 years old, extremely hard of hearing and also visually impaired (blind in one eye). She has also recently developed heart problems and got a pacemaker. Because of her health problems, she has retired and is now at home all day everyday of the week. 

I feel like we are constantly fighting due to miscommunication and her inability to hear anything I say. She can't afford to get a hearing aid and I'm not sure how else I can learn to communicate with her. I'm currently in college and have no money to help her buy one. Every night at dinner she asks about my day and school and everything but she still can't hear or understand anything I say to her even though we are sitting across from each other at the table. Obviously this is very frustrating for both of us and it's to the point now where I don't even want to talk to her because it feels like work (even though I know she can't help it). It's also frustrating because everything is so loud in our house. She turns the TV up as loud as it will go, she has a radio that she turns all the way up, and we basically scream at each other every time we have something to say. 

She also constantly says to me that I am selfish and ungrateful because I don't help pay for things, even though I don't have any money because all the money I have I spend on car insurance and college. I don't have a job during the school year and she also doesn't want me to get a job during the school year so I can keep my grades up, but she is also beginning to resent me for not helping pay for groceries or other bills. I get a part time job over the summer and save up money for my car insurance and also to pay for the classes I take over the summer (900-2000 dollars depending on how many I take), but normally I don't have much money left over. I tried working and doing school full-time during my first year of college and I had to quit my job because I didn't have enough time to study and my grades were dropping.

I am just trying to graduate from college and get a job so I can move out on my own, but how can I stop these arguments we keep having while I have to live with her?",23Dec2019,1
27,"Short backstory: My ex (38F) and I (39M) had been together for 19 years. She had an emotional affair then broke up with me a little over 2 years ago. After the separation, she kept texting and emailing me and I was politely responding. Then she sent me a long email in which she pushed all the responsibility of her actions and the breakup on me. I replied to her that I was angry and that I didn't want to have anything to do with her anymore. She played victim again but I didn't take that bait and kept no-contact.

4 days ago, I received an envelope from her in the mail. I am still angry at her, 2 years later. I thought about putting the envelope back in the mail (return to sender), just putting it in the trash, burning it... or just opening and reading it.

I hate that she sent it to me. Now I have this decision to take and I feel that there are no good choices. I affects me no matter what I do. Why the fuck can't she just leave me alone like I asked? 

So reddit... what do I do: Read it? Send it back? Destroy it?",23Dec2019,1
28,"Let me start by saying this is the first time using reddit. That being said, I have a lot on my mind and have zero idea of what to do with myself. 

A bit of backstory to start, I’ve struggled for a long time with my mental health and I’ve spent a lot of time in therapy, including 2 separate times that I was hospitalized short-term for a suicide attempts. I started struggling with wanting to live when I was 10, and was hospitalized for the first time when I was 12. I spent a week in the hospital, was diagnosed with severe major depressive disorder and prescribed some anti-depressant that I’d never remember the name of. I went home and went right back a month later. Throughout this whole time I was struggling to stay clean from ambien and oxycodone. I had started using them when I was 10, after my uncle asked me to get them from my grandma’s house. 

Fast forward 3 years, I’m on probation for more shit then I care to type out, and I’m just a full blown fucking junkie. I’m doing literally any downer that I can get my hands on. I’m stealing from my dad’s prescriptions, I’m robbing and stealing to buy Percocet, I’m selling other drugs, etcetera.  I’ve been in outpatient rehab 3 times with no success. I overdosed when I was 13 on mucinex and ambien with a house arrest monitor on my ankle and would have died, had my dad not drove me to the hospital when he did. So I’m fifteen and my dad finds a bag of random pills and a pistol under my futon, so he calls the police. They take my shit and put me back on house arrest, and three days later I cut my monitor off and go on run, and I get arrested three days later. I was arrested with pills and a gun on me, and was told I was facing 13 counts of felony possession of a schedule four narcotic, possession of a firearm, fleeing a scene, false information, and two more assaults. I do 9 months and complete a rehab program so they let me out. 3 months later I’m thinking I’m just gonna play the game, get off papers, and get back on drugs, right? No. I get a phone call from my girlfriend at the time, and she’s pregnant. So I start trying to get my life together and go to school but me and her break up because she had tried to stab me, and I start dating another girl. So she decided to tell me I can’t see my son, and I go two years without seeing him, unable to afford a lawyer. Now I have another child, who’s six months old. Two boys, I’ll put a picture of the younger one, as I still can’t see the first one. 

I caught my second son’s mom cheating on me in October 2018, right before we found out about Oliver. I stayed with her, because I’m a dipshit. We stayed together until August of this year. In August, we moved into an apartment that I had gotten us (my son was born in May, I was the only one working and it was a really, really big deal to us) and the night we moved in I caught her talking to the guy she cheated on me with. I kicked her out, but I’m still struggling with everything. It’s been 3 months but I still think about everything all the time. I have nobody to lean on. My dad and I don’t get along and my mom left when I was two. I work all the time and can’t find a counselor with a schedule that works for me. I have no friends, I don’t talk to anybody. I just feel really alone. I’m struggling with wanting to relapse on drugs, really really badly. 

I don’t really know what I’m looking for with this post. Just looking to get it out there I guess. If you have advice, I appreciate it a lot. If you don’t, I really appreciate you reading.

30,"So, as the title mentions, I'm seriously struggling to get over an ex. It's been a little over three years since we stopped talking and I still can't stop thinking about about them, becoming quite depressed a lot of the time. I think the reason it's effected me so much is because at the time I was quite a lonely person, so when we got together, all my time was poured into them. The relationship essentially became my personality. 

There have been a few times that I thought I've been all good and gotten over them, yet I'll see someone or something that would remind me of them and I'm back to square one. I've tried talking to people about it to get it off my chest, I've tried finding hobbies and activities to take up my time as that's often recommended, I've attempted to get back into dating but I couldn't stick with anyone due to not being happy with them, and giving it time most definitely doesn't seem to be working. I just don't seem to be able to get over it.

I'm getting tired of it, as you can imagine, and I was just wondering if anyone had any other advice or tips to help me out a bit? I'm not too sure what else to do, really.

I am working on getting out, but I want to know how serious my side pain is and if I'm healing because two weeks seems like too long and I've got a full time job I can't take more than I day off of at once, so if this requires time off I might be out of a job.

34,"So there's this girl at my school. I've talked to her last year a a very long time (maybe half a year). I had told her around January 2019 I liked her. When I told her I love her she said she loved me to but that she was not ready at that moment. When we finished what we had to say we went in for a hug. I kissed her on the check and she kissed me back. We would keep on talking like friends. One day I had to walk home but I have soccer so I didn't go to practice that day and I asked the girl if she was walking home. She said she is and I said I would walk her home. As soon as we got to her home I had this very unique feeling. I held her back and kissed her. I thought it maybe made her feel awkward so I stopped. As soon as I stopped she went in for a kiss and we kept kissing, no we were not dating. Time passes by and she answers a text from her ex (they were still friends). He said ""where are you at"" he said this because they usually hang out. And I never mind that she hung out with him but when I saw what she answered that hit me hard. She answered back with ""In your heart."" That hit me like a ton of bricks. I think I was in the wrong at that time. We weren't date or anything so I think I was wrong for getting sad at that. Anyways a few more days pass and we texted each other. She texted me a sentence that never wanted to hear. ""I don't think I love you anymore."" I cried myself to sleep and it was the worst timing because the following day was my little brothers birthday. So the day of my brothers birthday we went to Disney Land. I did no think about the for most of the day because if I did my little brother would not have enjoyed his birthday. Near the end of the day the girl text me saying ""hey, look I'm sorry if I hurt your feeling but it was just a joke."" I answered back with an ""Ok."" She said ""really I'm sorry please it was just a joke."" I responded back saying ""I can't talk to you right now I'm trying to enjoy my little brothers birthday."" The week that we come back m and her talk and continue to talk for the rest of the month. Near the end of February she stops talking to me. I try and try to talk to her but she just doesn't pay attention. I tell my friends for some advice. They say ""leave her man."" ""She was a b***h."" ""F**k her."" Now I'm not a person to hate anyone so I try not to think about her. I block her on my snap, insta. But I never delete our messages on messenger. Everytime I thought about her I would got to messenger and read our old text. February to now,  early December of this year we talked. We had a gift exchange for one of my classes. I text her about the person I got because they are good friends. Out of nowhere she says ""I'm sorry, I know I hurt you, I was in a really bad mindset."" Now ever since that text I just haven't been doing well I still think about her, I still miss her, I still want to hug her, I want to yell out to her that I love her. Unfortunately I can't do that because she is now dating one of my good friends. I say to myself that I'm happy for them, that I wish them the best. But to be honest im still very heart broken. So I'm asking for help wether I should still talk to her or not? What should I do? What could I have done to make thing better? This is really getting to my head. I keep thinking of it and it make me cry, it make me feel sad.",23Dec2019,1

41,"In high school while waiting for the bus to leave I witnessed a girl sorta get bullied by another girl. She was trying to mess around with who I assumed was her friend by stealing her hat. The friend got super upset and ended up threatening everyone on the bus with her mafia family. It was awkward. 

To me it seems like she thought her friend was just joking around at first until things hot to heated. 

As the super awkward hermit I am, I felt bad for her and try talking to her. I thought i was just uncomfortable talking to another human because of my social anxiety but I think it more of a warning sign from the universe. At first she seemed like a fairly normal human but the more I got to her, the more abnormal she was. 

Im not judging her for anything she has done but I want to give you an idea of what I mean by abnormal. I will post this at the end. I feel like she is in alot of pain that I dont understand. But now that I have know her for many years now, I am just greatly uncomfortable around her and she keeps pushing herself into my life. What do I do? 

***

The abnormal behaviors;
1.) She has walked from her place to my parents (about 6 miles) to see me, without messaging me first. 
2.) I wasn't home because I was at work. She stayed about an hour talking to my parents and ended up asking them to borrow 500 dollars 
3.) The next day she did it again but before she got the front she hear someone in the backyard and almost hop the fence to see them. She thought it was me.
4.) She did this again the next day. But later, because my parents told her the first day that I was at work and would be home later. They didn't give her an exact time, but the 3rd day she waited in the small forest she had to walk past to get to my parents house.
1-4.) I never gave her their address btw
5.) She post very attention seeking post on FB. And starts up drama and fights often. I have unfollowed her accounts, she has created at least 4 now. I have not accepted her friend request before, but she keeps sending them and I feel guilty for ignoring. I'm not sure what I should say. 
6.) She has been married 3 times in a year. Those three seemed to only show an interest in her for their green card, once they had it, they left her
7.) She has 3 kids but one of them she doesnt talk about or even acknowledged existed. Maybe something horrible happened? 
8.) The state has taking both kids she acknowledges away because of abuse. 
9.) She has been in jail twice to my knowledge for child and alcohol abuse and for having and using weed (before it was legal in this state) and failing to stay sober after she was on probation 

Again, I hope it doesnt come off as me judging her. I try not to judge people because I understand crap happens, people make mistakes, and we react differently when they are mad, scared, or stressed. I feel like she has all the cards staked against her and she is just trying to her best. But even before all this happened, I felt uncomfortable around her. Am I a bad person for not wanting to help or be around her?",23Dec2019,1

He'll stop talking in the middle of a sentence and just look me dead in the eye, then look down at the floor. This happens multiple times during our interactions. I figured maybe he's just got social anxiety, no big deal. Then he started offering to buy me coffee, multiple times in our conversation, being kind of pushy. Then he would offer to pay me just for talking to him. He's started coming in more frequently, probably three times a week, and if he sees other customers in the store, he'll leave pretty quick. In our last interaction, I asked what he was doing for Christmas, just to be polite. He tells me, then says ""ideally I'd like to buy you a $300 pair of boots, but I know it's off limits"".

I went to McDonald's with my boyfriend last night and reminded him of how he said she was nice looking and how uncomfortable it made me, I just couldn't get it out of my head.

Although I don't see why considering she lives at home w/ family. I openly showed disapproval; how could I possibly be okay w/ her going out w/ stranger (mostly men) who are paying for her company. She offered to delete her account, but I insisted she simply do what she pleases (The issue being that she even considered doing something of that nature in the 1st place). She tried to accuse me of being controlling, or shaming her for getting money in such a manner. But I made it clear that I never told her what she could or could not do. I'd simply hope that she'd use her better judgment, and thing about the implications of it on our relationship. At the last moment, she ended up telling me that she's going through w/ a paid ""meet-up"" anyways; so I guess I was wrong. She said that it'd be strictly platonic, and even offered to share her location, switch her preference to only women, and check in during the ""meet-up"". I'm torn. I can't see how we can possibly sustain a long distance healthy LDR ( Even though I believe she genuinely loves me), when I know she's actively meeting up w/ other guys. I feel like she either honestly doesn't see anything wrong w/ it, or simply doesn't care about our relationship. I really do care for her, but something like this feels degrading, disrespectful, and inconsiderate. I expect everyone to say to leave her; but part of me really doesn't want to.

after knowing her for about a year, we were up really late after her bf had gone to sleep, and we spoke about rather intimate parts of our life e.g. family/trauma. after this 3 hour long conversation she hugs me for like a minute straight maybe longer. A few weeks go by, and the next time shes in town she says she wants to tell me something; she never got the chance to bc a lot of people were around. fast forward 2 weeks and she messages me about staying at her place in the city instead of with other friends that I normally do bc ""their place is dirty""

She ends the message with this short sentence:  ""We can share shampoo and other things.""

Am I reading too much into that? If I were to write a text offering my place to crash, I'd say ""you can use my shit if you need to"" or something like that. I feel like there's an insinuation there.

My mom does not grocery shop, her and my brother (adult) eat sandwiches for dinner every night or go to bed hungry. I get depressed every year going home for the holidays, I usually stay 3 days but I cant shake this  depression I feel. I got everyone Christmas gifts mostly warm clothes that they need, it wasn’t much, but 2-3 gifts each. I know I won’t get anything but it’s been years since I have so I truly don’t care anymore. They didn’t even put the tree up this year, and we won’t be having a Christmas dinner. I don’t have money honestly so I’ll be sitting there starving my ass off. There is no WiFi so it’s even worse. Yet they beg for me to come home every year...Does anyone else have this struggle or depression going home?",23Dec2019,1
53,"Normally I'm the type that doesn't get embarrassed about things,  I fell down the stairs when drunk once and hospitalised myself and never got embarrassed about it but this particular one is getting to me . This is maybe the first time I actually feel embarrassed about something.  

The story goes like this:  

I was at a club at university when all of a sudden a girl unintentionally backs up on to my Crotch for Maybe three seconds,  I got a semi almost immediately and because I was rather embarrassed about how easily it happened at the time I moved away as quick as I could ( I didn't realise erections could happen in an instant like that ) . Luckily it looked like she didn't realise 

Anyway , the bad part comes in when I start drunkenly telling the story to my flatmate , he thinks it's hilarious and I completely forget that he is good friends with this Girl . Of course now The Girl , Her friends and my entire friendship group know about this and I am subject to jokes about how supposedly easily I get erect , it's slightly ruining my uni experience tbh . The Girl also now thinks I'm a creep , she's said as much to my flatmate.  

Tl;DR  Got a semi in a club due to very limited physical contact, admitted it to flatmate who knows the Girl.   my entire uni circle knows about this including the girl , now known as an easily aroused creep . 

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with embarrassment for someone who tends to not get embarrassed about anything ? I'm finding this one hard to live down and would appreciate some advice . ( not sure if this is the correct sub for this but I'm rolling with it .) 

Thanks .",23Dec2019,1
54,"Hi everyone. I am about to finish my undergraduate career and will be applying in early 2020 for MA programs that will start in Fall 2020. I need three LOR and I have two professors/bosses that know me well and I asked them. The third professor, who I will refer to as Dr.A, is sick with cancer and I don’t know if I should ask her because I don’t want to be disrespectful.

A little background with this professor; Dr. A was  my mentor for a two semester independent research class. We talked and facetimed the majority of the time because there was not a day we could both meet. 

At the end of the semester, Dr.A asked if we could have a meeting in person. When I went into her office, she was clearing it out and informed me she had cancer. I believe it was some sort of spinal cancer. She explained to me she’s in a lot of pain and drained. She said she’s taking a leave and going to Europe with her husband for a few months. I took this as a bad sign. She was kind enough to help me look for other options as she could not mentor the second semester of the research.

In Fall 2019, I asked to use her for a reference for an internship and she accepted. I haven’t talked to her in about two months though, as I was afraid to disturb her or be inappropriate. I am hesitant to ask her for a LOR at all because I don’t want to be disrespectful. I am grappling with it though because I believe she would write a strong LOR that could help me get into a graduate program.

Should I ask her for a LOR? Should I just asked another professor? I understand she could say no, which I don’t care, but I just don’t want to offend her by asking? Is this offensive? I’m so torn.",23Dec2019,1
55,"TLDR at the end! 

A couple months back, we noticed that our apartment’s door would lock by itself sometimes and the key wouldn’t work to unlock it. It has 2 locks, but the key only works for the bottom lock. The top one is the one that would lock itself. One day, nobody happened to be inside this time so we broke the door to get inside. It was night time and we didn’t know what else to do. Our apartments doesn’t have 24 hour maintenance, and we even asked the security guard that walks around for help earlier (before we broke it), but he couldn’t get the door to open. After we payed, what I don’t remember exactly, but was around $1,200-$1,500... yes, a shit ton for a door replacement, but they said it will get replaced when we move out. All they did was send out a maintenance guy to check out the lock. I guess he fixed it, as this issue never happened again. But our door looks bad and our lock/doorknobs are loose. The seal of the door is broken so air easily comes in and escapes. Now, we’re having issues with the lock that the key won’t go inside all the way. We need to leave the door unlocked when we leave which makes me feel unsafe. This has happened 3 times now that the man just comes and “fixes” the lock. Every time we ask about a replacement door, they ignore my email. What should we do? I’ve looked up the management company for this apartment complex and they seem to have bad customer service as other people have had terrible experiences with them. 

TLDR: 
We broke our apartment door because the lock was having issues and locked itself. We payed the bill for the replacement door and new lock, but never got either. They ignore our emails, and only send maintenance guy. Lock is still having ongoing issues. Maintenance man has come 3 times.",23Dec2019,1

I am a high school senior, and am currently working two jobs (Burger King and at a vet's office) along with a fuckload of extracurriculars (music, NHS, drama, etc.) I am also in three AP classes. I am working (usually) every day and every holiday (I take care of the animals when the other employees are on a holiday break) and it's getting hard to juggle everything. I also have to take time to do some college stuff. Sometimes I have to work both jobs in the same day, and I get so strung out I sometimes cry in my car between shifts. My parents really want to teach me responsibility and establish a good work ethic, but I feel like I'm working my life away at 17 and I really want to quit one of my jobs. But I'm torn; I'm keeping afloat with everything and my grades are still good so if I say to my parents that I want to quit I'm worried they'll think I'm just being a wuss because there's no evidence of me falling behind in anything.

Like the caption says, i keep losing close friends on the process of calling them out on their bullshit and of course I’m doubting myself- because I feel like the mean and bitter one for addressing the matters, although I’m the one being lied to. It’s like people nowadays can’t stand when others are being real and addressing boundaries and calling out on bullshit, so they exclude you out of their lives because ur too aware of their wrongdoings. 

And I’m really the last one to be judgey, so it’s not that. 
I’m very self aware and objective, I know when I have done wrong and can admit it and apologize, so I know this dilemma doesn’t lay on me. But I’m asking you all for advice- wether that be on what to do or how to face these kinds of things? Is this a normal phase? Of am I reflecting too hard about it and should I just be careless? Is that what’s normally done? I’m so used to tolerate people through their worst so I don’t even know what’s an overreaction or not.... :(

Also they are the definition of thot.) in my grade who im pretty close too. We text, we sit together at lunch, we exchange jokes, and we're close enough that we can shove eachother around and shit- boy the amount of times i've been pushed into a locker haha (we dont actually hurt eachother lol)
Anyways, theres this one boy i really like. Lets call him Nigel. Not his real name. I really freaking like him. I told him this last may, but nobody outside our family and friend group know. Also, we've decided not to like do anything about our feelings until highschool, so we're basically friends. Who occasionally make out and have sex... jk, the only physical contact i ever had with him was that one time i punched him in the nose on accident (we we playing keep-away with a ball) lmaooo. Anyways- the conflict starts here. My OTHER friend who we'll call Fraser also likes me. Kid legit made a SONG about me and sang it in a private voice call.. beautiful song, not gonna lie. He has told me several times how much he likes me, when we text he tells me how pretty my eyes are. I kinda started it by admitting my insecurities one time.. now he constantly calls me beautiful, oops-

Idk what to do. I really like Nigel but i feel guilty for turning down Fraser so much. Huh, now that i think abt it, Nigel does suit my friend a lot haha. Guess thats on my list of 100 billion nicknames i have for my friends. 

Tl:dr, i like one boy in my friend group, but a different one likes me so yeahhhh i keep rejecting him and i feel stupid for it

Also this is a throwaway because the info on here is enough for someone who knows me to figure out its me. And i put most of my personal stuff on reddit. Bro if ya think you knoe me irl tho just keep your mouth shut cause like i'll be really fucking embarrassed lmao- stfu ree",23Dec2019,1

69,"I have been bullied by my manager for the past couple of months now. She frequently picks on me for things and tells me “if you can’t do this you shouldn’t be working here”. She behaves friendly to others but treats me like I’m bothering her and has once said I’m “annoying”. She blames me for the mistakes of others such as items I would price which would then be sold by another employee and then I get blamed for not pricing them.

I would often get blamed when covering managers/supervisors would come to cover the store when she’s not available and they do not do the tasks they were supposed to and that it was my job to make sure they did their job. 

Whenever a covering manager would rearrange something (I am a sales assistant) I would get in  trouble for letting them rearrange her store in which i next time begged any covering managers/supervisors not to touch anything.

She often said I took to long in toilets and wouldn’t let me take toilet breaks and only let me take my compulsory 1 hour break (I’m entitled to two 15min unpaid break and one 1 hour break). She let other go to the toilet multiple times a shift though. 

She once’s got frustrated, yelled and swore at me because I wasn’t understanding something which made me cry and then proceeded to ignore me for the rest of the day. I thought as a team leader, if your employee isn’t understanding something then you would take the time to patiently explain until they understood.

There are many other instances but these are the main ones.

I’m not sure what to do as she is funny and friendly to others but completely different to me, I would contact the area manager but she is really close friends with him and I doubt he will take anything I say seriously if I tell him 😞

70,"We've been friends for a while. My friend who I'll call Julian, picks on our friend who I'll call Derrick.

I love Derrick. He's a very nice guy. He's quiet and a little socially awkward, but once you get to know him he's really cool.

I like Julian because he's funny, but he can also be an ass. He's an ass to Derrick.

Julian talks crap about Derrick behind his back. He says things like, ""Derrick acts like a punk ass, etc, etc."" I call him out like, ""Why are you talking about Derrick like that?"" Then he goes, ""Oh I didn't mean it like that.""

He disrespects him. One day when we were sitting in class, we got an assignment back. Derrick didn't do so well on it. He told Julian and I what he got and Julian goes, ""Oh wow, you're stupid."" Derrick just sat there. I should've stood up for him, but I didn't. Another time for another assignment, Julian asked him what he got on it. Derrick proceeded to tell him and Julian goes, ""Wow you are terrible.""

I remember me, Derrick, and a couple of our other friends were standing outside the classroom before class started. Julian comes up and gives each one of us dap. When he comes to Derrick, he was about to give him some dap, and Derrick was to, then Julian just disses him and waved his hand off at him.

One day when the three of us were on our way to lunch, Julian once again was teasing Derrick, and Derrick told him, ""Shut up Julian!"" Julian fired back and told him, ""Shut your faggot ass up!"" I started laughing but then I grabbed Derrick in a bro friendly kind of way and told Julian, ""Don't come at my man's Derrick like that!"" Then Julian goes, ""I was just playing with him. You're getting so serious.""

He didn't sound like he was playing.

I don't like how Julian treats Derrick. I'm not really sure how I should come up to Julian about it.

She always talks down to me and shes always complaining about something, and most of the time its me. Everything I do she looks for something she can nickpick on, like I can’t lean against the wall because it will leave a mark, I can’t pet the dog because she sheds too much, I missed a spot on the dishes etc etc. And everytime Im happy about something she tells me why I shouldnt be happy about it, e.g. when I got my boyfriend who I’ve been with for a year now she said it most likely wouldnt last. When i said I wanted to study history and archeology she said it was too dificult for me to make it in that. She complain about my nindento switch being anoying because of the sound of the button i press, while she loudly chews gum and when I called her out on how big a hypocrite she is she plays the “its my house” card. Tldr shes a bitch snd seems to have made me her biggest enemy.

77,"So, I just finished my first term at university. During the second week, one of my flatmate's best friends came round to visit him and basically, after the first time that he kinda met me and the rest of the flat, my flatmate told me after that he thought I was fit basically.

This really confused me as during the next 3/4 times that he met me when he came round for pre-drinks, he would change his behaviour i.e he would act a bit shyer and reserved than he usually would when him and the rest of his friends were there (he would kind of avoid eye contact with me and not pay me special attention which normally happens when a guy is interested in me) so basically, if my flatmate had not told me what he did, I would have zero idea that he was remotely interested in me as more than just a friend.

During the last week of university (before we broke up for the holidays), my friend along with with my flatmate and a bunch of his other friends (including that guy) went out. I was quite tipsy but he basically took care of me for the entire night i.e making sure that my clumsy ass stopped falling down (lol), hugging me from behind, making sure that I had water so that I wouldn't be too far gone, dancing with me, holding my hands, helping me put on my coat when we left the club - just cute shit basically.

I guess that was the moment where it turned non-platonic? He stayed for the entire weekend (which he normally does not). Me, my friend along with him and his friend had a deep conversation from literally 4am (when they got back from the club) until like noon the next day and at this point we started to get comfortable with each other so when I started sitting closer to him, he held my hands and then pulled me onto his lap so that I would be hugging his neck and it stayed like that for a lot of the conversation :,) (also one thing to point out is that I found out that he was a couple months younger than me and when I pretended to make a joke about it, he laughed and was like 'all the girls that I have dated before were all at least 6 months older than me, and then there's you - it's all good.'

What was interesting was that he was willing to go out of his way to spend time with me and make sure I was okay. When it was like 1pm the next day his friend told him to get some rest (I had gone round to the shop next door to get something and both me and him hadn't gotten any sleep over like 24 hours) but then he told his friend that he was fine because he wanted to wait for me to come back. When I did, we cuddled under the blanket and literally acted like a couple which is basically what everyone said.

That evening, our flat was playing drinking games and after a bit, I was tired so I left to go to my room. After a while, he knocked on my door and asked me if I was alright and if I needed anything. We had a bit of banter which ended with him going under my covers and pretending to sleep while he was smiling (which I thought was cute haha). He ended up cuddling my waist while we both basically talked for a bit.

As a whole, the reason why I'm conflicted is because the entire time, he acted a lot more romantic and affectionate than sexual even though he had the opportunity to do so e.g when we were cuddling. He also had no issue showing his affection for me in front of his friends e.g frequently hugging me even though I know some guys who would be embarrassed to do that. At the same time, when we were alone in my bed, he never delved into much of my personal life or my interests and rather stayed with surface questions like 'How are you liking the UK so far' even if it was a nice conversation overall. He also never asked for my personal contact to keep talking e.g my number/instagram etc which usually happens when this kind of stuff happens.

How my friend interpreted this was that he might have had a crush on me before but because our personalities are SO different (which I completely agree with 100%), he liked me more for my physical traits than my actual personality - not saying he doesn't like me as a person but he was more drawn to me on a superficial sense.

So, reddit, what do you think of this situation? What do you think I should do? Is he trying to get to know me more and progress whatever is going on or is he just wanting to hookup/have a fling? Thank you x",23Dec2019,1

Second attempts were available for the final and he was leaving but allowed me a second attempt with a different proctor but not before telling me I wouldn’t have any issues with doing things without a calculator if I bothered to show up for class.

81,". . . and i have a boyfriend (25). Basically my boyfriend and I have been together for six months. We were only actually dating for one of those months, after that first month he moved. We decided not to break up because we were friends before we started dating and really adored each other .

But a big part of our relationship is sex. It’s super hard for me to have sex. I’ve been through a lot of trauma when it comes to that and it’s been hard to let it go and get over it. He’s been patient but he’s a man ya know? And he’s so far away. I have to get comfortable with him before we have sex and with him being so far away I can’t get comfortable with his touch and all of that so it feels like we start over every time. We’ve recently been going through a tough patch. 

I started talking more to my coworker who I never payed any mind to at first. He’s 40 so I wasn’t even looking at him that way but he started training me personal and i just started delivery driving at night so he would ask for me to see my location until i got off so he could make sure i was safe. we’ve talked on the phone for the past two days and i just broke down and told him everything i’ve been through. i told him i was raped and beaten and it’s so hard for me to just have sex and i want to but it literally feels like i can’t and all this stuff. 

Then he started telling me that he really cares about me and if I wanted him to he would be gentle and slow with me until I get comfortable. I love my boyfriend. But I don’t know if he can do that. I think he can’t help but put himself first and not care how it affects me in that situation. I told him having sex for me feels traumatic now. He doesn’t understand. i feel like if i have sex with my coworker and break the ice, I could be able to have sex with my boyfriend without having a panic attack.

I left it alone until half an hour ago. He yelled at me, and repeated himself by saying he doesn’t have any gas. I told him that’s not an excuse because, what about all the other times i’ve been asking since August. I’m just a bother to him.

I certainly didn’t want to know this about my grandfather, but I don’t judge him for it. I haven’t told anyone and don’t plan on bringing it up with my family. I even installed some tools on his computer to automatically delete browser history once he closes out. (Trying to do him a solid)

Now after this latest “hack” I’m convinced he gets angry and insists on getting a new computer because he’s embarrassed and doesn’t want anyone finding out what he’s been looking at.

We’re lucky that his identity hasn’t been stolen yet to our knowledge, but it’s only a matter of time.

My family has suggested installing parental controls, but I’m guessing that’ll lead to other issues and “the computer not working right” because he won’t be able to get his porn. (Again, don’t plan on bringing this up with anyone)

All things considered I want him to be happy but I also want him to be safe so he doesn’t get cleaned out in his retirement years.

This has happened a handful of times now, so it’s a cycle and it’s incredibly frustrating.

85,"Had a couple friends visiting me this weekend so naturally I introduced them to the friends I made in the area. Couple nights ago, we were all pregaming together before going out to the club. One of the guys visiting is a quiet, innocent, and all around just a nice guy. He also has been dating a girl for a year or two now. Anyway, we get to the club and start dancing and having a great time. At this point, everyone’s pretty drunk and this guy is definitely gone. Lights out for him. An hour or so in, he starts grabbing one of my local friends breasts and vaginal area. She is pushing him off during the advances, but he keeps trying for a little.

I didn’t know about this at all and this morning, she tells me what happened. She’s fine, more annoyed and surprised that this happened than anything, since she knows the guy has a girlfriend. I’m pretty shocked that this happened after knowing the guy for so long and it definitely doesn’t seem like something he would do. He was definitely blacked at that point, obviously doesn’t justify it at all, but it makes it a little difficult to bring up. 

What am I supposed to do about this? I definitely need to talk to him about it, but I’m not quite sure what to say. Do I just tell him what happened and get his side of things first? I don’t want to just let him slide it off with a “I was blacked, I don’t remember that at all, sorry.” Also, I don’t know what to do about his girlfriend. We’ve met a couple times but we’re definitely not close. Does she deserve to know about this? It’s not like he cheated or anything, but it is potentially worrying for the future.",23Dec2019,1
87,"Context: i recently changed my phone, and my parents and gparents paid half/half of it.
My gma first told me she'd like to have my old phone instead of me giving it to my mother, and I agreed. Mostly because my mother had a nasty habit of looking up my archived/old Whatsapp chats and snooping only to bring them up later in my face to embarass me/victimise herself.

Now, due to my father's fuck up with two SIM cards,he left 5 of my mother's convos on my gma's phone-to-be and he dumped both phones in my arms in order to fix them. He thinks my gma is out to snoop on my mother simply because once, when gma's phone was out of order, she asked for my mum's just to browse through Facebook (she just likes doing so, for pure entertainment, nothing harmful).

My mother blocked my gma on Facebook, and while I let my gma know, my parents aren't aware of me knowing. Tonight, my father texted me at 1 AM asking for my gma's FB password. I didn't reply, but I'm deathly sick of their paranoia, infantillism and frankly stupidity in feeling so self important and entitled to making accusations.

For the record, no way in heck could my grandma access whatever archived leftover convos were there from my mother, the woman can barely even text.

I'm so sick of being dumped in the middle. How can I end all this shit w/o ruining Xmas?",23Dec2019,1

The only times she will eat healthy is if I do. If we go out and I order a salad and water so will she. If I order a pizza and soda, so will she. We’ve been dating for almost 6 months and she has yet to take her shirt off in front of me. She sleeps in hoodies and changes her shirt in another room. I’m a pretty skinny dude I hover around 135 and have a hard time putting weight on. But I feel like I have to eat healthy around her just so she will eat healthy. Idk what to do. I want to ask her to get a gym membership so we can go together but I don’t wanna be offensive.

95,"I am currently in a small band with 4 (well now 3) of my friends, we havent released any music or played any shows yet (even after 1.5 years) as we are struggling with work ethic and motivation. Last night we were discussing songs to cover and we had put forward a few 

Mine : Many of Horror (Biffy Clyro)
            Pour Some Sugar On Me (Def Leppard)
            Snuff (Slipknot)
Bandmate : Perfect (Ed Sheeran)
                      Castle on the Hill (Ed Sheeran)
                      Weak (AJR)

As you can see we have differeng music tastes (im a metal fan but i toned down suggestions extremely due to past agreements). I could tell my bandmate was turning down my suggestions for no reason (he claimed he didnt like the music, even tho he had previously said otherwise, claimed he didnt like scottish vocals ((Biffy Clyro)) even though when we covered it we wouldnt song like that) I explained this to him and he got extremely annoyed, then the big issue began.

 He said that if he didnt choose every song we covered (with no input from the rest of the band) choose who played what instruments and wrote every original song he would leave (he is a highy valued member so we could not afford to loose him)

I explained that a threat like that was a little childish but attemped to compromise, i said he could choose songs, but if we didnt like them then we wouldnt do them, and we could all write original music for the band

He declined and said he has wanted to leave for a long time as we hadn't done anything yet, but we are all very busy people and struggle to meet up often. He said he quit and then when i asked him to stay and explained to him that the threat was like ""a 7 year old throwing a strop at his friends"" the argument got very heated and we argued well into the night (3:30 am) on our band group chat, finally he said that i was a horrible person and no body liked me (listed friends of mine who ""secretly hated me"") as someone who was bullied frequently all my life i took this really hard and was very quiet for the next day or so (its Christmas break so i havent talked to/ seen him). Anyway the ffinal message he said was, and i quote "" You sound like you've heard a bunch of arguments and just throw in phrases you've heard. Also the stuff like insecurities. I don't know if you picked stuff up from the people that bullied you as a kid but it's kinda messed up. I don't really think you acted well and don't want to be friends anymore. If we are doing stuff in the friend group we can be civil. I won't exclude you but won't pretend to like you I assume that this will be mutual."" 

I genuinely liked this guy and wanted to be friends but he apparently has hated me for a while and so have a lot of people, im going to ignore the issue until the new year, and hope i can go in with a better attitude than i have right now


What can i do in this situation? I wanted to be friends but he apparently doesnt, and i feel its gonna be awkward for everyone around us, any advice is greatly appreciated and thanks for reading my 1,000,000,000,000,000 word essay",23Dec2019,1

97,"As the title says, just over a month ago I managed to get a really good graduate job with a massive bank. This graduate job will start in September and the only requirement in terms of education was that I have a 2:1 hons degree (which I do), so the job is basically guaranteed. However, I am also in the process of doing a masters degree. I've just finished my first semester and during it I took on way too many responsibilies. I work as a residential adviser at university accommodation, I took a job as a computer science demonstrator where I taught a subset of students taking a 3rd year undergraduate module - as well as marking their tests, and I was actively pursuing graduate jobs. While I was doing all of this I also ran into some personal issues. Because of this, it had a massive affect on my studies for my first semester masters modules and I'm really worried I'm not going to pass my masters degree.

With this, I'm having a massive imposter syndrome symptoms even though the graduate job I've received doesn't require it. Not only this, I feel like I'm going to be a complete failure / I don't deserve the job, or that I'm not going to do well in the graduate position. My dream is to use this to further my career path and one day move over the America.

I guess the advice I'm asking for is how you deal with imposter syndrome - If there even is a way to - as it's really starting to affect me. Last summer I did a software development internship and I would experience it during whenever felt like I wasn't working my ass off every second of the day.",23Dec2019,1
98,"I have a weird family situation going on, and I'm not sure if I'm a bad guy anymore. 

For background, my childhood was generally lonely, we moved a lot when I was little. I can't really form bonds with people or places. I was a 'strange artsy kid' who couldn't fit and my family thinks of me as such. They treat me like I am always wrong in emotional situations, like I don't have those since I was established a hard rationalist from childhood. I'm expected to be able to take everything, emotional burden and abuse without complaint. And I believed that as well.

The situation itself has to do with my brother's girlfriend who moved in with us a year ago. They were together for about 2 months at that point, but she was in a hard situation so naturally my parents wanted to help. I was away at uni at the time and was not asked about it, that hurt a little as I value my privacy and being able to just relax home in peace. Also, it felt like they left me out of an important decision that affected me. I knew I wouldn't have said no, but it would've been nice to be asked in advance. 

So she moved in, rearranged our home and put her stuff everywhere. I got home for break, then she told my brother that I offended her. I still don't know exactly how, she never confronted me, but my brother was livid. I was like okay, I know I can be harsh, she is obviously more sensitive, so I'll try to be nicer. She is a typical 'girly girl', wears makeup, talks in a high-pitched voice, has a lot of clothes and creams, likes fluffy things and screams if she sees something 'disgusting'. She is the kind of girl my grandmother wanted me to be and I was not even close, so she adores her. I usually have nothing against this, it just seems really fake. I knew I didn't like her, but I just assumed I'm the problem as our parents and grandparents loved her. Then my sister came home, she learned that gf doesn't like me, for some reason she told our parents and grandmother and they immediately assumed I 'hurt her', they attacked me for being rude and my sister was really annoyed how they jumped at me. I legit don't know what I've done, I heard that gf heard I said something and assumed it was against her. What I know is that I've never tried to be mean to her either face to face or behind her back. Whenever I told anyone about what's going on, I always emphasized that she is lovely and I am just me, you know, hard to like. 

My brother started smoking, became overprotective, called me a bitch, threatened me and still I thought he is right. They were always on each other, touching, I've heard them fucking on multiple occasions, she would walk around the house in her underwear, they just didn't care and I felt out of place while being home.

The other thing that annoyed me is that she is openly racist and homophobic. My mother is sort of a liberal and she raised me as one. My father would always say plainly bad jokes in this nature and I've always told him that they weren't funny, nobody was offended, we just moved on. Gf laughs at those jokes, pointing at my father like he is the funniest person in the world, he likes that attention, and my mother stopped saying anything against this. She wouldn't participate, but she wouldn't speak up either. I won't repeat the things gf says, but I am convinced that if I had said some of the things she said about minorities while growing up my mother would've slapped me hard. Now she is silent and I don't understand why. I have black and gipsy friends, Muslims, Buddhists and Christians and I feel obliged to defend them even if they are not directly affected by it. I'm an atheist and against institutionalized religion, but I wouldn't disrespect or ridicule people because of their beliefs like gf does. The problem here is that if I say anything, it is taken as a personal attack and my family is angry at me for 'hurting her' again. I'm supposed to be 'smarter' and stay silent. I have to censor myself in my home and I hate it. 

Once my mother showed us a picture of a 40something woman around this area who got into a car accident, was braindead, about to be taken off life support, leaving a kid behind. Gf's first reaction was 'I can't believe those fake boobs didn't act as airbags', similarly to my grandmother. And I hated all of it. They said I'm overreacting again.

She also wanted a dog in the house, fortunately my dad said no. I'm allergic. I think she wants me out of the house so they can be alone. My brother has a speaker, loud as hell, and they always listen to shitty music even when I'm watching tv or trying to study. Then if I ask them to please at least turn the volume down, she has this weird look on her face. They basically do whatever they like and my parents are fine with it. Once they literally sent me to my room because they decided they wanted to sleep in the living area. I've told my brother that I have to study and I don't have wifi in my room, he said 'night is for sleeping, you can do it tomorrow' then turned off the lights. I was so angry at them, but of course I can't say anything because she is sensitive. If this was just my brother I would've kicked him to his room, but I can't act that way around gf if I want to live home for a bit longer. At this point I seriously think my parents would kick me out, which is ironic since that's why she is living here in the first place. Another interesting thing is that she seems a lot nicer when someone else is around. Whenever it's just us, she stops smiling and generally just ignores me.

Right now, I'm one of the best in my class, but my parents don't care as that is also expected. I'm still not sure what I'm going to do after school, but I'm certain I'll find a job like I've done before. Regardless, my father treats me like I'm a no good, he makes fun of my illnesses that I was terrified of. My parents suggest that I'm a failure because I've never had a relationship. They wouldn't accept that I don't want one, so this leaves me abnormal while my brother and gf are the ideal. And as I've said, I believed that until recently. One day my mother was treating me like shit, and I understand she is frustrated and has to let it out on someone, but this time I've told her and she was like 'you always hurt me'. And I realized that I just have no right to say that. I have to watch out to not hurt my mother, my grandmother and gf, because they can say they are offended, but if I try to say something like that I'm 'childish, oversensitive and less intelligent than they thought I am', literally my mother words after she defended gf's feelings again.

Whenever I'm away, I'm friendly, open, laughing, I have friends who come to me for advice, I'm known, liked and respected by people. At home, they say they don't believe that, because that's 'not me'. My family doesn't know me and I think they don't even want to. I love them more than anything, and maybe they need me to be this silent evil that is the cause of every problem, because this way they don't have to face reality and I automatically turn into this soulless person that seemingly doesn't care about anything. 

I know I have to move out, I want to, I'm barely at home as it is, but I'll have to finish school first. I want to stay part of their lives. I don't know what could I do about this though, it is getting worse.

101,"(SORRY FOR ANY ERRORS, NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE AND WRITING ON A PHONE. THANKS IN ADVANCE)

First, to clarify: I'm a 15M, and I've been an atheist and leftist for some time now. Of course, I have changed my views a lot of times and I will probably do it again someday, but I've got problems NOW.

I've always been silent about my views to my family, both out of respect for them, as I'm afraid they might be hurt to know, and fear for myself, as I'm still in High-School and I've got no permanent job and they pay for most of my things. (More the first cause I guess.)

I have to go to church and catechism weekly. I always felt kind of uneasy there due to some of my conflicting values, opinions and beliefs and I've already expressed my disdain for it a few times, but never got far because of the reasons above and because it wasn't really that bad. After all, there were snacks after classes and some nice people in there.

At the end, I was able to shrug it off. The issue began when my Cathechist got political, first expressing pro-life, anti-feminism and other conservative views on various things(against my opinions and values, but not a big problem aside from the fact that he made some fake statements and that this was suposed to be a religion class), then criticizing other religions and Atheism with falaccious arguments and false statements(all of which easily debunked, but still kind of a problem). That was some weeks ago. Recently, he seems to have gone full wingnut and now rants about George Soros, Cultural Marxism(I'm kind of a marxist myself and this annoys me a lot) and other Right-Wing strawmen during his classes.

One thing is learning Christian values and the inner workings of the Church, another is hearing political BS and literal propaganda.

I'm getting sick of it, and I'm afraid for my friends in there, that they might actually be buying it.

My family said I have to attend those classes for another year at least. And I guess I can do it, I've already endured worse, but it still makes unconfortable as hell and I'm still kind of afraid for my friends, and I'm not sure I can get the whole next year without calling up his BS and exposing myself. And considering that the teacher's change in behaviour occured only in the last months of this year and he got that extreme, I fear it might get even worse in the next one.

What should I do now?

TL DR: My Cathechist has gone full wingnut recently and is spreading straight up lies and falsehoods, but I am silent about it. My family says I still have to frequent his classes for the next year but I'm already sick of it.",23Dec2019,1

I have not witnessed any type of discipline from my brother or his wife. They parent differently than my husband and I do- which isn’t wrong, just different than our style. I do not want to judge them on their parenting, they obviously love their children very much, and take very good care of them. The kids are just wild. 

When I say wild, I mean running through the house screaming, throwing things at windows, standing on tables, or hitting each other. They don’t listen to anyone, they throw food, and seem out of control. The parents seem to ignore it. 

I want to have people over for the holidays, other friends and children will be around. I worry I am embarrassed to have my nephew and niece there, but don’t want to hurt their feelings by excluding them. I don’t know if I should talk to them about their kids behaviour or my expectations- or how to even start discussing it. So maybe I shouldn’t say anything at all and let it ride?

I washed my blankets and my sheets, and threw them in the dryer on high heat and I also washed some of my pajamas.

Even though it's not my responsiblity, I feel like it'd be the right thing to do. What if they give fleas to other animals/people? What if it spreads and contaminates their entire house?

So one of my coworkers and I recently started talking quite a bit. It all started when she wanted to join her cousin and I in some video games, I didn't really think much of it at the time since I just saw her as another coworker that wanted to become friends, and basically just join us in some video games from time to time. Anyways we played for a couple of hours and she was actually talking for the first time, and it turns out she is super funny, so the 3 of us ended up having a great time(we haven't really played much since then). The next day i woke up and saw that she sent me a message over social media, and through that, we started talking quite a bit. Skip forward about a month and a half to today, as much as i hate to say it, i caught feelings for her, and i know she likes me too. I am well aware that she is 6 years younger than me and it would be absolutely disgusting if i were to do anything with her, especially since she has a lot of developing yet to do. We also don't hang out anywhere besides work, since i know that would be inappropriate.

I am currently in no position to have a girlfriend, I am simply way too busy with my full-time schooling and work and just cant afford to have any distractions that require a lot of commitment. I have never had a girlfriend, i still have my V card and im not planning on changing either of those any time soon. But this has got me questioning if there is something wrong with me, like why am i even attracted to someone that is so much younger than me. Id like to think its not something physical, since i had 0 interest in her before i found out she had an amazing personality. But then again i know next to nothing when it comes to relationships and such.

A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence : /",23Dec2019,1

I just don’t think I can take the traffic anymore, and like I’m tired of feeling like my life sucks and just going home where I’m constantly judged and I’m not even treated like an individual. I have the freedom of like a high schooler and the few times I do go out, it’s such a hassle just to past 12 or even get out of the house without being given a whole spiel. 

I just feel so incredibly stagnant and depressed at home, and just want freedom and to be able to do what I want. My mom actually threatens me like on a bi weekly basis that I should just move out if i don’t like how things are done here, and now that I’m setting up a plan, she’s saying how I can’t bc then I’ll party or just get sidetracked. And the thing is right now I’m just usually high all day, bc I’m just dissatisfied with life and don’t really have nothing better to do.

My plan is to work most of next semester, gather a little bit of money, and then find an apartment near campus for fall of 2020 when I’m a junior. I already have like 2 thousand saved up from over the years, and I think I could probably gather like 2-3 thousand working a part time job for like 4-5 months. 

She just left it up to my dad to decide, bc I’m just a dumb little kid of course, and he’s saying that he’s going to stop paying for tuition if I want to be independent so bad. My parents are just saying “these are the rules,” and like they’re not following any sort of logic, and it’s more about not wanting to see me progress or something. I’m thinking that they still want control over me, and want to be able to still have the chance to just judge and criticize everything I do, and they’re not going to be able to do that if I’m not within grasp. And then I’m kind of stuck bc my parents make enough money to not get any fafsfa, and we’re decently well off but I think since I have two other siblings it’s hard to spread the money.

Anyways, I’m so tired of just being treated like I’m fucking some stupid 15 year old, and it’s not like I get along with my family supremely well in the first place anyways.

121,"Hi, I'm a (22M) college senior. For the past couple years, my mother has been fighting with stage 4 cancer. Shortly before Thanksgiving, we were told by her medical team that they cannot pursue further treatment, and that she should go into hospice care. Based on her wishes, we opted for in-home care 24/7. Here's where it gets a bit complicated... 

I'm currently the only other person besides my mother and the various home care nurses that is in the house full time. Therefore, it's become my responsibility over my winter break to take over the cooking, some cleaning, caring for our dog, and the vast majority of Christmas decoration and festivities for not only myself and her, but the multiple additional family members that have been popping in and out throughout the past weeks. 

At first, this was a lot, but manageable, but in the week, it's increasingly wearing on me. The pain and medications my mother has been on combined with her inability to leave her bed have increasingly affected her mood to the point of very sudden volatility. One conversation will be normal, then the next will be her screaming at me that I'm a failure as a son and that I'm doing nothing to help the family during this time. Also increasing in frequency are requests that are difficult or nonsensical (I was asked this afternoon to cook three pecan pies and peanut brittle amongst other baked goods despite a very severe nut allergy). Trying to placate these requests or gently explaining why it's not possible now results in another mood swing. Trying to put some distance between the two of us by working upstairs in the house has also has similar results. 

I've been trying my hardest to remember that it's the pain and the meds causing this, and that during these moments my mom isn't herself, but it's becoming very hard and I'm tremendously stressed. Especially with Christmas rapidly getting closer and me heading back to college in the weeks ahead, I'm worried that the last holiday I'll spend with my mother will continue to go downhill. 

Any tips or advice on any aspects of this (admittedly long-winded) situation would be incredibly appreciated. Thanks all, and happy holidays.",23Dec2019,1

Despite the fact that being rejected constantly makes me hate myself, I still use the app and won’t delete it cause I don’t know how to meet girls otherwise. I live in a big western city where everything is really cliquey and it’s hard to make friends. So after three years of being here I haven’t made any friends and I still struggle with women 

I’ve also had lots of good shit going on though. I used to play in bands / go out a lot but that didn’t make a difference and no matter what goals I have / what I achieve, I always feel like a loser because I don’t have friends / get rejected all the time

125,"I have a very strange family dynamic, my dads side of the family is completely cut off, and my moms side is very invested in me I’m their oldest of three grandchildren, but I’ve been distant with them about a lot of my mental struggles.

They see the tip of the iceberg and part of me feels like they deserve to know all of it, but a bigger part of me feels like they wouldn’t fully understand and it would be very overwhelming for them to hear.

I’m conflicted because they deserve the truth but the truth is scary and hard and I don’t want to be a burden.

1. I'm quite young compared to most of the other people working there, and feel like this is creating a gap between us. There are a few of us my age, but we work different days so we never see each other. 
2. My job requires me to constantly move around the city doing deliveries and stuff, so I'm not stuck in a cubicle like the rest of my colleagues, and can't make small talk too often.

128,"I (44F) left a job I was good at, and made really good money because a new VP started and made it clear that she didn't like me, and was prepared to manage me out (long story). She put me under a new manager who was incompetent and I basically did his job and mine so the VP would have no good reason to get rid of me. After a year of this routine I decided enough was enough and found a new job. The other person in my department under the same manager quit about a month after I did.

Little did I know I was going from the frying pan into the fire. The new job is more stressful than anything I've ever experienced. Chaos rules every day even though I'm trying to implement change and structure. I've gotten zero training, just expected to ""figure it out"" as I go. The staff I'm supposed to ""manage"" misses deadlines, does shoddy, low quality work and treats me like I'm a monster for attempting to hold them accountable. My boss, the owner, is unpredictable and regularly has screaming fits/tantrums (so far not directed at me). I took a pay cut to work here because I wanted to broaden my skills. I'm regularly working 10-12 hours a day (more than anyone else who works there), and I can't ever seem to get caught up because I inherited projects that are months behind schedule while new projects continue to come in.

I've only been at this job for 2 months. I've never quit a job without having another one to go to, but my mental health is suffering immensely. I spent today crying in bed in anticipation of suffering through another week. If I quit now how will I get another job?

130,"So I've bitten my nails ever since I can remember, for ten years at least, and pulled my hair in waves for four years or so. I need help stopping both. More details below:  
  
# Nail Biting  
  
As I stated above, I've bitten my nails for a very long time, and I've tried telling myself to stop and using the bitter nail polish stuff, but every time I do either I still bite my nails. I've also tried trimming my nails, but I bite them anyway.  

#Trichotillomania  
First off, what is trichotillomania? Put simply, it's obsessive hair pulling. I pull my hair on my head, my eyelashes, my eyebrows, my genitals, and my armpits all the time, occasionally to the point of it being publicly noticeable. It first started four years ago, but then I went to a therapist and it stopped for a year or two, until it popped up again this year. My mom couldn't locate a therapist for me to see this time, so we've been thinking of putting band-aids on the tips of my fingers or getting a fidget ring or something to try to prevent me from pulling, but in the past, that has had minimal success.

132,"I’m looking for advice. The person that I live with has, as stated above, extreme entitlement issues. 

I would say that, overall, roomate(Ben) displays more selflessness than I do. However, I’m not incredibly selfish, I just like to keep my objects as mine, and not share them. 

Anyway, I’m just looking for a little help, or some way to put a stop to his behaviour. I’ve tried talking to him about it, but he gets incredibly defensive, and becomes increasingly difficult to speak to. Anyway, I’ll ask him not to use certain belongings of mine. For example, I have several rolls of craft washi tape. Ben asked me to use some, to draw a line on the floor. I told him I’d rather him not use it, because it’s fairly expensive, and he could just go to the store and buy some painters tape. He insisted that he use my tape, and kept asking me why he couldn’t use just 10cm of tape. I told him if he was that insistent, and unwilling to walk to the corner store, then he might as well just use it, so I don’t have to keep having the same conversation over and over again. He then expressed that he wouldn’t use it because I didn’t want him to, but he didn’t understand why “he would allow me to eat his food, and drink his beer, but he couldn’t use a piece of tape.” 

Now, getting annoyed, I told him to just keep the whole roll if he felt like he needed it that badly. Even though it won’t stick to the floor, anyway.

It just really gets under my skin, that the second I don’t want him to use some of my things, he immediately launches into the excuse that he gave me a nug, or a beer, the other day. It pisses me off because I do the same for him. I don’t care if he drinks my stuff, or takes some of my food/smokes, but I’d just rather him not use some of my other objects. Like, my crafting tape on the floor, when other tape is fairly easily accessible.

133,"Okay. So, I’ve been at my current job at one of the best thrift stores in my city for 5 months now and never had any problems with drama or management or anything. I usually keep to myself and my team, some of the cashiers, and one of the supervisors who is really cool. Things came to a head last Friday. 

I’ve come to realize that the store manager (30s/40s M) is something of an egomainiac cult leader. He constantly has store meetings that consist of him talking about how he’s not to blame for anything that goes wrong at the store, how great and forgiving of a manager he is, calling people out on their wrongdoings in front of everyone when it should be done behind closed doors, saying that everyone lacks communication but never makes an effort to personally communicate things he’s unhappy with to a particular person.. that kind of manager.
Strangely, everyone practically worships the guy. He is very captivating when he speaks, a lot of people find him attractive, he’s rather aggressive in his practices (it has made us one of the top locations in our company), but there is so much injustice at the store, especially on the shoulders of my team, who happen to have the hardest jobs (manager said so himself). Nobody seems to think there’s anything wrong but me.

Here’s just a comprehensive list of the shit that’s gotten to me recently.
1. Teammate M (F38) was recently pulled aside by him and told that she has a bad attitude and needs to do more around the store than just her job. In reality, M is one of the sweetest, attitude-free women on our team and goes above and beyond for the whole store. She was sobbing behind the building afterwards and none of us understood what he could’ve possibly meant. We think he somehow mixed her us with a woman on our team that was recently fired. He never apologized.

2. He called me out and used me as an example of “how great of a boss he is”.  A few weeks ago I was working alone in my department and it was getting to me. I was feeling actively suicidal and called my boyfriend to bring me some of my medication. When he came and was about to leave, I asked him to stay a bit longer. I admit that it was inappropriate to keep him with me when I should have been focused on getting back to work, but I couldn’t handle it at the time. Apparently the store manager saw us together, but didn’t say anything or scold me for it. He had someone on my team talk to me about it so it would come across gentler. Fast forward, and he’s telling the whole meeting about it because “he’s such a forgiving manager”. He didn’t even think to ask about what was going on and just decided to jack his own ego off. 

3. He demoted my favorite coworker (M35) because he missed half a shift to take his dog to the emergency vet clinic. He had called off work a couple other times, but not to a point where it was problematic. The manager said that he just hid in the back to avoid responsibility and saw the job as a joke, then demoted him to essentially get the guy to quit (he needed the promoted wage to make ends meet, but he was bumped back down to minimum wage and left to start at where his husband worked since starting wage there was close enough to making ends meet). He proceeded to talk shit on the guy even after he left and even though everyone loved him, followed the store manager’s opinions.

4. The manager constantly talks about my team having it the hardest, yet never gives us any additional help like he does the other departments and seems to go out of his way to make our jobs even harder. Even my team acknowledges it, and they love him to death too.

There is so much more, but onto the main issue.

Teammate K (F25), the BEST person on our team, was at one of his meetings and he singled her out, talking about all of her past personal struggles in front of like 30 people, and told her that her 2 year old daughter having pneumonia isn’t an excuse to miss work since ‘theres people watching her, you have time’. K told me she planned on quitting after that, and I told her that I wanted to lately as well and to do what was best for her. Later, as two of the team from the back of the store came out to go home, they stopped by K asking if she was okay. These girls (F20s, F40s) are known for being whiny snobs and telling on everyone. I had forgotten this since everyone had been getting along great lately. 

I walk up to support K since her day had been hell, and I started saying things like “Yeah, it’s been rough. Not that we ever get any help out here.” and “He has no right to talk about personal shit in front of everyone just because he’s the boss”.

Big. Mistake.

I think nothing of it until a few hours later, the department director comes to me. She says that the two girls told her I was talking shit on the manager and, knowing that they’re drama queens, wanted to straighten things out with me. I clarify that I was frustrated with how he calls out my team and humiliates them, how we always get the short end of everything, and that private things need to be kept private.
The director probably worships him the most. Never realized how much until she dismissed everything I said by saying “What happened with K had nothing to do with you. He called you out just to make a point that he’s very forgiving compared to most managers. It bothers me that you say things like that but never communicate with him.”
He doesn’t even communicate his schedule to anyone (literally blank by his name on the board in the back every week) so I don’t know when he’s even in. 

Cue a panic attack and wanting to die of shame for the rest of the night.

K has since said she was just having a hard time and that she isn’t leaving, that he was only hard on her because she needed to step things up. It pains me to see such a good friend of mine let herself be treated that way.

Overall, I’m worried to the point of throwing up because I know that when I go back in tomorrow, it’s going to be a shitshow. Rumors will have already spread that I’m a disrespectful shit talker, I’ll probably get written up, who knows what else. So, here’s the advice I need: am I crazy for thinking he’s an egomaniac on a power trip or am I actually being disrespectful and spiteful?

I’m searching for a new job. I’ve wanted to for weeks now since the job is so physically and mentally draining, but getting minimum wage for all the shit I go through and now having to deal with being labeled a damn heretic, I know I need out. I just don’t want to leave until I find a job so I don’t end up in a financial pit if I can help it.


TLDR: Manager is comparable to a cult leader, I said something about him to the wrong people, and now I’m probably gonna be in trouble at work tomorrow, both from management and my peers. Am I wrong for calling his behavior as I see it in defense of myself and my team or am I just the difficult, disrespectful one?",23Dec2019,1

136,"About 2 years ago (1 year and 7 months) I was in a relationship with my ex-girlfriend. It lasted only about 3 months, during those 3 months I came inside her with no condom or pill. A few weeks later she tells me she had her period. We ended breaking up 2 weeks after that because she was texting her ex (who lives in a different country) that she loves him. Right when we were saying our goodbye's, I asked her if she was lying about her period. She said she was not lying.

Fast forward, it's now July of this year. I still had her number on whatsapp and I would constantly look for any signs of pregnancy or something (i have GAD) luckily nothing. Until her recent pic in July of this year on whatsapp. It was a pic of her taking a selfie with a baby. The baby looked nothing like me or her. But it had her skin color (I'm extremely pale white and she's a brown Malaysian-Puerto-Rican). It didn't have me or her features and the baby appeared indian to me.

This girl i went to HS with has been involved in the rave scene. She was a beautiful girl over the past i years and i noticed in the past three months shes looking more and more like an old lady. Like her beautiful features are gone and I'm suspecting she is heavily on drugs. (I know drugs go hand and hand with raves) last month i noticed a post on her Instagram of an nsfw pic of her with a guy in a pornographic position. Soon after it was deleted and her boyfriend recorded her dazed on his couch and gently slapping her lightly on her cheeks saying "" wow you like to get around and cheat on me for drugs"". I have since checked his profile and he was devasted to be cheated on by her and soon after her ig was deleted. I was worried what was going to happen to her. Suddenly i saw she was back ig, so i asked her if she was okay? But no response. Randomly today she sends a picture of her smiling saying Sos need help and smiling. She looked like she was in a public place. When i clicked back on the pic it was no longer viewable. I wanted to screenshot the pic just in case.

I'm worried that she could be trolling me, but i take all help seriously. I messaged her back but there wasnt a response. 

Sadly she is living three states aways from me, so im not sure what to do.

142,"For background, this guy (28M) and I (27F) went on a first date to a casual restaurant (he paid), we went on a second date to an expensive bar (I got there early before him and bought our drinks) and a third date a few days ago to a causal counter service (and inexpensive) breakfast place. When we got to the counter (on the third date) I ordered my food and the cashier asked me if that was all, I turned to my date and he said nothing so I said “yes” and proceeded to pay for my order. He made no offer to pay whatsoever. For background, he has a great job and does not appear to be struggling financially. I don’t know if I’m being too sensitive, but I was thrown off because I feel that at least in the very beginning it is polite and chivalrous for a man to at least offer to pay. I almost felt like this means he is not particularly interested in trying to impress me and that he should be putting in more effort so early on…. especially at an inexpensive restaurant (and I drove an hour to come somewhere that was close to him).

143,"I was born with Non-Verbal Learning Disorder. In elementary school, I tested out of it, which basically means that since then I'm in the range of ""normal"" mentally and not considered a problem. However, the issues of the disability have persisted well into adulthood. I'm now 24. 

&amp;#x200B;

I make too many mistakes at any job I've held, which were all either temporary or my boss would pressure me to quit. When I was a cashier, the till would often be off by $20 or so. When I worked as a legal assistant, I would make errors on forms and forget to correct them. When I worked in a warehouse, I would get confused about organization or prioritization of tasks. You get the idea. I can't hold a job, and as that's become clear on my resume, I can no longer attain one despite best efforts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated with a degree in International Relations at a low-level college, near the top of my class with honors and a prestigious scholarship that was supposed to help me go places, and in fact requires I work for a year in national security. I did a security clearance where I provided such excessive and convoluted information its become impossible for me to attain one after two years of them processing. I'm now working on a paper I have been doing with a professor, but I'm falling into a depression as I have no idea how to do anything that's not academically related and I'm losing motivation to apply anywhere or do anything after a year of failure after failure at starting a career. I can't afford a therapist.

144,"I have adhd (not really any hyperactivity). Each of my thoughts and the emotions tied to them feel like a lengthy emotional film/movie. Like when you watch your favourite film to cry at and you really feel every emotion expressed in that film,  it’s an all consuming thing and you feel drained afterwards. That’s how each of my thoughts and feelings feel constantly ( I’ve been told it’s an adhd thing). Dealing with it all honestly feels like a part time job. The issue is when I’m stressed, overwhelmed or upset. I’m REALLY experiencing it, like all consumingly.  I had a really tough time in upper school, I was just a very unhappy person during that time and had little guidance.  So during that time I developed a lot of unhealthy habits/ coping mechanisms. That was a few years ago and I’m in a much better place, doing well in education, socially, mentally, physically, going to therapy etc. However I’m doing a lot and I’m often feeling pretty drained, from dealing with myself mentally/emotionally and again I’ve been told it’s an adhd thing but I need quite a bit of time to recharge from social interactions to daily activities. So a bad habit I can’t seem to kick is that I completely abandon most self care when I’m stressed/ unhappy or overwhelmed. Because of a mix of doing a lot, feeling drained from most things and then so intensely feeling all of my thoughts and emotions. It’s what I’ve always done, from a 3rd person perspective I could tell that’s unhealthy but with yourself it’s hard to recognise. I stop showering, I stop eating, I stop sleeping much, I don’t brush my hair. I fix myself up enough so that others don’t notice but it’s honestly awful. I retook some exams a couple years ago and did so with only a short 3 month period of preparation (I studied them at school but I didn’t really understand the subjects, not a great school). And I honestly think I showered a handful of times during that period, my self care always completely takes a backseat whenever anything happens. When I was in a relationship and we had issues I’d stop taking care of myself completely, I wouldn’t shower, I wouldn’t eat. When I have a tight deadline, I stop. When I’ve been working 10-12 hour shifts on the trot, studying in between, I don’t even run a brush through my hair, I don’t tidy my space. Adding a social life to that, I’m good at making myself look,smell&amp; seem presentable but secretly I’ve hardly been eating, showering or just been doing anything for myself. This isn’t constantly, I have short periods where I’m better with it but it just seems to be my awful habit. Does anyone else experience this/ has experienced it???. Or just any suggestions at all would be wonderful, thank you in advance.",23Dec2019,1
145,"I need help getting closure from falling for my best friend

This is going to be really long so I apologize in advance. 

My coworker (29m) let’s call him dan, and I (22f) have a very unique relationship. We work together but in different sections of our department. It started off as friends and then we became really really close. Like we tell each other everything, he calls me just to chat and talk about our days, and we go out for drinks pretty much weekly. I’ve never had a connection like this with another person. He’s great and we have a very strong bond. We laugh a lot together and I really really trust him. He gives me lots of good advice career wise and always has my back. 

So here’s the issue. “Dan” has a girlfriend (24f). When we first started hanging out, he would say that their relationship was still new and he didn’t know what was going to happen with it, that he didn’t love her and wasn’t sure if he could see himself marrying the girl, etc. she lives an hour and a half away and they only see each other once a week, if that. Sometimes once every two weeks. 

WELLLLL one night we went out for drinks. I drove to his house, he drove us and then we went back to his house and he walked me to my car and hugged me and we kissed. Then one thing led to another and we slept together. I slept over. This happened a few more times over the course of the last couple months. I also slept with someone else and of course dan knows, I tell him everything but this whole thing is so weird. We are both openly jealous of this stuff, and he always says he doesn’t know what to do. I feel like I’m reluctant to seriously get involved with anyone because part of me wants to see if there’s a chance. I told him the other day that I NEEDED him to tell me there’s no chance so I can be over this and he said “I see a future with you this situation is just so complicated.” 

The only reasoning he can give for not being in a relationship with me is that we work together. We decided to stop sleeping together because it’s not fair to his girlfriend and it’s just screwing us up even more and I feel like shit for doing it I know it was wrong so please don’t attack me for it. I’ve never been in this situation before and I’m really upset about it. 

I would never put him in a situation where he had to choose. He’s my best friend and I love being with him, even if it’s just friendly but I can’t push these feelings aside and neither can he because he always brings it up. We talked last week about it and how he’s afraid to end things with her and I just kind of cried hysterically because I’m hurt and I really care for this guy but it’s not his fault entirely, it’s also mine. I don’t know what to do or what to really say to him To have a conversation with him about it. We aren’t sleeping with each other but we do still hangout and the feeling are there and it  breaks my heart but I also don’t want to stop being his best friend. 

I’ll add that no one in our workplace knows about this. We keep our friendship very low key because drama and rumors spread like wildfire there. No one even knows we hangout outside of work.

148,"Heyyy! So the other night I got really drunk and passed out on my floor. My room mate checked in on me in the morning and said I had vomited on and peed myself and was a mess. They showered me and changed my sheets then put me back in bed with a bucked for me to spew in next to me. Anyway, I got up a few hours later (still intoxicated) and went for a shower. Whilst in the shower I felt the sudden urge to take a poo. Instead of just pooing in the shower I thought I’d go to the toilet but as I turned off the shower I realised I’d have to do a nudie run to the toilet and my room mate would see me. So instead I ran straight across to my bedroom and with a split second decision I decided to standover the spew bucked on my bedroom floor. However, as I was intoxicated I completely missed the bucket and shat on the carpet. I freaked out and didn’t know what to do so I picked up the poo with my hands and ran it to the bathroom sink and pushed it down the sink but the carpet still stinks like poo?!? It’s like stained and I don’t know what to do. Oh and to help the day I had, I forgot to wipe (because I was so stressed about the carpet) so I got dressed for the day and saw a friend and smelt like poo the whole day.

149,"I work as a concierge at an apartment complex and it’s a rule that we’re not allowed to accept stuff like money or keys from residents. I basically just handle packages and parking passes and if you need numbers I tell you who to call.

Recently one of the residents gave me a cute card and I appreciated it but she put $40 in the card.

No photos were taken no insurance was exchanged no license plates were taken down.

about an hour after this happened he called me and told me that the scratches weren’t rubbing out and he might have to get an estimate. He told me that he wouldn’t call insurance but then proceeded to ask me to see him the following day. . he was making me very uncomfortable on the phone saying things like don’t worry baby girl so I dodged the question and ended the phone call saying I had to go and then texted him saying that he could get an estimate if he would like and I would pay for the repair. he then replied “or we can handle this another way 😉” 

I did not reply to this message and at this point I’m hoping it will just go away but I am looking for advice on how to proceed in this situation. i am 21f and a student and would really prefer to just not involve insurance because I already have another insurance claim happening with the car that hit me two weeks ago.

Tonight someone sent nude pictures of me to my mother from a texting app. He told me he was going to ruin my life and an “eye for an eye”. He’s very conniving and manipulative. He frequently posts about me on social media. I’ve file a report with the police and went to the courthouse and got an ex parte order of protection, I went seeking legal counsel and showed him the stack of threats and harassment. He said since I’ve responded to him that I might as well just drop the protection order and just ignore it. It’s still ongoing and has not stopped. He drove by my house yesterday and my ring camera caught it. He said he was going to ruin my life and he is doing a fine job doing so. I don’t know where else to turn or what else to do but it keeps getting worse.

clarification on my reason for adoption the reason I don't want to be apart of the creation of a person is I can't help bring another into this world with my family's preposition to mental disability as I suffer from acute anxiety disorder that requires medication or I could have seizures and a buttload of depression.

168,"I went through a traumatic experience relating to an undiagnosed mental disorder a couple years ago, and when I came home my brother was really mean/rude to me and triggered it further nearly every night for about a year, to the point where I was having frequent suicidal thoughts, having breakdowns almost every night, and eventually lived at my grandparents' house for a month (before I turned 18, too). I even cut myself in hopes that my parents would finally recognize that this is serious and stand up for me, and of course they didn't (they act like this is something for me and my brother to ""get over"" when in reality I asked him simple requests to not trigger my severe anxiety and he either denied, yelled at me, or was very derogatory). He also often yelled or cursed at my Mom. Additionally, almost every time he visits home from college now, he is a jerk in some way. For example, one time he bragged about how he was stronger than me, because .... he's male and I'm not? Another time, I was beating him in Smash Bros., and he started saying offensive things. Yet another time, we were on vacation and he came home from Disney, I went out to say good night to him, and he started yelling at me *out of the blue* for getting the bedroom with two beds all to myself while he got the sofa bed (because of my severe sleeping conditions -- I may have hardly slept otherwise). You get the drift, he's a rude, inconsiderate, and immature asshole who only spreads negativity and bad feelings (as well as remind me of lots of traumatic memories). Frankly, he is emotionally abusive.

Because of how bad he has always made me feel the past few years, I avoid him now at all costs. When he comes home I either go to an AirBNB or sleepover at my boyfriend's house (which is often inconvenient since sometimes it is in the middle of the semester, when I should be studying or relaxing, not spending hours packing and traveling).

He's coming home for Christmas presumably (as well as other major holidays in the future), and every time a day like that comes up, my parents act all offended and hurt that I don't want to see the person who traumatized me so much I even have dreams of heated arguments between us. Now, I am just as Christian as my parents and boyfriend is (if not more so), so of course I believe in forgiveness as well. **However**, even once I can forgive him, I don't want to spend time with someone who has hurt me so much, and would just be a continuous shadow to my health and well-being. Every time I see him, he either says something extremely rude, is difficult, and overall I feel like shit for a while -- no one in their right mind would choose to spend time with an emotionally abusive person, regardless of whether they forgive them or not.

However, my parents, even after over 2 years and all that has happened, still see this as a ""you two need to make up"" deal, not as a brother relentlessly triggering (and sometimes bullying) his sister into desparation. They can't seem to detach forgiveness from being a doormat to letting ""family"" walk back into your life. (In case you haven't guessed, I don't give a shit about someone just because they're ""family"" -- real family doesn't hurt you extensively).

Additionally, my boyfriend, who of all people should be on my side about this especially .... likes dropping in comments that, for example, I should stay home for Christmas it'd make my parents happy, I should make up with him, etc. .... while ignoring the fact I'd inevitably feel like shit after/during his visit, and have to relive a lot of bad memories.

By the way, in case it is relevant, I now have it diagnosed that I have OCD and ASD, and I take a daily moderate dose SNRI. My school also recognizes my disabilities and gives appropriate accommodations. The only ones who don't recognize my disabilities are the people who were supposed to care about my well-being the most.

**In short, how do you make a convincing argument that forgiveness does not mean accepting emotional abuse from anyone, even family? (Or is it even worth trying to explain it again to them at this point? I've tried so many times, but maybe an external argument I haven't thought of would help next time it comes up.)** If I say someone hurts me too much, then I don't understand why they would encourage me to only continue being hurt, just to pursue a superficial relationship that I will never care about -- if they wanted the family together so bad, then I think they should've stood up for me when I needed them most.

*(Note: For anyone reading this and ready to go ""SnOwFlAke lol,"" let me be the first to point out that I have exceeded my brother in almost every way despite being two years younger than him. He failed calculus I; I tutored far above that when I was his age then, and am halfway through a math degree now. He didn't apply for scholarships, while I did, and I got multiple offers for free rides at various colleges (and took one up, the private STEM school near me). Needless to say, he's gotten himself in quite a lot of debt already, while I have never even taken out a loan or gotten a credit card, and have ~$11,000 in the bank while no longer working as a tutor even (I save money fervently). Finally, he used to vape, does not change his oil on time (and got car trouble), had high cholesterol (or blood pressure? I forget) at 21 years old, does not sleep nearly enough and eats barely anything or just shitty foods, while I sleep ~9.5 hours every night, have been waking up early for the past over a month, and eat lots of fruits. This ""snowflake"" will clearly be much more successful than some emotionally abusive asshole.)*",23Dec2019,1
169,"For those not wanting to read a long post there is a TL;DR at the bottom.

So... I tiptoe around my dad a lot and I tend to lie to him a lot. The reason being is because 1)  I'm a pagan, and with him being extremely Christian with a bit of prejudice towards other religions, I'm afraid to tell him, because he's likely to cut me out of his life, and 2) I hang around my stepdad because he really is like a second dad to me, but my biological dad absolutely hates him.

Context: my mom left my dad when I was 15 because she cheated on him with my current stepdad. Not a good move, but my stepdad ended up treating my mom better than my dad ever did. My dad decided then to become incredibly religions, and tried to use religion to control the situation (God says divorce is evil and sinful, etc.) And it didn't work. My dad held a grudge against them, and still sort of does.

Earlier this year my mom passed away from cancer. I'm terrified of losing my dad too, so I've been lying about my beliefs and who me and my daughter are around so he doesn't cut us off.

Two problems: first is my two year old daughter is talking more and more, and eventually will say something because she's a charter box. And not to mention she probably notices when I bluff to my dad around her and I don't want to teach her that ""lying is ok."" Second problem is I've noticed that I've been lying more, and not just to my dad. Like little lies, ones that wouldn't matter if I actually told the truth, and I hate myself for it. This started when I started talking to my dad again (roughly 3 years ago, before that I hadn't spoken to him for 3 years) and I can't help but feel like it's related to me having to lie about myself...

The reason this all finally came up is because my friend had an extra car seat she was going to lend to my dad because my car seat got left at my stepdads house and the other one was in the van that my husband took to work. My friend mentioned that my stepdad had my car seat to my dad, and he questioned me on it immediately. I told him that I didn't want to discuss it right then and there and avoided the question completely.

Later my friend talked to me about it and I said that I finally have a healthy relationship with my dad and didn't want to ruin it, and she said that if I have to lie about myself and who I'm around to avoid anger then it isn't a healthy relationship... And I think I already knew that, but I didn't want to admit it. I haven't heard from him much since then, and when my husband picked up our daughter, my dad didn't say anything about it, but he doesn't let stuff like this go.



TL;DR: been lying to my dad to avoid drama and being cut off, but that has its own consequences that I don't want and he'll find out the truth eventually.

It's time to be honest with him, but I don't know how to even start and I really don't want to lose him.",23Dec2019,1

171,"Tldr at bottom.
 PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU WOULD DO OR SUGGEST I DO.

I was at target buying my fiance a couple secret presents (we share bank accounts) and some wrapping stuff for my family. The end cost was $120 and I was at a self-checkout.  I was going to use 2 gift cards ($15 and $10), $40 in cash, and the rest on our card so my fiance wouldn't notice the costs.  Once I got the gift cards used and the cash inserted I tried my debit card and the checkout computer stopped working, so the cashier comes over, prints out my rescan receipt and the gift cards/cash that the computer had already used and moves me to another self-checkout.  I try the gift cards again and they won't work so she goes and makes another $15 dollar gift card and it won't work either so she takes me over to the checkout and has to scan everything again and then scans my 2 gift cards, adds in the cash and then scans the extra $15 dollar gift card she had made to replace mine as an apology for having to rescan, then she adds in my $40 cash once again and tells me my change is $.70 cents, but I only had 50 cents so she finds quarter on the counter and gives me .05 cents back.  I was in such a daze I didnt think twice about it but once I got home I started thinking about the money more and looked at the receipt and realised she entered in my $40 in cash twice by accident and so I actually only paid $40.45 and used $25 in gift cards to pay for a $120 tab.  I want advice on if I should go back and explain the situation and pay another $40 dollars or just leave it alone and move on? 

TLDR: Cashier put in my cash twice on computer and gave me extra $15 giftcard for having to rescan everything and I leave only paying $40.45 on a tab that was 120.70.  Do I go back to Target and explain, or just leave it alone?",23Dec2019,1
172,"hi. So im 18 and so is my friend. I’m from a low income background and I’m very academic. Like I read a lot and I love learning and I do reallly well in school and everything. So I wanted to go to this really competitive college with great opportunities and, more importantly, great financial aid so that I could afford to attend. I found an amazing top school to apply to and I spent like 5 months perfecting my application. I’d wanted to go to the school since 10th grade and did everything, took Ap classes, got a perfect score on the act, did crazy extracirriculars that I loved and wrote amazing essays that I poured my heart into. It was a heavy process. the only thing was that my friend also applied early. Out of all the schools she could’ve applied to, she chose mine. Whatever, I was fine because I knew that my application was the best it could be and everything would be fine. I wasn’t that worried about my friend “taking my spot” because I knew that she had lower grades, test scores, and average extracirriculars, plus she’s kind of mean and quiet so I didn’t think she would come off great in essays/interviews. We both got in. It’s an insanely selective school that I’ve been dying to get into, and I got in. I was elated for a bit but when I found out she got in too my heart sunk a little bit. I just feel now that my acceptance was worthless or just a given. Literally no one from my school has gotten in ever and I wanted to feel special because I sorta feel like I am special. I’m from a really disadvantaged background and I’ve studied so hard and done great things in high school and excelled far greater than a lot of richer kids like my friend, and now I don’t feel special at all. Like my friend and I are in the same category whereas I’ve just worked so much harder than her and I’m so much nicer to people and I don’t talk trash or wish badly upon others like she does and my family is so much poorer than hers and she’s gotten the few accomplishments she has from her parents or her parents money and I don’t like that we ended up in the same place.
I can’t cut her off even though she’s talked bad about others because she’s one of my only friends and I don’t want our friendship to end completely because we have all our classes together and have been close for a long time, I just can’t get over resenting her for taking away my specialness

Over the last five to six months I have had no drive/energy to be around friends or family. I get annoyed/irradiated and mad when I am around them and want to be alone, even though I know I am I only going to be sad when I when I am alone, resulting in me getting high. Yet, I just don't have the emotional capacity to be around people. 

Even when I am around them, I get angry at them so easily, genuinely hating the people I love. I don;t care if they are mad at me or if I am dicks so them.  For example, a friend asked me to go hang with him and some other people. I told him no, telling him I hated him. I was being serious, but he didn't know that.  I don't know why I hated him, I was fine a couple hours before, having just spoke to him for around 3 hours while playing games.

I have started to worry about myself, realizing that I have been distancing myself away from people from either lack energy or just pure hatred towards the people. Is there something wrong with me or am I just being over dramatic and just need to stop being a dick?",23Dec2019,1

177,"Well it all started in 8th grade (I am now in 10th) and I’ve been crushing on her ever since, but for the last couple of days I’ve just been feeling so in love with her.  Last thursday we had our yearly christmas prom right before break, and all my friends literally know I crush on this girl; teasing me with comments about me and this girl being perfect etc. I was not gonna let my last year of being together with this girl, slip through my hands. 

During the prom I was trying to allocate this girl with a few friends looking after her too, knowing her every whereabout just incase this random prick she has no interest in, offers to dance (We have a policy at our prom that if someone refuses a dance, he or she would get written down and get in trouble).
One hour in and they finally started playing perfect by Ed Sheeran. «Perfect!», I exclaimed inside of me (not thinking about the song, but the pieces that are falling together) I was trying to find this girl with my friends, and there she was, my crush. I turned to my friends to make some form for breathing room for my brain to comprehend that any second, I’m gonna be dancing with her.

Turned back around and approached several steps towards my crush, and then I see the prick dancing with her. I was furious at the sight of this prick snatching her as I approached. I had a pretty cool facade and told my friends it was cool, but no, it wasn’t. I wanted to punch the living shit out of him, but I restrained myself. Later in the last hour, I felt hopeless, that mere second or two I threw away, also costed me a dance I’ve been waiting THREE YEARS for. One of my friends comforted me by saying he would force the DJs to play another song fitting for slow dance, and then proceeded to teach me the proper posture and the how to move to the rhythm. 

Then I felt ready after that intensely fast course of How to Slow Dance 101. My friend went up to the stage telling the DJs to play a song, went down whilst the music was playing and quickly ran over to go get my crush that was waiting for a saving grace against this prick, quickly got her attention and pulled me over to her. I offered her  to dance.

The song playing in the background was Thinking Out Loud by Ed Sheeran, we were both dancing and enjoying our time together dancing and towards the end we both began singing along, and that was when I finally felt some tension between us. She’ve been previously throwing flirty comments like: «I dig you», proceeding to awkwardly laugh and have the biggest, most adorable smile on her face and «All the boys were pretty hot tonight, and you Mr_Iceteea». Later thinking that mentioning my name must’ve meant something? I had no idea.
 
For some days now we’ve been snapping about some unfinished homework everyone except me forgot, so I told her and helped her. In addition to this, we’ve been talking about piano and stuff, plus she added me to her private snapchat story?

189,"I'm a sixteen year old sophomore guy in the United States and things haven't been going well since eighth grade. In the past two years, I've done a lot of things that rubbed people the wrong way and I'm just going to explain them one by one. Any advice you can give (literally anything that could have popped into your mind) would be greatly appreciated. 

I went to a private school from fifth grade to eighth grade, and everyone was pretty close. Our class had the most amount of students in a class in eighth grade, with fourteen students. In seventh grade we had a girl join named Amy. She was short and kind of shy but like the rest of us assimilated in due to just how small our school really was. I considered her to be a pretty close friend even though we didn't talk outside of school and I had a crush on her for the longest time. One of the worst days I had in eighth grade was our field trip to a waterpark. I don't exactly know what happened but something there made me feel like I had lost friends, and that everyone I thought I knew there were just faking who they were. It was about a two hour drive back to the school, and I was in a horrible mood. I felt like crying, but then Amy tapped on my shoulder from the back of the van we were in, and asked if I was okay. I said yeah, and we talked for a bit until the topic of movies came up. I mentioned that I recently saw the film ""Battle Royale"", and she was intrigued by it. The movie was on Netflix at the time, so I brought it up and we watched it along with a few other people sitting in the back with us. At that point, it was the closest thing I had ever had to being on a date with a girl, so it completely changed my mood. The year then came and went. We went to Washington DC on a school trip for a few days, and she remained a pretty good friend. Fast forward to last summer, and I'm volunteering at our old school during their annual orientation, and she gets there with her little sister to help get her things set up in her locker. I of course talked to her and asked how high school was going, but she didn't really feel like talking. She didn't even feel like she had changed too much, it felt more like I had changed. This really confused me, because I personally think I had changed for the better since middle school. I had become a lot more mature, I had taken on leadership positions not only in extracurriculars, but even in my day to day life.  I had been working out and my acne had for the most part gone away, so I think I was looking a lot better, so it confused me as to why she didn't want to talk to me. We had very briefly talked during the summer when I was in Argentina and she was in New York. We just spent a few hours one day sending pictures back and forth and talking a little bit about how life was going. She felt like the exact same person. After the incident at the school, I made the mistake of being honest. I texted her and asked what happened and if I did anything to rub her the wrong way or if I did anything to make her upset. She texted back saying that it's within our best interests to go our separate ways and that we shouldn't stay in contact anymore. She said that things are just really busy and she didn't exactly give a clear yes or no answer to my question. I think in hindsight a lot of time apart and making new friends kind of drove us apart, but I didn't really expect her to say that we shouldn't stay in contact anymore. Regardless, I wished her a good tenth grade year and we went our separate ways. To me, she was a big part of middle school, and I loved being around her. Maybe she wasn't exactly who I thought she was, but I always held her in somewhat high regard, and I would do anything for her. I texted her in Argentina just a few months after a horrible breakup with the only girlfriend I ever had (we had dated for seven months), and seeing her again really made me feel happy. After coming back though, I caught up with a few other people that I used to know and that's where things really went downhill.

This next girl's name is Kala. Kala was a quiet, nerdy girl in the grade below me in eighth grade. It may sound mean that I describe her as nerdy, but she was. I never made fun of her or anything, and generally speaking we never really talked to each other. I saw her while volunteering, and she looked like a different person. She was absolutely beautiful, and it shocked me. I began talking to her for a while, and it turns out that we had a lot in common. We both listened to similar music, we were both die hard fans of ""The Office"", and we both really liked Model United Nations. Talking to her was like a drug to me. She was giving all sorts of signs that she liked me. We spend hours texted and talking to each other, which eventually led to us going to see a movie. We saw ""Annabelle 3"" in theaters with a few other friends. One of her mutual friends was the only one who bought a ticket for the movie because she looks like she's eighteen. The rest of us had to sneak in. She sat on the very end, with me sitting next to her and it was a lot of fun. I was trying to scare her but jumping out or yelling whenever we were anticipating a jumpscare, and we were laughing the whole time. We were sharing an armrest together with our elbows touching each other and everything just felt perfect. Just for reference, the only other first date I had experienced started with my ex girlfriend being 45 minutes late. Things with Kala just felt perfect, and when I was talking to her everything that had gone wrong for me melted away. After that, I decided to be bold and ask her on an ""official"" date. She said yes, so I was excited. We met up with some friends but she and I went to go see a different movie while everyone else went to go see another one. During the movie, she kept checking her phone and walked out then in a few times. The movie felt overall a bit dissatisfying, but I kept my head up because we were going to walk around the mall for a bit afterwards. She kept walking ahead of me and kept talking to her friend. At one point her friend brought up something about how a cute Mexican boy was talking to one of their friends. Kala responded by saying ""God, I would do anything to be in her position"". All of this led to me just being very quiet and uncomfortable, and later that night I was honest and told her how I was feeling. She said she was sorry and didn't mean for things to be weird, and said we would redo the date. I said okay and felt a little bit better. The next day she sends me a few paragraphs of texts talking about how she was really sorry but she was still in love with her ex boyfriend. Her ex I know really well, and I've known him since fifth grade, so I didn't have a problem with him. I did the absolute worst thing I could have done though and got mad at her. I felt as though I had been cheated, and that she only hung out with me and went on a date with me because she felt bad for me. I don't want to go into too much detail but I was really mean about the whole ordeal and I now feel horrible about what I said to her. Since then I've tried to apologize, but she rightfully doesn't accept them. I know what I did was horrible and I've learned and moved on, but thinking about how I was in the wrong and how I felt around her makes me feel anguish. I had trouble sleeping knowing that everything that happened with her was completely my fault. Because of this, I play up the whole situation with our mutual friends. I cope by saying it was her fault and calling her names, because otherwise I want to burst into tears when thinking about what I did. I would give anything for her to understand that I've learned from my mistakes that I'm truly sorry, but she isn't going to listen to me. Fast forward and I started playing soccer for my high school this year. We had probably our biggest game of the season just two days ago and she went to it. I was sitting in the stands for a little bit and she unknowingly sat down right in front of me. I was with a friend and she turned around and just looked at us and said ""hi"". After that, she got up and looked for someone else to sit with. I just wanted to let everything out in that moment right there. I wanted to talk until I had nothing left to say and leave no stone unturned. I didn't though. I just told the friend I was with that we went on a date and that it was both of our faults that it didn't work out. I lied about it again. Everything that has gone wrong with friends so far has been because I was too bold and too honest about how I felt. I really think I loved her, and maybe to a certain extent I still do. I would give anything to have another chance with her. I would give anything to apologize to her. I would give anything for her to understand just how sorry I am and that I've changed. She's gone sailing with me before, but hasn't gone to any of the Saturday sessions we have. I think it's because I go to those sessions. Part of me almost hopes she sees this post and can hear me out. I'm not going to bad mouth her anymore just because doing otherwise puts weight on my conscious. I'm just going to move on. 

That puts us in the present. Besides what's been going on with Kala, things are overall going well. I've met a few new girls that I'm really close friends with, but I haven't made any moves. One of my best friends right now I really like, but I think she's bi (I don't have a problem with this but I'm not sure how I'd feel about dating a bi girl). We get along really well and talk a lot in school. I got her a Christmas present and we might meet up during winter break. I also have a lot more friends this year than I did last year. I've been lifting weights and can now deadlift 400 lbs (I weigh less than 130). I have a lot more this year than I did last year, but I really only find happiness and gratification when I'm talking to people or when I'm at school or soccer. I feel like I want to be something different, but I don't know what I'd want to be. There are also more people that I've wronged, but I didn't talk about them because it was either completely justifiable, or I'm conflicted on if it was justifiable.

192,"So I (23F) moved in with my roommate, the same age as me, a little over a month ago. She and I have been close friends since high school, though we went to different colleges.

She has always been super responsible and grown up. We always joke around that she’s the mom friend and has her shit together more than any of our other friends. But she’s definitely going through some tough stuff emotionally- her parents might get back together after having divorced. Mind you, they divorced because her father molested both my roommate and her younger sister when they were going through puberty. So she’s naturally feeling really confused and betrayed and a lot of emotions that I won’t pretend I fully understand.

But here’s the meat of the story: this weekend, we had a holiday party with friends and she invited her ex. My roommate and her ex are still really close friends, and when he showed up from another state, after saying he wasn’t coming, everyone was surprised. He was planning on coming home for the holidays anyway, but we weren’t expecting him to show up. And he has a girlfriend. Who didn’t know he was making a pit stop to see my roommate.

Last night, he was still in town, so we all ended up going to a bar together with this guy I’ve been seeing. Eventually we parted ways, because her ex was drunk and wanted food, and me and my date wanted to go back to his place.

This morning, I get a text that my roommate had drunkenly slept with her ex. And I wasn’t at all surprised, but she seems to think he was blackout and didn’t remember having sex with her, but she’s debating telling him. And she was nowhere near as drunk as he was.

And now, I’m off of work, and I get a phone call from my roommate that her other ex (a guy who cheated on her) is apparently hanging out at our place, and she’s like “yeah, it’s that guy, so you know. He’s not nice.” 

And I get why she fucked the first ex. They’re bad as a couple, but they have a really strong connection and I know it must be hard to just be friends with someone you felt that deeply for at one point. But the fact that she doesn’t really care about his girlfriend’s feelings, when I have listened to her bitch endlessly about this man in our living room being a cheater... my brain is absolutely boggled. Like, I don’t know what the hell she’s doing. The sex with her first ex was one thing, but now she’s got another one here and I don’t know if she’s like having an existential crisis?

How do I be a good friend but also respectful of boundaries? I don’t want to be judgmental, but I’m really concerned by this behavior that’s really out of character for her.",23Dec2019,1

She’ll complain about doing work like a child “ahhhh i dont wanna do woorrrrkkk!!” and continue to complain about how she doesn’t have a direction in life but doesn’t want to do anything about it, and talk about how she’ll end up in her 70s doing the same thing. It’s just...too much after a while. Like I said before, she isn’t a bad person, but a lot of other coworkers as well as myself just want to tell her to grow up and stop acting like a child. It’s like we’re working with someone who’s in elementary/jr high school 

TLDR: coworker acts immature and I want to find a firm but polite way to tell her to grow up.",23Dec2019,1
199,"Hello,

I’m a 25 year old woman with hsv1—I’m fairly certain that it is genitally located but there’s a small chance that it’s oral. 

Anyway, about 6 months ago I disclosed to a guy that I had been dating for a month (5 dates) that I had ghsv1. At first it went well but then he ended up backing out, he told me that “ there were other things unrelated to this that have been brought up that I also have to consider in parallel”.

This disclosure was my first and only one and it was honestly traumatizing. Every day my mind goes back to that day back in July. I keep feeling so much shame and embarrassment knowing that there is someone walking around who knows this very humiliating thing about me.

I live in a huge city of over 2 million people, but I still get paranoid that one day I’ll run into this guy or maybe one of his friends. I get paranoid that I’ll meet someone he knows and they’ll know this intimate secret of mine. I can’t stop thinking about this and I haven’t brought myself close enough to disclose to anyone again since.

I feel like a bad person, like I did something wrong. How can I stop replaying that day? How can I get past this?",23Dec2019,1
200,"my brother is 16, I’m older then him by a little. 

He has always been “weird” but I just thought he was an erratic personality, however since age 13 he has periods of deep depression but then he will suddenly think he is gods gift to the world and some sort of genius. 

But since these last few months it’s really escalated. For about two weeks from late October to early November he didn’t leave his room barely and missed like half of school in that period, but since then he was briefly normal but now he has become so pretentious. 

Just today he told me that he is “Michelangelo waiting for Lorenzo Di Medici to free his intellect” and he draws this stupid stuff such as a concept for 4th and 5th dimensional travel. 4th is just diagonal highways and 5th was basically wormholes or something. 
He also compared himself to David Bowie, MLK and The Greek Titan Prometheus on Snapchat. 

I’m not trying to bash my bro but this is really annoying for me and he can be quite rude, in the opposite side I’m scared he will hurt himself sometimes when he is depressed. 

Is he just an asshole or is their something wrong with him?",23Dec2019,1
201,"Ok I’m new here

For context I’m 15 year old guy in 9th grade with excellent performance in class and at home when it comes to chores.  both my parents are 57 and these are a few things that we don’t see eye to eye on. I would really appreciate it if you read this and gave me feedback I desperately need it.(sorry if punctuation,grammar and spelling are incorrect here. It was late when I typed this)

So. My parents seem to have this issue where they don’t want me to grow up but they want me to be very mentally intelligent and stuff and it’s starting to irritate me. 

So let’s start out with my dad. My dad had this issue where personally I think he just wants to be in control of something because he sets these limits on EVERY SINGLE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICE I HAVE!!! Like im not joking there is not a single piece of tech that my dad doesn’t “provision” (that’s the word he uses when he installs all of his snooping software.) The only thing he hasn’t provisioned yet is my iPhone 7 Plus because I earned it with my money and he just ordered it for me. He was going to but I got mad at him for trying to control something that technically was legally mine since I technically paid for it. But basically what makes my skin crawl is that I have a Ps4 Pro and my dad has set a limit for how long I can be on it. It’s typically from 11 am too 7 pm. But here’s the thing. He can’t make up his mind on what he wants it to be. He changes “curfew” all the time and it’s SO ANNOYING! Today I was playing and he changed my ps4 to stop working at 8 today when usually on weekends he lets me play till 9. I was angry because I thought we had a good schedule 7 on the weekdays and 9 on the weekends but his argument to why I shouldn’t be playing “so late” was quote; I don’t think you should be playing so late you should be reading and getting tucked in for bedtimes”.This sentence right here made me want to do some horrible things to him but I kept my cool and reiterated the fact that I just turned I am 15 and I’m doing really well in high school (all “a”s) and that the schedule we had going on was never a problem until now then he said that he turns it off early because  he’s worried about blue light affecting me (even though he stays up all night to watch tv) and that I haven’t been reading enough. Now about the blue light thing first, both my parents seem to think I need them for everything and that I cannot function on my own but I can do some chores by myself. I turn on blue light filters and dark modes when I’m on my devices I also have the brightness to the minimum. But the reading is the main problem for him. My dad doesn’t really see me that much because he is on the computer doing coding and stuff but he automatically seems to know that I’m not reading and I’m just on my phone or the ps4 all the time. That I think is unfair because he doesn’t see me all the time and I do read just not conventionally. I don’t like being told to do certain things like reading and chores etc but I get them done when people DONT tell me to do them. Same thing with reading. I will read on my own and it will be more enriching than when my mom or dad tells me read and I just stare at the words and turn the page. They just don’t understand it at all and it’s almost like they don’t want to listen to my opinions when I comes to reading. 

The next thing is that I’ve never had a device without him going through it and putting in all of his parental controls.. whenever I got a new tech thing for Christmas or my birthday it was always opened and had the settings tinkered with so he never even gave me the chance to monitor my own screen time. I do it diligently with my new iPhone. The kicker is that he won’t let me try and monitor my own screen time and it’s redundant  because when I eventually leave them nobody is going to have my stuff set to turn off at a certain time. (Also about above with the reading I read articles on the web and car magazines with full articles and I’ll occasionally read a chapter book) 
Another thing about time limits is I don’t have any friends in high school but I have a few friends in my street that are a bit younger and we play on the ps4 together and I’m always the first person to leave because the program that automatically locks me out of my ps4, SCHOOL PROVIDED COMPUTER, my home computer that I don’t use because he set the time limit to 30 minutes and forgot the password, and my previous phones. All at 7 pm mind you. He does this for the same to reasons; blue light and my reading, but he doesn’t realize even when I tell him that it’s only hurting me and my social life.

Another thing with him is that he waited so late to let me have a phone with phone service (14 years old) that I was never able to hang out my friends because I couldn’t contact them and nobody liked calling each other and so now most of my friends stopped talking to me because I couldn’t do anything about my parents not letting me have phone service. Oh my god and when I finally got it he went crazy. Because when we left the Verizon place he locked my phone in the glove box of our car and sat on the key and waited for me to get out so he could put another highly protective layer on my phone. It wasn’t worth it. I could only test until 7 pm and I could make calls until 1 pm and by that point I didn’t have any friends so it was just a waste.

Now I am a 15 year old male that is organized academically and I am on the path of medicine when I go to college. My dad forced coding into me and he’s really pressuring me to get a job in coding so my future can be perfect because other jobs are going away and stuff. I have no social life because of them partially and I think it’s unfair how other kids my age and older have their parents loosening the reigns while both of my parents are tightening it so much I’m starting to choke.

Oh and in further detail about my phone limits; I couldn’t be on it for more than 3 hours in a 10 am to 7 pm time window, I couldn’t make calls for longer than 10 minutes even with an unlimited plan, I could only text for a total of an hour a day, he had norton parental controls on And he set the age to 10 years old so I wouldn’t be exposed to anything “scarring”, I was only allowed to use the YouTube Kids website so he could see my searches and I couldn’t use any web or multiplayer games.

Now onto my mom

I don’t know what to call this but my mom seems to have this issue where she doesn’t want me to leave either but she tells me these things like that she’s going to live in my house just us and that I’m going to pay for her medicine when she gets old and I’m her baby forever and stuff like that. She treats me like a baby when she wants too and then she expects me to grow up for other things and it’s super annoying. Then when i confront her about this or anything she gets mad and tells me to stop talking back to her and what especially makes me mad is when I try to get her to explain why she made some rule or when I’m right about something she says that “im raising my voice and that I need stop being disrespectful” I keep an even monotone in my voice so I don’t know why she says that. My final gripe is that I think that I have autism even though she says I don’t but when I do something she deems as “autistic” she compares me to my uncle who is weird and quirky and not autistic to try and get me to stop and she keeps me from doing a lot of things that most kids are doing at my age because apparently “ I can’t handle it”

So there we have it. Please tell me if my thinking is off or anything and please give me honest feedback because I really need your help. Thank you so much for reading this🙂",23Dec2019,1
203,"Ok I don’t know if I’m morbid in thinking this or what, but a couple weeks ago I noticed tonnes of flies in my apartment, naturally I searched everywhere think gross I left some food out or something (I’m not super tidy but I think I’d notice maggots like I’m not that bad haha ) nothing. Anyway there’s been heaps of flies in my apartment and it’s annoying as fuck and it’s from nothing here. 

I’ve noticed my neighbours mail box is overflowing with letters like they haven’t checked their mail in ages.i didn’t think much of it at first but it’s been a while. I haven’t noticed any smells which I think would be expected.

206,"My parents died from a drug overdose six years ago and I've been living with my grandmother ever since, not only so I'd have a place to live, but also to help her out as much as I can. As soon as I finish college, I plan on joining the Marine Corps. I've already filled out all the paperwork and have officially enlisted, I judt don't yet have a date on which I'll be shipping out to boot camp. At any rate, my grandmother fell last week and is in the hospital. The doctors don't think she'll recover. She's fallen before and was fine, but it seems like this time, she won't be coming back home. 

I've taken a leave from work while I spend time with her and help her get her affairs in order, which means that I haven't been working or making any money. I work part time while I go to college, so I don't make much money as it is. I was wondering if anyone knows of any assistance programs or any ways of *quickly* procuring a very short-term loan. I just need at minimum $120 for groceries and other necessities until I can get back to work. I don't have any credit, so a loan from the bank is out of the question. Nor do I have any collateral or things to pawn. Although I'm NOT asking for handouts, someone suggested that I link to my Venmo and PayPal accounts, so here they are: https://venmo.com/code?user_id=2804862433624064381 

paypal.me/JBotts3D 

I'm so incredibly grateful for everyone's help. I wasn't expecting donations. I've received twenty dollars so far, which is already a huge help! 

So back to my question: how can I quickly come up with $120 to get by until I return to work? I'd be happy to work out a short term loan with interest, but I can't post on r/borrow due to my account not meeting the karma requirements. I *sincerely* appreciate any and all help. This is turning out to be an incredibly shitty Christmas, as I'm about to lose my last remaining family member. I don't know how I'm going to get through this. My mind is starting to go to some *very* dark places.

Only in the office facilities however as we work for the same company. 

What can be done to break the ice? Find out a) if she’s interested; b) if she’s single; c) if we’re even compatible to take things outside of the office

All conversation to date are really just work related unfortunately. 

I think it’s jumping the gun to ask her out to a coffee at this point? But I’m eager to find a way to display even a slight amount of interest and hit on a topic non work related even if it’s just, “how was your weekend?”

Having said all that there’s a long way to go, IMO, and plenty of other fish in the sea. I really prefer to just rip the band aid off, but understand I must navigate this carefully as it is technically a coworker. At the minimum I need to be prepared for a wide array of responses and make sure my response is appropriate if I am rejected. 

If a guy in the office asked you to get coffee, that’s it just “hey wanna grab a coffee sometime?”  Keep in mind the guy is someone you don’t much more than what team he’s on. 

Would you perceive it as a date or just a colleague to colleague coffee? 

Would you expect it’s strictly professional or would you be open to discuss interests outside of your career?

210,"I have this friend of mine who always keeps his problems to himself even though he has his own loving family and us, his friends.
A month ago, his ex sent me a message telling me that she couldn't hide it anymore and that she needed to talk to one of her ex boyfriend's friends and eventually she chose me. I was a bit hesitant at first on talking to her since my friends and I knew she was kind of manipulative and she wasn't really good for our friend. But when she sent me those messages, I regretted all my judgements towards her. 
All we knew was that she was a crazy bitch all along when she started being so paranoid about my friend's whereabouts. She constantly checked on our social medias to see if her boyfriend was with us or not, because she literally made a time curfew for him. Of course, we would think that she was getting crazy because our friend was already having second thoughts on leaving her. It wasn't our idea to make our friend break up with her in the first place. It was our friend himself that told us that he was not happy anymore and he feels like he was getting choked with their relationship. 
Now I know why the girl was acting up. It's because she got pregnant with my friend. Unfortunately, she had a miscarriage after a couple of months due to several factors (I don't really know the details). She wanted to keep the baby though. She went through a lot after that. She went to the hospital on her own because my friend couldn't come with her, making some excuses and all. He only gave her money for the check-ups. Her family kicked her out of her house when they knew she got pregnant. She couldn't sleep, eat, and she can't even do good in her academics anymore just because of the paranoia and trauma she's been going through. It's really sad how she went through all of this while my friend was just posting memes and playing video games. 
I just want this to end and talk this through with my friend because I think that the pressure is on me. The girl constantly sends me messages that I couldn't even dare to read anymore because I don't know how to help her. She just wants to let my friend's family know what happened to her and I know this is just to make my friend go through what she has gone through with her family knowing that she got pregnant.  I also want to tell my friend that he needs to man up and face the problem that he has caused, but I can't. I don't know how I would bring his up to him.",23Dec2019,1

215,"Hi everyone,

This has been on my mind quite a bit lately, I'll try to make it short.. My stepdad and I have never really gotten along well. I moved out about two years ago and my stepdad started to come by every now and then, I was kind of annoyed at times as I was sure that my mom told him to come over to see if I was doing anything bad (was pretty rebellious growing up). He started to come by almost daily - he said he wanted to get used to my pretty big dog who used to be aggressive with him.. 

Well I started to feel just a little off when we went out for breakfast one day and he told me that he was taking a class on sexual assault and he told me he couldn't believe my mom didn't believe me when I told her my uncle (her brother) touched me when I was younger

A few days later he came by my apartment as usual and he starts pretty much complaining about how your mom does this, your mom does that (not a very good marriage to begin with). I always just kind of said yeah, she just needs help.. Next day or so, he started to say that I'm the only child of my mom's that he's really felt close to and was sitting next to me on my couch and had his arm over my shoulders for quite a while. He would complain a lot about his marriage.. Then the last time he came over he said something like, ""don't tell anyone but your mom always complains about how I am in bed. She gets mad because I don't have sex with her correctly. She doesn't understand that I waited to have sex until marriage and I don't have experience"" repeated stuff like that. When he was saying this he had his arms over my shoulders and I felt kind of uncomfortable..

I told my mom I didn't feel comfortable with any guys in my apartment and said it's nothing personal but I would rather not have my step dad come over. He was really upset about that and tried coming in again and I felt pretty uncomfortable when he did that. This happened about a year ago but it still crosses my mind quite a bit and I need a second opinion.. Do you think he was just needing someone to talk to or something else?

However,  for some reason whenever i wear a thong under my pants when im around  my mom, dad, relatives, and friends and co workers i feel so awkward and  weird about it. Like its as if i feel guilty or ashamed of my thong  wearing habit when im around people i know. almost as if im worried that  they might find out or know i am wearing a thong. or just the whole  excitement i have of wearing a thong goes away when im with friends and  family. i feel like wearing boxers around them. but if i am alone  wearing a thong or if i am in another town or somewhere in public like a  mall or something where i am not with anyone i know i feel comfortable  wearing the thong and feel more free.

basically  to simplify this, whnever i go to hang out with friends or family and i  have on a thong, it feels awkward. but if i lived in another country or  a town far far away from anyone that i know then i would easily be  comfortable wearing a thong in public under my pants aslong as i am not  with any familiar people such as friends and family.

i  tried several times wearing a thong under my pants when i went to work,  school, hanging out with friends, family parties. and i felt so awkward  wearing it even though i knew they didnt know i was wearing a thong.  but times that i wear a thong when i take vacations by myself to  different states or countries where i know that i wont run into anyone i  know, i feel so free and comfortable wearing a thong out in any public  place.",23Dec2019,1
222,"I’m a hopeless romantic. 

When I (M20) was in high school I had a best friend (F20). We started talking in grade 9 when I was 14 and she was 15, and within a few weeks we texted all the time. She was the only person I texted consistently, and every night we’d text until we said goodnight fell asleep. This lasted all throughout high school. 

In grade 11 I asked her out 3 times because I knew I loved her- she turned me down each time. In grade 12 she told me she liked me and we started dating. 

I feel as though we’re a perfect match; we never run out of things to say, we laugh all the time, we understand each other, we listen to each other’s problems, especially the ones that we don’t like talking about or what we try and hide from others- we’re ridiculously compatible. We’re so in sync that to this day we still end up saying the same thing or we can pretty much tell what the other is thinking. I always know when something’s up with her. 
We never argue really, but her parents didn’t like the idea of her dating in high school so the relationship was kept secret for a bit, then once it came out it didn’t go well. She still dated me for a while even though her parents didn’t like it and we never really had any issues despite that. 
Before I moved away for uni she dumped me after almost 8 months, she said it was because  my morale had changed and that we were growing differently, but I didn’t really understand what she meant, I felt like I was the same as I had always been. 

Shortly after uni started, she met this guy and they started dating. They broke up a couple times and got back together because her parents once again didn’t approve of who she was dating. She really loves him, I think it’s because she lost her v card to him because we never had sex- at the time we dated she was waiting until marriage. 

Since breaking up in 2018, we catch up from time to time, either one of us reaches out to the other or life ends up forcing us together. 
Before my second year I took a construction job at a university in my hometown, a different uni than the one she was enrolled in. It’s a very large campus, and wouldn’t you know it- she was doing summer school at that university and had class in the building that I worked in exclusively- what are the fucking odds. we reconnected that summer, halfway through she had broken up with her ex for the first time and I was her rebound, we hung out a bunch, and she tried to keep things platonic but after we kissed one time it seemed like there was some internal conflict in her- from time to time we would make out intensely and things would be pretty heated, much more passionate than when we were in high school, and then other times she thought it may not be a good idea. Once the summer ended and I left she got back together with him.

After not talking for over a year after that, we reconnected a couple of months ago and it honestly feels as though she has feelings for me- she sends me an excessive amount of heart emojis, told me that I make her feel so cared for and loved, that she’s so lucky to have me in her life and that “every day I show her something new and amazing about you and that I’m an infinitely amazing person.” She’s not with her ex anymore but she still spends lots of time with him at school because they’re in the same program. 

I told her that some feelings came back up about a week ago, and she said she wants to be single right now. Since then she’s been kinda distant with me which is unlike her, but it just makes me think about her more now. I’m helplessly in love with this woman and I feel as though our souls are entwined and that we are meant to be, but it seems as though she doesn’t feel the same. 

Do I sound crazy for still loving this woman?

 How do I let go of that? How do I move on from someone that would be the most ideal person to spend the rest of my life with? 
To this day there is literally nothing wrong between the two of us, when we’re together we are nothing but happy, and we both talk about how we can talk for hours and hours and that we don’t want it to end. She feels like my other half yet this is sorta the only thing we aren’t in sync about... Do I even let her go?

229,"Welp, here I am again. Posting about my crumbling relationship and opinion on my mother. 

Just not to long ago, in a conversation with my Dad, I told him I couldn’t get in contact with my little brother (not related by blood). My mother, the opportunist she is, claims that the reason why is because his parents don’t want him talking to me over the break because he’s needs a break from me and my “interests.” As I mentioned, she believes all my interests are by its nature, bad (a term she still refuses to define).

She continues by stating that if I pay attention to his comments at our worship meetings, he’s studying more and trying to become closer to God. So, logically, you can trace back the genesis of all interests to me. All of his interests, outside of the Bible, are thanks to my bad influence. She even mentioned that if I wasn’t such a bad influence already, why was he mentoring me? First things first, I wasn’t being mentored, I was being taught how to work the audio and visual systems along with the security cameras (my previous job was cleaning, maintenance and repair), secondly, he has been working on the sound system for 2 years now. 

I don’t bother pointing out her flawed reasoning. There’s no point. 

She continues to claim that I’m a bad influence on my friends, they not a good friend, and not a good Christian because I didn’t attend our worship this morning (I have the flu), and something else I’m too mentally exhausted to remember. 

I try talking to my Dad about it, and he’s just says I need to ignore it, that it’s not true, that, I’m an adult, I can’t let small things hurt me. Those “small” things she tells to her coworkers, to family friends, to my friends, whether she knows it or not, she’s ultimately changing the opinion of others about me. As my mother, to them, she’s going to look at me more objectively  when criticizing me in front of others, or something like that. 

Either way, some of my friends been slowly hanging out with me less and less. To the point where one has outright stated that they refuse to hang out with me until I speak to someone in the congregation. 

I can’t do anything about my Mom, but my father is the only person she listens to, how do I get him to see how bad this situation is? I don’t have the circumstances to leave seeing as I’m balancing a shite job with schooling. 

I need some advice.


*what pisses me the fuck off about this so much is how she’s upset at me because I don’t talk to her, but how can I when every chance I try to, you berate me and claim I’m the second coming of the devil himself.",23Dec2019,1
230,"
When I (M20) was in high school I had a best friend (F20). We started talking in grade 9 when I was 14 and she was 15, and within a few weeks we texted all the time. She was the only person I texted consistently, and every night we’d text until we said goodnight fell asleep. This lasted all throughout high school. 

In grade 11 I asked her out 3 times because I knew I loved her- she turned me down each time. In grade 12 she told me she liked me and we started dating. 

I feel as though we’re a perfect match; we never run out of things to say, we laugh all the time, we understand each other, we listen to each other’s problems, especially the ones that we don’t like talking about or what we try and hide from others- we’re ridiculously compatible. We’re so in sync that to this day we still end up saying the same thing or we can pretty much tell what the other is thinking. I always know when something’s up with her. 
We never argue really, but her parents didn’t like the idea of her dating in high school so the relationship was kept secret for a bit, then once it came out it didn’t go well. She still dated me for a while even though her parents didn’t like it and we never really had any issues despite that. 
Before I moved away for uni she dumped me after almost 8 months, she said it was because  my morale had changed and that we were growing differently, but I didn’t really understand what she meant, I felt like I was the same as I had always been. 

Shortly after uni started, she met this guy and they started dating. They broke up a couple times and got back together because her parents once again didn’t approve of who she was dating. She really loves him, I think it’s because she lost her v card to him because we never had sex- at the time we dated she was waiting until marriage. 

Since breaking up in 2018, we catch up from time to time, either one of us reaches out to the other or life ends up forcing us together. 
Before my second year I took a construction job at a university in my hometown, a different uni than the one she was enrolled in. It’s a very large campus, and wouldn’t you know it- she was doing summer school at that university and had class in the building that I worked in exclusively- what are the fucking odds. we reconnected that summer, halfway through she had broken up with her ex for the first time and I was her rebound, we hung out a bunch, and she tried to keep things platonic but after we kissed one time it seemed like there was some internal conflict in her- from time to time we would make out intensely and things would be pretty heated, much more passionate than when we were in high school, and then other times she thought it may not be a good idea. Once the summer ended and I left she got back together with him.

After not talking for over a year after that, we reconnected a couple of months ago and it honestly feels as though she has feelings for me- she sends me an excessive amount of heart emojis, told me that I make her feel so cared for and loved, that she’s so lucky to have me in her life and that “every day I show her something new and amazing about you and that I’m an infinitely amazing person.” She’s not with her ex anymore but she still spends lots of time with him at school because they’re in the same program. 

I told her that some feelings came back up about a week ago, and she said she wants to be single right now. Since then she’s been kinda distant with me which is unlike her, but it just makes me think about her more now. I’m helplessly in love with this woman and I feel as though our souls are entwined and that we are meant to be, but it seems as though she doesn’t feel the same. 

Do I sound crazy for still loving this woman?

 How do I let go of that? How do I move on from someone that would be the most ideal person to spend the rest of my life with? 
To this day there is literally nothing wrong between the two of us, when we’re together we are nothing but happy, and we both talk about how we can talk for hours and hours and that we don’t want it to end. She feels like my other half yet this is sorta the only thing we aren’t in sync about... Do I even let her go?

I live in Southern California- renting a condo. Two days ago, something happened to cause a gas leak (probably due to endless construction around and within our apartment building.

239,"My post was removed from AmITheAsshole, and it's not showing up on SeriousConversation so I'm trying here. Let me preface this by saying that there's a possibility that the other person is a troll and I'm a huge dope for worrying this much about it. But here it is:

So, yesterday I came across an AskReddit post trashing Americans, and OP is saying vitriolic things in the comments. They claim they've been in a America for 10 years, they've lived in rural and urban areas, and all that time they've experienced nothing but unprovoked mistreatment by everybody. I don't believe that, assume they're trolling, post parts of their story to thatHappened. Earlier this evening I looked at their history and saw them doing the same thing in another comment thread trashing Americans and acting like a victim. So I find one of their more recent comments and I leave a nasty response. So then OP dms me and doubles down on their claims. I ask them what Americans have done to them, and they say they can't legally talk about it because of it's severity. I try to find out more avoiding what they supposedly can't talk about, so they say ""General mistreatment, unprovoke verbal and physical abuse, and attempted theft of property,"" but I can't get any more information than that. One thing they freely tell me is there that they're in the US and they were raised by a non-American family. Previously they'd said they had American family members, which I think is has to do with what they say they're not legally allowed to talk about, which if what I think it is, then they reiterate that it's dark. And I would understand their anger a little better. So I try to ask then more questions, avoiding that certain thing, but they just say ""You don't deserve to know this much about me, fuck off."" As it stands I've told them that if what they say is true, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, and I'm willing to listen and talk with them, and I deleted my post and comment as a sign of goodwill. But I don't know if they saw that because I said those things after they dismissed me. If what they say is true, I would like to offer what little consolation I can, but the claim that they've experienced nothing but unprovoked hate for a decade straight is frankly too outrageous for me to believe, when you pair that with the vague things they told me and to elaborate on them, I don't know what to think. I don't know ow this sub's stance on intra-reddit drama, but the I'm concerned id because if it's all true, then they might do something drastic, and I would hate to have sent someone over the edge.

Is there even any advice that can be given here? How am I supposed to feel?",23Dec2019,1

I told him no, but never felt safe enough to use our old ""safe word"" which I know could have stopped him.

Two years ago I was obsessed with gardening and growing my own crops and herbs and after a year or so of doing it I got my own computer and did a ton of gaming for months (Began this year) then late November I got into doing Photoshop and Lightroom and learned a lot and did a ton of that.

245,"I (29m) have been working a blue collar job for the past 8 years and I've grown tired of it. While the pay is ""decent"" enough to cover living and a bit more, I can't help but to feel as though I cheated myself for not going to college. I avoided college to not rack up debt via student loans but my blue collar job has allowed me to accumulate debt in the form of auto loans and a mortgage. I'm tired of busting my ass and hurting myself for a job that doesn't give a damn about me unless I'm apart of their good ol boy club. I dislike how I have to hide being myself for the sake of not being the butt of everyone's jokes and to not give them any more reason to dislike me. I'm tired of the locker room talk, the sometimes blatant sexism, racism, etc and not being able to change it without marking myself for removal.

It's honestly not the work that bothers me, but rather the people. Any talk about self improvement is mocked unless it's for the organization and the higher-ups turn against anyone who decides they want to pursue something outside of it. I enjoy forming new relations and pursuing ways to better myself for myself and my interests but the vast majority of my coworkers are content with the work 9-5, eat, procreate, sleep, repeat mentality. I've tried aligning my interests with the company's and besides a couple promotions, it has brought very little in terms of work satisfaction and opportunity to grow. 

What gets me the most is when I visit my friends who work white collar jobs and they're paid just as much if not more to do considerably less work and have less responsibilities.

247,"I'm not sure how to shine the light on this situation but here is the honest truth that I'm dealing with. I have an older sister who divorced her husband for her own reasons. She was not true to him and over their 10+ years of marriage, she had been unfaithful to him multiple times with different men. Now I don't agree with what she did those were her choices and she is still my sister. I don't think they should haunt her forever or cast a shadow on her in her future. 

Now the problem I'm facing is this. She is in a serious relationship now with a man who has also gone through a divorce. He has a lot of young children and seems like a very nice man. My sister seems to of changed for the better for him but their relationship is still fairly young. She hasn't moved in with him yet but it's in the making as her pets now live at his house. This all seems quick but they seem happy. I say seem since he doesn't know everything in her past. This would not be a problem ONLY if he had made it very clear that he does not condone cheating in the slightest. 

I did not realize how serious he was about this until I found out that he wanted her to end a close childhood friendship she's had due to her friend cheating on her husband. I was shocked. How could he ask her such a thing when she herself had done the same thing? I was again surprised when I found out she had, to him, said they were no longer friends. I believe he doesn't know about her own past with being unfaithful. 

I feel like in this case, he should know. He has made his opinion about the subject clear and while I'm not sure it will end their relationship it will cause tension. I don't want my sister's happiness to end because of her past choices but I don't think she can start a life and marriage with this man without being honest with him. Should I keep my mouth shut and let it ride out or speak up and let the truth be heard? I feel like no matter what it won't end pretty but there is more on the line than romance.

258,"So this really attractive girl who works at my gym came in as I was leaving, I've chatted to her a few times and I'm just trying to shoot my shot when the time is right. I pretty much bombed the entire conversation today.

Me: ""Hey, how's ya Christmas goin""
Her: ""Yah not really Christmas yet""
Me: ""Ah yeah""
Her: *stuff about how tomorrow is only a half day etc*
Me: ""Ah cool, anyways I'll see ya. Hey btw is that your bike outside?"" (There was a Honda outside)
Her: ""Oh no i think that's next doors""
Me: (Me immediately realising she didn't walk in with a helmet so ti's obviously not hers) ""ah ok, well I'll see you later""

Thing is, I know she likes bikes (I ride a really nice one to and from gym, she wants to start riding too) and there's definitely potential there for me not to be a total spastic. I do lots of interesting stuff like exploring waterways near the coast finding hidden beaches, cooking really yum food and riding supermoto but I'm socially retarded hence why I spend most of my time doing things alone.

Normally I workout late afternoons and she's working morning shift tomorrow which she told me about, should I purposefully go early to try redeeming my bad conversation? I know I can not be retarded I just need to forcefully get in the right headspace.",23Dec2019,1
259,"Maybe I'm just crazy. I don't know lmao. Maybe it's just a difference in cluture or something and it's normal but I just need an outside opinion because I'm not sure how I'm supposed to react to it.

When I was 15, she had no issue with a 20 year old ""liking"" me or something. (In my church a lot of guys will be like eyeing girls that they want to marry)

I'm 16 now, she said some other 23 year old was eyeing me(apparently she's talked to his mom and his mom told him something about his attraction??) And she says it had been a while since she talked to the mom so she wasn't sure if the attraction was still there or not. Buuut she's been noticing him(and his mom) kind of going out of their way to be nearer to me and my mom says she's noticed him looking at me??

There are a lot more guys that she claims like me but who knows, but these are the only two adults that she's has basically ""confirmed"".

I'm from the US, and in my state the age of consent is 18, so definitely still underage, but I just don't knowww. The whole prospect of it seems creepy as hell, but I don't know who any of these men are because my mom won't tell me(ig bc she doesn't want me ""showing off"" in a way in front of them?) And since none of them have talked to me, there's nothing inherently wrong with it.

Still, I need someone to tell me if this is okay or not? Idk please just give me insight.

My mom also saw no issue with this one couple that met when the girl was 16, and the guy was 26, since they got married when she turned 18 and it was all consensual(Onision vibesss). So that should kind of set the stage for what she seems acceptable.

Obviously she's not going to force me to marry anyone that I don't want to, but I just need to know if her judgement is to be questioned or not.

And sorry if I just blew this out of proportion and this is normal, I just wasn't sure!",23Dec2019,1
260,"26F, I made this account so I could post the more embarrassing posts on this one instead of my main.

Basically, I need advice on how to let a potential partner know your body is ugly and how soon? I've never been in a relationship because I am unsure how someone would react after I remove my clothes. I have very saggy large breasts with nipples that literally point towards the floor. I'm pretty sure that no guy would ever find that acceptable and neither would any woman either because they would have normal breasts. And understandably expect normal breasts. I also have very fat armpits, most likely from some breast tissue moving into them (a doctors guess). I also have two large scars on my side that look absolutely terrible, from a surgery that I had when I was very young. 

So far, I've gone on two dates in my entire life (with the same person) and when he expressed interest in continuing, I decided to end it because I really don't want to have an angry reaction when I take off my clothes due to them feeling deceived. 

Do you guys think I should try to pursue an asexual relationship or anything where the other person doesn't want sex? Is there anything I can do at all? I really don't want to be alone for my entire life but I also understand why no one would be interested in me. Please don't suggest breast surgery because I genuinely cannot afford it even with insurance. 

TLDR: How soon should you tell a dating interest that your body looks like trash?  Should I mention it at all? What should I do if I take off my clothes and they become angry?",23Dec2019,1

267,"So I have been family-less for the last decade. Even when I did ""have family"" I was a ""Harry Potter"" kid. Meaning for a lack of adding an essay in here, they just weren't parents. So I haven't received a birthday or holiday celebration since maybe my pre-teens. I've also stayed single since the tenth grade.

Essentially I haven't had a reason to celebrate for close to two thirds of my life. Most of the time this is no big deal. Then Christmas rears his head. 

Two things I'd love advice on:

1. How do I tell people I have no plans for Christmas without bringing a depressive cloud out when they ask why?

I just started to develop friendships that feel more family than my birthers and they have started inviting me to Christmas. 

2.How do I convey to these friends that I don't want to be there becauas it poses no significant meaning to me and I don't want to bring that feeling to their celebrations?

I tried to explain it as it's not Christmas to me....it's just Wednesday. 

I know they mean well and I really appreciate the invitations but it just isn't my thing.

It's probably significant to add I was diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome late in life.
I've developed pretty good mimic skills for social situations but still don't experience any ""emotional"" movement for this whole holiday thing.

281,"Obligatory on mobile what not.

Background: I'm a 16yo female in high school. I'm in choir, color guard, and dance as of next semester. I'm hella gay and i've had problems in the past of heart break and family members/friends hurting me when I've opened my heart to them. This causes me to not know when love is alright for me to go with and to have a weird sense of fashion, love, and a high set if standards for liking someone.

Ok now on to the teenage complaints.

So despite what I said before I have been lowering my standards so that way I can actually have a chance instead of making up excuses for my self to not like someone. Well when I started school this year I walked into my choir class and saw this girl. At the time she had short brown hair, but now it's black. She has brown eyes, pale skin, weird personality, is kind of popular from what I can tell, and is tall. (For reference I'm 5'5 and she's like a foot taller than me at least.) 

I took one look at her and thought that she was really pretty, but, as I normally do, I turned away from the thought process and focused on choir. Both of us ended up being on the leadership team this year (her some form of president and me a section leader), both of us are Soprano 2's, and we're right next to each other. 

I know virtually nothing about her except that she's Bisexual, a leader, popular I think, has trouble breathing, and likes to talk to her other Sop 2 friends that stand behind her.

I like the sound of her voice, both when she sings and when she talks, and I like her sense of fashion. Even if it mostly contains hoodies, tights, and Nikes. 

Whenever she talks to me my face gets red and my heart speeds up. I feel nervous talking to her, but that always happens when I'm talking to people of higher authority. I think she's really pretty and super interesting from what I can tell, but maybe I just want to be friends. I mean I know she won't like me, but still. 

I'm a major loser who has never been invited to a party, but most people know about me? (Idk either.) My fashion isn't the greatest, I have some mild to major depression and anxiety, different friends from all over, like to keep myself busy, and am super close with my family. 

I think I like her? Idk. Maybe not. Maybe it's like a people phase. Where you think you like them but it shortly thereafter goes away. She seems Interesting and pretty, but idk. I know she won't like me like that. I've given up hope of anybody liking me back, but I just want to identify these feeling so I know how to handle them. Maybe I just think she's hot.

282,"Ever since college my sister has had a classically rocky relationship with my parents over what she wants to do with her life. She wants to fulfill her artistic dreams while parents want her to earn money. She does have a history of career choices bad enough that my parents have to pay her rent.

Today she told them she'd come home for christmas, but immediately after my parents drove four hours to pick her up, she told them she didn't want to go back and had a serious breakdown over it.

The short story of why is that there are issues on her end too. She has displayed behaviors seen in abusive and manipulative people. Parents want to get her mental health treatment, but she has been displaying this behavior for years despite seeing several doctors and psychologists for years. In particular they suspect she's not telling them the instances where she was abusive and manipulative.

283,"Okay here is the basic info you need - There is me(25F) and my brother James (11), plus our Bull Mastiff, Zeus(3M) for this story. We all live under the same roof and have had our dog since he was a puppy. We got him for my brother but you know how kids can get, he doesn’t want anything to do with him now that he is getting older, so I am the one to take care of Zeus. He has been professionally trained and up until this point we have never had any type of aggression from him. He’s really a gentle giant, I take him on walks everyday and he loves all the people and other dogs. 

I have had to deal with several dogs with LDS(little dog syndrome) coming up and attack Zeus and he will just roll over until they are done. Never so much as growls unless something is coming at his family aggressively and the occasional bark at the mailman or balloon approaching his territory. I can take raw meat out of his mouth when he is eating and he will keep his mouth open so I can do so. Like, I make sure that this dog is the best boy he can be; I know with his breed and size he would automatically be the one blamed in any scenario where he bites someone. Up until this point he had been very good with my brother, always right by James side and would get between anyone messing with him. 

James and I play fight pretty much everyday, this has always been something we have always done. It can get rough, but we always stop if the other one gets hurt. Zeus usually watches from the sidelines, sometimes he would come between us, nipping at our arms, to get us to stop when he thought we were getting too rough. The past couple of months, though, Zeus has started going at James more frequently and more aggressively than before. Growling at him a little harsher than normal when we are messing around. Never biting or showing teeth at James and only when we are wrestling around, but I know things can escalate quickly so I would like to weed this out early. 

I am probably making this into a bigger deal than it is, but I would rather be safe than sorry. 
I will be taking him to the vet after the holidays, but I figured reddit might want to get their two cents in beforehand. I do not want to get rid of my dog but I will, painfully, if I can’t figure out a solution. Please only helpful advice, no dog or breed bashing. 

TL;DR my dog has been getting aggressive towards little bro when we are wrestling around, not sure what caused it or how to fix it.",23Dec2019,1
284,"I got informed by my dissertation advisor that the faculty won't write me recommendation letters for the job market and that I'm in all likelihood not going to be able to actually get my PhD. It's not entirely a surprise; I fully believe I went to the wrong school, there are lots of issues that are probably best left for a different discussion. Suffice it to say that I do blame myself for part of it, I also feel very let down by the faculty who were supposed to help guide me to success and by the institution I'm at as a whole. My school doesn't even do a master's in this field if you leave early, so I just get to leave ABD and that's all I have to show for the last 5 years of my life.

How can I find purpose? This has been *the plan*, that I go through and get this degree and an academic career, and now that's over. I feel like whatever I do, I'll be behind, given that most of my peers have had time to start building their careers and to build something of significance out of their lives. Coming out of high school and even my undergrad, I had so much *potential* that's just going to waste.

How do I let go of the bitterness towards an institution that I feel is partially responsible for what definitely seems like the crash and burn of my life? I spent my 20s sacrificing a lot to get to what's revealed to be a dead end. I'm having a lot of trouble viewing this as a life not already wasted; anything worth doing I should have started on the path 10 years ago; I spent my best years full of anxiety trying to figure out what expectation I was supposed to be meeting and descending into a deep depression as things got more and more difficult; I put on a bunch of weight and I feel like I've aged 20 years in the last 5. At the depths of it, I've seriously considered suicide. That's not really what this post is about, but it's been a very deep pit (yes, I have gone to a counselor)


How do I deal with the constant anxiety? I wake up and just feel my heart trying to beat its way out of my chest; I hear the blood rushing in my ears. I'm consistently on edge; I've always been a pretty calm person but lately the smallest things seem to push me past what I can handle and I just break down.

As I consider what I'm going to do next, it just all feels kind of pointless. Whatever life I manage to make is going to be worse than the life I could have had. It's doubly worse as I'm watching other students from my program go on to get the kinds of jobs I was thinking I'd be getting about now.

TL;DR: Failed a PhD, I feel like I sacrificed the best part of life for nothing, now I'm wondering what the point of any of it even is. How do I let go of the absolute stink of failure at the final stage, the bitterness and anger at those who I trusted to help get me to the end goal, the constant companion that is anxiety, and the feeling that I've already lost the chance to meet the full potential of life?

288,"19 M. 

I'm fairly new to this place and this college I'm in because I had to migrate for some not-related-to-this-situation reasons. There's this small group of my classmates who live near my house; they're pretty... decent, but for whatever reason, all of them are heavy smokers and they almost always need to take a puff after college before heading home. 

On my first day, they offered me a joint and I replied “I don't smoke,” and then I just sat there awkwardly staring at my phone until they were finally done and we returned back together. The next day, though, they didn't invite me or anything and just kinda ignored me. I felt bad cause I have literally no one to talk to in this place. I've made some other friends in my class who sadly don't live anywhere nearby. 

So the other day, I met a guy from *that* group at Target. He said there will be a small party to celebrate one of the dude's birthday and jokingly said that I “probably won't like it, though.” I said “That's OK, it was awkward enough the first time,” and he suggested that I “should probably try to fit in and start smoking” and stuff. I just shrugged and said I'm not really sure about that.

Basically, if I started smoking, I would:

* have friends in-and-off college.
* not have to walk the way to my home alone.
* have people to hang out with in this new place.
* ... “fit it.”

290,"Hey reddit, 
I’ve been dealing with chronic depression pretty much all my life but it’s gotten worse over the years. 
I come from a very religious family and they don’t necessarily believe in mental illness, they believe anything can be healed with religion and that my misery comes from lack of practice and me straying away from god. 

I’ve had multiple occasions when I was young where I broke down in front of them because they assumed I’m possessed in some way, I didn’t know what was wrong with me at the time until I got older and realized what the symptoms of depression were and actually got diagnosed. 

But it still didn’t help with my situation. 


I’ve opened up about my depression and why I’m depressed to my family before but they often dismissed it. I don’t exactly know when these rituals began but I remember them discussing this with me at a young age, how this religious figure said I’m surrounded by evil spirits, something only a kid would believe and that terrified me but I knew it was complete bs. 

I’m now an adult and it’s still happening, I hit a really low point in my life because of depression and so this started again, my mom contacted this woman who claims she could help me and she had my mom pay up more than 200k. My dad is already in debt and it’s disgusting how far they’re willing to go to believe it’s not depression. 

I don’t know what to do, I already broke down so many times trying to explain this to them and trying to get them to stop, sometimes taking my own life seems like the only option. I can’t really leave the house because of traditions and what not.",23Dec2019,1

295,"I have hesitation even writing this because I have such a strong desire not to badmouth my parents - for reference, my parents are divorced and since my dad remarried, it's just been easier in conversation to reference them and ""my parents"" and my mom separately. My mom and I are very alike and I have a habit of dissociating her from the idea of ""my parents"" because I am very different from my dad and my stepmom.

My dad and my stepmom are good people - I know that. They're good to my stepsisters and they have lots of friends and they care about being kind. However they have extremely traditional views and when I, at 11, discovered that my life would not be satisfied until I acheived success as a performer, they routinely and regularly discouraged me from pursuing it as a career. I don't have super lofty goals - I don't need to be famous, but I ""need"" to be in a show to be happy. For example, I went to the International Thespian conference between my sophomore and junior years, and I spent three of the five days I was there talking to colleges about their programs and seeing what they were all like. I came home with a stack of brochures 4 1/2 inches thick and my dad said (without looking at or even considering anything else) ""you're not going to any of those schools - you're going to \[local college\]."" I hated their program and had such a strong desire to go ANYWHERE else (presumptuous, but who isn't at 16?) and I temporarily gave up on my dream, thinking if I had no support there was no way I could make it come true.

They don't like anything emotionally inconvenient or that is outside the norm, so when I was 12 and going through my first year of menstruation, I had the WORST cramps. Like every few months they would just debilitate me and I had never dealt with that level of pain. I was supposed to clean my room on Saturdays and one month where the pain was just too much (AT 12 YEARS OLD) I laid down in my bed and was physically incapable of doing anything else, and my stepmom came in and asked my why I didn't do what I was supposed to. I told her that I had cramps and she laughed at me. Then at dinner she brought it up to a family friend that was staying with us for a vacation -- ""Oh, tell her why you couldn't do your chores today!"" And I told her (and everyone else at the table) ""I had really bad cramps"" they LAUGHED in my face. I know this is something that happened a long time ago and I should just let it go, but (not to be dramatic) it scarred me for life and taught me that no mater how bad my pain is, it is irrelevant to my duties and I'd better suck it up and get things done. It has stuck with me until this day, and every time I have debilitating cramps (fewer and far between since I gave birth to my six-year-old) I hear the laughter and mocking echo through my head.

I did a professional show two years ago and I begged them to come see it but they never did. It was a disaster of a show behind the scenes - run into the ground by incompetent producers. But it was my first real gig, aside from the male lead, I was the FEMALE LEAD, and I felt like my dream had come true, and it felt like no big deal to them.

Their support has wavered depending on how much of a potential financial burden I would be; sometimes they tell me they don't understand how I do what I do onstage because they couldn't do it themselves, but that's the biggest compliment or praise I have ever received from my (now almost two decades) of dedicating myself to my craft. But apart from that, my voice has been a nuisance and my rehearsal a burden.

They always kept a roof over my head and food in my belly but I felt fundamentally rejected because performing was all I ever cared about, and I was 10000% willing to put in the work and put in the time to become as skilled and consistent as possible, and I have. That 10,000 hours rule for mastery I have achieved at least twofold. I am not afraid of hard work and I am AWARE of how difficult the industry is to get into. But they treated it like a hobby, and they have been desperate for me to give it up since it started. It has always been a burden.

I never knew what was going to be acceptable; I got made fun of for misunderstanding things or not doing things right in practices that they NEVER taught me to navigate (money management, personal presentation, relationships and friendships) and things were okay one week and annoying and unacceptable the next. I have always been a highly emotional person (which has manifested in a lot of anxiety) and any conversation that had the potential of eliciting a negative emotional response, or anything emotionally charged, in my was either avoided or fought against. They would tell me things and then claim they would never say anything like that, and I just felt like a total crazy person.

I have a younger sister and two older stepsisters; the older stepsisters married men that were willing to let them do what they wanted, and they wanted to be housewives and that was the deal. They have beautiful families and they are visited a few times a year by my dad and my stepmom. I married at 22 to a man who told me I could have my career (he wanted to be a lawyer and I just fantasized us as a power couple that would dominate the entertainment and law industries) as long as I started a family, but once that family was started he was 100% unwilling to allow me to do anything that wasn't involved with the family. We have since split and are good friends (we are GREAT coparents and we have achieved a level of friendship and camaraderie that I have yet to observe in other ex-couples) but now I'm a single mom trying to balance the career I refuse to let go of and the menial jobs that I have to take in order to make that happen. I'm not GOOD or SKILLED at anything else, and (I know this is pretentious, I'm sorry) but I know I have the talent, skill, and determination to at least have some presence in performance, and potential to entertain people and enrich their lives - it's my life's purpose.

Life, however has not been kind to me this year -- I lost an office job (that I hated anyway) that put me in a position to lose my apartment and collaborate with my daughter's father (I have a six year old) about custody (I see her every day and we spend quality time together) to have a stable living situation with her so I could get it together. However, the job market where I am is very competitive and I haven't found anything - people look at my resume and for whatever reason don't call me in for an interview. I have been looking for a job for months now and have only had a few mild bites. I'm persevering - I'm almost to the point where I'm able to accept literally anything for work.

I asked my dad for financial help today (I really don't need much...but I was involved in a hit and run that was 100000% not my fault the lost me my car which was my temporary home) and previously they had told me to ""let them know if I needed any help"", which I don't know how to respond to because at this point I've lost almost everything, so literally anything will help. The car accident was bad, and they never once texted or called to make sure that I was okay - the one night I spent at their house was them berating me for not having a job already (I had been delivering for Postmates in the interim between meetings applying feverishly for a job in a dispensary so losing my car was losing my job). But he ignored me... he read the text ten hours ago and no response. 

I had expressed last week that I was uncomfortable joining our family Christmas gathering because I wouldn't be able to give anyone gifts of any significance (this is very important for my family) and they assured me I didn't have to spend any money... but the lifetime tradition I have had of spending Christmas Eve with them is apparently cancelled this year anyway, but they are planning a dinner...with just the ""adults""... my dad named him and his two brothers, which I assume includes they partners, exclusively for Christmas dinner. I had to wonder..was I just disinvited? They told me that my sister and I would be receiving stockings and they didn't want us to spend any money. But... they don't even want me there for the one Christmas tradition we've had since I was a child? Am I really that embarrassing and that much of a burden to them that I'm not even invited to Christmas?

Sorry this is so long... my parents are wonderful and they are extremely supportive of my siblings, but I feel like my determination to make my way in the industry of my choosing, combined with my failed marriage and deviation from what is socially acceptable and financially stable has fundamentally ruined my relationship with them has put me in the ""black sheep"" position. Everyone in my family is more successful than me, and I don't know how to be of value to them except to make enough money that they don't have to worry that I might ask for help.

I tried my hardest this year... and it's still not good enough. How do I either 1. reconcile our differences and continue to try to have a relationship with them where we are at least cordial and they see me as an adult rather than a dumb teenager; or 2. Just give up and accept that they'll never see the value in the things I care about, and dissociate from wanting their approval and stop depending on the idea that if I just do well enough, at some point they will be proud of me?? I am absolutely their f\*\*\*-up child, and I have an incredible amount of guilt because of it. And now I have been disinvited from the Christmas celebration with the rest of my family. I care to a fault what people think of me, and I don't know what would be better: to let the idea that I will ever impress them go as a possibility, or keep trying to achieve their approval by proving that I am as good as it takes to get paid to do what I do. I want to be able to see my own value, but a childhood full of uncertainty of whether I am acceptable as a person has greatly impeded my progress; I feel unworthy of even going for what I want because I feel like I don't deserve to be happy...I don't want to blame my parents for my mental illness and anxiety, but I don't know where else it came from.

Thank you to anyone who really bothers to read this whole long thing... I'm sure plenty of people have the same problem I do, but I live and form opinions about what's wrong with me in a vacuum most of the time because I'm not sure whether my pain is valid or I'm overreacting to my parents. Would it be better for me to just stop caring and accept that I'll never be what they want me to be and find success because it matters to me more than anything?

tl;dr - my dad and my stepmom have rejected my career choice, and therefore (it felt) me as a person for most of my life, but they're wonderfully good to everyone else and I can't decide whether to continue to strive for their approval or just give the f\*\*\* up.",23Dec2019,1
296,"So I am constantly happy, lately I have been getting a small bit neutral but it’s okay I hadn’t cried in a while and I finally did the other day and I feel brand new.

I work in a retail environment where I move from different locations. On a work day it’s usually me and 1 or 2 other people. And in the work area there’s about 15-20 people. I like ALL of these people. There’s some I have more in common that others but for the most part I smile all day and get the job done and usually leave happy but maybe tired.

I worked a lot of days in a row. Just luck of the draw. I worked a weekend and then the first few weekdays so they were all pulled up together. They days were long draining and busy. 2 of the days I worked with this new guy who came from a similar company with 6 months exp. he seemed okay at first. Everyone kept saying he was lovely so I thought when he wasn’t chatty and also kind of rude on the first day that he was just tired.

I was incorrect. Maybe he was tired that day. But in reality he is just a truly horrid horrible person. He’s rude and condescending. He thinks he knows his job better than me, which is fine, maybe he does but if he’s going to call me out on stuff he could do it nicely like the way every other staff member seems to. He left me to close the shop on my own less than 3 minutes after a very angry customer yelled at me for 20 minutes. While also leaving me to close on my own he left me to do all of my work and his work because he couldn’t bare to leave work 3 minutes late. When he left me alone I finally cried. Which was actually really good.

Anyway, this problem can be sorted. If I ring my manager and ask her to not put me on with him ever it won’t be a problem. But before bed and throughout the day I can’t stop thinking about how horrible he is. I hate bitching but I want the whole world to know he is a dirty rotten pig and any other horrible names I can come up with. And as much as I want to expose him for how horrible he is, I don’t like this new light on my own personal character. I don’t think malicious thoughts like these. I don’t want to think thoughts like these. I live in a fantasy world where everyone is nice and perfect and I see the best in people. I don’t mind not seeing the best in him, maybe even just having no opinion. But I can’t stop thinking horrible thoughts. I told my brother that night that i wished the guy got hit by a bus on the way home. 

Besides this I’m still really happy and wearing my best smile. It’s just when I hear his name which is deadass the most common name ever. And when I think of that night he made me cry. It’s only been a few days but how can I stop my mind thinking like this",23Dec2019,1

301,"(Sorry for reposting, I didn't know how this subreddit works)

Bit of a context: I am an 18 year old college student. I get monthly expenses from my mom, which was plenty for me ALONE. My boyfriend is currently staying with me at my apartment (just the two of us), and he had stayed with me for around 2 months (since we started dating). He works as a freelance, and only goes to work when his college schedule and work schedule don't clash with each other. He's nearly graduated, that means he's really busy with college, thus can't go to work as much as he used to. He's paid based on how many sessions of work he does. That means he hasn't gained that much money lately. One of the reasons why he moved in with me was because I provided psychological safety. He has some kind of psychological illness, and being alone makes said illness worse and can result in him harming himself.

I love my boyfriend. He's the absolute best I can ever ask for. He's cute, smart, funny, multi-talented, all in all an amazing person. I love him with my entire heart. The thing is, he and his family aren't as financially stable as me; he doesn't even have any money left in his bank account. I knew about this financial problem of his from the start, but I didn't realise it was this bad. I wasn't prepared for it. My monthly spending has doubled ever since we started living together because I'm usually the one who pays for food, gas, and other stuffs. I can't even save any money because of it. I used to be able to buy stuffs I wanted, but now I can't. Money feels really tight for me, I don't want to ask for more money from my mom because she too has some kind of problem financially, and it has stressed me out lately. I don't want to blame any of this on him because he too feels guilty for having to depend on me financially.

I need some help with keeping my carpet from being peed on so often. I’m afraid of it building up and my apartment smelling like urine. I clean and scrub each accident but I still am worried that’s not good enough. What I’ve done to help out my old man is take him out more often which is very helpful but somehow I still manage to miss the timing, and he lets loose. I will literally be getting ready to take both the dogs out and he goes pee so I’ve been trying to catch our potty times earlier. It doesn’t help that he’s a little dehydrated and I’ve been giving him some extra water when he needs it, but I always make sure to be extra on top of that shit if I’m doing that. I’ve thought about getting rugs and lining the underside somehow so the pee doesn’t soak through to the carpet. I’m not sure about diapers...I’ve also thought about that turf thing that mimics grass and you can have it indoor,  but I don’t think he would take to that.

311,"I’m 21 (F) and live with my older brother (25). I recently moved in with him because I’m in college and I needed somewhere to stay. 

We’ve always gotten into regular sibling fights, but now, it’s gotten to a whole different level. He acts EXTREMELY immature when we get into these fights, which drives me into a manic rage. 

For example(today): i deal with migraines, and I was watching tv with the volume low with captions and all the lights off in our living room. He walks into the room, and starts making fun of what I was watching (he hates Jeffree star so he was making fun of him). He starts yelling over the tv, and I asked him 3 separate times to be quiet because I have a really bad migraine and loud noises make it worse. He continues to YELL over the tv, and I yell at him to shut up. I was done asking nicely at that point, and he loudly whispers “I thought loud noises make your head hurt”. 
Actions similar to this, just him being a smart ass in general ON PURPOSE to annoy me or when he fuels the fire, brings me into a psychotic &amp; violent rage of anger. 

I get EXTREMELY violent, pulling scissors out on him, threatening to cut him, throwing household items to get him to shut up, and screaming at the top of my lungs. I usually say things I don’t really mean (as all angry people do). I always scream this phrase, “I ASKED YOU POLITELY TO STOP MULTIPLE TIMES, WHY CANT YOU LISTEN TO ME?” I say this because I feel as though that he cannot hear me or is just ignoring the fact that I want him to stop doing whatever he’s doing because it’s bothering me. 

He usually follows up with “oh you’ll be SO HAPPY when I’m dead, right? You HATE ME.” 

and I respond with “no, I don’t hate you, you’re just being annoying right now”. 

I get so violent sometimes that it hurts to admit to myself how bad I can get. I regret getting so mad every time, but I seriously can’t help but just have a goddamn temper tantrum. I’m self aware of these actions, and it’s literally an “abusive relationship” between my brother and I, but these fights are rare, maybe once a month at most. 

I’m afraid that my neighbors will see/hear our fights and call the cops (that’s how bad it gets). I want to control my anger but I cannot explain in words how freaking immature my older brother gets. He starts it every time when I’m just minding my own business. 

I’m his younger sister- I get it, he likes to annoy me for fun, but it always turns into me threatening to hurt him or actually punching/hitting/ or throwing things at him. 

How do I prevent this? I tried ignoring him, (doesn’t work), moving to a different room (he just follows me), and physically leaving the house (but then he just calls our mom, who doesn’t live with us, to bring her into the middle of the situation over text/phone calls to both of us)",23Dec2019,1

314,"I have painful social anxiety, I’ve always had it but since I’ve started online school and removed myself from an abusive friendship; it’s gotten progressively worse. It’s at the point where, if you compliment me, I will stress over my response so much that there’s an 80% chance I will start crying. 

For some more perspective; during the point in my life when I had the best handle on it, I once accidentally ordered a whole pizza because I panicked. Now I can’t even order a pizza or carry a pizza because I don’t like phone calls and I freak myself out over worrying that people will think the whole pizza is for me and that’s weird. Yes, I know no one will think that and even if they did, whatever but that doesn’t change my irrational anxiety.

I also found that I struggle to even write anything positive about myself because I fret over if people will think I’m shallow or bragging. Doesn’t sound that bad but it makes writing resumes and college applications literal hell because “I’m ok but I could be way way better” isn’t really what they’re looking for. I don’t like accepting compliments either for the same reasoning but then I get trapped in the loop of “if I accept the compliment I sound cocky but if I deny it I sound like I’m fishing for more”. 

I’m not good at adapting to sudden changes so any changes I make to work on my social anxiety will have to be baby steps. I don’t even know where to start though, I’m trying to make new friends but it’s really hard when I spend 2 years trying to decide how to respond and another 3 years crying because I regret what I chose to say.

317,"So my family does a lead up of presenting gifts to each other before the holidays. Tonight, my very dear mother gave me a plaque with this MLK quote “We are not makers of history. We are made by history”. I do not entirely agree with this idea, and the plaque leaves out some very important context in which King encourages us to make history, rather than be shaped by it. The original quote was an admonishment. 

My mother was very excited about it, and make no mistake, I thanked her profusely. I am currently training to become a teacher, and she suggested I hang it up in my future classroom for the students to “follow”.  As stated above, the plaque conveys an idea that goes against one of my deepest beliefs. Should I leave the plaque unhung, or should I put it up despite the message it conveys? Please, any advice is good advice. 

And before I get jumped on, I love my mother to death and would do anything to see a smile on her face. I’m not raising this question to sound like an ungrateful sop, but simply because I am a little confused.",23Dec2019,1
318,"So, as many people do, I was recently trolling EBay looking for things I’d like to own but couldn’t afford. One such thing being an Apple Watch. My family’s not well off and I can’t afford one with college tuition money due soon. 

So I’m looking around at them, and just for kicks, I bid on one. $100.00 is my max bid. I’m like okay, it’s brand new, no way would I win this so whatever, y’know? Except I did. 

I won an Apple Watch series four for $100.00 +5.95 shipping. 

I get to looking closer, and the damn thing is advertised as locked. I can’t contest the purchase, and now I’m stuck getting a locked $100.00 watch on my next payday. 

Is there any way to factory-reset a watch like this so it can be used normally with an iPhone?

322,"So, my fiancee and I moved in with a friend of ours who's quickly becoming less and less of a friend. Recently, she met a guy through a hookup app - the guy is homeless, jobless, not paying rent, smells like weed constantly, and thinks my fiancee can ""fix"" her schizophrenia through pagan spells and witchcraft. Now, my fiancee is into witchcraft, but she knows her therapy and medication are the way to go with her mental state. 

Anyway, this guy got our roommate smoking weed. CONSTANTLY. The house constantly smells of weed, and my fiancee has had several nights where she's hurt herself, gone into psychotic episodes, and hallucinated much more vividly than usual. The roommate won't listen, and her boyfriend said that my fiancee's psychotic episodes were ""her choice"" to endure ( what??? ). 

My fiancees doctor has said she can't be around weed. 

Alongside that, my asthma has gotten twice as bad, and I've had bronchitis for the past few weeks. I've never had these issues this badly until this all started. 

We own two cats and a bird. We've mentioned it to the roommate that weed can kill our bird very easily, but she won't listen to us. 

She told us we can go live with my family again, to which I told her no, we can't, because I've all but been disowned due to being trans.

At this point, this has devolved into several screaming matches where she holds the ""I was going to kill myself before I started smoking"" over our heads, to which I've told her that she's causing the same thoughts in my fiancee's head, and causing her to literally self harm. I've come home more than once to my fiancee with her cheeks scratched raw or her slamming her head against the wall to ""make it stop"".

330,"Hi Reddit,

Recently I did something pretty idiotic. I know I fucked up. I just need advice on how to move forward. 

I quit my last job as an office admin due to my grandfather having a stroke and me being the one with the most flexible schedule and 19 I had to quit and take care of him until my parents found out a way to work a schedule around his care. He lives with my grandma further in the country so i have to drive out there to help out. I did leave on good terms with the store manager and location manager who both offered to be references for me. 

My grandpa is doing a lot better now so I recently started reapplying to different jobs and got an interview at a law firm. I honestly didn’t think I did that well in the interview. I was late, and I think some of my answers could have been better. This is the part where I messed up. 

I was kind of embarrassed that I had quit after only 4 months at my previous job. I know it looked bad, and I thought that they wouldn’t like the reason why I quit. When they asked me why I left my old job, I told them that it was a contract position and that it was only for 4 months. 

Anyway, I was really surprised when they told me they’d like to move forward in the process and asked for my references. I am afraid to give them my old boss’ numbers because they might ask them why I left and hear a whole different story. I could possible burn both bridges.

The fact I never been in a “real” relationship had never bothered, I’m in college and a great majority of my friends have (or had at some point in the past) developed meaningful relationships with the people that they like and I am very happy for them. Things started to change when this one friend I was very close with from ages 13-18 got her first boyfriend and a lot of things changed. We are not that close since we go to different colleges, but during break I was kinda looking forward to having some quality time together for old times sake. That didn’t happen and I was like alright, people get busy it’s fine. She wanted all our friend group to meet her bf in Christmas party, and all of a sudden she was acting so different. I know people tend to act differently around their SO specially in the beginning of the relationship, but I remember when we used to be close, and both of us promised each other we wouldn’t be those couples that can’t do things unless their SO is with them, or that stops talking to friends because of a boy. And alas, that is exactly what she has been doing and I feel kinda betrayed not gonna lie. Her bf is probably a nice person but our first interaction wasn’t great. I have a bit of an accent that sometimes comes out and he would repeat certain things I said in a mocking way, just so she could laugh, in front of me as if I wasn’t there. Like ???? Okay I don’t mind being roasted, but that was our first interaction. We were not at that level and that made me feel self conscious idk how to explain. 

I don’t feel like we are as close anymore because of college, so I don’t feel comfortable bringing up how bothered I am by the whole situation. I understand things change and priorities change, But after that party I felt like complete trash, and I am still a bit upset and feeling inadequate. It got me overthinking about how I’m 19 and haven’t had a bf yet, and that doesn’t seem to change any time soon. Like this shouldn’t be a big deal at all, and I don’t want to feel jealous, but if I was honest with myself, I need admit I kinda am jealous for many reasons. One I wish she wanted to hang out with me like old times and two, their relationship made it seem like having a boyfriend is the best thing ever and I am missing out on having something amazing in my life. I know it’s stupid but I can’t help myself but feeling like that.

As we were sobering up, we both slowly felt out each other’s comfort zones and took it slowly and eventually fooled around. We acknowledged it the next day but didn’t say much. A couple weeks later, we go out with our friends again and he said tells me in the middle of our night out that he wants to have sex later. I agreed. We went back to his place and had sex. 

Since then we’ve hooked up again but not had sex. For two people who are usually way more than open with each other, we’ve both been tiptoeing around the subject.

Things to note on gf: on depression meds, incrediably low self confidence, self-aware of her issues

**Problem: University pressure**

Started education at a very prestigious and difficult University this year. Doesn't wish to continue as:

* No enjoyment in the course. Becomes mentally draining.                                                                                                                                                              (It was her 3rd option but felt pressured to at least try the Uni because of how prestigious it is and how difficult it is to actually get in. ""You don't want to waste opportunity"" ""it'd be dumb not to take it"" that kind of thing).
* Incredibly heavy workload that she has been barely keeping up with. Stress amplifyer, ""must meet deadline""
* Difficulty fitting in. Actively does try to make friends to little fruition. Stress amplifyer, ""is there something wrong with me?"" ""very lonesome"" (People there don't have much in common with her to form deep friendships) Barely has time to even socialise
* 4 years of education. Long time to be doing something you dislike, in a place you dislike, with little people you get along with. Not even sure she'll keep her sanity. If she wants to quit it's better early than 3 years in.

She feels pressured to continue as:

* Close family being proud of her. Doesn't wish to disappoint, mainly her parents. Parents like the ability to humble brag, the opportunity that graduating would give her.
* Other family and friends, close family humble bragging to relatives. This results in relatives being very openly proud and actively supportive. For example giving helpful gifts, offering help in accomodation. These result in her feeling guilty in accepting the help. Doesn't want their feelings to go to waste, doesn't want to disappoint. (likely because she is constantly anxious that people will dislike her or that she is harming her parents in some way.)
* Guilt. She believes she has taken the place of someone who would've wanted the place more than her; more deserving. She thinks quiting would be the equivalant of stopping someone from entering the Uni.

**Personal questions to problem**

Do I encourage her to continue or not?  Do I act more persuasively/actively as to tip the balance of indecisiveness? Currently have voiced my opinion which is too much on the fence to help her commit to an action. I am unsure whether or not to act less neutral.",23Dec2019,1
352,"Hey there. I’m a first time poster to ANY subreddit, so forgive me if this turns out to be a mess. There’s a TL;DR at the bottom for your convenience. So, I (22M) live with my mom right now, as of about a week ago. She and my dad have been divorced for several years because of my brother (29M). My brother (who I’ll refer to as “J” from now on) is a dangerous person. He has severe schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, he suffers from psychosis, and he has a “gangster” mentality that lead him into drug abuse and thievery. I am in no way stating that being schizophrenic, bipolar, or a “gangster” automatically makes you dangerous, I’m just explaining how J is and giving clarity on the impactful issues that may attribute to his dangerous behavior. Anyways, J has a history of gun violence, armed robbery, and assaults. He’s admitted to having vivid hallucinations and he refuses to take his mood stabilizers and other medications that could help him to be less violent and more in control of himself. He recently blew up on our dad last week (while I still lived with him) whilst yelling about conspiracy theories and other nonsensical things. I called the cops because he started throwing things and threatening to kill my dad. The police talked to him and he immediately calmed down and left the house in his car (where he keeps his gun). J is a master manipulator who’s dealt with the police many times, so he knew exactly how to get out of the situation without getting arrested. The police couldn’t do anything because J appeared to be calm and he hadn’t hit my dad yet. I was afraid that J would come back and shoot me because I called the cops on him, so I left in my car and had to stay with a friend for a while. Eventually, my mother convinced me that it would be safe to just come live with her. A few days after J blew up on our dad, he robbed a group of college students at gunpoint and got arrested for it later on. Apparently the only evidence that the police have is surveillance camera footage of the robbery taking place, so my mom says that J won’t be in jail for long. When he gets out, I’m afraid that he’s gonna come after me, my dad, or my mom. If he’s not being forced to take his medicine, then he’s going to continue to get more and more violent and I’m afraid that he’ll kill me, my mom, my dad, or another family member. I’m about to be back in school and haven’t had any luck with getting a job (because I was a stupid teen who’d quit jobs way too quickly out of frustration, and my work history sucks because of it). I feel like I need to get my own apartment far away from my family if I’m ever going to be safe and have a normal life, but I’m unsure how to do that. I’d probably need at least two jobs to afford rent if I’m by myself, but I doubt that I could work two jobs AND go to school full time. I’m stuck, stressed, and afraid for my life. I’d really appreciate any advice that you guys might have for getting jobs and moving out. There are a lot of details that I’m leaving out of this post because it’s already too long, but I’d be happy to answer any questions you guys might have. Thank you in advance!

TL;DR: My brother is a dangerous, mentally unstable criminal and I think he’s going to murder me unless I move out and keep my whereabouts a secret from the rest of the family. I’ve been having trouble getting a job and I’m about to be back in school, so I’m afraid that moving out may be unrealistic or even impossible",23Dec2019,1

356,"1st off this is a throw away account because people IRL know my main  
2nd off this is my first time making a post like this so sorry for any formatting things.

Background  
So i am in my senior year of high school currently and am in my marching band. I have met a freshman girl who i will go ahead and call R. Well my friend R and myself become friends through this last fall semester. She has a sister who is quite competitive and they have a tough sibling rivalry however I refuse to believe that she is the cause of these problems as I know her sister, she is a senior, and I don't think that she would hurt her little sister. She just isn't that kind of person.  


Now onto my speculation

  I have picked up some small things such as she is extremely skinny and has mentioned her lack of money to pay off band fees multiple times in passing conversation. I have also given her some cash for food but I believe that she has possibly had it taken by her parents as she remains hungry even after I gave her the money(It was like $100). I confronted her about this and she just kinda dodged the question and moved onto something else to talk about.  


She also says that ""I am one of her only friends"" and is always quite happier when around me. I also am aware that she has to take some meds which I know is something for her bipolar disorder which I have talked to her about. I don't know if these feelings are a result of the meds as we talk a lot during lunch and the period after so keep in mind that could be a factor however I cannot be certain.  


This leads me to believe that she also doesn't have the best home life as she prefers to stay after school in the band hall and do literally nothing, no homework, no reading, because she just doesn't want to go home. I mean that HAS to be a point right or is she just fucking with me? Honestly I feel like a madman right now yelling into the void lol.  


So what should I do? Should i call some cops or something? Should I just give her some food and my attention and support? I dunno. Will answer any questions in the comments.",23Dec2019,1

361,"So it has been six years now, my girlfriend is great when I met her first, I stood beside her and supported her always. Two years ago, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, she withdrew and changed. I understood that I had to be with her and not leave her. Moving forward today, her mother is recovering, but my GF is still the same (cold, absentminded and act as if she does not care what I feel). We live in distant areas so we rarely see each other. She is a simple girl and rarely goes out with friends (mostly Sunday's church).

Yesterday, she decided to come to our house while I was at work, I came home early to surprise her. I noticed on her neck a mark. It looked like a hickey but when I asked her, she said it was a curling iron burn. She tried to cover it up with makeup before I return home but it was still apparent. I told her I wanted to clean it with wet wipes, she hesitated and did not let me, and started to get mad as if I was suspecting her of cheating. I got mad and told her that I wanted to see her phone, but she refused. I started to get more suspicious, but she did not seem to really care and told me that she is depressed due to her mother's condition and family matters and that I am falsely accusing her. She said that you have a better life than me (good health and a job) (she was recently released from a job), and the talk goes on. I do not know if you can conclude something from this. But my gut says she is good, meanwhile my sister noticed that mark and told me that is definitely a hickey and if it was a curling iron burn, why would she cover it up, and why would not give you her phone, she is definitely hiding something. 

I am in a state of shock, I do not how to act and what to think. I hope I can give you more information to help me with something. (sorry for any grammer mistakes, I am not a native speaker).",23Dec2019,1

365,"So ever since our last place together my moms partner put a at first unarmed bed in my room and it was just there. Not built. Not used. Didn’t like it there taking up space but whatever we moved out 4 months later. 

Now we moved in this apartment and have been here for a year and the only thing that changed is he built it but it was never used for his daughter which was the purpose. It’s just been taking up space in my room and I got tired of it and unarmed it and stored everything under my bed and closet. 

We don’t get along but I wanted to move it for the longest time and also to get a big dresser since the one I have is so small and the drawers are all messed up. I struggle to open the middle ones every day and all my clothes don’t fit there.

He found out I unarmed it and now is going crazy wanting to kick the door to get in my room and tell me stuff but my mom calmed him down. Saying I can decide what to do when I live elsewhere and pay rent. Now he says he’s gonna arm it again and throw away the dresser if I buy it and I’m just so tired of his crap.  I don’t know what to do and my mom just says no don’t do it and that’s all. He says I am borrowing the room but I live here. Yes I don’t pay rent but my mom does help with bills and I believe she can have word on what goes on inside this apartment too right?? 

He’s a sexist asshole and mentally unstable imo. Who wants to kick down a door just to argue.  I feel helpless and I don’t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.",23Dec2019,1

368,"TL;DR at the end!

The title is pretty self-explanatory. I’m pretty goddamn overweight, so much so that even if I do lose the pounds, I’ll have so much loose skin I’ll never even be seen as “average”. 

In 90% of situations, I’m perfectly okay with that (with “not being pretty” I mean, not with being unhealthily obese). I’ve never put much stock in my appearance, and even appreciate a good fat joke at my expense. It’s when I feel compelled to please someone with my looks that I’m totally screwed. As a result, I’m a chick nearing the age of 21 who’s never had a boyfriend. It’s not even like I expect a total looker, either! Idgaf if my future bf is a 500 lb landmonster, if he’s got a solid personality and we’re emotionally compatible, he’s a gem as far as I’m concerned.

The major problem here is that I won’t even put myself out there. I’ll never express interest in someone for fear of rejection. I don’t take great care of myself, dress nicely, or try in any way whatsoever to “be attractive” because it feels like it won’t make a meaningful difference (even if I know, intellectually, it will). I simply don’t look good enough, and never will. Sucks like hell!

So yeah, I could use some advice. I wanna learn to feel secure enough in myself to take steps towards finding a life partner. Not that I expect a single perfect solution from Reddit—just some relatable experiences maybe, and tales of how you guys overcame those struggles. I’ll be seeing a therapist about this, as well. Thanks in advance!

369,"So basically I (F18) couldn't dorm with anyone specific (because I had no friends going there) and I wasn't able to specifically choose roommates because I still wasn't sure if that was the college I wanted to go to. So I ended up having a roommate assigned to me. In my housing application, I said I was completely comfortable with anyone who was LGBT, as I am bisexual. I communicated with her (MtF18) through text before moving in and she told me she was trans and I said I was perfectly fine with that. When it comes to moving day it turns out my roommate is in no way presenting as female. We don't have co-ed dorming. She said she doesn't have a pronoun and you can address her as you like, so immediately I'm confused whether she's non binary or trans. So immediately I just didn't feel comfortable. Again, I'm very open to and accepting of everyone, I'm chill as fuck. I would've been completely okay with it if she was presenting as female because now it just totally feels like I'm dorming with a male. For a while I was kind of cool with it, I had no real problem with it because it felt like I was just dorming with a male friend, and I also kinda had to live with it as I didn't want a problem in my first weeks of college. That's until we both couldn't comfortably change in the room when we were both in there. I'd put my clothes in my backpack and go change in the residence hall bathrooms (we don't have one in our dorm). The room is also extremely small, it's split in half and the amount of space you get is literally the width of a twin bed. Whenever I had friends in my dorm and she'd walk in I'd get a puzzled look from all my friends. They'd ask me ""is that your roommate?"" and I'd literally have to explain because there's no way of protecting her from revealing such information because she literally does not present as female. Anyway, that's only part of it. Living with her was tolerable but I just never got my alone time because she was always in there. To add a humorous tone to this, she's walked in on me doing the deed more than three times. She always seems to walk in at the worst times, so at that point, I'd have to tell her what I'm up to so that she won't. I kind of don't want her specifically knowing about my sex life, so I've been in a dry spell. Big rip. There were way too many times where it was like 2 am and I'd be dead asleep and she'd come in and slam the door flicks on the light and start to shuffle things pretty motherfucking loudly for what time it fucking was. I'm starting to cuss because I'm agitated just writing this. She always seems to be up real fucking late, I usually would too but this semester I had 2 fucking 7:30 classes and I had them both collectively 3/5 days of the week. So I can't be all that angry but she was just never considerate of the fact that I was already tucked in bed at around 11:30 because I have to get up at 6ish to get ready for class. I hate that I was still nice in the mornings and used my flashlight to see shit in the dark ass dorm and get ready with my flash. She literally gets so much more sleep than me considering the fact that she doesn't wake up until 5 minutes before her class and even gets there late, she only had one morning class and she had it with me, I'd leave before she even woke up and get there way before she did. All her other classes were afternoon classes so she'd be able to sleep in all she wanted. My man, I did my makeup with just the flash. She was simply never considerate of me being in there. She'd leave her desk light on through the whole night multiple times. I can't sleep unless it's completely dark so I just invested on an eye mask. I thought problems were solved until we came back from Thanksgiving break. She ended up breaking her laptop so what did she bring? her whole pc setup, that's loud as fuck and the desktop would heat up the room so bad. It's winter and I had to open the window because it felt like 80 degrees Fahrenheit in the room. What did I find out? She's a streamer and plays league of legends every. single. fucking. hour. of the day. So I thought I was never alone before, and now she's just never going to leave. There were a few days where I'd just want to stay in my dorm all day for valid reasons like having a period and taking a mental health day, turns out staying in my dorm where I literally live did not help at all if anything it worsened it. She's constantly yelling and laughing in her headset. For whatever reason, her keyboard literally sounds like firecrackers and her mouse sounds like a constant ticking of a fucking bomb. Her desktop fan was also constantly on because you guessed it, she'd play so much it would heat the fuck up. So my living situation was only driving me insane instead of being a peaceful environment. For finals week I had nowhere to study since all the closed rooms in the library were completely reserved, the lounges on my floor were all taken. So I had to stick with studying in my room. Which turned out to be the worst fucking choice of my life. She was playing her fucking games on her pc, loud talking, LOUD laughing, like the neighbor would probably think she was in her fucking room but no she's just got a loud fucking laugh. Even with the noise-canceling beats, I could hear her keyboard and mouse, I'd have to blast music to not hear it but I'm not going to go deaf because she just won't shut the fuck up. I literally debated studying in the fucking hallway of the floor. Speaking of hallways, I'd have to start leaving the room to take calls from my friends because she listens to everything. She listens to my conversations. Now I have absolutely no fucking privacy. Throughout the whole semester, I'd constantly leave home on the weekends, she never did. She lives the same distance away from home. So right off the bat, she'd constantly get the room for herself for days straight. I never ever have. I've NEVER had the fucking room to myself. My mental health has been deteriorating little by little and there was a day where I had fallen asleep around 6 in my dorm because I was severely burnt out from school as I wasn't doing too great, I had found out my best friend of 13 years tried to make a move on a guy I had been talking to for a while knowing fully well as we have been seen by her as a couple already, my family life was taking a huge toll on me and I was just emotionally clocked out as I had been crying for hours on end. Door slams, wakes me up from my nap, gets on to playing league of legends. So now I'm laying there hearing the constant clicking, typing, and talking/laughing and I just lay there and cry more in silence. I already don't have privacy back at home, and that living situation didn't help me get away from those problems, which is kind of why I wanted to move out of my parent's house to begin with. If anything it added to my stress, and now I'm just mentally fucked to where my anxiety and depression have been getting extremely severe and harder to cope with. Even after 4 months of this, she still remains a complete stranger to me. We're not friends at all, we never were. And it hurts to hear all my friends say they're like best friends with their roommate or at least really cool with each other, and I have to deal with all of this. I want to change rooms, but my RA has to get the whole gist as to why and I honestly don't know how to explain this whole situation. I also have to think about how I'm going to move out all my shit, I have a microwave and fridge (that I was letting her use) and a small tv to move out of the room. I'm kind of assuming I'm the one that's gonna have to move out because I'm the one complaining. There's also a slight chance that she just wanted to push me to my limit to move out. So like basically she probably antagonized me until I decided to move out instead of her, after writing this out, that's what it sounds like. I'm just so frustrated because I don't know how to tell my RA this since I have no idea if she's gonna have me discuss the problems with her there to hear it.",23Dec2019,1
370,"This is a follow up on a post I made about 2 months ago about my Dads arrest.

I’ll fill you in on what’s happened over the past 2 months.

I went to my Sisters wedding, much to my Mum's dismay, and no one was talking about the arrest. Everyone was just enjoying the night and it was a great night. The next day she was kind of cold towards my younger sister and I for going to the wedding, but that didn’t last long. 

After that she kept pestering me to go see my Dad. I kept saying i’ll think about it as I wasn’t sure if I wanted to see him yet. She said she wanted me to see him at least once then she’ll leave me be. After a couple of weeks I went with her and my younger sister to see him. I didn’t really say anything to him and vice versa. She kept asking me to go see him after that even though she told me she wouldn’t.

You have probably heard that Australia has some bad bush fires right now. I happen to live near one of the big ones and our town had to be evacuate for a few days. My younger sister and I went to my older sisters place to stay until we could come back home. My Mum stayed with my Nan (her Mum). We kept in contact to make sure we were all alright.

The fire didn’t do too much damage to the town thanks to the Firefighters, only a few houses were burnt. Our house was untouched. 

We got back home yesterday. My sister and I unpacked the car and sat down in the living room to rest for a bit. About 10 minutes later my Mum walked in and was majorly upset. She said that Dad is basically fucked and that we never asked once how she was doing with everything, which we have, multiple time. I ask her how she’s doing every day and she says she’s coping. I ask if she wants to talk and she says she doesn’t want to.

Anyway after saying we never ask how she is she went on saying that it’s our fault he was arrested. Went on to say we hate her, which we don’t, then proceeded to storm out and she drove off somewhere. She came back today at about 11am and she hasn’t said a thing to either of us since she left yesterday. 

I understand that she’s upset and frustrated that Dad most likely isn’t getting out anytime soon but there is no need to blame us for it.

What should I do about all this? I’m at the end on my rope right now. I want to just leave to avoid all of this bullshit but I know that would most likely make things worse. I'm trying to keep a level head but it's getting very difficult, I feel like i'm gonna lose my mind.",23Dec2019,1

So. I have thought about asking her what it was like, what went on, how she and her family fared through the 30s and 40s. However I’m unsure if it might really upset her, it’s obviously a bit of a touchy topic.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad has been in and out of my life since I (22f) was 3 (that's when I met him). I lived with my mom most of my life. When I was younger he would promise that we would go and do things like go to the movies, go to dinner, or just spend time together in general but when the time came, it was excuse after excuse. After a while, my grandmothers dementia worsened and he wasn't able to leave her for a few hours like he used to be able to. I generally overlooked the disappointment until I got older. He would call my mom's phone to talk to me and would always complain that I never called him and would say that my sisters (all at least 15 years older than me) called him once a week even though he would never answer when i called. I also ignored the fact that he's a functioning drug addict and has been my whole life. Until I got older, I never realized that he had been doing pills in front of me and that all of his ""friends"" were really just a bunch of neighborhood addicts. I used to spend summers at his house and some weekends. He tried to convince me that my maternal grandparents of a different race have always had some kind of bias against me because I'm mixed. All of this, I was willing to forgive, because all of this had happened when I was younger. In my teens, things got better for a while. I had to drop out of school at 17y/o to work. 4 months later, my moms partner kicked us out in the middle of January and kept everything we owned except for some clothes, so we went to live with my bio father. now we are getting to the point in my story where now that im older, things are really starting to matter to me more. The biggest peeves I had with him is he would make comments about me being a bigger girl, would call me names, take my stuff out of my room. I was a huge stoner and he would borrow my paraphernalia w/o asking, and just generally be a shitty room mate. The parental bond we had wasn't prevalent because as much as he may or may not have tried to be a father, he just wasn't. I was never mad about that and it has no effect on how i view him. anyways, we would have little spats and i would leave things alone because it was my father. Things really came to a head when he would ask to borrow money and when it came time for him to pay me back, he said I wasnt getting the money back because the bills needed paid, as if i didnt pay for everything we needed such as soap, washing detergent, food, and cigarettes. When i got mad about it, he got physical with me and at the time i was 19 y/o so i looked for an easy way out. I started dating a man who was twice my age and i moved in with him shortly after we met. unbeknownst to me, my dad had some girl and her kids (whom we have no relations to) in my grandmothers house. they pilfered through my moms stuff and stole her clothes, stole my stuff out of my room, destroyed the house basically. Now mind you, i already lost most of everything i owned when my moms ex kicked us out. So how do you think i felt when my dad let some strung out lady stash her kids in my grandmothers house? i was pissed, and i went off. i felt guilty afterwards but my mom and i are trying to rebuild our lives and you let a couple of rowdy kids come in here and tear our stuff up while their mom is out doing drugs? i left and didnt talk to my dad for about 8 months. During that time, my ex and i broke up so i moved in with my maternal aunt. then she kicked me out and i had to sleep in my car for a while. AT NO POINT when my dad knew i was sleeping in my car did he offer me a place to stay. i found out he knew after i had finally saved up enough to get my own place. after a while i got a new job, and only during the week im flat broke does my wheel bearing start to go out. he swears he can get the part for $35 and that he can have his friend put it on. he swears he knows what hes talking about but a certified mechanic told me that the whole assembly needs replaced b/c i was using my car with a bad part so i ended up having to borrow money from another relative to get it fixed. I have no desire to talk to him anymore, but i cant help but feel sorry that I don't. I know Ive said a lot of bad things about my dad but hes 71 and not getting any younger. my grandmother passed almost 2 years ago and he was severely depressed for a while. on the day of her funeral, my cousins had to crawl thru a window to check on my dad because he wouldn't answer the phone or the door. I feel kinda bad for him. Both of my parents are addicts, but my mom got clean and had me 200 miles away. the whole time, my dad never knew I existed. I was conceived during their crack addiction and when my mom moved us back he basically gets thrown a 3 year old and gets told this is your daughter. I feel like he didn't have the same opportunity to clean himself up when he found out he had another kid on the way because he didnt really know i existed. but he had all of this opportunity for 19 years to be a father and i feel like hes barely tried. I turned out great by some kind of miracle (the story of my mother is a whole different ball game). at 19 i got my own apartment. 21 when i got a job making 70k a year with no degree. 7 months later i bought a brand new car off the lot with no co-signer.  I go to therapy 2x a month to help with my issues. i could be doing so much worse for being the child of active drug addicts.

380,"I recently took out a friend (A) of mine on a morning excursion to try to take her mind off the stressful week she just had.  Her bf has been short on the rent during the past few months and he recently got pulled over with a suspended license (he had several months to resolve this issue).  Her best friend (B) saw how down she was and suggested i take her out to try and cheer her up.  I was apprehensive at first because of the optics but i just looked at it like i was being a good friend and decided to just treat her.  

So i picked her up and took her out for breakfast nearby.  After we ate, i took her to an art museum downtown (i asked her where she wanted to go beforehand and that's what she came up with).  After we hit the exhibit, she wanted to check out the gift shop.  I ended up picking her up a souvenir shirt and a Salvador Dali pin.  Before i took her back home, i stopped over at a local italian bakery and bought her some cannolis because she said a few weeks prior that she loved them but it's been a while since she had some.  After that i took her home and before she left she said she had a good time.  No kiss, no hug, no flirting, just a fist bump before she walked away.  

Later on that same day, friend (B) tells me that when she spoke to friend (A) about our morning trip, she was in a much better mood and really enjoyed the day.  The problem, is that now her bf thinks it was a date and that i'm now trying to steal her away.  Friend (B) tells me that friend (A)'s bf rarely treats her and that friend (B) had never experienced someone taking her out and treating her the way i did (i don't really think i did anything special but since this is her first bf, the experience was new to her).  

I'm glad that i was able to cheer her up but now i'm kind of regretting doing what i did because i feel like i've gotten too involved.",23Dec2019,1
382,"So my main issue is college, I literally cannot afford to enroll for next semester. I'm about to turn in a from for more loans so I can hopefully enroll last minute (I know it's really late but it's hard to get all the paperwork done when your parents don't make enough to be a co-signer which is required) so I don't even know if I'll get a chance to enroll now. 

Also should I just drop out? So far college has caused me nothing but trouble, I can't afford my medications (allergies, anxiety, and depression) I can't afford to see a psychiatrist or doctor, which in turn affects my school work. College even cost me boyfriend (I essentially had to chose between him and college but instead of choosing calmly I got upset because I have a bit of a temper which led to that bridge being completely burned).

I just don't know what to do, I had so much riding on this. I was going to go to med school and become a cardiologist, but here I am struggling through the first semester of college. Also I can't exactly bring any of these concerns to my family as they're all super conservative.

383,"I'm a 21 y/o college student home for winter break. My mother kicked me out of her house (I didn't do anything wrong, she's just like that), so I called to ask my aunt/grandma to stay with them for the remaining month until school starts. They kindly agreed, and for the past week, I've been staying on a cot in my grandma's kitchen. They've been really ,really, kind to me, I've tried really hard to be a good house guest, quiet, well-behaved. I always ask if I'm making too much noise, as the kitchen connects to my grandma's bedroom on the other side of the room, but she always reassures me that she can't hear anything. For the past few nights, I've even watched youtube videos on a normal volume on my computer (the volume I'd likely have it if I were watching alone in the house), and she has never woken up and insists she can't hear it.

Well, the title being explanatory, you know where this is going. I've been here for about a week, I was stressed bc of being kicked out, needed badly to unwind. Around 11.30pm I called my boyfriend to video chat, gma was asleep at the time. Bf and I had cyber sex over fb video messenger from maybe 1.30am-2.45am, basically sexy talk with accompanying visuals. Gma was still asleep. Our ""dialogue""  was around normal speaking volume. In the thick of it, I heard my grandma cough. We froze, and after a minute I heard her cough again. We said goodnight immediately and turned the lights out.

It took about an hour after that for her to finally fall asleep. She usually dozes off pretty quickly, but the fact that she has been awake so long can only have me think she is somewhat traumatized. She is rather religious and sheltered. She can't handle curse words or references to sex. I feel so awful and absolutely understand why she may have been too embarrassed to do or say anything. I want to believe that she didn't hear *what* we were saying to each other, but if I can hear her cough, she can probably hear me talk. I have no idea when she woke up.

I'm scared of what will happen. At best, she slept through it and didn't hear a thing. At worst, she is deeply offended. What if she kicks me out, too? I don't know if it would be best to bring it up first and apologize as she likely wouldn't even if something did happen. Or just keep quiet and hope it blows over. What would you do?

But yeah, idk I've just been feeling like I am slowly drowning but am also quite numb to it, I acknowledge it is happening but I have not intention of doing anything as that would be alot of effort. As for the level of drowning I'd say I'm constantly feeling like I'm deep in the ocean struggling to stay afloat with my face barely staying above water, with the feeling of isolation you get of being alone in the cold ocean struggling to stay alive, only sometimes taking on water by accident, feeling the burn of the salty water in my throat.

We went out for a night and had a great time. Not once did he try to make a move on me, was just an all around gentleman and kept shrugging his behavior off as how I deserve to be treated by anyone. I wasn’t tempted by anything other than effortless conversation, intelligence, endless laughs, and a real vibe. It made me feel as though I’ve never been properly taken out until then. The problem is, of course, that he was twice my age.

I guess what I’m asking is, is it impossible to find a true gentleman who was born after 1990? Or has decades of horrific social cues from TV and social media doomed me to be single unless I lower my standards? Do people just not teach their children how to treat women anymore?

Something you should know, I have generalized anxiety disorder. I'm not shy, or cowardly, or normally bad with people, I just second guess myself to hell and back with every situation.

Four years ago, I asked this girl out that I had met a few weeks prior at our local community college. We were 17 and 18, it was our first year. She said yes, then texted me later on the same day saying she had to change her answer to a no because she was only planning on staying in the city for a year and didn't want to be in a relationship that likely wouldn't last. Understandable.
So, we became good (mutually platonic) friends, and had a really great friendship until the end of the school year when we both moved on to other universities. Out friendship dissipated as time passed, and eventually we stopped talking.

Fast-forward three and a half years later to last summer. After a few years of not having thought about her, I had a random dream one night about her. I woke up, figured I'd shoot her a text, and we caught up a little bit. We soon found out we would be in the same city for a few days (turns out, my work takes me through her city about once or twice every couple months), so we decided to meet up for lunch.

We picked up right where we left off. We ended up talking for like four hours, explored the city for a few more, and had a really great time. I haven't had such real conversations with anyone else this entire year. I go back home, a month passes, and I realize I'll be back in her city in about a week, so we set up another get together. My mind at this point is pretty much pretty platonic, thinking, ""man, this is great, getting to hang with my friend again"".

I show up five minutes early, grab a table and wait, and that's about when I started to feel super nervous and anxious out of nowhere, and then eventually even more nervous and anxious because I couldn't figure out why I was so nervous and anxious. She shows up, and my shakenupness pretty much dominated the whole lunch atmosphere, goddamnit. Lunch is pretty short. Maybe an hour. We walk for 10 minutes, but I know I've already fucked the mood with my anxiety. We end up parting ways shortly after.

I don't even know what my question is. I want to go and get together, but I'm terrified of freezing up again. I think somewhere inside I still like her, but am still hung up on it not going to work, so I'm trying to deny though feelings. She's the person I have the most chemistry with out of anyone I know. She's the type of person I want to spend the rest of my life with. Is it foolish to even think like that? Does that make me a bad person? Any thoughts welcome.",23Dec2019,1

410,"Backstory: I (20F) dated this guy (20M) for 11 months, broke up in August. He asked to stay friends and I agreed (we go to the same school, for the same program, with many mutual friends). Months pass by, I realize that instead of healing from the heartbreak, I’m simply distracted because of school and thus suppressing my feelings every time I interact with him. 

What I want is to fully heal and get rid of any lingering feelings in order to, hopefully some time in the future, approach the friendship genuinely and we could be good friends again. 

Now: We have a Chickfila lunch coming up (just us two, we’ve “owed” each other this for months) and after that lunch I want to address my “boundaries” within our current friendship. I’d consider us close friends at the moment, but now I want to be just school friends (a school-centred friendship). For me this means: 

- no more sending memes back and forth. I don’t do this with my other school friends. 
- only hanging out in group settings, not even studying alone together

That’s basically it. It would be best if I could completely stay away from him but as I mentioned we’re in the same courses, robotics club (important extracurricular for my degree; I don’t want to drop this), and similar circle of friends which means interactions are inevitable. This is the most distance I can come up with that doesn’t put our friends in an awkward position nor put us in an even more awkward position than our exes-to-friends-who-see-each-other-every-day situation. 

I also wanted to explain my reasoning, mentioned 2nd paragraph. 

I was wondering if doing this over a lunch would be appropriate, or am I doing too much in the first place? One non-confrontational way I thought about was to keep making excuses whenever he asks to hang out, as well as telling him I’m going on an “Instagram cleanse” and then blocking/restricting him while still using Instagram behind his back. That way, he’ll still act the same with me, but with no knowledge about what I’m feeling/thinking. I think this might be easier for him to prevent him from overthinking his actions after I’ve vocally expressed my “boundaries”.",23Dec2019,1

412," Using a throwaway since my main account isn't private from friends and family. I haven't brought this up with anyone and I wanted some space to work out my feelings.

That being said, this is my situation...

My ex (M28) and I (F28) dated for around 2 years. We broke up because we both agreed we'd be better off that way and 3 years later, we're still best friends.

Now recently he has asked me if I would be willing to have a child with him, in a non-romantic partnership (Which I am completely fine with. Our relationship is now very close, but very platonic). His reasons for wanting it are all things I've thought about as well.

We are both very reasonable people, so we aren't likely to let emotion or petty grievances get in the way of parenting. We trust each other not to fight over custody, access, etc. We both want kids, but don't want to have them with just anyone. Which, as the aunt of multiple children who's fathers aren't in the picture anymore, this is a big point for me. I trust him not to leave me to do this by myself.

Basically, it all works out in theory and I want to say yes, but I feel like it's such a big decision that will ultimately change both of our lives. I want to have thoroughly thought it through and have all my bases covered before I make a proper decision. We haven't had a chance to talk about it in more depth yet. He only asked me the other night and won't be back in town until tomorrow, but I'm having a bit of difficulty working through my thoughts and would like some extra input.

Some immediate cons that come to mind are that I've had multiple miscarriages in the past and am worried that, if I can in fact even have children, how many more will I have to go through? And that I have ADHD and can barely keep myself organised and take care of myself some days (I'm still in the process of working out treatment that works best for me), I'm worried that I won't be able to do it. I managed with my siblings' children, but I haven't looked after them for more than a day or two. I'm worried I won't cope, even though I get repeatedly told I'd make a great mother.

If you have any advice, or suggestions for things to think about/work out with him, even questions, I would love to hear them.

We've argued whether or not it was within hearing distance of the man. I say it almost certainly was. Boyfriend said it wasn't. But here's the part that's really irked me. During our argument, my boyfriend informed me that he 'didn't care if the man heard.'

Let me clarify - this wasn't a man who was visibly on drugs. He looked as though he might have been, but if he was very obviously on drugs I wouldn't have given him money. Again, this is something we disagree on. 

We've had our moments, but up until now, I've always idolised my boyfriend. He's normally very kind, caring and wonderful to everyone. People generally love him and he's quick to make friends with others no matter what their societal standing, so this has somewhat altered my perceptions on him. 

Based on the above, I don't know if I'm being too quick to judge. In my boyfriend's eyes, he saw someone who he felt was very clearly on drugs, he didn't care if they heard him say it because maybe they need to hear it. 

In my eyes, the homeless are discriminated against and nobody has any right to vocalise an assumption out loud within hearing distance. The dude might just be in a really shit place in life, not on drugs, and my boyfriend's comment could have really upset him. 

To me, the fact that my boyfriend said he 'didn't care whether the man heard' shows a total lack of compassion for others. During the argument, he backpedalled and said he'd changed his mind and that, in fact, he does care after all. Let's be honest though, people don't just change their mind. He's saying it to pacify me. 

I won't lie. I've been ill for a few days, emotionally all over the place so I cried way too much at the start of our argument and probably seemed like I over-reacted. I think he either thinks I'm mental or on some kind of a moral high horse - I'm not, I just have incredibly strong opinions in this regard. 

I feel this has changed my opinion of him, hopefully temporarily, but I just don't know whether I'm taking it too far. As far as he's concerned, it's a man on drugs who could do with hearing what he had to say. 

Is this a clash of opinions that I should let go or major 🚩 territory?",23Dec2019,1
419,"I have a co worker who became my best friend over the last year n a half or so she was great we would get breakfast 3 or 4 times a week we would go to the gym together we go shoping. i would always try to keep her happy shes kinda all i got n all tho im not particularly socially capable. Over the last few weeks shes gotten colder and distant lately she doesn't talk to me. she leaves work as soon as i get there she doesnt even say hi half the time. i don't know what i did wrong she seems so hateful but she is still friendly with everyone else. i try asking about it but she wont talk and i just want my best friend back as im kinda pathetic and without her id be alone again. She is maried and neither of us have any kinda relationship thing as far as i could tell and i get along fairly well with her husband but its heartbreaking that she looks at me like im dirt now.

420,"I went to my best friend of 12+ years family function today. I’ve been there a million times, everyone is like family and it’s nice usually. She recently broke up with her boyfriend of 9 years and now has a new boyfriend who is drastically different personality-wise than the last one. The last one wasn’t very social and didn’t talk to me or anyone else too much. Very reserved and shy. The new one is very outgoing and outspoken, talks to everyone whenever possible. That can easily be misconstrued as flirtatious to people who don’t know someone. 

My friend went to the bathroom and was gone for long while, and her boyfriend was talking to me like normal conversation. I understand that his mannerisms may come off as flirtatious to strangers but if you know him then you get that it’s not like that. We literally talked about guitar and I showed him one video from a Facebook page. And then her uncle cane over and looked to him and was like “you better watch what you say” and then walked away. I just was like “I’m sure it’s because he’s drunk” and forgot about it. Come to find out, he told my best friends cousin who then told my best friend that he was flirting with me... 

And so now it’s just a huge mess. It was arguments in the car the entire way back. He was mad that my best friend even asked him if it was true (which I think she has a right to question it just to confirm) and then called me biased when I said it’s normal and understandable for her to ask him.. just a very messy and annoying situation to be in. I feel like she’s mad at me or doesn’t trust me because of this but if I thought he was flirting I would’ve put him in his place. I texted her saying that it sucks that this has even come up and that if she needs a couple of days to think it’s ok, she read it and hasn’t answered.

424,"I (40M) have been married for 1 year now. My wife (26F) is pregnant so we're also expecting a child soon.

In the last few years my business has really taken off. I'm pulling in a lot of money. I estimate that I could retire within the next 8-10 years if the trajectory keeps up. I didn't come from a privileged background so I'm very grateful for the good things in my life.

My sister (44F) isn't as successful as me, and I feel she resents me for it. She's also always been a negative person. She's always complained about everything but never did anything about it. When I announced that I was getting married, everyone in my family, my parents, brother (20M) and friends were all happy except for her.

She felt the need to say this marriage was inappropriate. She made no effort to get to know my now wife either.

My sis came to ask me for financial help which I found amusing. She then tried to bring up my marriage. I felt she was baiting me but I couldn't help but resist answering. She felt the need to insinuate I took advantage of my wife, which is NOT true. My wife is Ivy League educated and comes from a place of financial privilege herself. I then corrected my sister and pointed out that I did give women my own age a chance, it's just that it didn't work because in my view, whenever I attempted to date women my own age (from 35 onwards), I always felt some pressure from them to tie the knot. They would force this idea of marriage, kids etc when it felt unnatural, like they were trying to tick boxes on a checklist. Whereas with my wife, I didn't initially start dating her with the idea of marriage...it developed naturally and then I realized I wanted to marry her.

I told my sis to get out of my place and said ""Your negativity is repulsive"" then she got upset and left, but not before calling me AH. Maybe I was harsh, but I think she is a huge hypocrite.

I may cut off my sister.",23Dec2019,1
425,"My family is always bringing me down and making me feel like shit, sometimes saying awfully hurtful things like that I'm a waste of money and should be kicked out for being useless. I'm not old enough to move out nor do I have the money or knowledge, so I have to reach out for help and I have a person in mind. The thing is my social anxiety is always making me too anxious to leave the house and my depression tells me I should just give up and stay in my misery because getting help requires energy, but I'm constantly mentally exhuasted. How do I force myself to reach for help and ignore those reoccuring thoughts?

427,"We started talking like 2 weeks ago but i met her almost 6 months before. The other day we were out talking about stuff and then her friend became a subject of our conversation. She told me her friend (who I know) has done drugs and currently steals stuff from shops and other small stores in malls. I told her joking she was a drugadict and a thief and told her she was a bad influence. The rest of the date was cool.

She has this tendency of leaving me in delivered and not answering until more than 7 hours have passed and it’s impossible to try to talk to her because when she answers she delivers de driest and weakest texts ever. Yesterday I told her I thought her texts were dry and she told me that she didn’t like chatting and that she wasn’t obligated to answer and me neither.

Today I didn’t reply and she got mad and told me to talk to her. We got into a huge argument and suddenly she brought up the comments I made about her friend. She told me that she was upset and the entire arguments focus was changed to if what I said about her friend was wrong or right, I told her it was a joke and that if she didn’t think it was a joke then it was straight up facts. I ended up apologizing but she was quite angry. She threatened to end our 3 week relationship and I told her that I wasn’t going to beg for her to try. Then like an hour later we talked again and I asked her if it was over, but she told me she wanted to talk about that tomorrow. 

I understand her annoyance but I’m a human being too, and humans tend to do regrettable shit, but she seems more annoyed about what I said now than when I said it first. It almost seems as if she desperately wanted to win the argument instead of listening me and actually improve our relationship.

To whoever is reading this, plz give me your opinion and tell me what to do about her, I’m very attracted to her, and I’m 100% into having a real relationship with her, but also I have self esteem and won’t  tolerate being threatened by her by telling me she is about to finish our relationship.",23Dec2019,1

They were given two choices , western or Chinese , both of the younger sisters(19,23) chose western as we would be having Chinese for when the new year comes around , however the eldest sister(27) was bent on getting chinese food because she just wants two dishes which can be bought anywhere else.She(27) then messages me asking me to vote for Chinese food without any proper explanation , then when I said I did not want to , she threatened me by saying that she would not get dinner for me (after I haven’t eaten the whole day) , this only got worse after I asked her if she would still be getting dinner , she demanded the fifteen dollars from me even after I told her that our parents didn’t want us to get delivery with the money.

432,"My grandmother passed recently (May she Rest In Peace) and had a trust set up. She re-married well off man years ago to her second husband and he left her with a lot of money after he died. Originally when she set up her will she had three beneficiaries; my mother and my aunt and my uncle. My uncle passed away years ago and then a few years after that my mother passed away due to cancer. 

I’m my mother’s only child and my uncle never had any children. My aunt had two sons. One son of my aunts died but left a daughter (my aunts granddaughter) and my aunt’s other son is still living.

After those deaths, my grandmother changed her will and wanted the trust to be spilt 50/50 with my aunt and I. The only reason that I would get anything is because my mother died early due to cancer and I’m her only offspring otherwise my mother herself would have gotten the 50% portion. My aunt is obviously my grandmothers only living child so she would get the other 50%

Now let’s fast forward to today. My aunt contacted me the other day saying that she tried to talk to a lawyer and tel him she was power of attorney and that my grandmother changed her mind about the trust and wanted to change the will. She is saying that my grandmother didn’t want her other grandchildren’s feelings to be hurt (my aunt’s son and my aunt’s granddaughter) and wanted to add them in. She was going to have my cousin (aunt’s son) get 25%, me get 25% and my aunt’s granddaughter would just get whatever my aunt would throw her way. So pretty much my aunt is saying her som was suppose to get money. The estate lawyer said she can’t do this because the will in place didn’t say that. My aunt is saying that she didn’t get a chance for my grandmother to sign the new will but that they drew up papers saying it and showed the lawyer. He said no it’s not valid. So she called me after she tried to change it and asked me to give money to my cousins.

As it stands right now I’m suppose to receive $50,000 and my aunt the same. My aunt wants me to give her son $10,000 and her granddaughter $2,500, so that their feelings aren’t hurt. She asked me to think about it and I told her that I would. I gave it a few days and decided against it. I’m married (married 5 years) and have 3 children. 2 from my husband and 1 from us together. Regardless those are our kids. So I told her “I thought about it and I’d like to honor what’s in the original document.” She got upset and assured me she could show me the drawn up papers. I explained to her, “That’s not necessary. I’d like to honor what my grandmother had signed and what she had told me (my grandmother let me know about this will after my mother died and what she would do. She never mentioned this change my aunt is saying. In fact not even my aunt mentioned this until after she died.) “ I also told her that “I am going to just use it for our 3 children’s futures.”

She didn’t like this answer and responded, “I am shocked and hurt. My moms money is going to benefit children that aren’t my moms family and my moms grandchildren benefit nothing and will get nothing.” I explained that the only reason I’m getting this money is because out of her two siblings, my mother is the only one beside her that had a child and unfortunately mother DIED to CANCER. This is was not a win for me. I’m my mothers only child and I’m lucky to even be alive. I suggested to my aunt give her son and granddaughter money from her portion. This is when things went south. She said, “Wow! I’m honestly not surprised. I took care of your mom and my mom for many years and you never helped me!” She is now saying beyond hurtful things to me. I’m a 40 year old woman who tried my best to help my mother and grandmother while juggling work as a software developer and 3 kids!. I had to work but I cleaned parts of my mom I never thought I’d see and her body deteriorated. No I couldn’t just sleep at her house for days on end but I was there for my mom and grandma as much as I could be. That hurt me. So then I asked her “I’m sorry you feel that way but it’s not personal so please don’t take it personal. It’s my mothers portion. If she were alive this wouldn’t even be a conversation. Would you have asked her to give your son and granddaughter money from her portion?” She immediately texted back and said, “I can guarantee your mom would my my son [insert name] and granddaughter [insert name] and NOT your husband’s children!...only [insert our youngest child’s name].”

After that I stopped responding via text. She got angry and said she was shaking and she was so hurt and angry and said she was done talking to me about it.

The will that’s in place says 50/50 period. But I think the part that hurts the most is that she mentioned that about our kids. Our children ARE OUR FAMILY. Whether she likes it or not. The money was my mothers portion. However I decide to invest in our future, whether it be paying for college, paying off our house, investing, etc., I feel that it’s our choice. She’s guilt tripping me so hard over something that’s in the documents! I do need to add my aunt and I aren’t close. We see each other at holidays when my mom and grandma was alive but since my grandma passed before Thanksgiving, we haven’t anymore. She only contacted me to tell about this money.

These are just questions I’ve had bouncing in my head. I know she has to follow the will but it feels like she’s making me out to be a monster. She wants me to give my mother portion of the inheritance to my cousins so their “feelings aren’t hurt??!” My aunt is still alive!!! How would they be sad about anything? Especially when their mom/grandma has the same amount?!! 

Note: I haven’t mentioned or talked about this to my cousins. I don’t feel like it’s proper. They aren’t in the will so why are they even being brought up? She probably already has, but I haven’t. It seems that things are going at racing speed with this thing and now we aren’t even talking. My husband is hurt (rightfully so) for her comments and feels that after all these years she never even thought of him or our kids as family, otherwise why make that statement?

I need advice. Am I being greedy? Am I wrong? Should I not invest my inheritance into my children? Should I just say screw her and continue to live our lives? If we do fall out how do I explain this to our children?",23Dec2019,1

434,"We've been internet friends since roughly 2014/15 and were both in the same friend group of around 10-15 people.  
Eventually most people moved on since they'd gotten busy with school and other friend groups which is a totally normal thing to happen. My friend didn't move on because he had nowhere else to turn to. He struggled a lot with making friends on the internet and in real life (the other 2 or 3 friends he had besides me were kind of abusive and just rude in general), he also didn't particularly like the people in our online friend group because he didn't know how to interact with them since he had very different interests and he admitted that he only hung around because I was easy to get along with since I shared interests with everyone. A couple of months ago he left this group as him and I had found a couple of new friends who he got along with (I think he thought that we were making a new friend group which we would both stick in), this new group of friends pretty quickly faded out and he was left with no one besides me and the abusive friends I mentioned earlier.

Recently I've been dealing with depression related to many things in my life (yes, I'm aware that I need to seek help for this issue but it's a long and difficult process, I can't just snap out of it like he expects) and it's meant that I don't want to contact or hang out with anyone unless I REALLY want to. He's always been a very clingy friend but his constant begging to do stuff together has been driving me absolutely mental because I just can't do it because I'm stuck in this rut. I've tried to explain this to him a couple of times but he doesn't really seem to understand and just complains that this is torture for him because he's the one without any friends and that I'm his only friend so I have to be there for him. Usually I end up giving in and hang out with him but it's spent being miserable and makes me feel even more drained because of course I'm not going to enjoy something that I'm basically doing against my will.

(all names and dates/places are made up)

this girl i will call Emma (24f) and me (22m) were on some projects together (school) and hit it off pretty well. i was planning on asking her out in june because we were going on an international project together in may with some people and didn't want to make it awkward for her or the rest of the group if it didn't work out.(the trip includes vacation as well)

after a fun night out we both ended up ""confessing"" and kissing some.  
okay here i want to take some time and tell you that i haven't been in a relationship and never kissed so this was a first. i'm generally quite shy but am really trying my best. she has been in a serious, quite long, relationship.

the day after i stayed there and we talked a bit about what happened, we both decided we wanted to see where this was going but were going to keep it a secret from the rest. the plan was for both of us to focus on our studies during January (exams) and to see where things go after.

now this week we're going on a date before all the stress starts and i don't know how far i can take things. she doesn't want to kiss yet because it's still a little weird for her, which i am totally fine with. can i hold her hand?can i be romantic? i am pretty stuck...

the way we are now i don't know how far i can take things. i don't know how much i should message her, if i can flirt a bit. this also mainly stems from a lot of insecurity on my part. I keep thinking i've already fucked this up... there'd be no way she likes me. (those two are my main problems, like huge!)

just so much doubting myself on my part...  
also i'm scared for January because we're not planning on meeting really and we're gonna be holed up in our rooms studying for the most part, i have no clue what i'm gonna talk about and am scared she will lose interest.

I also really want to do the army gap year program but the applications are going to be due soon and once again... I’m not a citizen. 

So TLDR I can’t do anything I REALLY want to do because it’s out of my control because I’m not a citizen and I don’t want to go to uni because I don’t want to study anything in particular.

On top of this poor self image  I'm the one who shoulders the family drama and financial burdens. Being the one they look to and yell a t when things go wrong  is emotionally and mentally exhausting.

I've been clean from self harm for four months now and it's screaming st me to start again. Last time I self harmed, I was convinced that suicide would be the only way out, and I'm terrified that I'm in that same place.

I don't want to hurt myself, or my family, but I don't want to hurt them by telling them that I'm in pain.

450,"Hi guys, so this may seem silly to some but I got invited to an event from an app that I constantly used for groceries, pet care and cleaning supplies. I got an email saying that out of 4.5mil users I was chosen as one of the 50 people to come to a summit. G-50 summit they are calling it. There will be questions, ideas, advice etc. They just want to hear from their users. 

I cant decide if I should go because: 
1. All my clothes and shoes are packed away in boxes because my bf and I recently broke up and I am moving out of his house. So I would have to dig through it all to find something and if I do I dont even know what people wear to such a thing. I hardly go out lately and even then I am in jeans and a sweater. 
2. I really dont want to have to say something infront people, I extremely shy and worry about saying something wrong. Besides I dont have anything to say to them because I was happy with their services. So wont it be better to invite someone who will provide them with ideas and comments. 
3. They provide thise who join a 10% discount and to their friends too but I wont be using this app anymore because of financial issues. So yet again shouldn't this opportunity go to someone deserves it and will be able to provide them with more customers. 

On the other side I think I should go because:
1. This is one of those opportunities that does not happen often and if I dont go I know I will feel regret for missing out. 
2. My bf always complained that I dont do much with my life and I feel like I should go so he wont be thinking ""oh she missed another event and decided to stay home"" I know it is silly too because we broke and I should think only about my self and my decisions but thats just how my head works always thinking about the people closest to me. Like not letting someone down, my mum told me I should not miss a chance like this.

The thing is that I don't know how to turn it off, I have no control over it and it's getting harder and harder to be present, it's like I'm living more in that world than in this one. It's my own fault, indeed, because I let this happen. But now I realized the harm I'm doing to myself and I want to stop because I'm missing many things, since I'm in my world, not here. I don't have a good control of my emotions either, my emotional intelligence is like in an embryonic state and it's quite hard to admit this at 24 years old. In several months, I'm going to take a very important exam and I'm scared that I can't control my own feelings about that, about stress, that every little detail makes me overthink and destabilises my inner self.

456,"First of all, I am sorry for my english as english is not my first language. and also, sorry for the long post. Back story, I was adopted by my biological father’s sister. She paid my family around $200. My family was reluctant to give me away.   
 

Growing up with her, I was beaten for not getting the first place in class. For spilling drinks. For playing around as a kid. All this happened when my late adoptive father was working. I still remember hiding under the dining table bracing for my dear life because she was angry that I drank her drink (not alcohol, I think it was coffee.) After she had enough of beating me, she would lock me up inside the bathroom with the lights switched off. My teacher once pulled me aside because I have bruise marks all over my body. And I just said that I was okay. I thought it was the norm for being beaten.   
 

After my adoptive father passed away, things took turn for the worse. Every morning, she would splash me with hot water to wake me up for school. This would carry on until my teenage years. Once I hit 15, I started to rebel a bit. That caused her to lash out even more, chasing me with meat cleaver inside the house. After graduating school, I started to look for jobs with odd hours, just to get away from her. Then she forced me to work with the government, of which I did just to comply with her orders. I started paying bills for the house. But she wanted more and more. As if my effort wasn’t enough. This was when I was 22. I took smoking as a stress reliever (i’m trying to quit now)  
 

Then come one day, she called my biological brother (same father, different mother. and I did not grow up with him. We are not even close) to the house. She told him that I was smoking and that she wanted him to teach me a lesson. Of which he did, he hit me on my head and at my spine. Causing me to have headaches for a few days.   
 

Whenever I am out with my niece, just to pass the time, both my adoptive mother and my brother would call me non stop demanding me to come home. Until one day, my brother started to send me threatening messages to murder me. That was the day I decided to get out of the house. I lodged a report on him with the text messages as evidence. Even the officers advised me not to come home. But at that time I was still working with the government. They would come to my office, and drag me home. Telling the upper management how much of a rebel I am, and just showing how good they are. Of course, they believed them more than me as I am just a kid to their eyes. I managed to run away again, and this time I stayed under the radar for 3 years. But I am still in a good relationship with my real biological family, they said it’s okay for me to choose my own life outside.   
 

I had to quit my job with the government because they would call my boss every single day. I had to cut off my relations with my nieces because I do not trust anyone at this point.  
 

But yesterday, she found me. Forcing me to come home. I am now 26 with anxiety and depression. I am in desperate need of advice.",23Dec2019,1

Hello,

I am an Australian male of 20 years of age. I wish to join the protest for two reasons:

And we talked about very deep things and both had many things in common but we also had light debates which was AMAZING. We also gave eachother new perspectives, it's like we've known eachother forever. I felt confident and open with his and he was constantly reassuring me he felt the same and it wasnt in my head. We hung out till 4 am in his car and talked about every and anything but he broke the news thatd hed be going back home which isnt in this content. 
We kissed made out ect and before I left we hugged for minutes and he exhaled deeply as if he were really enjoying it.
We hung out today and did the same, but we also hooked up. It was like nothing I've ever experienced I have a lot of sexual awkwardness and I usually never take all my clothes off but I let him undress me and I felt so comfortable and we were both very pleased. This time when he dropped me off it was a sad vibe and he said when he comes back he really wants to see me again. I aggred and we joked saying see you in 2 years. He said he didnt want to seem weird but this brief interaction was special. And I agreed . Now hes gone and 
I'm sexually frustrated again I think, but I dont want to sleep with anybody that doesnt give me the feeling I just had with this guy. And I'm considering deleting tinder cause I know nothing is going to compare.
What's wrong with me?

TL;DR: Met an AMAZING guy on tinder we talked for hours was incredible and special but he went back to the continent he lives in now I'm sexually frustrated and want to give up on dating because I know itll be while till I find that connection I had with him.",23Dec2019,1

473,"I have a brother in law who is at least 160kg. Of fat. He has ulcerative colitis, crohns disease, a thyroid disease &amp; lupus. He has had a surgery on (what's left of) his bowels pretty much every year for the past 5 years. He had a colostomy bag for a few years. He's on loads of medications, addictive painkillers &amp; often antibiotics for bowel infections. 

Hes a happy and upbeat guy. Probably because he eats is feelings. His family don't talk about it. They're just like ""Keep up your fluids, Tom!"" But he is drinking 2 litres of Coke every day, never water. He will only eat a half size portion of his dinner so that he can fit in a lot of dessert instead. His mom feeds him cake and cookies that she bakes often. 

Then they all sympathize with him ""Oh he's so sick, oh, getting so much surgery is tiring, oh, having so many illnesses is exhausting.."" 

I'm sitting there like ""Hol' up."" Youre enabling him. You feed him junk. You never comment or talk about the complete garbage he eats all day every day. He's going to an early grave because he inhales pizzas, Coke, chocolate &amp; fried chicken all day, every day but no one wants to acknowledge the elephant in the room - he's killing himself. It drives me mad. 

Sometimes he'll say ""I could never go on one of those strict healthy diets."" Or ""I'm too fat to do [insert any activity].""

Hes literally in hospital at least once a year for  surgery or infections. If he was injecting recreational drugs into his arms that put him in hospital for two weeks every year then wouldn't people intervene? If he was drinking so much alcohol that he was hospitalized wouldn't people encourage him to get help? See a psychologist? 
But because it's food it's somehow different.

Anyway, he's only my brother in law so there's only so much I can say but I find it so hard to sit by and watch and no one does anything. 
He needs to eat salads, cut the crap out, STOP INGESTING 500G OF SUGAR EVERY DAY and his diseases will improve. Autoimmune diseases seem to see the biggest improvements with diet changes - no sugar, no gluten, no dairy - and you can achieve a symptom-free life with these illnesses. But it's like he's treated as the victim of this situation and this sickness is thrust upon him outside of his control. Even though he's morbidly obese.

I looked up all the things she did to me (blowing air on my parts, fingering (I believe, though the memory is a bit blurry) calling me sexy, commenting on my body and weight almost all the time, peeking when I was in the bathroom (both mom and dad did it) and walking around the house either with underwear or naked, and when I got my first period, my mom helped me put on the pad on my underwear, but i was naked (only my towel covered me) but why couldn’t she just tell me how to do it? Why did she have to see my underwear and probably my parts? Besides, she often talks about her sex life, A LOT, actually: she tells me what she likes when having sex, what she doesn’t, and so on. Even though she says she’s not attracted to anyone at the moment. Why is she telling me this? 
That’s been going on ever since I was little.
To this day, my mom comments on my body and walks around with nothing on.
I told my psychologist about all of this, but she says that it’s not sexual abuse since they didn’t force me to touch their genitals, that it wasn’t sex at all. That maybe my mom blew air on my parts because she was trying to dry my genitals.
My dad almost always was in boxers (up until I was 12) and my mom told me that he peeked through the door of the bathroom when I showered. As this is a flashback I just got a few days back, I haven’t told my psychologist.
I don’t know if I’m overreacting, or maybe I’m not. I decided to ask here, since I’ll get an unbiased opinion. What should I do?

We’ve had our serious moments where rank  at work crosses personal lines and we have to bring things back into line with reality. But other than that we’ve a very happy, monogamous and trusting relationship. Neither of us have had more than 3 sexual partners. 

Fast forward to this week, we’re on a cruise in Australia and I’ve met this (26M) Switzerland guy on crew who I have loved talking too and hanging out with. (We have signed the papers which allow this) 

Drinking last night I found a bit more liquid courage and I asked my boyfriend what he thought about me being a little flirty towards the guy. To my surprise, my boyfriend didn’t seem to mind at all and even expressed permission.

Drinking tonight we hung out with the guy again and I noticed myself and partner being very forward, open and flirtatious with eachother and crew member. 

Laying in bed tonight, my partner makes several jokes about asking him back to the room to play cards, and continue drinks here in the room tomorrow night. I know this is him again expressing his interest in fun together with our new friend.

486,"My best memories go from the earliest I can remember to age 6. I was a part of a commune, where I had tons of friends, I was surrounded by loving people, and I constantly went on adventures. In my mind those were the happiest years of my life, it all went downhill from there after we left. I still have a strong connection to all the people I grew up with, even if I haven't seen some in close to a decade, they feel like they're my siblings. We've all literally been born and raised together.

Anyway, I found documents from my first psychiatrist visit ever from when I was around 13 I think and I read them out of curiosity. And in the document they quickly went over my history, so obviously they mentioned that I grew up in that place, then it mentioned that the place is a recognised cult in my country. My heart sank. A cult? I watch true crime videos all the time, I pretty much know by heart the story of every infamous cult, and my commune was nothing like that. There wasn't anything shady going on, no one was abused, we just believed something that's a little different (spiritually).

So I googled it. My heart still can't stop pounding, I feel like I'm about to break down. I recognise all the names in the articles, the lawsuits, everything. Even my mom's name is in some of them. I've found out about things I obviously didn't know as a toddler. I feel like my whole childhood is a lie. And I'm a terrible person for looking fondly back at those days.... am I one? like I said those were the happiest years of my life and yet apparently all those years I was in a cult. What am I supposed to gather from that? I feel empty",23Dec2019,1

Tonight we talked for 5 hours straight and it felt so nice catching up and joking around together again. At the end of the call I asked him not to block me again but of course he did.

Hello all, first of all I'd like to say that this is my first time posting so I am not sure whether this is the right subreddit. If it is, please let me know!

I am 21M living in Germany. In Germany there's a system called Ausbildung, to sum it up real quick, you start working normally with a small amount of salary and go to school at the same time \[usually lasts up to 3 years\] , where you learn things related to the job you do. This summer were the final exams, which I failed. I saw all my friends pass, while I wasn't even close to passing. Failing once wasn't a big deal for me.. as long as I don't repeat the same mistakes again. And here I am, repeating the same mistakes again. I took the other exams which were last month. Today I received the results. I didn't only fail, but this time the results were even worse than last time. At this point I don't know what to do. I get the chance to take the exams for the last time, but I will have to wait another 6 months total. Studying has always been like hell to me, and I really don't want to imagine having to go through all that again. I really feel like quitting. But if I quit, probably no company will take me knowing I tried 3 and a half years of Ausbildung and quit. I do international trade, logistics and I was really looking going abroad once I finish. But in order to do that you do need some sort of certificate.. which I don't have. I have always been someone who ends up quitting in the end. I only care about leaving from this country and going abroad, that's all that matters to me. I just want to leave everything behind and start over a new life. Should I quit and look for a chance to work abroad without any certificate? Should I go the risky way?",23Dec2019,1
490,"About a decade ago, I temporarily moved to the other side of the country for about two years before moving back to my old town. 

My new school was OK... I was a complete joke/outcast the first half of those two years but I eventually made friends in the second half. (Just to be clear, I moved in the middle of the school year, finished the next school year, and moved away again in the middle of the following school year.)

Ever since about a year ago, I found some of my old friends on social media, but I feel intimidated looking at their stuff because they feel like they've really changed since we last saw each other. 

I hear stories about people just messaging their old friends to say hi and explain who they are, but I'm not sure if I should bother trying to reach out. Their friendships meant a lot to me in my last year there but I am willing to let it go if they aren't as receptive. I don't want to seem like I'm super clingy for someone that's only been in their lives for such a short time a long time ago and it would be embarrassing if they don't recognize me.

I'm a shy and anxious person, so I just want to know what's the best way I could do this or if I should just let this all go. So, any advice on what I should do? Even an assurance or putting this idea down would do.",23Dec2019,1

500,"My (27m) relatively new girlfriend (25f) has been through some tough experiences of sexual and emotional abuse.

She was getting help and counselling for it but is no longer doing that as she says it dident help her and she absolutely refuses the go back.

I don't know if that's a bad thing but she makes her own choices I can't make them for her...

So most of the time her mental state is what I would say (and I'm not a professional or whatever) is of sound or clear mind

But there are times when I can tell because it's so obvious that she's clearly not ok ... so for an example sometimes when I come home late and she's already in bed going to sleep she'll awake to me hoping into bed and she'll ask me in a very stressed voice ""are we gonna have sex ?"" "" are you gonna do anything"" ""when can I go to sleep?"" ""Please let me sleep more"" Or something along those lines and she says it very rushed like she's instantly panicking or something and when I reply with ""no it's ok go back to sleep"" or I always say something like that anyway. She'll roll back over and says everytime like every night without fail ""if you're gonna have sex with me please wake me up first""

This disturbs me greatly and I've talked multiple times with her and told her I'd never do anything she dident want to do and I'd never do anything while she was sleeping. She seems to get it and is completely fine throughout the day it's just at night when we're going to sleep she seems to forget everything I've told her and maybe forgets who I am ? It's especially bad when she's already asleep by the time I come to bed ( which is often because I work late shifts )

I can't cuddle her or anything at night because she'll either freeze up or freak out. I try my best to calm her and explain I'm just going to sleep and everything

During the day she's the opposite she's all over me and super comfortable in my presence we have sex during the day no problem and she loves it

I just wanna know like what else can I do to comfort her through the night ? What should I be doing that I might not be ?

And also should I be trying to convince her to go back into therapy or should I just leave it ?

I'm just trying to be a good boyfriend and I want to do the right thing I'm just not very experienced in things like this

I mentioned to my girl I can Uber to a movie theater and go to Star Wars so she can go out and do last minute holiday shopping/hang out with her family. She doesn’t like that idea and says I should stay home and do nothing until everyone comes back

508,"Hello, I am a Muslim 16-year-old and my parents are getting a divorce. I am not superstitious nor am I religious. However, there are certain things happening that are suspicious which makes me slightly concerned for my family and my mother believes it is because of black magic sourced by my father. 

Around the first few months, after my parents agreed on getting a divorce, my mother found a water bottle labelled ""Drink"" and a list of steps/ingredients on a small piece of paper. My mother immediately contacted her friend that works at a mosque and a couple of others more to ask them about what she found. All of them replied that the steps written and the waterbottle correspond with a certain spell or ritual one must take to cast black magic. I forgot what it was called but basically, it makes my family obey my father despite us hating him, like a mind control kind of thing. I didn't know how my mother responded to that but I know she was really unhappy. We found the water bottles, poured the water out and poured in tap water to be safe. 

After that, I accidentally saw him praying in front of his bedroom door. Let me repeat: he was *praying in front of his bedroom door.* Alarms were ringing in my head then and contacted my mother about it since she was at work. When Muslims pray, we pray in the direction of the Qibla and his door definitely does not face the Qibla. My mother theorised that it is one of his black magic rituals but we still aren't sure. My brother saw it too. 

Now, we are all having trouble sleeping. Been happening for months. You may blame it on stress but my mother, brother and I are having trouble sleeping at the same time. I have no school because of holidays or any problems happening currently so I am definitely not stressed. When my father comes home, he goes into the house incredibly slowly. So slow that it takes, I guess, half a minute or even a minute to open the door. It's like he's welcoming another presence here. I'm not sure what's next but I am not waiting for it to get worse. 

My father is a ***bastard***, that's all I know. He is making the divorce case incredibly difficult by delaying it. I am not superstitious nor am I religious but if he harms my loved ones, I damn well will fight back. If anyone knows anything but black magic, perhaps similar cases like these, or have dealt with one before, please do advise me on how to deal with it or how I can protect my family.

510,"I was doing an online course on an online course platform which can be mapped as credits, but it released the certificate pretty late. It seems like generally the school office would expect submissions to be made earlier in the semester, maybe November or even early December so they can process the transcripts. 
However I messed up and submitted my certificate just today. I saw an email saying that if I didn't sent it in this morning, they would not count my module as credit for this semester, as the exam results are released tomorrow. I'm devastated because I need this module to graduate this semester and it would be so terrible and such a failure on my if I had to pay school fees for another semester to take one module. Also I don't have the best financial situation and I really don't think I should do that if I can avoid it.

I know I messed up, but in my head it's not that big a deal because they can always just process it any day even if it's late and I can get my credits to graduate. I didn't think the results release tomorrow would be a giant hurdle for that because this module didn't involve exams, I just need the credits mapped.

If they tell me that I sent in late so it can't be helped, I think I'll probably go down to my faculty office to ask for help, but I'd just like to ask if it would be too much if I asked them to help me map it over despite sending it late? To me it seems like it's pretty arbitrary and as long as I have proof I took this module it should be fine. I feel like it would be petty to hold a student from graduation and make them pay another semester of fees because of this.

512,"I am a male, 15 years of age now.

I know that this is a huge amount of text to read, but I would appreciate if you could read it and try to give me advice on what I should do now.

Ever since a young child i’ve always been very interested in sex and genitals. I remember the kids in my neighbourhood who were 1-3 years older than me showing me porn when I was the age of 6. I remember when they used to dry hump their younger sisters and I would join in, I was at oldest 6 and their sisters were at oldest 5. I remember getting one of them to strip in front of me for stickers. I moved out soon after. 

Now, at age 8-9 (I don’t remember) I rested my hand on my cousin’s butt (she is 2 years younger me, so she was around 6-7). I didn’t squeeze but I think it would be classified as groping. This was definitely NOT a regular occurrence. It happened at least once though. 

I dry-humped her when I turned 14. It was my birthday and my cousins slept over. The same cousin was on the mattress with me. I was sure she was sleeping and rested my groin area onto her butt (clothes on). She was 12 and I was 14. I ejaculated from masturbating to her butt. (I didn’t ejaculate from physical contact).

Another case  was when I had turned 12 (a few months after my birthday passed), distant cousins came over for around 3 days. There were two siblings, one was around 5-6 who actually put her panties down in front of me without me asking (Looking back at it, I think they knew what sex was) and her older sister (who was around 8-9-10) just started giggling. I did not do anything with the youngest sibling and actually lead her out of the room. I did not have any sexual temptations with her AT ALL. However, the older sibling (8-9-10 years old, I was 12) once was searching for something that was besides my bed and I was laying with my back facing the mattress and on my tablet looking up. She went onto me in a sexual position. We dry humped in that position throughout the  day and the next two days after that, under some sort of dry humping game. I remember her searching for something underneath my bed and I dry humped her from behind. She enjoyed it and wanted more... It only lead to dry humping with our clothes on and I made sure I kept it that way with our clothes on. But I was definitely expecting her to dry hump me. They came a year later and I had turned 13, the older sibling tried to play the dry humping game again but I refused and was concerned so I told her it was wrong to do and never did it again - I was thinking about it a lot throughout that year.

Another incident is when I was also around 11/12 and my little cousin, who was at most 5, was dry humped by me as well. I remember once she was uncomfortable and I stopped. I can just imagine how confused she was and how scared she felt. Her favourite cousin making her feel so weird and strange. Before that incident I had dry humped her at age 9-10, when she was around 4, at least 3 times - also under a ‘game’. Showing my manipulative, creature-like behaviour.

I am now 15. Over the past year I have learned a lot and made new friends who have guided me the right way in life and I have finally started reaching a truly happy state of mind aside from my deepest and darkest regret, which is this. I still have anxiety (self-diagnosed, although my cousins say I most likely have OCD related anxiety since I have a lot of obscure compulsive habits as a result of worry). Music has been the main thing that has helped me open my eyes and whenever I do listen to any music with meaningful lyrics (especially Baby don’t cry by 2pac which touches the topic of a 13 year old girl struggling from rape) I reflect on these disgusting, monstrous crimes and sins I had done to such innocent family members. I know that I have changed but that will never justify shit. I have began turning my faith to God, or more - the idea that I can also change for the better, that my cousins can indeed have reassurance that I am no longer a sex-driven child. I would never ever do this to a child or anyone. I move away when girl relatives come too near me and am paranoid about this sometimes, but it hasn’t impacted me socially, I even had a healthy relationship with a girl. Despite this, I know I can never ever justify what I did, ever, because the reality is this can definitely harm them in the future. I brought this onto them. I had the choice not to. I did this. I want to apologise to them but I don’t know if they remember or want to be reminded of it, but that’s also not 100% the reasoning for why I won’t apologise, it is also because I am a coward. I just can’t even think of ever talking to them about this, I have absolutely no right to even propose any discussion about what I brought to their lives. 

Thank you for reading, please do not refrain from being brutal about anything. I need to grow from this and work towards building enough courage to apologise. I want to make sure that they don’t suffer any mental health issues or a struggle to fit in.

513,"I have a wristband that is of great personal value and I would like to prevent possible damage to it. The problem is that the wristband itself is not of the highest quality and I have a dog that is constantly trying to chew it. For now, I wear a watch (also with a silicone band, though a little tighter) so he can't bite into it right away, but it's not very secure.

I'm looking for a definitive way of keeping it from tearing. So far I've only found advice on how to clean your wristband, and I'm not sure about some of the methods described (like using both hot and cold water with soap) because my wristband is much thinner than the most (0.5cm wide, about 0.1cm height (or depth? Not sure what it's called)). Ideally, I want some sort of casing to put it in, but that probably doesn't exist.

Jake and my GF have been friends for years, but I didn’t know him personally, I just knew that they were good friends but I never had any interest in meeting him because of some childish reasons I don’t wanna mention.

My GF and I had some problems last summer, we even broke up for a bit, now we’re good but still working on it. I made some mistakes and we’re trying to fix them.

She’s currently visiting me, but her friend Jake is very sick, in hospital and undergoing a rough treatment. It’s unexpected and life threatening. She’s spent some time with me, but goes to his hospital quite often, takes care of him and spends time there. He moved to this city a few months ago, but has lots of friends so he’s not alone or anything.

I was outside and they were looking at some photos of themselves (around the time we started dating but weren’t serious yet), and there was one where she was sitting on his knees/lap, and they said that was their remake after the [whistle scene](https://youtu.be/30DSfAA0brs) in this movie because they kinda look and were dresseed similar to the actors.

I connected the dots and started thinking that they had a thing in the past. I was her first serious BF and first sexual partner, and the only past thing she said she had was with a friend she went out a few times and they only kissed.

I told her I felt uncomfortable and she only said “When we were broken up, Jake was the only one who told me to get back to you.”

I was relatively popular at my old school, but I was almost like the unpopular popular kid. I had a bunch of good friends but never really got to be super close to them, but with her already, this is the closest I’ve ever been in a friendship. I have told her that she is easily my best friend at the school too. And so that’s what I’m worried about. I think she is really beautiful and has everything I could ever want in a girlfriend, but I’m too damn scared to lose my best friend.

522,"When I was a freshman in high school, I became involved with a guy who will be called Brian. We started dating when I was a sophomore, and Brian is two and a half years older than me. We were together for six months before things started to get shaky. We would get into petty arguments, and it seemed that the only thing that made it stop was if I cried. Otherwise, he would keep going on and on. A few months after that, our petty arguments were no longer him just yelling at me. He became violent. He always told me it was my fault, and when he became violent, it was only because he wanted to make me better. There were many times that he would lock me in his closet or cut my hips with a pocket knife or just hurt me, all to make me ""better."" Things progressively became worse. When I was 16, he raped me. He left sometime before I turned 18 after being emotionally unable to deal with him anymore. 

We were together for a little over two years. I have had almost zero contact with him since he left. What happened with Brian really messed me up, and I've been seeing a counselor for a year trying to work through everything that happened and untangle the mess we had. 

As far as I know, Brian has not had a stable relationship with anyone since we broke up. I know he dated a friend of a friend, but it ended quickly. I saw on Instagram (I really need to delete that app) from a friend of a friend that he's with someone else. He should be about 23 now, and the girl he's dating is a junior in high school. Unless she was held back, juniors are about 16-17 years old. 

I try not to be nosey or involved in other people's lives, but I've always felt extremely guilty that I never turned him in. He was 18 when he raped me, and if I had gone to the cops, he could have been sent to prison. I didn't because I thought I was in love, and he really was trying to make me better. The optimist in me wants to believe he's changed, and I definitely don't want to ruin anything if he has. But she's so young, and I knew a very dark side of him. If anything were to happen to her, I feel like it would be my fault. I thought if I messaged her, I could shed some of the blame if anything were to happen. But, when I was in her shoes, someone tried to warn me. I didn't believe them, and it only drove me toward him more. I don't want to make things worse, but at the same time I feel so guilty.

The past 2 years I've learned my parents keep me in a bubble. It feels like they don't act like themselves around me. If I hear them talking about something together, I'll walk into the room and they immediately change their tone and topic. I'm not trusted to hear what they are saying for some reason. Whenever me and my brother are together with them they put on a happy face and act all happy instead of how they feel in that moment. This has been a tremendous struggle for my brother and I when we have issues we don't know how to solve on our own. I have tried talking to them about some issue I had at work or something at school but i feel like they immediately pass it off as nothing. They always try and give a solution to my problem instead of listening to me and understanding why I feel a certain way. 
Now you may be thinking ""don't you want a solution?"" The answer would be yes but all I want them to do is pay attention to what I'm saying and understand me. I feel I can solve problems by my self. I want them to guide me to the correct answer o stead of talking me to do something without explanation. They always think they have the right answer when on reality they sent there with me at work or at school to see what I'm talking about. In other words they don't understand the context of my scenario before giving me advice. It's like they don't listen. They just want to get it over with. They always sa y ""you can talk to us about anything"" but really I cannot without becoming more frustrated. I am not happy at the moment and I do not know what to do. I've tried to explain this to them before and all they do is turn it on themselves and worry about what they did wrong in raising me. They don't worry about the problem I came to them with. It may sound selfish but I thought I could talk to them about my problems without creating another one entirely.

539,"Hey guys, 
Just looking for some advice, my boyfriends dad  has just taken in a new golden lab from one of their neighbours. I have a really good relationship with bfs dad and he still lives with his parents so I’m in their house a lot. 
The dog (Rocky) belonged to a neighbours who had asked the dad to take care of Rocky for a few weeks whilst he visited relatives in India. A few weeks passed and there was no word, and to cut a long story short they ended up giving Rocky away so of course bfs dad agreed to take him in after forming a close bond with him. 

A little background on Rocky, he is still a puppy, under a year old (can’t remember exactly) and he is one of the most lively and excitable dogs I’ve ever met. He constantly jumps up and does dog zoomies. He misbehaves a lot and has trouble listening and being told what to do. When in contact with other dogs he jumps up at them and (not sure if intentionally) scratches them and tries to go for the dogs by biting them (not play fighting). He has a lot of energy but he is walked at least twice a day. 
Before Rocky ended up with us, the family he belonged to made him sleep outside, would rarely show him attention, and he was incredibly skinny. The owner use to take him to be a stud because he was interested in the money even though Rocky is still very young.
This is obviously fucking awful and when Rocky began to get treated properly he didn’t understand and was confused about being loved like a dog should be. 

The advice I’m looking for, is that the dad does not understand how to talk to and train a dog. Instead of being firm and repeatedly keeping up steady forms of punishment for bad behaviour (e.g. making Rocky sit in his bed) the dad shouts and yells at the dog (obviously putting it into a frenzy) and he doesn’t hit it but taps his nose or gives him a light smack (the dog never yelps). The dad responds with anger/emotion which prevents Rocky from being able to clearly understand what he’s doing wrong.
I’m worried that in his formative years Rocky won’t develop a good sense of authority and will continue misbehaving, he won’t be able to socialise with other dogs and he does hurt you with all the jumping up. 

I don’t want to overstep my boundaries and tell the dad what to do, I don’t want to disrespect him, but also I know if this keeps happening the dog is not going to get any better. How should I handle this ?

I’ll try to make this short. Basically, 2-3 years ago I had a friend I use to hang with daily. He was a drug addict, but it wasn’t obvious as he was working for Amazon and pretty successful. He’s tried to offer me things like oxy, meth, shrooms, etc., but drugs aren’t my thing, at least not that hard stuff. We did try the shrooms once and it was one of the worst trips I’ve ever had. He kept pointing out my fat, my scars, and telling me I need to squat more. He also tried to put me in a triangle chokehold. I kept saying, ‘no..’ but he started moving furniture out of the way, and I was really scared. He then tried to kill him self. Over bitcoins. The whole ordeal was disastrous and after a year friendship, I saw a side of him I never want to see in another person again. On drugs or sober. We hung out a couple of times afterwards, and at some point he said to me, “we should have sex.” And kept trying to push the subject after I said no. I dropped him. I owed him money, but my new job at the time didn’t pay new employers for a month when they start the job. He knew I couldn’t pay him till a certain date, and proceeded to threaten to sue me. I was maybe 18/19, so I had no idea how getting she’d worked and I was very nervous. He also insinuated people in our friend group wanted to r*pe me. All that passed, I paid his money back, he tried to act like we were friends still, and I moved on.

As the title suggests, my roommate seems to be doing terrible things to my controller. To give some context I've lived with this guy for years on and off, our living room is where our gaming happens (my ps4 as well as his desktop computer) and for awhile ive noticed that when im away for extended periods of time or am asleep, my controller is drastically moved from its location I set it down at, and on several occasions....it had scraggly hairs on it that aren't mine when I found it moved. To give further context this guy is non confrontational and does everything indirect if he can to get back at someone (whether that be work or at home as I've worked with him before as well) and will deny every accusation thrown at him, like a child, even if all evidence points towards him being the perpetrator, for instance he has denied belching right behind my head while passing by the couch I'm sitting on and passed it off as ""the sound of him opening his water bottle"". With that said it's pointless to even bring up why my stuff is moved as he will deny it to no end, I have regardless asked him why it's been tampered with and of course he won't own up to it. A couple weeks ago I was sleeping and was woken up by the sound of specifically two control sticks being moved side to side frantically (as if someone's rubbing the main part of it against something) and immideatly got up and went out there, sure enough my controller was sitting right next to him on the couch when I for sure set it on the glass table. So I did the reasonable thing, grabbed my controller and took it with me to be put beside my pillow as I slept, not even two minutes pass and he sends me a threatening message over Facebook messenger saying that if I can't trust him with my stuff then I need to move out.....i left the room and actually had to leave my controller out there and also apologise or else I was going to be kicked out. I'm not on the lease as he refused to sign the final paperwork, so I don't actually know if he can do that under the circumstances. Ever since then though my controller is moved on the daily, especially days where I piss him off, I'm getting tired of having to take a wet wipe to my controller just to be able to play my games, and it's even effecting me at work since I'm not there to watch my stuff.

So I'm 19, I'm in university, and I live at home with my single mother. She's not abusive, She goes on business trips for approx. 1/4 of the year and I would rather save my money than spend it on rent and utilities, which is why I haven't moved out. 

Now most of the time, my mother is fine with me drinking and going to concerts and whatnot. So you would think that she would be fine with me doing those things by myself, right? Nope. Not at all. I, a grown-ass woman, cannot go to a concert by myself. I won't be drinking, the concert starts at 8:15pm and probably won't go any later than 9:30pm. I live in a fairly safe city, and even if I didn't, I am trained in martial arts and carry a knife. So why exactly am I not allowed to go alone? Because she doesn't trust that I can take care of myself and no amount of evidence to the contrary will change her mind. At this point in my relationship with my mother, I'm not even bothered to argue the point with her anymore, it's just much easier to lie.

So my question is what can I tell my mother I'm doing? Also, keeping in mind these things:

* none of my friends like going clubbing and she knows that
* a bunch of my friends are overseas/interstate for the holidays

TL;DR - I need an excuse for coming home @ like 10:30pm even though I'm an adult.",23Dec2019,1

553,"Ive been working on his small IT company for nearly 3 years now, my plan was to only work for a year just to gain experience. But i fell in love with my work so i stayed this long. he pretty much taught me everything i know. This is my first actual job since i graduated. The workplace is great, coworkers are fine but the salary is a bit low, the rest is good.

Lately hes been sharing hes plans for next year in how the company will be expanding, hes plans for new projects etc, ill be playing a big role in this expansions.  Another reason why its hard to leave. 

Im planning on resigning next year, and will look for a job in the city. The salary difference is huge, extremely huge since were at the province.even if i ask a raise the amount wont even come close to the salary given in the city. 

im quite not sure how to say it. My conscience is giving me hard time.

Will quit my job next year for a better paying job. How do i say im quitting to my kind boss who taught me everything i know.",23Dec2019,1
554,"A while ago.. I was really hurted about what my co-interns has said to me i am. Mentally unstable but I'm still working as an intern in a psychiatric clinic and what we usually do there is dance and entertain the patients. 

So a while ago, it's our Christmas party and since i am mentally unstable I cannot dance infront of people without uneasy stomach. now my two co-interns approach me and said ""meichan(not my real name), you didn't dance"" with a judgemental look in their eyes. He turned around and said to my other co-intern in front of me ""meichan is already satisfied with a grade of 74 joy""  100 is the highest, 75 is almost failed, 74 is failed. He said, ""meichan you didn't do group dynamics, you do not dance every zumba (eventhough I did!)"" and my other co-intern said.. ""yes, you will fail this practicum and do it again"" and they said that in front of our group and the other girl who always go to me whenever she have nobody antagonize them and said ""hey don't do that to meichan she will cry!"" and both of them said ""that's just a joke hahahahahaha don't cry! joy"" it makes me feel horrible.. It feels like eventhough they knew I'm mentally unstable they will still not understand and bully me and they treat me like stupid like.. 

""come on you wanna talk to meichan and have a therapy with her? joy"" thank God I'm already finished with that practicum everyday is hell.",23Dec2019,1
555,"Hey Reddit. I'm trying to keep it short. 

So, mother is rather conservative, not the really bad kind, she's really into the myth of how women should be and what's good for a woman.

I'm a ""woman"", but not that kind. Not at all. I'm a nerd, I wear baggy pants and nerd shirts with gaming stuff on it. All my clothes are either black or dark gray. 

Whenever we meet, she comments my poor choice of clothing. Things like ""Did you really have to wear that now?"" ""Don't you have better shoes?"" ""Why do you wear that?"" ""You should throw this away.""

Then she gifts me things. Things that I hate. Very feminine stuff with colors I hate. Stuff I would never wear and she KNOWS. I swear to all that is holy, she knows. But she's always like ""But I thought it's your style and the price was good and I really thought you need new (whatever)"". 

I always tell her to stop it. To not gift me these things. I hate them. She knows. They don't fit me anyway. There were moments when I really burst out in anger because I. Don't. Want. Her. Forced. Gifts. 

I have a boyfriend for 10 months now, and we'll spend Christmas at his family's home. I'll meet his family for the first time (they life far away). 

My mother kept pestering me for weeks what I'll gonna wear, if I have NICE shoes, if I'm gonna wear that thing she thought I was pretty in, if I want to go to the hairdresser, when I'm going to the hairdresser, what clothes, when hairdresser, what clothes, when hairdresser. And then she made appointments for a hairdresser which I really didn't care about. 

Whenever she does this, it hurts me badly. I avoid her as good as possible. I don't want to meet her anymore. Everytime we see each other, she either has something to say, or she one if her infamous gifts. 

I almost always cry later. For a long time. She doesn't accept me and what I need. I could totally need money for groceries or painkillers for my chronic pain, I'm basically walking around with crippling pain for weeks now because I'm broke. There's so much I'd be so happy to get. But what does she gift me? Shoes again, clothes again, ugly shit I will never wear.

Also, I'm a fucking recovering hoarder. Yes, I was the bad kind. I chose to live in a small apartment, I chose to have little space, I chose to have only one small space for my clothes. It's very hard for me to keep track of what I have, and it's very hard to throw things away. 

She basically, not only hurts me deeply, she also really makes my small chosen space fill up too quickly with useless stuff I can't throw away that easily.

I'm tired. Talking doesn't help. She doesn't listen. She plays the victim, she asks why I am so difficult and ungrateful. Help me please. What should I do to make her stop? Should I shout at her? Stop contact? Throw all the shit in front of her door? I don't know anymore. I cried for the past 4 hours non-stop and I'm just tired and hurt.",23Dec2019,1
556,"Ok, so I'm 19 y/o and I'm one of those people, who hate asking for help, but I feel that now I could use some. Let me start off by saying that I just graduated from high school, passed my exams and everything looked great. The problem is that only place I see myself is in military, but when I tried to get into military academy I failed my medical test, and felt devastated, but managed to move on, worked abroad in a slaughterhouse for 4 months and thought it would help me to forget, start a new chapter. Now that I'm home again, I feel that nothing makes me happy, I lost interest in anything, except exercising, because only while doing it I feel like doing something worthly again. Recently I saw and article about french foreign legion, and became obssesed with it, because I feel that it would give me a reason to live. So, I need for someone's, who's been in a situation like this, advice, what should I do? should I do something as drastic as joining french foreign legion, or should I stay here, with my friends and family and live for others, ignoring my own passions?",23Dec2019,1
557,"I’m 29 F and my metabolism feels like it has started to slow down, and I’ve been gaining weight consistently.  I don’t know what to do anymore.  This all started after a cough I had for 6 months.  It was difficult to diagnose, took 6 doctors, and I tried many different medications.  One doctor put me on steroids for 2 months.  I gained a ton of weight rapidly (20 lbs in 2 months, now I’m up 30 lbs from what I used to be).  I finally figured out it was cough-variant asthma after 6 months and the cough stopped immediately, but ever since, my body hasn’t been right.  

I keep trying to diet and restrict what I eat, but I can’t lose weight at all.  I just keep gaining, and I can’t afford to keep buying new clothes.  I am also struggling with fatigue, chronic headaches, muscle soreness all over, hair falling out, and constipation.  I already have dietary restrictions since my husband has high cholesterol and a family history of very high cholesterol.  Most of the time we’re eating salads, vegetarian dishes, and mostly chicken and fish rather than eating red meat, a lot of carbs, a lot of sugar, etc.  I’m not cooking with butter or oil.  I’m not using a ton of dairy/cheese either because of the cholesterol.  Just spices.  I feel extremely hungry all the time and get nauseous often.  My husband is losing weight, but I’m just gaining.  

I’ve had my thyroid checked.  My T4 was 1.1 ng/dL, TSH was 1.6 uIU/mL, and T3 was 177 ng/dL.  My doctor says there’s nothing significantly abnormal.  I’ve brought this up with multiple doctors and none of them think anything is wrong.  Any idea of what I can consider/bring up with a doctor?  I feel that there is definitely something wrong, and I hate my life.",23Dec2019,1
559,"I realized that quite often it is helpful to reach out to experienced people to get **feedback, input, knowledge** and **learn**. Nowadays we can easily do this online of course. However, there are vast opportunities to do so: simple Google, access all-knowing online communities like **Reddit** or **Quora** or very specific online communities dedicated to one topic e.g. **cryptocurrency**, remote work, **health**, **nutrition**, etc.

There is also the option of finding online chats or group chats e.g. Telegram. 

Would you suggest to become a master in one large community like Reddit or just post individual posts whenever you need to in individual forums? I believe one will never be part of a community if posting on many different forums.",23Dec2019,1
560,"I would like to start getting up earlier, but I'll need to start going to bed earlier for that. My problem is Reddit. It's hard to put it down. 

I use Reddit in bed every night and I'm up until 2 to 3 am.  That's not so terrible, since I don't *have to* get up until 9ish for work. 

But I want to start getting up earlier, and I don't want to be so controlled by Reddit. The constant new and interesting content is like a drug to me. 

My plan is to ban Reddit from bed, which will be easier said than done. I'm going out today to buy a physical book to read in bed and I plan to get into bed later than usual. I'll get my redditing done in the living room before I go to sleep.

561,"Lately, I’ve been having more consistent dates with women I’m actually attracted to.  Some have gone well others have been complete shit, but c’est la vie. This last date I went in was really nice.  I know first dates aren’t perfect but we talked a lot and she laughed a lot which is usually good, and it wasn’t a pitty laugh she could stop giggling for half a minute. She’s not from the area and English isn’t her first language so there are different social cues right?  Every time I ask if they’d like to go out again, I get ghosted or led on.  I really hit it off with one woman, but she works ridiculous hours, so we could never sync up. I’m all for meeting up at 3am but I can’t keep that up log. Term.

In all of the stupid dating apps I seem to attract the same physical type of woman, petite, cute, Asian girls.   I literally swipe right on everybody, so I don’t know what the deal is.  I have had other matches but only a few dates materialized. But it’s just weird.  Do I just have a type? 

The other issue is that I have feelings for a very close friend (also a cute Asian girl) who is polyamorous, but in a relationship with someone.  But we’re involved so much in each other’s lives since we graduated (never thought we’d love so close together) that it feels like we’re in an accidental relationship. We go on trips together, cook together, bake together, watch tv shows that she says she just watches with me.  I have to credit her with getting me out of a bad funk when we met, I just want to and have always wanted to spend time with her and she has said the same thing.  I love our friendship and it means so much to me but I feel my feelings for her are coloring a lot of what I do in my romantic life.  We’ve had our drunken moment together, but I’ve never wanted to take advantage when she was really drunk. We keep making plans, we have a tripped planned for the spring, and other activities.  I enjoy everything with her so much, it’s hard to pull myself away. 

TL;DR: I can’t seem to read the situation with my dates correctly.  Should I just keep asking for that second date? I also have feelings for my friend which may be skewing my romantic life a bit too much. Do I need to sort that out first or should I tell her how I’m feeling since she’s open to having more than one partner.",23Dec2019,1
562,"So me and my best friend are both (14F). I don’t know how long she’s had this disorder and I don’t know how it started but all I know is that I wanna help. I started to suspect something a few years ago, but I wasn’t sure and she gets really upset when anyone worries about her too much so I didn’t say anything. But my suspicions were confirmed a few months ago. A group of us were out at a skating rink and we were just hanging out. Everything seemed normal, and then we were sitting down, and something happened. I’m not sure what it was. She was just holding her stomach and gagging. We asked her what was wrong and she said that she hadn’t eaten in 2 days.

We got her some plain food and water and had her eat it little by little so that it wouldn’t upset her stomach more. I was upset about it afterwards so I told my grandma and she said she was going to tell my best friends parents. I told her that and she absolutely freaked out. “No no no no please don’t please don’t” etc. we didn’t, but I managed to get her to talk to my grandma instead. 

It seemed like she was getting better for a while, but then she joined the wrestling team at school. Now, a lot of her weight (about 160 pounds) is completely in muscle. She’s been working out constantly since we were about 10. She has to be 150 pounds or less to make it on the team a lot, so she’s stopped eating again. I just really don’t know what to say to her without her getting upset at me.

I’ve known her since we were 7 and I’m really scared. Does anyone know what I should do?

564,"So long story
I moved away and I broke up with my ex on some bad terms; he's like really mentally unstable and I rekindled an old friendship. Well my friend had some how taken a vendetta for me and tried to rouse me into you know pressing charges against my ex. The thing is she ordered something well 3 things by dicks by mail or some shit faked an invoice with my ex's info and thought I won't see past glitter and annoyance. It almost worked but I ordered and received gags by mail and past my initial frustration I noticed an order invoice is odd with those types of boxes. Then I did research and called their customer service, they don't include invoices in their boxes, so apparently my friend ordered them for herself. To one of her addresses because she has more than one home took them out of their original packaging then repackaged them with an invoice with his info on it. Then sent it to me.
Well I thought it was the end of that, but today I had to use her computer and her mail was up and there was a lot of order invoices with my ex's address. Normally I don't care but my ex is again volatile and I don't want it to fall back on me. 
We're not on good terms. I need advice because my friend won't cancel he orders.",23Dec2019,1
565,"F[18] My 18th birthday was yesterday and my emotions were plagued yesterday by me being betrayed in a sense. I just want to know if I have a right to be upset. 

-
Back in August a friend of mine M[17] and I were having a discussion and he revealed that his parents never did anything nice for his birthday. I realize that we shared the same birthday, so I asked him if he wanted to plan a joint party together. Months flew by and we get to December, It wasn’t until I asked for an invite list and he had some people on there who didn’t like me. I was okay with that but then literally after I created invitations he suddenly didn’t want to do the party anymore, so I had a bunch of random cards and wasted money. I asked him why he didn’t want to do it anymore and he said because his friends would have to pay for their meal and if I wasn’t paying for them he didn’t want to do it. I realized that it was his friends who didn’t like me looking for an excuse to not want to share a party with me. I was devastated because you know I really wanted to do something nice for this guy, but I wasn’t going to pay for all of his friends to eat dinner. What makes his birthday different from just a regular get together?? So he tells me he doesn’t want to do a party at all and I’m okay with that you know. 

But then 2 weeks fly by and it’s his birthday. I see him on social media with his friends who don’t like me btw and the guy who I consider my close friend there too at his alleged birthday party. I wasn’t invited and to be honest I was so hurt by this. 

- he lied to me about not wanting to have a party
- I planned this party for like 5 months
- he didn’t plan that party himself, the girl who didn’t like me did
- he literally excluded me from his party
- after that he wished me happy birthday like nothing happened 
- I still had time out with my friends but I couldn’t fully enjoy myself because I felt so disconnected and betrayed 

It’s literally been a day, and I am still deeply upset about it. I unfollowed him, blocked him and I vow to be no longer friends with this guy, I just want to know if I am thinking RATIONALLY.",23Dec2019,1

Does anybody know/have advice for starting off a online shop or where to hold it? More Specifically somewhere that would be able to do print on demand hoodies. I’ve already started off a little on Teespring, but from what I’ve heard they’re not the best especially for printing, as the quality I heard can be bad. I’ve been trying to find the answer through google, but whatever articles are showing up for me aren’t that good.

570,"My oldest brother is 18 years old and has always been highly intelligent. He got top grades in everything at 16 but since he has started college he hasn’t been motivated to do well. He originally started studying four tough subjects and dropped one because it was too difficult.

I think he is depressed or something, he never wakes up earlier than 2pm and doesn’t do anything. When he is awake he is either too tired to talk to anyone or just rude to everyone. Occasionally he is really nice and normal but most of the time he looks tired. sad and angry. He has very important exams coming up soon and he has no motivation to study or do anything. My parents are too busy to deal with hin and don’t have time to assist him. Whenever he is supposed to study I just see him sleeping or playing video games or procastinating. His school and my parents have gave him countless chances to improve and I fear that he may be kicked out of college if he doesn’t improve his work ethic and grades. What can I do? Whenever I try to speak to him about it he snaps at me and gets very irritated. It also seems like he doesn’t socialise with anyone anymore. He doesn’t speak about friends or anything.

So my girlfriend has had a ""pill addiction"" I dont know if it's true or not but she ending quitting the pills apparently and started moving on but her liver was acting up and she needed to get surgery on it. She gets sharp pains in it all the time apparently. But recently I went to her house and she gave me smthin for a headache and I got these really bad sharp pains in my liver. Like how she describes it and I've been sussed out since.

She was supposed to get surgery on her liver 2 weeks ago, but instead she went to some dudes farm then came back and told me the surgery was pushed back. But then she said she had surgery coming up and it jus disappeared never to come back again.  While on this trip her father ""broke out of jail"" and called her bunch. Oh I forgot to mention her father raped her when she was 8. 

NOT EVEN 2 WEEKS LATER BRO, NOT 2 WEEKS LATER. ""I might be moving too (blank) with my father"" But didn't your father break out of prison and the cops are looking for him? Something is so fucking fishy. Okay then just recently she ran out of her house to go to a mall with friends. Got ditched almost got drugged and sexually assaulted and is now having to testify against this same dude.

I’m currently a senior in highschool and I haven’t had a girlfriend for all of my life, to the point where I’m used to it. Sure I’m a bit saddened but other than that as long as I don’t overthink about it I feel fine.

I have however tried once to get together with this one girl but I put all of my emotion and love into trying to get with her. I felt happy all the time and motivated. But that didn’t work out since she told me that she only saw me as a friend. This was after weeks of trying to at least hangout with her. But she would always tell me that she was busy. And I would always say that it was ok.

This school year I signed up for study hall in the cafeteria and I saw an old friend that I knew ever since kindergarten. 

I haven’t seen her for 5 years since she went to another school after 8th grade. 

She is one of the only girls I know who is extremely responsible, dedicated, and empathetic. She also has dignity which is rare to find in today’s world. She is everything a guy could honestly want.

573,"I don’t know why I always feel guilt for not being good enough when others seem to not really think about it.....

For example, in my orchestra class, my section was playing a passage incorrectly and my teacher wanted someone in the section to clap and count it (to basically demonstrate in verbally how it’s done). And she kept looking at me and two other people. But I stayed silent and a million thoughts went into my head. I stared down at my music thinking about how to say it. Then my teacher grew impatient saying “does ANYONE know how to count this???? Seriously???” Then this girl behind me raised her hand and did it perfectly. 
My teacher thanked her and we played for the next hour. 
The whole time I felt HORRIBLE. My mind kept going “why? Why didn’t I know that measure? It was pretty simple” and another side of me was yelling “why do I feel guilty?? Those other two people she looked at moved on and even talked to each other and laughed silently. And then there is me here.....” 

One last example was me in physics class. 
Now, physics for me is difficult to understand, but I consider myself good at math so I have a hard time grasping to concepts, but an easy time solving them mathematically. 
So in my class, I am in the most advanced math compared to my classmates. Yet, I’m struggling so hard on understanding why this velocity is this or why this force applied to this and not this. I am always the last one to finish the test and my teacher always hints towards me in class when a calculus term in mentioned and waits for my definition. 
My brain goes “nice! You know it” and someone else in my brain goes “great....how’s that gonna help you pass with straight A’s if you can’t even set up the problem? What’s the point of being in that math class?” 

Overall, I’m a moody, sensitive, and insecure person. 
I have a huge family and most of them have high expectations. My parents are supportive and tell me that it’s ok to fail sometimes and they keep insisting me to grow up and get over it because I’m acting like I’m the only one feeling like this. 

Ive been TRYING to gain confidence in myself the past two years but certain situations with friends, classmates, teachers, and my parents plummeted that.

574,"My younger sister went through a pretty terrible time in high school, hardcore depression and suicidal. My parents refused to understand her and generally were the source of the problem. 

For some context, my mom is a pushover and my dad is insanely controlling. When I was suicidal and my parents found out, my dad told me I was scum of the earth. They don't believe mental health is real and anything that makes you feel emotional is just an excuse; even though my dad is one of the pettiest, most passive aggressive people out there.

Anyways, my sister just got back from her first semester of college, very anxious and stressed from school, but happier than ever now that she knows what life is without their oppressive nature at every turn. 

The relationship between my sister and my dad is very strained as my sister had a tendency to lie to him a lot during high school, so she's putting in a conscious effort to communicate and mend things. 

My dad doesn't trust her, assumes she's doing something wrong all of the time and is essentially bullying her constantly. He's making all sorts of sarcastic comments, giving her permission to hang out with her friends and then getting mad at her because she should have known he was testing her, pretty much yelling at her whenever she gets home. 

Whenever I've tried to help with anything in the past, unless I'm supporting my dad's opinions, he gets very angry at me because ""you're an adult and you shouldn't be getting involved in drama"" which is ironic. But regardless, generally causes more problems than helps. But I'm a very straight-forward person and really not one to be a bystander. This is causing me a massive amount of stress because I need to help but I don't know what to do.

I can see how this is affecting her and how much she just wants to cut him off but how much she's truly trying to get things to be better. She's being so mature and tries to communicate with him when he's like this, but he'll just interrupt her to make fun of her. He can't and won't see how he's doing anything wrong.

Younger me wasn't very smart with money. I have credit card debt out the wazoo. ( Wife is aware ). I currently have 20,000 in credit card debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

We also EACH have a car payment with my name being on both cars. One payment is 400 a month. ( She had to take some negative equity on this one ) and one is 270. These will both hit their natural end point of their loan in 2021. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have disposable income and both have decent jobs for the area. I bring home around 50K a year and she would bring home around 38K a year.  Each month we have around 3K that we have available to pay things down but we do not know where to start. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should we focus on knocking the credit cards down or should we preemptively pay the cars down? I know debt to income is hugely important and we are trying to make that work. There are other bills involved ( school loans ) that are making it where one or both of these NEED to go before we can get a mortgage that suits our family. While we have the money to pay a mortgage payment, the banks still do not like our debt to income right now.

584,"up until this point in my life (i've just turned 24 so hardly lived 'a life') i've settled for jobs that I despise and living with my parents and spending any non-work time or school time on the computer in toxic internet communities and basically shut myself out from the outside world. the one constant that made me feel any hope was the occasional time where i'd go abroad for a holiday and general travel and so I decided to do one of those tefl courses for the sake of trying to find work abroad because I felt like that may be the answer to all of my problems. anyway, I did the tefl course (honestly could not give less of a f about it) and applied for a job in china teaching english which I have been accepted for and I quit my current job which I hated and am in the process of waiting for my visa but suddenly I feel this flooding feeling of guilt because i've convinced everyone in my circle that this is the path i'm taking and that I want to take it but deep down I feel like I've made a really bad decision. I have absolutely zero interest in teaching and also zero interest in going to china (no offence to those of you with a vpn reading this live from china). I honestly feel like I need to sort my mental health out and start doing things that I actually want to do instead of being naive enough to thinking that moving abroad would solve all my problems when really it's as if i'm running away from problems to just be faced with even more problems some of which a language barrier will completely amplify with that. anyway, I reached out to a friend but all they've said is to be honest and tell my parents that it's not what I want to do and I'm not sure if that makes sense until I come up with a plan B. I paid some money (haven't booked a flight) to an agency and to send some documents to the chinese school and also for the tefl course of course but honestly it's just money I hadn't spent because I sat in my room all day after working a full time job that made me miserable. the idea of going to another country (one that I actually like \[I have no opinion on china btw it's not like I don't like it I just feel very vanilla feelings towards it\] and have visited a few times before) is appealing to me but then it's like how would I find work, what would I do with myself...etc...etc...etc... dunno if any of this really made sense but I'm just worried because I'm the sort of person to make really rash decisions but this is something that I have mulled over ever since I made the rash decision to apply in the first place and the only reason I applied was to get out of the job I hate. anyway, if this made any sense then here's hoping someone on reddit is kind enough to take pity on me and offer some friendly advice.

Background: I know, there is an age gap, We am well aware. I approached him, we keep things slow and on my terms. We are also in Community College together, had a class, now he is a tutor for the school. Please don't post any comments about the age, or anything off-topic.

My mom knew about us because we dated last year and both decided to break up due to overwhelming class load (he is majoring in engineering and I'm in Pharmacy). We got back together over fall, we have been dating much longer than last time. Happily together for 2 months.

I was planning on telling her when we got back (right after Christmas). 

She is a woman who is very conservative with ways and is stubborn. She doesn't care if I'm 17 or 77, she can be very overprotected. (I get that it can be positive, but expressing opinions is difficult.

I bluntly told her that there was no communication about it and had she told me about it, I would have completed the task for her.

597,"Long story short, I have PTSD. I don't want to talk about what it's from or anything, but I will say that I'm not dangerous. And no, it is not a self diagnosis. 

At the moment I have three semesters of college left (I'm 26 y/o) and it's just my wife and I. I'm in school for software engineering and I don't think I'll have a problem getting a job when I graduate, but I don't have one now, and I can't find one. 

Money is tight and something is always behind, and I feel awful. I NEED a job that will work with school, and even a full time one over the summers, but I HAVE to go to therapy every week for one hour. The issue is that sometimes my therapy hours change because my therapist, whom I can not and will not change, both teaches at a different school and works at the clinic I go to. 

This means my one hour sessions fluctuate weekly. They're **always** between 1pm and 3pm and they are always one hour long.

I know no one is going to want to hire me because of this, but I truly can't stop seeing a therapist, nor this one in particular. 

So, if I don't mention to an employer that I have to go to therapy for PTSD and that the scheduling is sometimes erratic, can they fire me once I get hired and mention that I have to?

Should I mention it before I get hired? (I'm scared this will stop them from hiring me. They could simply say no for any other reason and lie.)

**Edit: Btw, I live in small town, rural-ish Arkansas (7000 people), and Arkansas is a right-to-hire, right-to-fire state. This means that you can be terminated at any time for nearly any reason. And if an employer wants, they can fire you and say it was for an entirely different reason than the actual truth, and the law supports this.**",23Dec2019,1

We took these paintings and I brought them to my moms and she has had them ever since. 

I never even thought of them once until today when she pointed them out. I’m visiting again about four five years later. As soon as I saw them I remembered how I found them and had a panic attack. 

These canvases don’t have initials, they aren’t of anything but specific just shapes and colours, but I can’t calm down. I bother my dad too much with my anxiety so I came here. What should I do?

601,"I've gone into a deep depression. My personality is extremely competitive, and I kill myself to be the best at every single little thing. Even in volunteer organizations I get angry when I am not the best at a task or if there's someone else other than me doing it. On top of that I am extremely guarded/reserved. I hate most fun/social activities and can only talk if I consider it to be a talk about productivity- not small talk. People think I am arrogant due to this, and I am struggling to make any solid friendships. I am going on sudden mood swings lately when I feel I am not in charge of a situation/task and feel ostracized. These mood swings are becoming depressive now, and I really can't figure out the source of this.

Here's some introspect as it has recently turned into depression.

* When I feel I am not in charge of a situation or someone is telling me what to do, I feel ostracized.
* I get triggered when I am not the best a task or someone else is doing it other than me. On top of that I am extremely guarded/reserved. I am obsessed with productivity. I can't do small talks or fun/social activities- only productive talks. This leads people to think I am arrogant. I am struggling to make solid friendships now.
* I am worried that I'll start losing friends or maybe my personality has already changed due to these depressive mood swings and I can't notice it
* I hate to admit it and I try to bury it, but I may have some sort of jealously as well because one of my triggers is seeing my friends/family hanging out with people laughing and doing goofy things. I'll think/fear they like them more than me because I'll never have that personality
* Ex. There's a family member that's coming to visit for the first time in a while and that's already irritating me somehow. That he is going to get more attention/interactions than me; and I know it's completely wrong to feel that, but I can't help it
* And now even if I succeed in every single thing on my to-do list and excel in everything and accomplish my goals of being the best, I still feel completely empty

 I think my issue might be that I've always been just me against the world and braved through any hardships with just my high drive for success alone; But, I've never actually had a sense of family apart from just my parents. I think that now for once I actually feel as if I am close to some people and there's actually something more important than my drive and I fear losing that. I don't know if that is it.

Even tho we were in the same group we never talked, we submitted our assignment and that’s all. Until one week ago. He texted me asking about the score of our assignment. For me it was weird cuz he went to classes and the teacher told everyone that he didn’t have the scores yet. So I told him that. Then he started asking me about my exams and then it escalated to him telling me to study together on the next exam and then asking me about my family, asking about my plans and then inviting me to go eat with him. So that’s when I freaked out because for me it was weird that this boy was talking to me this way when we have never ever talked for like 3 years. So I decided to text him (by the influence of my sister) saying that I am busy and that I can’t go out and that if he was texting me or inviting me to go eat to be more than friends, that I wasn’t interested cuz I have other priorities now. Then I said something to decrease the seriousness. He responded me by saying that I don’t have to worry about that and then said something about a previous conversation. I was kinda relived that he wasn’t interested in me so I said ok and then commented about something else. After that he never talked to me and I left it like that.

I began to stray away from the instrument and my cousin who goes to a school where they have to play an instrument but played the saxophone the year prior asked to borrow it. I said go for it and she began using it for the the new school year.  This is the 2019 school year btw. 

The year goes well but recently I have been super inspired and want to pick the bass back up. To my surprise she tells me that because her school isn’t forcing her to play so she is stopping.

609,"**TLDR: What is wrong with me? How can I stop feeling this way?**

I work in a very quiet office with sound-dampening ceiling tiles. The only sounds come from directly behind me, where a coworker sits and taps on his plastic chair rug with his rubber shoes. I also hear various humming and mouth clicking and tapping.

The problem isn't him, however; it's my reaction to it. I don't think he's doing anything *wrong*. Despite that, I can feel this incredible urge to fly into an outrage and throw my monitors against the wall and strangle him, yelling at him to STOP YOUR FUCKING OBNOXIOUS TAPPING.

I'm not normally like this. I know it's hard to believe based on this post alone, but off of Reddit I'm a pretty relaxed person. It's just whenever I'm at work I feel this insane rage, which destroys my mood and affects how I talk to others on the internet.

So far I've tried:

- brought my headphones to work; sometimes I forget them at home (like today).
- bought ear plugs (they don't help).
- tried breathing slowly and relaxing. That doesn't work at all.

I've thought a lot about my reaction and what it means. I've felt similar ways about my younger brother chewing his food loudly growing up. I think the common denominator is *someone is making a noise they are oblivious to but I cannot ignore, the cosmically ironic pointlessness of which creates a feedback loop that explodes inside my mind*.

Am I fucking crazy? I feel like it. Can I please have some advice that isn't just ""stop being an asshole""?",23Dec2019,1
610,"TL:DR - need emotional release from my father’s passing but having a hard time to do that because I’m naturally melancholic

So here it goes. Premise: my father passed away a couple years ago. He was ill/sick as long as I can remember. He suffered a few strokes mid-life and the final one caused him to lose function on one side of his body and voice. Nonetheless, we looked after him for many years until his sudden passing. He was fairly young. The only memory I have of him healthy was when I was about 5/6 years old. He was missing for a few years of my life and I’ve never witnessed a loving relationship between my mother and him (long story). More like a patient-caretaker relationship. In my teenage years I’d hate him for not being there during my formative years. In my adolescence I hate to say it but he felt like a burden on the family.

I consider myself a caring person. I’m in the medical field where I’ve been praised for my empathy. My eyes well up hearing other people’s plights. But I feel like I can’t express my sorrow for my loss. I did love my father. I got over the teenage angst. And I am sad that he’s gone. But I’ve only cried twice, second time forcefully, about this.

I’m generally melancholic. Like everyday in general. I feel I’ve been this way since my very existence, before my father’s passing. Old teachers would say the same. But I feel like I haven’t been saving up my emotion points for situations like this, instead wasting them feeling melancholic on a daily basis. 

My question is, do I forcefully bring about some grieving or do I just carry on with life and wait for the grief to hit me.? The latter is easy because I’m a bit of a workaholic. 

Am I a bad person for not openly sobbing? Is it because I’m a man (stereotype I know)? It’s not that I don’t care because I feel it everyday. Has guilt got anything to do with it?

So hoping to get some objective advice on something.

I was under the impression I'd be spending Xmas with my girlfriend and her family.

Getting to this unit only amplified this mentality. Now I am uncomfortable just taking the trash to the side of the road. I find myself thinking, ""What are people thinking of me right now"", ""I bet my neighbors are thinking I'm gross for having to take out such a large amount of trash."" I feel embarrassed that people are able to see my business, so I actively avoid doing things like this. I feel like I have to focus on how I walk so as to not draw attention to myself by walking loudly or weirdly. So I do not go into public unless it is with my girlfriend. I used to dress with colors and some sort of style, and now I wear drab, solid colored, collared shirts and plain pants and shoes, so I don't draw attention to myself. I can't go into public with my younger brother because he's 12 and silly and draws attention to me and himself. I can't use the bathroom in public/work because it might be loud or distracting in the workplace/area. It is so exhausting and putting a huge strain on the only relationship I've ever been in long term. I have begun to become extremely angry and bitter towards the world from being in this constant ""stop watching and judging me"" mentality. It has gotten so bad that I am starting to project these accusations on those closest to me and literally everyone. It has become borderline paranoia it seems. There are times when all I want to do is cut off ties to everyone I know and live in the woods where nothing can see or judge you. I used to live by the ""life's better with your gut out"" mantra, but it has turned into nobody can be trusted.

How can I undo this or at least mitigate it? Are there mental exercises? Could forcing myself into a situation where these thoughts happen and not walking away work?  I do not want to live my life being this uncomfortable or scared of everyone or failing a mission because I was spotted or found out. It is so thoroughly exhausting trying to tell myself all day that nobody cares what you're doing. They might look at you but you're out of their minds in a few seconds. It is a constant battle that preoccupies my time to the point where I can't focus on work, or listen to people when they're talking to me.",23Dec2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

 

So, almost two weeks ago I had to what (at the time) to my knowledge was protected sex.

Now, I have since learned that my IUD was dislodged and I was not, or at least a whole lot less protected than we assumed me to be and I have since been having absolute meltdowns. I do NOT want to be pregnant.

So, after some furious googling (yeah, I know) I learned that there are tests out there that are developed for ''early'' testing. They still reccomend two weeks of waiting time but I figured if I had a negative, I could at least spend Christmas in denial before testing again to be sure.

So, here I am, running to the store and standing there for well over half an hour comparing tests. Realising I lost track of time I end up grabbing a box and running home, where I obviously take the test as soon as I can drop my trousers. To my absolute horror it turned positive. After a solid 20 minutes of absolute meltdown i check the manual again, ''to be sure'' and notice i didn't buy a pregnancytest but an ovulationkit. Tears of horror turned in to tears of joy untill i took it to [Dr.Google](https://dr.google/), again where I found a bunch of contradicting information. One ''source'' claiming that when ovulating, you can't be pregnant (obviously) and another claiming that ovulationkits do not ''see'' te difference between the hormone caused by ovulating and the hormone caused by pregnancy, so it could still go both ways.

Now, here's what I do know;

1. The chances of me being actually pregnant on it's own are slim to non excistent.
2. It can just be a faulty test.
3. I might just be ovulating (wich shouldn't be a thing since i only had the IUD completely removed a week ago, up until then it was still ''up there'' but just dislodged)
4. It is still stupid early for a pregnancytest of any kind to show a positive result, even if I am.
5. The chances of me conceiving, even without the IUD are minimal, due to an injury i had passed august, I have only been ''cleared'' about two months ago, when I had a new IUD ''installed'' and my OBGYN told me my womb would need more time to fully heal.

So, wich side of google is telling me the truth. Can a ovulationkit pick up a pregnancy and give a false positive on ovulating or am I indeed, by some fucked up miracle, just ovulating?

I've wanted a girlfriend since I was about 12, so it's not like this desire crept up on me recently. It's been something I've been interested in for over a decade. It's been soul-destroying to go through life perpetually single despite desiring romantic companionship.

In the past I've tried a couple of interest groups, expanding my social circle, going to clubs and bars, online dating and haven't really had success with any of it. Nowadays I don't get out as much because I'm jaded.

His family is coming down from PA for the holidays, and it will be my second time meeting them (his mother and sister in particular). It dawned on him to ask me if they could borrow my car to do some Christmas shopping. I was aghast that he would even think to ask me that, especially since his sister goes on vacation every month. When I asked why his sister couldn't get a rental car, he said that she doesn't have the money for it, and that she doesn't like asking her breadwinner husband for things unless he offers. I'd offered him in the past to borrow my car since he has a son and does not have a car due to a DUI, but his family is another matter. He is financially strapped as he is a single dad and is in debt. Other than this string of bad decisions, he has been a very good person and partner to me, and overall.

He understands that I've declined his request, and won't press it further. But my issue is that underneath that, he says he still doesn't truly understand why it's a big deal.

628,"Hi Reddit community,

I have been asking myself several questions about my relationship and thought it might not hurt to ask for external advice, hence this post.

I (28F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (33M) for almost 3 years. Most of the time he is loving, supportive, funny &amp; caring - a lovely boyfriend.

2-3 months in the relationship, he told me he had had issues with depression in his twenties, so much so that he dropped out of university twice. He is still taking anti-depressants now. Basically, depression runs in his family - one of his parents had it, his grandpa had it and it's likely he will pass it on to any children he/we may have.

Most of the time the depression is manageable and my boyfriend would appear to be as mentally healthy as anyone else and the great person I described above.

But once in a while, especially in the winter, he'll have tough spells of depression, during which he won't be able to get out of bed for one or two days, barely eat... This winter, this also happened but on top of that, he would drink one bottle of whiskey during this days (like whiskey gone after 1 or 2 days).

He doesn't want to go to therapy and, fair enough, he says he has already done lots of it when he was younger, he helped then but he's reached the end of what therapy could bring him. Now he says he just needs a stable and loving environment.
He also admitted that he feels anxious all the time and his work, which is quite dangerous, doesn't help 
(I know some of you may say that it would be helpful if he changes career but that's not an option since, long story short, he has already changed jobs plenty of times and is now on track to get a vocational qualification which would help him professionnally and personally in the long run).

I am torn:
- on one hand, everything is fine 80% of the time and I feel good with him. I also know that nobody is perfect and, if not this, any other person I would be dating would for sure have issues of their own (I also have my own, as we all do)
- on the other hand, I'm concerned about his mental health getting worse and making him do bad/crazy things. I don't know if I would be able to manage supporting him for a life time of going through

Any advice from anyone who has been or currently is dating someone with mental health issues, on how to manage this and how to know if, in spite of this, the relationship is still healthy/fulfilling?

Cheers

629,"Long story short: 

My sister met a girl on tinder, whom lives 3hrs away with flight in another country. My sister decided to stop talking to her after awhile. She’s now sending my sis tons of threatening messages that she’s committing suicide if my sister keep ignoring her. 

It makes my sis really scared. 

She messaged my sis within all kind of social media. Even though she has been blocked from facebook, instagram, FaceTime etc. She kept sending messages such as: 

“ I’ll make you regret for what you did.”
“ why don’t you respond. Are you playing me?”
“ didn’t you promise me you were going to talk to me?”
“ fine. I know you want to be with your gf.”
“ if I die, thats going to make you happy.”
“ I’m going to commit suicide, its your last chance.”
“ i will find you.”


I read through all the message attempts she tried to send via instagram, which sounds super manipulative and threatening. She created a new account to message my sister. 

The worst part of it was probably that my sister was already in a long term/ long distance relationship while meeting this girl. This girl fell in love with my sister regardless she knew the situation, and was willing to offer my sister more. Now I assume she felt disappointed and the feel of being used. 

Now that the girl was acting crazy. My sister is super scared. So she asked what to do, I told her I’ll post it on reddit. 

Any advice?",23Dec2019,1
631,"I’ve (25F) been dating my boyfriend (29M) for four months. I feel really awkward asking this because I’ve never had trouble with my sex life, especially with someone I’m in a committed relationship with.

In short, I feel like our sex life is dying out already and as someone with a high sex drive, it’s making me feel multiple, confusing things. I don’t place ultimate value on sex in a relationship, but a healthy sex life is important to me. I’m having a hard time distinguishing whether or not this is just a lull in our sex life (which is normal) or if there’s something wrong with me.

I’ve talked to him about it a few times. He expressed to me that the primary reason is because work has been really stressful for him and that when he’s stressed it’s really hard for him to be in the mood. I get that, I’m a just a person who reacts in the opposite (the more stressed I am, the more I want to have sex). 

Another reason is that in his last and only long term relationship (5 years long, give or take), the girl he was with just stopped wanting to have sex with him during the last three years of the relationship. Her therapist recommended she tell him that if she wants sex that she would ask him for it, but he said they maybe did it all of 10 times in those three years. He has become conditioned to wait for the other person to initiate, whereas I rarely have ever had to initiate it. I’ve made it clear to him that our relationship is different and that he doesn’t have to stress himself out about that. If I’m really not in the mood, I would clearly state it. 

Again, this isn’t a matter of me placing sex as the priority in the relationship. I love him for so many other reasons and besides this, our relationship is the ideal relationship for me. I just need advice and insight on how I can better deal with these feelings until this can maybe regulate on its own. I never want to push his boundaries and I don’t want to cause him any more stress than the stresses he already faces. 

Him and I have already talked about it multiple time and I’m hesitant to bring it up anymore. 

Anyone else experience something similar to me? Any insight would be helpful.",23Dec2019,1

635,"There are so many reasons why my dad is toxic but I’ll try to cut it short for you.

The main reason for this toxicity is because my dad is incredibly selfish and he’s always been like it but in recent years, it’s becoming unbearable. When I was younger, he used to lie to my sister and I, telling us that he couldn’t see us on the weekend because he was at work, but we drove past him this one weekend when he said he was at work, and he was in the car with his girlfriend and her daughter. A few years ago I confronted him about this but he denied it ever happened and even tried calling me a liar. That is one of the MANY examples of the way my dad is. It breaks my heart that he doesn’t own up to what he’s done, it’s like trying to get blood from a stone. 

He continuously lies to my sister and I, I’ve confronted him plenty but he still continues to lie and I just can’t comprehend why a father would be like this to his daughters. He recently received a lump sum and he’s got an extension on his house with new things for him, his now wife and her daughter. I don’t care about material items, but it’s the principle that he’s lying about it. Every time I see him, my self esteem plummets because his house reminds me of the fact he’s a liar. I’ve tried to confront him but you honestly don’t get anywhere with him. He always undermines mine and my sister’s achievements, while praising whatever his wife and her daughter does. It’s not that I want him to worship the ground I walk on, but it honestly hurts that me and my sister receive no acknowledgment from our dad. We are both at very prestigious universities and he doesn’t care, he doesn’t care about anything we’ve achieved. I’m currently anaemic with B12 and folic acid deficiencies and I’m on a lot of medication and I suffer with a lot of symptoms. But my own dad doesn’t ask me if I’m okay, he never actually asks me. Meanwhile, my sister and I always ask him if he’s okay and we always go out of our way to help him (because we want to of course), because he’s currently suffering with PTSD, which makes this situation so difficult. It just sucks that it isn’t reciprocated. He has always been like this, before he had PTSD, so I know that’s not what’s causing his behaviour, although it does contribute. It’s not that I want attention, but it hurts that my own dad doesn’t care if I’m alright. 

He shows no interest in our lives and everything me and my sister do isn’t good enough and it makes me feel so low. He always picks out little flaws and criticises at every chance he gets. I’m plagued by the way he was when we were younger as well — one time my mum asked him what he’d do if she died, and he said to her in front of me and my sister that we’d go in care. That’s how little he thinks of us. 

Earlier this year, I decided to cut him out of my life because he did nothing but make me feel like shit. But then he had a lung cancer scare, and I was prettified that’s he’d die and it made me realise that life is too short and I should just accept him for who he is. So since then, I’ve been sticking it out and making the effort. But I’m the only one who initiates the communication and puts in any effort to see him. When I tell him this, he makes me feel silly. My grandad died a few months ago, and he didn’t have a relationship with my auntie or uncle, and they now have to live with guilt and regret. I never want to be in that situation because not only do I want to feel that, I still want to support my dad. That’s why I’ve been reluctant to cut him out. I know that if I was to explain why I’m cutting him out, he would never question his actions and would blame me. One time my sister asked if we’re in his will (I had nothing to do with it and it was harmless), and since then he’s been going around his workplace telling his colleagues that his daughters only ring him to ask if we’re in his will. I know this because my boyfriend works with him so he told me. The worst part is, if I asked him if he did say that, he would deny it. I don’t deserve that because I’ve never asked if I’m in his will, I don’t care. I always text and make the effort to see him so it hurts that he’s been saying that about me. His wife is very high maintenance and spends a lot of his money and he makes hints that he can’t afford presents at Christmas. So last year, I told him not to get me anything. That wasn’t reverse psychology, I’m just very empathetic and would never want to put him under any pressure, and I don’t care about presents. But my sister told me that he was on the phone to her and calling me immature for telling him not to get me anything for Christmas. Even when I’m being selfless, he’s still saying shit about me behind my back. And the reason why I’m even typing this is because this Christmas, I have no way of getting a lift to his house (as I can’t drive, nor do I have any money for transport). He could pick me up but I knew he wouldn’t because he’s selfish, so I text him and told him I’d have to see him on Boxing Day (26th Dec). I knew he wasn’t going to offer a lift, but I think deep down I still hoped. And he replied with “oh okay no problem.” And I’m sat here trying to stop the tears in front of everyone because my dad doesn’t even care to see me on Christmas Day, when he can pick me up.

636,"Hi Everyone - sorry if this is long and sorry for the repost. Am hoping to see if others respond given that I originally posted over the weekend and I’m on pins and needles on this major decision. Thank you!

Hoping others can give me advice on a very important career situation. I have been working in the medical field for one company for over 10 years. It was the first organization I ever worked for, a non-profit, and I loved it. They were a community focused organization and very mission driven, as was I. Through the years I shined in the organization and had multiple promotions and came to a high salary for my profession (problem 1). A few years ago my boss and mentor, whom I totally trusted, asked if I'd be interested in directing several grants and thus shifted my salary to these time limited grants. It was another good opportunity and he said once they were done he would pull me back into the organizations budget. So I went for it (problem 2)

Several months after that, a very large academic medical center took over my center, and installed all their own leadership, and my boss was pushed out. This new company is private, and is ultra driven by the financial bottom line, they have an army of data analysts, and the vibe is not about any mission to help the community, but turning profit and everyone now is the best and brightest (problem 3). I don't shine as much and everyone who had worked there has these conflicts about the change in mission and company culture, as there is no loyalty or friendly feel in the office at all. In my department there are over 100 people and everyone is running round, appearing stressed about productivity, and don't have time for small talk or smiles.

The grants which fund my salary come to an end in a few months (problem 4). The grant did not spend down all the money and he assures me that the surplus will carry my salary through all of 2020. Of course details are vague. My new boss is nice enough and says he wants to retain me, and I believe him. Leadership says they will find some creative solutions if need be. Of the two options he said they are considering, one is interesting, the other is very boring to me. They want me to stay to help the community where I was raised. And in one year's time, much changes in healthcare, and new grants can come, others may leave or retire, other opportunities may arise. So basically it's ""hang in there and we want to find a solution and within 12 months we are pretty confident we will find a position for you and be able to fund you""

I've been looking for jobs for my title and in my salary range for 3 months, and there have been only 10, and **only 1** has interviewed me (problem 4). However, I really liked the place and they were super warm and welcoming, loved my experienced, and are also mission driven and a community focused organization. They sound much more relaxed and disorganized. They are surprised that I'd leave an academic institution for their non-profit and feel I'd bring much to the table and want me to leave my mark with all my experiences. I was shocked that the salary there is only 4,000 less than what I currently make, so that's pretty equal. The one thing I didn't understand is they asked twice if I was ok leaving the generous pension fund behind as they don't have that, but they have a 401k that they say is 3% first year then goes to 10% second year. (They are sending me the benefits package monday so I don't know about all the benefits besides this and salary).

It's hard to leave behind the only company i've ever worked for, but in a way that company doesn't exist as it became a for profit with no charitable mission. And I'm lost in a sea of the 'best and brightest' and don't feel too valued. On the plus side it is very close to my house (15 min versus 40 minutes), very close to my kids school, and close to where I grew up. At this stage of life starting over feels like a big deal. But there are definite positives at starting at the new place. 

**I am feeling like i should use the offer from Company B to try to stabilize my situation at company A. Or at least see if they can get me better job security than jumping around to all these grants which inevitable end. Any idea what is the best strategy to do that, the best language to use? It's delicate and I don't want to ruin things with Company A in case Company B doesn't pan out.**

For most of my life my mom has been extremely overprotective and controlling because she has anxiety that she does not think is an issue. For 18 years of my life I thought her anxious behavior was normal because she told me I was the only one of my friends that had a mother who loved them. 

So yeah that has fucked up my life. I have become anxious like her and now we have a completely unhealthy relationship and I am scared of her and her disapproval.

The biggest thing I am scared of is that I am atheist and I am gay. Both things my mom would disapprove of. She is really suspicious and literally puts me under a microscope, analyzing every single thing I do. I think she suspects that I am pulling away from Christianity and is desperately trying to control me to stay at church. I still go and act like I'm Christian because I am scared of her.

Well, my non church friends are obviously more liberal and my mom hates that. I want to go on a trip with them 2 hours away from my home and it is in another state. Its literally just for a day and its a small trip. My mom doesn't want me to go because she doesn't like that they are not Christian and she thinks they are bad influences. She keeps trying to control my friends and my life. I don't get why she can't just set me free. 

This has caused a lot of anxiety and tension between my mother and I. Am I wrong for wanting to go on the trip? She makes me feel like shit for doing anything out of the realm of her control. How do I break free from this craziness?",23Dec2019,1

643,"18 year old (M) here, I have found myself completely addicted to the internet in the past few years and thanks to it I just feel like I’ve wasted so much time I could have been devoted to other things such as having a job and hanging out with friends, etc. It became so bad I had no motivation to drive and right now I am in the process of getting my permit as I don’t even have a license. For years I didn’t see the need to experience things as in my mind it was all available on my phone or laptop... I just feel I’ve wasted so much time and was hoping for some tips and advice on how to go forward, I finally came to a realization that it was making me unhappy to such an extent. Thanks in advance and happy holidays",23Dec2019,1
644,"This post might get emotional because I'm genuinely disgusted with my family's behaviour. Sorry if there are any formatting issues, btw.

Context: My grandmother was abusive towards my mother. It was both physical and emotional, but mostly the latter. Said grandmother also convinced my aunt (my mom's sister) to join in the harassment all her life. My grandfather is basically brainwashed by my grandmother and therefore sat and watched. I've seen these things happen to her a few times in person, but most information has come from my mom's word as I wasn't born yet during the worst of it. At age 16, my mom tried to kill herself. She doused herself in gasoline (or some similar substance, can't quite remember the small details) and caught herself on fire. The only reason she survived? She didn't want her dog to catch fire too, so she jumped into the pool to make sure he was safe. By the time this was done, she had life-threatening burns all over her body and was immediately taken to the ER. She told me, and I'll use almost her exact wording on this, that when she woke up, it looked like she was wearing loose socks. But it was just some of her skin bunched down at her ankles. Now, what did her mom do when she woke up? Cry for joy that her baby was alive? Not even close. Word for word, my mother told me she said, ""Now you're ugly on the outside to match the inside."" This story makes my blood boil all the time. Oh, and they LIED to family and friends about what happened. They told nobody about the attempt despite my mother's disapproval with their choice. They said a propane tank exploded. Years later, 39 years old to be exact... My mom was successful in committing suicide. It was after a fight she had with me when she was drunk and she became physically abusive toward me. I ran out with my brother to stay at a friend's house for the night and my dad went with us for comfort. We came back home around 4 am to find that she'd hung herself in our basement. We called the police, obviously, but long story short, it was too late as she had been there for over half an hour. Her outbursts, bipolar disorder, and PTSD were all caused by my grandparents and how they treated her during her childhood. This was her downfall in the end, too. Regardless, for the sake of helping the grieving process, my brother and I were forced to go down to our grandparents' house almost every day for dinner. It wasn't terrible, but it was very uncomfortable as they virtually cut my dad out of the equation despite him grieving the worst and needing the support of family more than anything. He would barely leave the house, spent hours crying every single day, couldn't sleep in the room he shared with my mother and instead settled for the couch, and barely spoke. 

The current situation: My grandparents have become increasingly hostile towards my dad despite him doing nothing to trigger it. He's done nothing but try to reach out to them and try to be affectionate. He even gave them random gifts and organized mass (expensive) despite my mother being openly atheist just to give them closure. They began spreading lies, even going as far as to tell our close family members and their friends that my dad was the cause of my mom's death despite playing no part in it whatsoever. My mother denies these accusations of spreading rumors, but enough distraught family members have come to us separately in secret telling us what she's said that coincidence isn't a realistic option. My great-aunt (grandmother's sister) out of the blue decided to tell us directly to ""never contact me or my family again."" So... We complied. If we didn't, legal action could be taken against us as far as we were aware. After a while, our grandfather showed up at our house unannounced and started pounding as hard as he could on our front door. He was yelling for my dad to come outside. He was extremely aggressive and this lasted at least half an hour. We were scared for our lives and were fully armed in case he went as far as to break in. (Dad had his conceal carry, I had a dagger collection from fairs, etc). He *thankfully* gave up at some point and we filed a police report. We've caught him walking his dogs by our house and filming us randomly from across the street a few times since that encounter. Fast forward a bit, and my dad gets married again! I was so happy for him and I was afraid he would never be able to look for companionship again, but he met this amazing woman who is super genuinely sweet. I even have three step-sisters now. Somehow, my grandparents caught word of this and... It didn't go too well. We invited friends of ours who were invited to my grandparents' house for ""a talk"". My grandmother cursed, yelled, and cried at them for considering even going to the wedding. According to what they told us, she said, ""If you go to his wedding, you are dead to this family."" They obviously didn't want the drama, so they decided not to go. They did apologize to us profusely for giving in to her manipulation and gave us a very generous gift. I feel so bad for them.

Long story short, I'm not sure what the hell I'm doing. I stand fully by keeping them out of our lives, but that entire side of my family thinks we're insane and heartless. Am I justified in cutting them off?",23Dec2019,1
645,"This one is a bit all over the place, and I'm at a loss. Right now I'm just staying in my lane and not saying anything, but last night changed things. 

A very good friend of ours went through a very messy divorce a few years ago. Wife left the country. Took the kid. Didn't tell him she was pregnant too. She had been unhappy for years, had an affair and decided to leave it all behind. He still doesn't know if they're his kids or not. 

We took him in during this. He stayed with us. It was a huge struggle for him. He lost his job during this as well. A few months later, he started to regain control again. No longer on suicide watch. Got a job. Got his own place. We helped furnish it and get him the basics. He got help. Started to really get better. 

Recently, he introduced me to his new girlfriend. She looked familiar, but I couldn't quite place it. Like, really familiar. But I couldn't remember where so I didn't bring it up. The few times we've hung out, she's rubbed me the wrong way. Very passive aggressive. Demanding. Not giant red flags, but enough to tweak my patience. Little things. Treating the waitress badly. Changing her mind a million times. Pity party talk. Even straight up insisting we should all pay for her dinner because we had jobs and she didn't, etc. Sometimes she was pleasant, but I started to really hate how she bossed my friend around. He seemed happy enough, so I kept this shit to myself. Maybe I was just being too critical, you know?

On Friday, I picked up our friend and went out for a few drinks. During dinner, our friend's phone blows up with text messages. My friend looked confused, then turns to me and asks:

""Hey. Uhm. I think my girlfriend knows someone on your Facebook."" 

Me: ""Yeah? Who?""

Friend: ""Amanda.""

Me: ""Okay yeah. Me and Amanda go way back. How does your girlfriend know her?""

Friend: ""They had a big big fight in high school. She's mad that we associate with her."" 

I'm kind of taken aback. High school? What, 20 years ago? Wtf?

My friend's phone continues to blow up with messages and he shows me a few of them. Grilling about how we know Amanda. Why Amanda is on both of our social media. Why we didn't warn her about Amanda? How this just triggered a full blown trauma episode and that my friend's girlfriend needs to call her therapist because it just 'undid years worth of therapy to see Amanda's face again'. It went from 0-100 in about 5 minutes of text messages.

At this point, I call up Amanda, because this is really weird. Amanda answers, and I mention this girls name. Amanda tells me that they had a falling out in high school. Turns out a bunch of girls were dating the same guy without realizing it. It got messy, and the one girl (the one who my friend is dating) had an absolute breakdown about it. Cut ties with her entire peer circle, left the school district and went homeschooled. 

Apparently they hadn't seen each other in 18 years. 

I get off the phone with Amanda. My friend gets off the phone with his new girlfriend. He looks really upset. 

Friend: ""She says I can't be around someone who is friends with Amanda.""

Me: ""What does that mean? That *we* can't be friends?""

Friend: ""She didn't say that, but she isn't happy and wants me to come home right now.""

I said I understood, and if she was that upset then he should go make sure she was okay. I dropped him off back home. Later that night, I got a text thanking me for everything I've done for him, that I mean the world to him, that he wouldn't be where he was without me, and that he needed some time to think about things. 

I straight-up asked him what was going on. That this sounded like a goodbye?

He said it's complicated, not yet resolved, beat it around the bush. In the end, he cancelled all our future plans. He removed me from his social media and I've been completely blocked by his girlfriend too. I reached out to a few close friends, who are also friends with Amanda, and they've been removed from his friend's list as well. 

I can't help but feel hurt by this. I don't know what to do. I'm just giving him space right now, but I can't help but feel like this is bullshit. I'm worried about him. I want him to be happy, but I'm worried he's found someone who doesn't have his best interests at heart, you know?",23Dec2019,1
647,"I’ve been best friends with this guy for 2 years, and on Friday I finally told him that I had feelings for him.

I did it over phone, and he thanked me for doing that because it’s important to not talk about it over text. He assured me that he isn’t the type of guy to ruin our friendship over this because he “isn’t that dense”. 

But... when I asked him if he by chance reciprocated those feelings, he said, “Honestly? I’ve never really thought about having a relationship with you. I’d need some time to figure it out.” And I’m response I told him that it was perfectly okay if he needed to figure out.

Then for the next 30 minutes we talked about life and classes and extracurriculars that we were both in. 

The thing is... if I’ve been BEST FRIENDS with this guy for 2 YEARS, and he has NEVER thought that way about me, is there even a chance he’d say yes? There is no way, right? I just don’t have high hopes for this right now, and I don’t want to get my hopes up. 

Please! Advise? Do you guys think he’d say “Let’s start a relationship.”?",23Dec2019,1
648,"My friend told me to post on here. 

Last year, I got some inheritance money, like a lot, from my uncle and his family that had tragically passed away in a car accident involving 5 people. Because of my place in the family, I revived the money over my parents. So I opted to buy a house with the funds since my parents and I have always wanted a place to our selfs. And having lived in apartments my entire life, the thought of a house, no matter how difficult it may be, was really intriguing to me. 

Since moving in, my parents have gotten more and more insane with the passing days. My dad has many, MANY mental and physical problems causing him to act out when the smallest of things don’t go his way. It’s the worst, because I can’t do anything about it, but it gets taken out on me. He unloads everything that’s ever happened to him to me. It’s draining being the emotional bag that things get thrown into when other bags are full. He’s told me things I wish I never heard, and quite literally ruined 2018s Christmas for the entire family because he’s a depressed man-child. He’s ruined my relationship with my grandmother and my uncle, the same way he ruined those relationships for himself. He blows off the handle and goes from 0-100 instantly the SECOND something goes wrong, which because of his mental state, is literally every day. He is incapable of seeing the bigger picture and it’s so incredible sad to live with. 
He has a shopping addiction, that he is fully aware of, but refuses to do anything about. He spent $70,000 of the left over family money in less than 6 months on shit we don’t ever use. Things from huge ass table saws, to tens of R/C’s. 

My mother is a mess too. She loves starting fights for some reason and literally goes out of her way to make my dad and I feel like trash sometimes. But, she’s no where near as bad as my dad. 

Half a year ago, I got wrongly fired from my job, and have had such a hard time finding a job in my area for a long time. I have my own bills to pay, and I am also helping pay with the power bill, and the house taxes that my parents neglected for a year or so. Once I lost my job, my bills, including my credit card piled up quickly and now I’m in a little trouble with the debt collectors. Nothing super serious yet, but If I don’t make the payments I lose my phone, my internet, and whatever my bank takes to pay off my debt. It’s my problem, so I thought I would keep it to myself for the time being. My dad being the man-child he is, looked around my stuff and found I owed a lot on my credit card, which he freaked out at me for. Saying that they could’ve helped me when they don’t have money left either. Both my parents are on disability, so the government gives them cheque’s every month, and a large portion of my dads goes to R/C and other worthless shit when it should be going towards the house, because if I were in the same situation, and I have been before, I would step up and sacrifice my extra money for the house. 

Well, I just got fired from a job that shouldn’t even been on listing for where I live in the first place due to the lack of costumers in that line of sales. And I got 1 pay cheque out of them. I got it direct deposited. The day after I got canned, I received a letter from the  place I had just got fired from. When I opened it, the first thing I saw was $200 so I assumed it was a cheque. Immediately, as soon as I mentioned the money, my mother said something, basically presuming I’d be giving her the money because I haven’t been able to help with the power, or taxes for a bit. I was annoyed by this and just wanted to go to bed because I had just gotten home from a long day and it was 12am. 

When I tried to walk away, my dad lost his fucking mind at me screaming at the top of his lungs saying that I’m ungrateful and how if I was born into his family, I’d be on the streets right now. Then he basically kicked me out, to which I didn’t do because it’s my Fucking house. 

Idk what to do. It’s draining living like this, but I can’t just evict them because they’re my family, and I probably won’t leave unless I find something I want to do elsewhere. 

Anyway, yeah. Sorry for the long post.",23Dec2019,1
649,"I’m going to be 23 years old soon. I have a difficult situation on my hands in regards to living at home. I have dealt with an overbearing, controlling, helicopter, overprotective mom for all my life. It was difficult even to go outside the house on my own but I did it. It was difficult to take public transit for places even 2-5 miles away but I did it. My mom has also disapproved of my boyfriend resulting in me having to have a secret relationship and live a double life. My mom thinks we’re broken up, but we’re not.

My mom and I have had some arguments lately. One thing she says to me is that “you live here rent free.” I really don’t live there rent free she actually makes me pay at least $50 in rent. I would actually be happier paying a higher rent, because I would have a space to myself and privacy. However, with that being said, I cannot afford the higher rent in the city. I would go live with my boyfriend if I could. However, I would put him at risk of evection, because the lease says specifically that other people cannot live there.

My boyfriend lives 20 miles from me and that is not by his choice that was the only thing available. This is the big issue that I have. I talked about using public transit to go further away into the city like 10 to 20 miles further out. Every time I try to bring that up both of my parents will bring up the safety issues. There are big issues of me being a young woman. I cannot have a rational discussion without being told that I’m going to be raped or be killed while taking public transit. My mom doesn’t know that my boyfriend would be with me on the public transit going further out. She can’t know that because she hates him. So I have major issues with my mom at home when it comes to visiting him in his apartment or spending the night with him. If I went ahead and just did that, I know my mom would have a nervous break down.

The issue I have is just because somebody does or doesn’t pay rent, it doesn’t mean that they are owned by the property owner and/or landlord. In this case it is my mom, a lot of times she treats me like she owns me and that I am her property. This is especially true when it comes to doing riskier things like traveling and with my relationships. I tried  to address this a memo in the past. The memo stated that I would only take public transit to the city if there was a special event going on. She wasn’t really okay with it, but she did understand at the time. I know with my mom it’s all about taking baby steps, not one big leap.

On the other hand, in the past my dad was always willing to drive me to where I needed to go. This is no longer true, especially since I am an adult. My dad works full-time. I asked my dad if he would be willing to drive me to my boyfriend’s apartment 20 miles away and he said that the risk of getting exposed is too high. (My dad knows about the relationship and is okay with it.) There’s a lot of things that he refuses to do because the risk of getting exposed is too high. My mom has threatened to divorce my dad over my relationship with my boyfriend in the past when she knew. 

To address this problem, want to spend the night in a hotel a few times until she gets more comfortable with it. Besides, I want to be able to spend the night in the hotel sometimes, because it can be very stressful at home. I thinking of giving her a new memo which states I will be spending the night in hotels locally first, and then go further out. The reason why I need to be able to spend night in the hotel (besides my boyfriend living 20 miles away) is public transit can be unreliable and it can be a lot harder getting back home at late at night. If I go 10 to 20 miles further out, a hotel would make it worth it. Otherwise, I would have to turn around and go back right away without spending much time at the destination I got to. 

However, my dad warned me that this plan I have in regards to hotels might make my mom suspicious that I am dating someone in secret. If she does get suspicious of this, she will create more chaos. I have to be careful with the wording in my memo that it clearly does not imply anything involving dating. For the purpose of adding more context, I live in a suburb of Los Angeles.

I understand that this is a extraordinarily difficult situation. I do not expect an ideal solution. I’m just posting this thinking that maybe somebody else who went through something similar will see it and be able to assist. I will say the good thing about the relationship is that my boyfriend and I have is that we are able to do the basic things. We are able to get intimate in a hotel. I just can’t spend the night as of now. Spending the night is one of the problems I’m trying to fix. Another problem I want to fix is to go 10-20 miles further out using public transit with out it being such a divisive issue that it causes a rift in my family. I need to have the ability to spend the night somewhere else even if I am alone. Things can get heated in my family and sometimes I would be lot better off spending the night somewhere else.

I figure that paying for hotels (at least once every two months) would be a temporary thing until I can get my mom comfortable enough. I want to get my mom comfortable with that. I want to stay at my boyfriend’s apartment one night and feel confident that I’m not going to get caught.",23Dec2019,1

656,"So some background first before the part I need advice on:

* I'm a freshman in college
* My mom is a college educated woman in her 50s
* I have depression (have had it since my junior year in high school)
* I go to BSU (Boise State University)

Onto the story/rant

I have been struggling with my grades, gpa, mental health, and with making friends since the first day I started college. I have a few friends that are the best and a few of them don't plan on leaving the city. Since visiting Boise, I have always wanted to live in the city even when not in college (like I want to move there permanently). I love the city so much. The college on the other hand, that's a different story.

I don't like school. Never have, never will. And I haven't exactly gotten along with students either. I was bullied from third grade up until I graduated high school (junior and senior year were a whole different type of bullying). I never had a lot of friends and, to be honest, I can't do group work. When a teacher tells us to choose our own groups, I just stay seated and wait for someone to invite me to join them. I am scared of joining another group because of what happened in junior and senior year so yeah. 

I have been thinking about dropping out of college since September. It's currently December as I'm writing this. I have told my mom once about dropping out and she said she would not financially support me living in Boise and not going to college because ""(she) can't afford it."" Which makes no sense but whatever. She said if I want to drop out, I would have to move back to my hometown and live with her. But I can't. I have eight families that despise me and bad memories almost everywhere I go - even in my own home. So yeah. Staying here wouldn't be good for my mental health.

I want to drop out so bad but I can't stay here. And I can't stay at college either because my GPA is shit. I don't want to move home so I need to think of a way to drop out and stay in Boise. I don't know what to say to my mom though so I am stuck in college. But I don't want to stay in school any longer.

658,"I’m going to start this with how we met and how the relationship was while we were together it’s been about a week since we broke up and it’s eating me alive. We first met while in college but I left to go work and she graduated. As soon as she was back around my city we immediately started talking and hanging out on weekends because we both work overtime jobs. We went on dates, I cooked for her, bought her clothes, and I was beyond happy. Everything was good until a week before thanksgiving and I was meeting her friends. I also have to add she’s been getting off antidepressants. When I was meeting her friends she told me she was going to come spend the night and that was the plan all night. As i was leaving her friends and asking if she was going to come over later she said no I’m going home. This was the first fight we had. I was upset because I wouldn’t see her for another week. Thanksgiving was great my family adored her and her dad even asked me to come fishing sometime. After everything was good until I invited her to hangout the next weekend but she said she was too busy but she had time for her friend. This obviously didn’t sit well with me and she said we couldn’t hangout until Christmas. I wasn’t happy about it but told her it was ok.

660,"Idk if this is the right sub for this, but I could really use some help... so if this isn’t the right one, if anyone can point me in the right direction, that’d be helpful! 

TL;DR I don’t know what career is best for me, wasted 2 years in a program I hated, and started having severe health issues that employers don’t really understand. Want to go back to college (preferably a 2 year program instead of another 4 year college, that will have jobs that can be flexible with someone who has health issues.) right now I have $2 in my account &amp; im behind on every payment I have, there are no assistance programs I’m eligible for, I have no family, my condition isn’t considered a disability, I can’t pay rent, the place I live has no job opportunities but I don’t have money to get out, and if I don’t find a solution, idk what will happen to me.


It’s a long story so I’ll try to make it as simple as possible, but you kinda need the full extent or it doesn’t make sense. 
I’m F(23)
I jumped into college not knowing what I wanted to do.Around 20-21 yrs old I started to realize idfk what I’m doing &amp; I dislike my major. So I took a break to think about it. I worked okay jobs for the next year, until I started having serious health issues. We’re still unsure of a pin pointed diagnosis but basically I have a rapid heart rate always above 120-140bpm resting rate, I have palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, extreme fatigue, shakiness, blurred vision, irregular beats, fluttering and the list goes on. I’m also hypoglycemic &amp; anemic. Ive had chronic migraines since 7 years old &amp; chronic kidney infections over the last 5 years. 

I’d always kind of dealt with these health problems but it seemed to be that this year for whatever reason they intensified. Basically since then it’s been a constant cycle of trying to find a job that’s understanding (without a finished degree) working there for a few months &amp; then having another flare up &amp; they fire me or I quit because they aren’t understanding. (Not understanding I mean: some employers threaten to take away paychecks if I couldn’t work a shift, yelling at me, refused to let me have days off to go to doctor appointments, made me wear my magnetic name tags even though the magnets mess up my heart monitor, making me wear sweaters in the summer to cover up my monitor, coworkers talking shit about me, threats of being fired because I was throwing up in the bathroom too much.) and no I am not kidding. 

I’ve tried 2 times now to go back to school to finish the psychology degree so I at least had something, because right now all I can get are terrible fast food, underpaid care work, or other miscellaneous entry level work for minimum wage. But I’ve realized I can’t afford to go back &amp; still have a job without completely destroying my health. 

I need to find some career path that will be flexible, won’t take me an additional 4+ years to finish because I don’t have the funds, time or assistance to not work while in school. Preferably a certificate program or 2 year program offered at a tech school, something that makes decent money. 

We live in a very very expensive college town where rent is $1500-2000 for a 2 bedroom, and minimum wage is $8.00 an hour. And there are little to no jobs here unless you a.) have a medical degree but we have literally the lowest rated hospital in the state b.) work at the college c.) are into farming/agriculture or d.) work fast food/retail/any other entry level job similar that will pay you less than $10 an hour &amp; no benefits. There are very little opportunities here. 


Right now I have my medication aide license. My nursing assistant license. I’m CPR certified. Crisis intervention training. Mental health facility experience. Banking experience. 2+ years. Management experience 2+ experience. Customer service experience, i was a cake decorator for a few years (I’m currently back doing this for the same business because I know the owner well &amp; he’s willing to work with me if I need a day off but I don’t even make $10 an hour.) 1 year done of my psych degree &amp; about 2 semesters worth of credits in criminal justice. I’m pretty good with computers. I own a small crafting business but it doesn’t make much income, it’s more or less an extra $50 a month, I am a pretty good writer and am very passionate about helping those in need (but can’t do the grunt work because pretty much ANY strenuous lifting, running, on my feet all day completely wipes me out &amp; I sleep for 2-3 days straight.)  

What the heck kind of career can i do?


Side note: I’m married. My husband also doesn’t have a great job. The initial plan was that he would work full time &amp; I would go to college, and then when I got a good job, he would go back to college. We basically have no one here to help us otherwise we could reach out to family or friends for help or advice. Neither of us are from the town we live in now.. but it’s one of those places that makes it impossible to leave, and you get stuck in this place forever. I’m estranged from my parents (I occasionally speak to my father, but my mom has bipolar that is untreated and is very violent/irritation and you can’t have a conversation with her because at this point she doesn’t live in reality.) I only have one friend, who isn’t the most well off either. My husband doesn’t have a dad. And his mom doesn’t talk to him unless she wants him to pay his part of their phone bill, she lives on the road and left the second he turned 18.) he doesn’t have any friends here since he’s only live here a few years &amp; doesn’t really get along with the people from here because he was raised in a completely different world. We want to move because of the lack of opportunities here, but like I said this place sucks you in.. it’s a never ending cycle... everyone who comes here never leaves, because all the jobs make it so you can ONLY pay your bills and even then sometimes it’s not enough. People just settle. And I don’t want to live like that. 


We don’t have a solution at this point... but we are so close to losing everything. We need to move somewhere there are other opportunities, or I need to go back to college, or I literally don’t know. 

Also, the condition they think I have is NOT eligible to receive disability, so that’s not an option. It’s not that it affects my life to the point I’d call it a disability and I wouldn’t want to take that money away from other people who CANT work. I can work, I just need someone to let me take a day off when I need it because when I keep pushing myself that’s when i get these flare ups.",23Dec2019,1

Keep in mind I’m barely even awake right now. I yanked the phone out of her hand and asked what the hell she was doing. All I can remember next is her being very angry with me and shouting at me but I’m so out of it that I couldn’t process it. It just made me cry hysterically because I felt so violated and could barely understand what has happening. 

About an hour later she came into my room said she was over it and we would talk about it later. I brought up that I felt violated because she broke a boundary, to which she said “since you handed me your phone of course I’m going to read what’s on it”.

If I try to talk about traveling alone, I will be told that I cannot, because I will get raped or get killed. It makes me think about what it would be like to be a man. It makes me think about how much freedom I would have being a man. On the other hand, I know I don’t feel like a man and I don’t identify as a man. Comments like these make me think of dressing up as a man just to do basic things like traveling. I know that is not going to work and it would make me feel uncomfortable. I also know the outside world can be very sexist towards women. I know my family is concerned about the world being a mean place. To a certain extent, I can understand that. However, there must be a middle ground here. Using critical thinking, this problem can be addressed. Continuing to live in the box that I’ve been conditioned to live in is not the answer. I identify as a woman, I am born with this biology, and there must be a realistic way to deal with sexism.

670,"My fiancé (27F) and I (25F) have been dating for over three years and are getting married in March. My family has never been anything but supportive of our relationship and treat my Fiancé like another daughter. Growing up, my parents had a quite a few gay and lesbian and friends, so same-sex relationships never seemed bad or out of the ordinary to me, until high school when other kids would give their opinion. 

My fiancé’s family is basically the complete opposite. “Religious people” who are distraught at the thought of their child marrying another woman. They haven’t attended church in years, and see no problem with their two sons having multiple children outside of marriage, or their other daughter living with a man she isn’t married to. I included that information because I think their hypocrisy is important for context. 

When we first got engaged, my fiancé called her father to tell him the news. He was not excited in the least, and told her that he doesn’t agree with it. I’ve known the family for the entirety of our relationship, and spent multiple holiday’s with them, rather than my own family, so his response took me by surprise. 

Yesterday, we spent the day at her parents house to do Christmas. At some point while I wasn’t around, she asked her dad if he was going to walk her down the aisle. He told her that he doesn’t know if he should and he would have to think about it and get back to her.

To the point where I just disappear. On top of this last month my step brother (who's 13) molested me. I'm 16 years old and have been having trouble with my father because he was negligent. I posted on [r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/e4jooi/i_need_help_with_my_step_brother/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) what happened and I got support from them (if you read that first thanks for helping me). 

When my mom found out she felt like she had failed in protecting me. My step father was very sorry about what his son did and understood if I wanted to press charges. But later there were custody issues involving my step brother, and my mother came in to talk to me about things. We got on the topic of pressing charges. This is what she told me:

""I know things are very difficult for you right now. And by me not pressing charges that would ruin our relationship, but I don't want to ruin my relationship with your step brothers. As they are more important right now."" 

I feel like absolute crap right now. But I can slightly understand why they are more important. Both are autistic, but my stepbrother who molested me is very high functioning to the point where you don't notice it if you don't know. My other step brother has a developmental delay and can take things the wrong way because the way he was raised (he was in foster for a long time), also I literally love him like a little brother and I would protect him with my life.

Yesterday, as I was about to leave their Christmas party, my very intoxicated guy friend pulled me aside and told me how I should come by more often. He hugged me but his hand started to slide to my lower back which made me very uncomfortable. Tried pushing him away, but he held on pretty firm. Managed to gain some distance but he hovered over my face like he was looking for a kiss and grabbed my arms to pull me in closer.

This isn't the first time something like this has happened - one time I received a christmas present from my grandparents and he insisted it stayed at his.

Initially i have no problems with this since she's probably really busy about things or she wasn't able to use her phone much (maybe it's broken or some sort), but the thing is, it isn't the case. I knew since i asked her as to why she would reply really late and she replied, ""because it's getting really tiring to go online and reply.""

In the USA. r/legaladvice thought my question was a bit vague and suggested I try here.

Tl;dr - My company’s Compliance/Legal dept. is taking the stance that we cannot assume delivery/receipt of appraisal reports when we send them by email, and this is causing delays and headaches. I’d like a strong leg to stand on to make an argument get this changed.

--------

I process mortgages and recently had situation that resulted in a delayed closing for our borrower. We emailed an appraisal to this borrower, but did not get a confirmation of receipt from them. The underwriter on this loan took the stance that without confirmation, we could not close the loan until three days had passed after receiving confirmation, which ended up delaying their purchase. This caused a lot of stress for everyone involved.

I have viewed https://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/regulations/1002/14/#14-1-1-Interp-4 which mentions (snail) mail specifically, then mentions delivery electronically must comply with the E-Sign Act.

I’ve also read https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201301_cfpb_final-rule_ecoa-appraisals.pdf which has a blurb that “Having different rules for different means of communications of the copies [of appraisals when being sent to multiple borrowers] would introduce additional complexity…” implying that e-delivery isn’t going to have its own set of rules.

The E-Sign Act https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/compliance/manual/10/x-3.1.pdf (short version) / https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-106publ229/pdf/PLAW-106publ229.pdf (long version), in summary, says the borrower has to agree to receive docs electronically, and we have to have evidence they possess the technology to get/access the docs electronically.

That blurb about having to have evidence of technology is what my company is clinging to as why we can’t assume delivery. They are claiming we have to have evidence for each document we send (that has timing requirements). My thinking is that we have already established the borrower possesses the technology because we have to send disclosures out at the very beginning of the loan. The disclosures are sent via DocuSign, as PDFs, and the appraisals are sent via Mercury (an appraisal management company/website) as PDFs. These are both email delivery systems that send the borrower a link that says “Hey, click here to get your document”. We get confirmation and records of the borrowers accessing and returning the initial disclosures, so it is a logical assumption they can receive the appraisal.

The initial disclosures are a much more urgent set of docs for us, so we are constantly reminding/urging the borrower to view and sign them. The appraisal being viewed is less urgent (to us) and it is pretty rare a borrower does not view it. But when they don’t, and we don’t catch it, it causes problems.

So, I’ve been unable to find anything I think is strong enough to overcome my company’s conservative stance on this; does anyone out there have experience with this scenario or otherwise know of some legal ruling/precedent I could refer to?

We first met on December 1st
Then when we started texting the next day he directly admitted that he licked me a lot and that he wants us to become a couple
I’m not  a very impulsive person so i told him to wait for at least a second date
Our second date went fantastic 
So this guys isn’t very chatty we usually just go eat listen to music and cuddle, hold hands and caress each other. Nothing sexual. 
The thing is. He is not this type of guy. He usually hooks up with girls for like a week and then leaves them. He hasn’t been in a long term stable relationship in a very long time. 
So he told me that with me it was different and he didn’t want to wait he didn’t want to lose me and he’d do everything to keep me. 
He has never tried to do anything to me nothing sexual no mouth kissing no nothing even though he had many chances. ( in our culture we don’t usually do that while dating but a lot do it, personally im not the kind of girl to do it. And he understood it without me saying anything) .
Our 3rd date went great too we did the same as usual: go eat then go hangout at a café.
After our 3rd date i started loosing interest like when I’m with him i dont feel like im flying anymore. But i still like to text him and talk to him.
Yesterday was our 4th date. He came totally stoned. We ate then took a walk then hang out at the café. I am going through some health issues so i told him everything about it i just talked about anything and everything he just kept staring at my  eyes and smiling at me. I dont say he was away in his mind he was following me like he knew what i was talking about etc but he didn’t react to anything he didn’t ask questions no nothing. He just never says anything. I know when he wants to say something i can tell he’s thinking about something but he never lets it out of his mouth. 
So yesterday after i came home i felt like shit. I felt like he is just passing his time with me and when he’s finished with me he goes home. It’s our 4th date and i still know nothing about him. He never says anything.


So at night when we were talking i confronted him about anything 
I told him i was having doubts because i dont know where is this going. I feel like we’re not moving forward we’re stuck in this routine. I told him how i feel like he is not interested in me thats why he never comments about anything i say or ask me questions. I told him everything about my feelings.
He told me that i should never say that again that he can never take me as a girl who he’s passing his time with ( its kinda true because he never tried to do anything with me. He respects me. But i feel like he is not sexually attracted to me) 
He told me that he is bot the kind of person who likes to talk( i already knew that since day 1) 
That when he’s in a good mood he doesn’t talk and when he’s with me he’s in a great mood. 
I told him that i dont like the idea of him being stoned ever time we meet and that made me feel like he’s incapable of being with me when his head is clear he said he understands and that he won’t smoke again when he comes to see me ( at first i thought that maybe him being stoned was the only reason he liked me in the first place but ive done some  research and understood that its not right)  and that the first time we met he wasn’t stoned.

Yesterday while we were together i met a fried and i introduced my boyfriend to him as being my friend.
So my bf asked why i did that i told him that i didn’t tell my friends yet about him and that i dont want a random friend to know about us before my close friends
At a moment while we were at the café i was talking and wining about stuff and he asked me what are we i said i didn’t know and apparently that hurt his feelings. I afterwords explained to him that i said that because of the feeling of our relationship not moving forward and the doubts i was having etc.
So now i feel stuck. I have doubts. I don’t know if this is something i want to deal with right now. I don’t know if we’re going to work or not and all these questions are triggering my anxiety. I feel overwhelmed and stuck. I’m afraid i made a mistake and i want to be able to end this rn before it moves even forward.

687,"I talked to a free counselor at my school last semester and I booked another free set of appointments this following semester, but it'll be with a different counselor.  I think it helped a little but I feel I had trouble communicating my problems a little bit and the sessions didn't feel very focused.  I also lied and claimed to not have suicidal thoughts even though I do.  I plan on telling my new counselor that I have suicidal thoughts, I'm not sure if I even care if I get committed or not.

If it matters, the issues I have are kind of ""forever alone"" type problems, even though I don't like using the term.  I'm a 25m virgin and I'm really struggling with figuring out how to get a date, which has always been a drain on my self esteem.

694,"Hello all, a bit of context. I started talking to this girl, call her F, a few weeks back. I got her snap from a mutual friend. Anyways, I had a party yesterday, and this mutual friend brought F along. Over the past few weeks, we snapped and even facetimed. We genuinely do have a lot in common and hit it off at the party (although it may have just been the drinks, I don't know). Anyways, during the party, we were flirting, dancing together and cuddled for a bit. It seems like there is a mutual attraction.

Now here comes the dilemma: She goes to a different school, about a 15-minute drive from me, and I can't really meet her in person to ask F out in person.

Would it be best to do it over snap? Phone call? Facetime?

695,"This probably isn't the type of advice typical for this page, but I need some help regardless so I'm here!  I appreciate any feedback I can get. 

My best friend since high school (we're both 37) passed away in October. It was a horrible situation that I'm still healing from. I sat by her bed at the hospital while she was dying. I sang at her funeral. We were very close. 

Her father is a very old man in his late 70's and I've been trying to help him out as much as I can. Now that Melissa is gone, he's going to move out of the family home she grew up in as it's too much for him to handle by himself. He's cleaning out the house, getting rid of things, packing, etc. His plan is to go move to a small house he owns in the country where most of his extended family lives. 

Here's what I need help with. Melissa had a very nice antique cabinet in her room, full of glass figurines and dolls. He doesn't have the room for them and would like to sell them to make some money for his move. Her medical bills and funeral pretty much drained him. I don't know much about antiques, but I do know some of these figurines are probably rare and worth some decent money. A lot of them were passed down from her mother. They are all old. Some around 20 years old, some probably closer to 50 years old. Or even older. I also feel like I recognize many of them as Hummels. (Sp?)

I've told her father I will take on the job of getting the items appraised and sold. But I have no idea where to begin. Honestly, it makes me sad that they need to be sold. They've got a lot of history and sentiment. But, the old man needs money, he's been like a second father to me since I was a teenager, and I'm going to do what I can to help him out. I feel like if these precious things must be sold, I'd like him to at least get a decent sum of money out of them. 

Does anyone have a clue where I can start with this project?  He's sending me some pictures as I type this (after I talked him through instructions on taking and sending pics from his phone) but I'm probably going to end up going over there the week after Christmas to get some more detailed shots. 

Any advice is much appreciated!  Thank you and Merry Christmas!",23Dec2019,1

699,"Hey, I'm 17 years old, (almost 18), and I'm passionate about writing in the film industry. Currently I'm writing my own animated show that I hope to be on NETFLIX. So far I have drawn all the characters myself and have made incredible progress on the story, but as of right now the story, or first season, isn't done yet. However, I'm currently taking the initiative to do research on the whole pitching/selling process. There is a site where I can pitch my idea and it have the potential to being reviewed and bought by a producer, which is great, until read more in to the site and it claims, 

&amp;#x200B;

""We manage to get the producers to use our clients’ screenplays about 60% of the successful pitches. For the remaining 40%, major studios are prepared to pay you for the idea and hire one of their own writers to develop the screenplay to their standards. The reasons are primarily because they don’t think that the script is up to standard or clients might not be willing to give away the rights for the script. No producer will choose to invest in a project to which they have not secured the rights. It is hard for studios to allow writers to have creative say on a project when they don’t have a pre-existing working relationship with them.""

&amp;#x200B;

I need help determining on weather or not this is the right move. Instinctively I would say no because I'm in love with my work and it enrages me when someone have the audacity to try to own my work. The site also says this,

&amp;#x200B;

""Along with the offer, we will send you a contract that assigns the rights to the idea. To most people, this contract may seem harsh, especially if you feel that this idea is “your baby”, you will need to assign ALL rights for the use and modification of your idea without any further reimbursement while you waive your rights to sue them for any reason. In reality, these contracts are standard practice. We negotiate all aspects of an offer including the amount, screen credit and the possibility of involvement in the project.""

&amp;#x200B;

Now my close friends told me to not do this but I don't think they understand that this the more reasonable way due to that I could either,

&amp;#x200B;

1. Keep pitching until a producer lets me be apart of it. (which could be unlikely) 

2. Try to negotiate with the producer, if it does get picked up, which ultimately I might not be even close to being satisfied. 

Or 3. Do it independently which most likely would consume way more of my time.

700,"This is essentially it. Everytime my sister (F27) brings her boyfriend(M34) around for family gatherings he tries to provoke me (M25) into all sorts of different arguments. The vast majority of what he does is based off of relatively private things my sister has told him about me. The thing is I never take the bait and just kind of brush off what he says. There has never been any bad blood between us, but he keeps searching for things to try to get a rise out of me. 

He knows I'm politically liberal based off of what my sister has likely divulged (I don't get political on social media) and will make some grandiose and aggressive statement about ""SJWs"" and ""cancel culture"" then immediately look over to me to see if I respond. (I don't) Another example is that he knows I meditate (which is also super private thing that I guess my sister told him about) and will start making claims about meditation cults and their evil and blatantly look at me for a response. (My typical response is ""wow that's crazy man"")

It's gotten worse in the past where he'll say something like ""your dad doesn't seem like that bad a guy. Why do you hate him?"" out of nowhere when I've never divulged any of my personal issues with him. (My dad and I are on pretty good terms these days anyway and he's not present for these comments at least) It makes every family gathering extremely uncomfortable, so I guess what I'm asking is how I address his passive aggressive behaviour?

704,"So I'm visiting my mom over the holidays, she lives in a single family home with her partner. And there is another guy (around 40) who is renting the basement at the moment. He does not work or ever leave the house because he has an disability and gets money every month from the government, which at the time I thought it was just physical disability. The renter's mother never disclosed what kind of disability he has, so my mom and her partner just brushed it off. The house doesn't have great sound proof so any loud noise can be easily heard.

Things were going great the first couple of months, the guy was so quiet it's like he's not even there. Then it would get worse and much worse over the months. He would talk to himself at random intervals during the days. He started to spout random foul words by himself at night, sometimes laughing uncontrollably, and then go on a sudden burst of rage, smashing things, followed by a loud disturbing shriek the neighbors could even hear. He then would go completely quiet like nothing has happened.

My mom's partner had talked to the guy before renting, but he seemed complete normal and nice as her partner would describe it.

We've been through this many times before when I come visiting, but today is the worse one yet, partly because I am alone in the house. The entire house was shaken and I almost had a literal heart attack. Now I'm starting to wonder if he does this every weekdays. Trust me, you do not ever want to be there when it happens. It's like real life horror, I don't think I have been through anything like this. And I'm pretty sure he broke things in the basement...

He would still do this when my mom and her partner is around, but not as worse this one. This went on for 5 minutes.

My mom and I were thinking about kicking him out, but we signed a 1-year contract which won't end until April, 2020.

710,"Before I go on, I need to explain some family history. 
When my sister (let’s call her Jane), came met a man (let’s call him Adam). She was at most 17, and he was around 40. He got her pregnant when she was 17 and he promptly fled. At this time, Adam was married to his third wife. About a year after her son, Jim was born, Adam started to get back in his life. My parents are devout Catholics, and they were desperate to make sure that Jim had a father figure. So, they let Adam live on our basement rent-free, and they even paid for a car for him and Jane to use, When they were living together, Adam and Jane would frequently get into arguments. I could hear them yelling at each other, and he punched a couple holes in the wall out of anger. When Jim was a toddler, they got into a fight and Adam left them for a while, but he did come crawling back. Eventually, though, they were married. After about two years of marriage, Adam began to cheat on Jane, and they eventually divorced and he left our home in Oregon to go to try and get back with a (married) ex who lived in New York. He left his son on the opposite side of the country the day after Father’s Day. 

Throughout this whole affair, both him and Jane have been deadbeat parents. Jane is 25 years old now, and has never worked a day in her life. She has no high school diploma, cannot drive,!rarely attend events with Jim, and lets my parents do almost all of Jim’s actual parenting. They are trying to raise Jim even while they take care of my brother Peter who has extreme Down’s syndrome. Adam has also been a deadbeat: he rarely spent time with Jim when he lived here, he never paid a cent towards Jim’s healthcare, and when he visited for Jim’s birthday in November, my parents paid for his plane tickets and he demanded that my sister pay him $300 in lost wages to compensate him for missing work to visit his own son. When Jim’s teachers ask him to describe his parents, he talks about my parents, not his actual parents. 

I thought that this would have been the end of this affair, but it turns out that this ex girlfriend of his wasn’t really interested in a new relationship. So now he’s coming back home. While he was gone, me and my sister would talk shit about him, but now she’s talking about how distance makes the heart grow fonder and that she wants to take him back. My parents are ready to let him live in our house rent free once more. 

I am concerned because I believe that Adam is a lazy, lying, serial adulterer. I think that rolling out the red carpet after he tried to abandon his son will only encourage him to act selfishly and do anything he wants to. The man is nearly 50 now and has cheated on 4 wives, and when he left for New York, he said that he didn’t want to have a family tying his life down. I do not believe that he will change. I think that he and Jane will keep arguing so loud Jim hears. I think that he will raise Jim’s hopes, only to dash them when he leaves for the next girl that he can find. 

There are two more complications. Obviously, as Jim’s uncle I do not have much power in this situation. Also, Jane is a flight risk: she recently came into a great sum of money because she received the balance of an educational trust her grandpa set up for her but she never used. My parents and I are afraid that she might at any time get up and leave, and we do not think that Jim would be safe and happy living with just her and Adam.

So I’m trying to get my first job. I called a grocery store and told them that I was interested and I applied online. The hiring manager took my last name said something along the lines of “I’ll check the applications later”

So far it’s been a week and I haven’t heard anything since. Should I call back and ask? Or does the hiring manager lost interest in me. I don’t want to come off as annoying. 

Any advise would be helpful, thanks",23Dec2019,1
717,"First time poster, I have been working with my current company for the last 4 years. The initial 2 years were amazing. My job role is a very niche role and you usually have 1 or 2 employees of my designation in the organization. Things started going down around a year ago, I had returned from an overseas trip(personal) and my health gave up. I had difficulty performing tasks and give updates. I knew I was not performing and when the appraisal season came I did mention the same and agreed for lower appraisal then. 

This past I have had my hands so many plates, where misses were bound to happen and they did. Along with this my personal life has not been that great for the majority of the year. I do agree this past one year my performance was not par expectation but was not bad either. But the think that broke the camels back was 2 weeks ago the client had emailed on a friday late evening(after office hrs) and we do not work on weekends, I missed responding till monday and this got escalated. I approached my boss and agreed I was at fault and promised to start taking steps for the same on Tuesday. There were no problems till Friday.

But today(Monday) I received an email stating I am on review for the next month or so and will be fired if I dont perform well. I am not sure how to react. If I had been ignorant about this and not spoken to my boss about this I would have definitely agreed on the action they have taken. but I did spoke to him, promised him i will pull up my socks here. i was devastated when I heard this. 

Financially I am okay for now, but have a few health related expenses inn the upcoming months. Hence I am not sure about leaving this Job. Should I just quit before things go out of hand or should I stay and salvage this situation.",23Dec2019,1

So I asked him why he had it cause he gets some, and he says it's like 2 of his friends that snap him. Then I said I would jokingly and then he right away says he got rid of it. 

When I asked him why he did that, he said ""I feel guilty you dont have it and I do"". Which is weird? I told him he has an instagram and I dont, and he was like ""I thought of deleting that too"". And that he honestly wouldnt care or notice if he did delete it.

726,"We’re all in college. End of first year, A, K, and I decided to rent an apartment together near our campus. Myself and A have 4 year degrees, K has a 3 year degree. The three of us are solid friends. After much trial and error we got a place and rented for 16 months, as I am currently on a year-long exchange in east Asia. In this country, subletting is illegal. A mutual friend of ours, E, took my spot on the lease (the lease is 3 equal signatures) and my room for this year. E also has a 3 year degree. I always intended on coming back, and was vocal about it. I always made my intent to return known, at the landlords’ discretion o course. Two months ago also I reached out to A, as K and E were finishing college this year and both publicised wanting to leave the country we go to college in, and asked if I can come back on the lease 100% after my year long exchange. I got my good graces In this country, school ends in mid-may. Where I’m at currently school ends in late June. I would be absent for the first month of the lease but still pay of course, as the current lease ends in May. 

Recently K had to take a leave of absence from college due to a health issue. She now has to come back on the lease next year to finish college. In hindsight, as it is 20/20, I should have talked more directly to E. But she did know from A and K that I was going to come back. I texted E last week as she went back to her home country for Christmas, and asked we sort this out ASAP, because her plans were completely unknown. It’s important to note neither her nor I are citizens of the country we go to college in, and I need to get an internship this summer as it will be the last year of my degree. I need to renew my residence permit in this country and need proof of address to do so. I told her this was important to sort asap because internship deadlines are flying by.

A and K don’t really mind who has the spot on the lease. They dont want to take sides, nor have I asked them too. I 100% respect that.

E did not text me for several days and last night after I asked for updates she told me she wanted to stay, and that “moving sounded like a pain” as she wants to get a masters but has to work for it first. She essentially said that because A and K told her they’re ok with her keeping the room (which is also what they told me) that she ‘doesnt really know what to tell me.’ Despite my clear intentions to return and that verbal agreement. 

I am offering a financial incentive to basically get my original spot back, which I again vetted 2 months ago. However I think she blocked my messages. People who know the four of those have tended to agree that E is basically in the wrong, but I don’t know what’s up. E is very secluded as a person and is hard to get to open up.

I showed her all of this and could you guess what she said? ""I know you're looking out for me but just trust me, ok?"" like BITCH NO. I don't mean to call her that but God fucking damn it, it's so frustrating having her worry her ass off cause she's never gonna meet this guy. She's literally their pay pig at this point.

733,"You ever try to picture something that you would consider sad in an attempt to see how you would react to it? And it constitutes little or no emotional reaction? I've pictured family members dying, terrible accidents, et cetera with no amount of emotional reaction. This is what evoked my curiosity to delve further into my psyche and the more I pondered, the more I saw an inclination towards sociopathic traits within myself.

There's a significant history of mental illness on both sides of my family, most prominent of which being **bipolar disorder**. It was easy to witness this illness in action growing up around my parents; constant fights were breaking out, multiple divorces, and a revolving door of strangers entering and exiting my life. Therefore my genetic predisposition is reasonably prone to some sort of deviation.

However, the man makes the man so I'll let my own actions speak for themselves. Growing up I was transitioning from school to school and states to states. Never really finding my footing within one community. I finally settled down in early high school in which I easily found a group of close friends (one of which I lived with for an extensive period of time) and dated multiple people, never holding a relationship for more than 5 months. I've pushed away those whom I care for the most a multitude of times, indicative of Borderline Personality Disorder rather than a sociopath.

Hello everyone, I \[24F\] was sexually groomed in high school  by a younger male teacher who was 27 at the time. It went beyond just inappropriate talking and there was contact and time spent behind locked doors, rides home from school, and physical contact like touching/groping. I even met his fiancé. Another student I introduced him to (my best friend at the time, J) was also groomed, and I am almost positive there was sexual contact between them before J was 18, but I know for a full fact that J continued a relationship with this teacher and his fiancé after graduation. At the time, I didn’t realize I was being taken advantage of, and I didn’t really recognize everything that was wrong – he preyed on me for being more mature and often overconfided in me, so I felt like this was a normal, mutual attraction situation.

This is how I also know he met his now-wife as a freshman in college….when she was a student in 8th grade. So this behavior didn’t start with me and J and won’t stop there. There was a vice principal at the school who seemed to be suspicious, and I am considering reaching out to her before calling the school proper.

I no longer talk to J and think we would disagree on whether this was really assault anyway, so I cannot involve them at all. It’s been 8 years since I graduated, but I know he still works at the school, and that he was briefly let go and then rehired (only rehired after the old principal retired, which to me implies people might have known what was going on).

So here’s my dilemma – how do I approach calling him out? He is mutual friends with people I know from high school still, so I considered making a facebook post and posting in my high school groups, but I want to do something more concrete, like make sure he is investigated and isn’t currently grooming another poor girl. So I know I have to call the school, but I don’t know the order in which to do things, as well as what I would say (how much detail is too much), who I would speak to at the school, or what my options even are besides pressing charges (no way I could afford a lawyer). Is this even worth bringing up? Any advice or reassurance is appreciated. If you’re going to question whether or not this happened – don’t. Why would I bother almost 10 years later if it wasn’t terribly traumatizing and creepy, and clearly inappropriate.

TL;DR – was groomed/touched inappropriately by high school teacher; found out he still is a teacher at the high school, want to expose him, how do without being sued or accused of defamation, also don’t want to press charges.",23Dec2019,1
742,"I am 32. I have been sitting in an apartment on disability for the past 3 years. I have been diagnosed with MDD, and ADHD. I used to have a pretty decent job, however, I smoked a bunch of spice thinking it was weed, had a psychotic breakdown, wound up in a hospital for a month or so, and when I got out of the hospital my car had been stolen, I'd lost my job, and my roommate had moved out.

743,"Basically I am failing high school because of my father.

745,"Okay, I could really use some advice but first I have to explain the context, it's a little long but it's a complicated situation.  


In 2016 my father went to prison for submitting falsified documents to the court, he was there for 3 months. His defence was that his girlfriend lied to him, and that's why the documents were wrong, but he was sentenced anyway.

She was also sentenced for that crime, AND another crime for calling in a bomb hoax to a primary school pretending to be another mother she disliked. She has always been, in my opinion, volatile and unstable and just generally unpleasant to be around. While he was away, he was venomous about her, blamed her for everything, told me to forget about her, etc.

Also while he was away, I struggled badly to take care of our household, my little brother, and him. I am still recovering from those 3 months, and I am literally not the same person I was before them. I never will be again.

This February, my father started his own business helping ex-offenders get back on their feet after being released, including helping them find work, open bank accounts, etc. I found out, not from him, that his ex was helping his work. I asked about it, and he told me she was doing leg work and driving around, never in the office. 

I found out later, also not from him, that she actually had a desk in the office and was employed full time.

Now, all of this, I didn't really care about. I don't hate her, I'm not even angry at her, I just don't care about her at all. I'm not interested in her, I don't want to be around her, and I don't really want her in my life. I told my father all of this, and I've told him multiple times. I've explained my reasoning very calmly and casually to him, I've never expressed any malice but it's been accepted that she doesn't come to the house. 

Until recently. While I was away for a few weeks, she apparently came to the house for dinner a lot. She has started coming to the house to give my little brother french lessons. And my father is going to see movies with her. 

For one, I'm just kind of disgusted with him about it. He swore when he was released that he would always put us first from that point on, that he wouldn't make the same mistakes again, but whatever he's an adult and he can do what he wants even to the detriment of his family. 

But I told him again, that I don't approve and I don't want to be around her. Because of this, he knows that if she is in the house, I won't be. Even if he didn't like it, he's accepted and respected it. I've also explained in the past that yes I do believe people can change for the better, and yes I do believe that ex-offenders should be given the chance to find a life again after being released, but it doesn't change my mind about her. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, tonight, he texted me that he's invited ""everyone"" to dinner for the holiday. Usually this means another family with kids that we usually have over. But, I didn't like the way he vaguely said ""everyone"" since he usually just says the ""*lastnames*"" are coming over. So when he got home, I asked him who was coming over and he said that his ex was coming over too. 

I was so surprised I just kind of stared at him for a few seconds, and then said ""okay"" and walked back into my room. he followed me, already angry and raising his voice, and said ""is this how it's going to be? Is this how it's going to be from now on?""

I tried to remind him that I'd told him how I feel about her, I also tried to ask him if he wanted me to just pretend I was okay and smile and lie about it, but he just kept asking and yelling, so I said ""Yes"" and he left. 

Then, he sent me a text that I think he meant for someone else, and he had the following conversation over text:

    Dad: Ive had a blazing row with iknowimwrong33
    
    Me: I wouldnt call it a blazing row since you were the one doing most of the yelling but okay
    
    Dad: Yeah well, when you look at me with such venom in your eyes it feels like that.
    
    Me: It wasnt venom. It was shock. You know exactly what my position is about her, I've been as calm and clear about it as I can be. I havent been malicious or even cruel to her or to you about her. I don't want her in my life, I dont want to be around her. I felt like that wasnt a huge ask. I didn't know the two of you would be working together, or pursuing anything further. I was mostly shocked you didnt even consider just telling me that she would be coming. Did you expect me to just accept it when she arrived because it would be indecent and too late to make a scene? What did you think would happen?
    
    Dad: Don't worry. She isn't coming. I've nothing I say. She is not coming.

And that was the end of it. We had dinner with the other family who came. He put on that he was fine and cheery and didn't care. I'm not even mad to be honest, I'm just kind of tired and annoyed. I don't think I'm wrong to hold my ground on this. I shouldn't have to let someone in my life that I don't want in my life, no matter the circumstances. But I know this is going to be a growing issue between me and him and I don't really know what to do about it. He's never been someone I can just talk to, he's not someone you can really argue with, and I live with him at the moment.

750,"My (24) current boyfriend (30) and I have been best friends for about 5 years now and we’ve been together for a few months. He has a 9yo who he has all of the time except weekends. I understand that she comes first is his life. Until recently, I lived about 3hours away from him and visited him every weekend for almost a year; until I got a new job and didn’t have weekends off anymore. (There were other personal reasons that happened in that time, but isn’t relevant to this story) He then started giving me shit for never visiting anymore. In the 5years we have known each other he only visited me 3 times and only stayed for a few hours before returning home. He has been to Vegas and Mexico for long weekends several times with his friends, but wouldn’t stay for the weekend with me. 
Now, for personal/family reasons, I moved 1000 miles away and have no money to fly to visit him. He, on the other hand would be able to visit me up here with little issue. His only reason for not visiting is that he doesn’t want to be so far from his daughter. I understand the hesitation, but also, he has been far from her on other occasions. 
I feel like I am the only one putting in any effort to visit  and if I bring it up to discuss he just gaslights me and gives me shit about not wanting to visit them or whatever.  I don’t really know what to do.",23Dec2019,1
751,"Seeking some life advice and reddit seems like the best option for me right now. 

I (23M) feel so lost in life right now I honestly have no idea what to do and it’s putting a tole on my mental health, physical health, and my relationships.

We can start from the beginning but I’ll try to be as brief as possible. I grew up with a very loving and supportive family, my dad was on top of the world financially when I was a kid but that all came crashing down soon after. He lost most of his money and turned to alcohol right away. My mother divorced my father when I was about 10 years old. Unlike most divorced parents, mine are still very close and talk to each other most days, even though my mom remarried and my brothers and I moved to a different town. 

I was able to graduate high school with a pretty below average gpa. I was one of those kids that just hated going to school. Never really pushed myself to get better grades, I always just tried to get by. I played sports regularly, had a great social life, but dealt with some mental issues like depression and sometimes thoughts of suicide (even though at the time I knew I would never actually go through with it). I fell in love with a girl during high school, we dated for about a year then broke things off when I went to cc.

Flash forward post high school. I attended a community college and most my friends were going the university close by. About a year into community college, two close friends of mine asked me to move with them to a different area and start our own business. This time was probably the healthiest I was in my life and I was being very productive. I was working out, eating healthy, and making okay money. 

Eventually our business started failing because there wasn’t an even distribution of work between my two partners and I. One of my partners and best friends came from a very very wealthy family. He started dating a girl and basically the whole business fell apart. 6 months later they broke up and my friend ask me to move to another city with him to his parents house. (They owned many houses but this one was a straight mansion)

I was a weird lifestyle for a little bit, I was living in a huge mansion with two of my best friends but yet I wasn’t making any money, and I was just parting all the time. I was working out, talking to a lot of women, and I was very active on social media. 

It ended up just being too much for me. I couldn’t live this rich ass lifestyle when I wasn’t the one making the money. I contacted a friend from highschool that lived in the same city, I asked him if he wanted to get a place with me. Soon after that we got a 3 bedroom together, me, him, and my very rich friend wanted a room even though he was never there. 

One day my roommate came up to me and asked me for permission to take my ex girlfriend out on a date, I politely said no and gave him my reasoning. She was my first love, we took each other virginity, I feel like that type of thing is special and I wouldn’t want my “friend” who is very disrespectful towards women to date her. 

Soon after that I found out they began a sexual relationship. I packed up my things and drove up to my hometown. Through all of this I was still paying rent for about 4 months and ended up losing our whole entire deposit after the lease ended because my stupid friend wasn’t taking care of the place. 

I began to isolate myself heavily after that and began to play video games a lot. (I always loved video games) it was my escape from reality. Soon after living alone and feeling really depressed for a while, I found out my father had a stroke and broke his neck in a few places. My father was in a way better place than his alcohol days, he was running a business and sober before the accident. Through all of this he basically lost his whole business and it started bringing back his old drinking habits. He also developed a pretty bad nerve disease.

My dad told me numerous times he just didn’t want to live anymore, and it just broke my heart. As a person that deals with a lot of depression and suicidal thoughts it just made it worse. I hate talking about my problems. 

Fast forward to today, my dads accident was about 1.5 years ago. I have been dating a new girl, and I am absolutely in love. We have been dating for a year and she also deals depression as well. (She grew up in foster care and her mom was a druggy) her family doesn’t really talk to her. 

We have both been isolating ourselves heavily this year, not really going out with our friend anymore, staying inside watching movies and playing games instead of going out and doing more productive things.

At this point, I’m just lost... I feel like I’m drowning. I have no money, no job, we share her car, can barely pay bills, fix her car, I don’t know how to pay taxes since I’ve always been under my moms. 

I feel Ike I’m failing as a boyfriend and a son. I constantly have to ask my parents for money even though they barely have any but I have no other choice unless I want to go live on the street. I can’t buy my girlfriend or my family presents for the holidays and it honestly just makes me feel like a piece of sh*t. 

At the beginning of November I drank too much and put myself in the hospital, coming close to dying. I had no insurance at the time and I got a bill in the mail for $4,000. My mom has always put me on her insurance even though I haven’t seen a doctor in a long time. (I am also on her taxes) 

I’ll try to wrap things up here. I need some advice on how to get back on my feet again. I am still dealing with my depression everyday and feeling so bad about myself. One bad thing after another keeps a happening to me. How do I stop drowning? I can’t take another year of this...

Thanks for listening.

758,"20F here. Have an awesome relationship with my boyfriend 20M. He’s in school has his life in order. I’m taking a gap year (both sophomores in college) because my anxiety was very bad (seeing a therapist for it now), interfering w my schoolwork and also I was switching my major and I didn’t wanna blow my money being in school when I couldn’t focus for a number of reasons. 

My friend group is very small right now. I have about 2 girl friends but I see my boyfriend the most because he’s the most fun. I feel like my anxiety is hurting my relationship w my best friend and my other close friend well we just haven’t been hanging much even though we talk everyday. 

I try not to depend on my boyfriend too much emotionally. Yes he’s aware of my anxiety but he’s not my crutch. I don’t want live through him. 

I know I need friends but I’m bad at approaching especially since I’ve been out of the social scene for awhile now because of not being in school. 

I need a part time job too. I’m about ready bc anxiety is getting better. I also need to learn to want to approach people because I want friends I just get nervous. I don’t appear it but I feel it and it steers me away. On the outside I look like a pretty and normal girl. 

Boyfriend is great to me and I could easily see him everyday but obviously I need balance in my life. More friends. To get back in school soon. A part time job. I do have my hobbies but I just need more people to do things with. 

Boyfriend is always eager to hangout so he tags along with me a lot but I keep in check how often I see him.

763,"I am currently studying biology in my undergrad.  I had a plan freshman year to go to dental school, but it just fell off the rails. I now have a 2.7 gpa and people who have been in and are applying to dental school know that this isn't good enough, since schools look at 3.0 gpa's or higher. I have lost my interest in dental school, thinking about it makes me sick. Sitting there operating on teeth just doesn't appeal to me anymore, and I am unmotivated to even look at schools I want to apply to. I want to get my MHA and go into healthcare administration, something that requires less schooling and I feel will be a better fit.

I recently just brought up to my parents my gpa is not good enough for dental school, and they're so adamant on making me still apply. They are extremely pushy, and it breaks my heart to have to tell them I don't want to and also am not good enough to get in to dental school. I am expecting worlds of disappointment and embarrassment, and I feel like it will crush me. They are paying for my undergrad so I feel like if this disappoints them enough they will stop paying for it, and I am unemployed. I am extremely nervous to sit down and tell them because my mom always has a negative opinion on any change, and will present her negativity without any evidence to back it up. She acts extremely defensive when told she is wrong and she has a short temper, and I don't know how I'm going to get through to her, or my dad. I am really afraid of the outcome.

770,"This is just a shit storm to post but I need advice. I don’t know what to make of all of this. This guy and I, we’ll call him Ted. Ted and I had been involved for a year and a half as a FWB dynamic - yet this soon quickly turned into FWB plus feelings on both ends. Ted and I saw each other often. He had sex with another person along the way that he was open and honest about and I moved along as he was not committed to me and had no right to be upset. 

Fast forward to August of this year, Ted randomly blocked me on all social media after posting a Snapchat story of another girl - we’ll call her Sandra. I tried to ask if he was sleeping with her and got no response. 3 weeks later he posted that he was moving to Montana (we’re from Michigan). I tried to talk to him before he left and I got no response. NOT knowing he had a girlfriend at the time before he moved he asked me to come over and we had sex and also a small heart to heart. Come to find out Sandra and Ted were a package thing while he lived in Montana and when we had sex, while she lives here in Michigan still. She even flew out there to visit him during thanksgiving. 

I have not intervened. Not told Sandra directly about Ted and I’s hookup as it wasn’t going to change anything. Yet she still found out through word of mouth. 

This last Saturday I get a call from Ted, 18 in fact, asking what I was doing and how I was. He was and is home in Michigan. He said, “I haven’t even been home for 16 hours and you’re the first person I call.” He also told me he loved me which I’ve never heard him say before. All while still having Sandra as his girlfriend. He stated, “you’ve helped me grow and I needed/need you.” He asked me to come over and have sex with him also.

All very confusing naturally. I’m taking it with a grain of salt. 

Then some alarming points were brought up to me by him. He somehow knew things about me while living in Montana. It felt like he was keeping tabs on me. He said, “I’ve been shown screenshots of things you’ve said about me leaving and being with Sandra.” (Well naturally as I was upset). He also said, “if he lost Sandra it would kill him” and “she might move to Montana with me” after being together, long distance for 3 months.

He even somehow knew men from our hometown who have been trying to have sex with me.  He said, “yeah I know *insert name* has been trying to have sex with you” and “if you had sex with *different so and so* I’d laugh.”
Very concerning, very creepy in my opinion.

All in all the jist I got from it is that he’s been keeping tabs on me. Also don’t really think he cares about his girlfriend if he is saying all of this stuff to me and tried to cohort me over for sex. 

I don’t know what to think of it. He said this is the last time I’ll hear from him but I don’t feel like that’s the case.

I’m a sarcastic person but, even if I explain that I’m not serious and that it was a joke, she’ll still take it seriously, my other friends also agree that this is really annoying.

776,"There is this guy who I became friends with through my mum. Him and my mother met through her job, she sells her prints/artwork in the centre of town. He used to be a marshal there(basically a security guard who also guide the tour buses and keeps track of the tourists).

I used to hang out with my mum in town at her job and help out and through that I met this guy. We would joke around a lot and since I make sex jokes with people A LOT I did it with him as well, never about us two specifically tho(nothing that could be interpreted as flirting)just sex in general. He would make jokes too. He was fine during that time.

A while later, he changed jobs to an actual security guard in a different area to where my mother worked so we stopped seeing eachother. I said to my mum that I missed him cuz he was a fun guy and I considered him my friend, and I had even met his daughter and wife. Me and him got back in contact cuz of this, he got me to get WhatsApp. I did and he acted surprised, saying “you got it, just for me 😍”. The heart eyes was a bit of a weird thing in my mind, especially cuz I’m under 16,but i let it pass. We continued sometimes having chats about things people normally do.

Then once I said I was gonna be going on holiday near a beach and he asked “got your bikini packed yet?”. Again I thought it was weird but I let it pass again and I brushed him off, saying that it was gonna be cold so no bikinis

Now, more recently he WhatsApped me again, we hadn’t talked in a while since I was kinda trying to avoid him cuz of the stuff he had said cuz I felt a bit uncomfortable. During this conversation I told him I got a boyfriend and said “no we haven’t had sex before you ask” as a joke, cuz that’s kind of our thing. His response was “honestly I wasn’t thinking about whether you had sex, I was thinking about how you got a boyfriend since you never go out”. And then I told him how I was surprised he didn’t think of that cuz my friends ask about if me and my boyfriend fucked all the time(as jokes). And he said “well I’m not like other people, besides there’s always time for you to tell me that 😋, after all, I’m probably gonna get your clothes off first” and that he “still Had to get [me] swimming sometime lol”. I felt really uncomfortable and I didn’t respond. He said “nothing to say to that?” And then I blocked him. I sent screenshots to my friends and they all said I should tell my mum, my boyfriend even got angry at me for refusing to tell my mum and refused to talk to me for the whole of the next day.

I don’t want to tell my mum because I don’t want to stress her out. She already has a lot on her plate being a single mum and when she gets stressed out she drinks and I don’t want to deal with that. I could tell my dad but he doesn’t live with us and he doesn’t have much control over the family cuz of my mum so there isn’t much he can do.

How bad is this situation, I know it isn’t great but I’m not sure how serious it is, I tend to have a habit of not taking things that could put me in danger seriously because I have been through sexual trauma before so my brain is desensitised to it, so I dont know if this is that serious or not.

777,"16F; I’ll call my mother’s (42F) boyfriend Dave (27M) and his father John (~65). Dave and my mom started dating maybe a year after my father passed in 2017. Shortly afterward his dad moved in because he was recently divorced for the 4th time, didn’t work and didn’t have enough income to live by himself. John was a heavy alcoholic at this time, 6-10 beers and a bottle of wine heavy alcoholism. 

During this time he did a lot of things that didn’t sit well with anyone—stealing food, breaking things (including a whole glass sliding door and pretending it wasn’t him). Other examples are when he walked into my sister (23F) in the bathroom and pretended he didn’t know she was in there (she was playing music loudly and the lights were obviously on), when I caught him standing in my doorway while I was sleeping. There was another time he randomly stopped me as I was walking back into my room to tell me he had a gun, right in front of both my mom and Dave. 

There was one thing that happened that still makes me sick; he was really drunk one night, fell onto the ground out of a chair and yelled my name for me to help him. I lifted him up and placed him back into the chair, which in itself made me severely uncomfortable as I really don’t like touching people for a lot of reasons. Then he said “thanks, sweetie pie” and I noticed he had an erection. I hate names in general and that one specifically will still instantly make me feel sick a year later. 

One night he got into two bottles of gin that were specifically stashed away from his reach. That night was a clusterfuck and he was hospitalized. For a few months he did not live with us, and I was happy for a bit until he moved back in. 

While he no longer drinks (only drinks non alcohol beers) me and my sister have both caught him on several occasions bringing cases of alcoholic beers home in a sneaky fashion. He has gotten close to relapsing a few times which has made me nervous, and the only one keeping him in check is Dave who is gone 5 days a week. 

My mom thinks I’m rude for not liking being around John, I still respond if he asks me basic questions and I stay neutral. I hate the pressure of having to be nice to a man that’s made me uncomfortable in my own house, as a result I never leave my room. The thing I hate about all of this is that I feel like I’m overreacting and crazy. I’m made out to be the asshole whenever I finally establish my own boundaries and don’t want to bend over backwards for the people that make me uncomfortable, including my sister. 

The only option I feel like is telling my mom about the aforementioned incident with him falling out of the chair, but there’s too many ways for that to go wrong I’m worried.

He cannot go anywhere else without taking my moms boyfriend with him and I don’t want to separate them since it’s what makes her happy.

779,"I am in university and have an internship at a company. I got the internship a few months ago. I was taking two classes this last semester and unfortunately of my 3 classes I failed one. I was put on academic probation due to my semester I was not doing well. I was studying hard this semester but yet failed a class. Being on academic probation I cannot return this semester until the next semester. Due to my previous semesters and going down hill I am trying to turn it around.

I was proud of this internship as it will help my career. They do not ask for grades but where do I go from here? Do I talk to my advisor and see if they would allow me to take classes. What do I do about my internship? If I am not taking classes they may be suspicious or not want me there since I’m not taking classes at the moment. I don’t want to tell my job I can’t return for a semester because I don’t want to be let go. I’m lost and don’t know what to do.

“Aron should ask Liam instead what’s going on with his backdoor...shemale...need I say more?”

785,"I (19M) am thinking about leaving my 5-month long boyfriend (19M).. i still havent come to a decision so i came to you guys. Oh and just a heads up english is my second language so im sorry for the grammatical errors.

 Me and my boyfriend have been each others first everything's, and at first it was pretty nice, heres our story. This last summer, my best friend got super mad and blocked me on everything and told me we would never be friends again, and since i didnt have any other friends i was super depressed and alone all summer, to the point where i cried almost daily (i also had a humongous crush on him and that was mostly the reason of our separation and why it made me so sad), but then i met jim (not his real name and my current boyfriend) online, playing video games.

We talked and played from the moment we woke up to the moment we fell asleep, in that time i got to know him and his friends. I had already met jim before, he studied with me in highschool and thats why it was easy to talk to him, even though we had only interacted like 2 before this summer incident. In that time i found out not only that he was gay, but that he had a crush on me. I was still going through the heartbreak of losing my best friend/crush but after one month of playing with jim and his friends he decided to ask me to meet me in person and tell me that he liked me. At the moment i honestly felt like i did too because he made me happy and worried about me and kept me company in those dark times, so i told him i did too and we made our relationship official.

At first it was great, the honeymoon phase, but even then he showed some red flags that imma mention in a bit. This was around august, college was starting again and that meant i was gonna see my exbest friend again in all my classes. Imma skip a bit, but i ended up patching things up with him and we became really good friends again. But in that process i was going out a lot with my boyfriend to drink and hang out with his friends, but in that time he showed me a side of him i havent been able to shake off to this day. He always tried to make me do things i didnt wanna do, that included sexual things (like insisiting we had sex even when i didnt want to) but it was mostly nonsexual things, like insisting that i drink or insisting that i stayed at his house when i didnt want to... but when i say insist.. i mean a nonstop beg-fest until i said yes, there was no way i could say no because it honestly was just a waste if time, once he begged for, and im not kidding i looked at the clock, 30 minutes or so. It was honestly a horrible experience. Very rarely i could pull off saying no, but in every one of those cases he got really mad and didnt talk to me until he calmed down (which was a long time).

I remember one time, i went to visit him because i hadnt seen him in like 4 days and wanted to spend some time with him. I told him i had to be home by 10 oe 10:30 because i had a test in 2 days and i wanted to study. Everything was fine until the moment i told him i had to go. He locked me with his body so i couldnt move much and told me that i should stay with him, and i told him i had to go study, it was a back and forth that lasted like 15 minutes.. then i got pretty tired and mad about the whole thing and shook violently until he let go (he wasnt geniunely being a bad person he thought it was all in good fun but i was pretty annoyed and mad). But when i finally got off of his lock he took my keys and ran off with them and hid them, i was so mad i literally told him i would walk home, but in that moment he took his house keys and locked the entrance (his entrance is key-only) and hid those keys as well, then dragged me to his room. At that moment i got really scared and annoyed and told him to let me leave in that instant or i would scream, he took it as a joke but when he saw i was serious he gave me the keys and didnt talk to me as i left his house. This happened over 2 months ago, and we talked about it and he said he was sorry.

Jump to this month (december), (ill jump over some details because i noticed im making this too long) i had my college finals and i was studying very hard for them and i couldnt visit him much or text him much, he got reaaaally toxic and depressed about that and we fought a lot that week, i finished my finals (and did great even with all the issues) and needed some time to just sit back and rest. He then again got really mad and toxic because he *needed time with me* and even went to my house when i told him not to, i ended up driving away on my own car to get away from him.. he eventually came back to his senses and said he was sorry about all of it and i firgave him, and up until now we havent had any fights but it has been weird between us... but all this alone time has given me a chance to think about this whole thing and ive come to the realization that he doesnt make me hapoy anymore.. i fear im holding on hope that things will get better in the future but i really dont know anymore.. everytime i think about him i just remember all these dark moments (i didnt mention a lot of them) and i just get unhappy at the thought that this is the man im planning to marry... and through all of these issues my best friend has been theee for me supoorting me and helping me get through all these issues... and i fear i mightve fallen for him again... i fear i might lose both of them if i dont do the right choices and i dont think i can handle that.... what should i do...?",23Dec2019,1

 I didn't tell Naomi where lived instead I asked why do you want to know. After that Naomi didn't respond, but a few minutes later Naomi responded with Sorry for asking that.

I told Naomi that it's fine, so I carried on with talking to Naomi. We talked for a while about gaming and etc but then Naomi asked me what I was doing, Naomi had asked me what I was doing a couple times already so I didn't over think it and said nothing.

I asked Naomi the same question which Naomi  responded with nothing LoL, so I jokingly said sounds fun Lol. Then Naomi replies Lol and then asked if I lived in Masterton.

Which I will say creeped me out, even though I don't live anywhere near Masterton because Masterton is in New Zealand and I live in the United States.

800,"I met this guy on Facebook is probably 2012 or 2013.  Chatted a bit, tried to be nice to him because he seemed kind of lonely, he was deaf and didn't get out much and seemed to have no friends. 

I soon realized he was very off. Be it his lack of social experience or interacting with people, or what, but he was just weird. I basically stopped talking to him after he started getting weird and making and asking inappropriate questions. Ended up blocking him on Facebook, Instagram, the lot. I will note I have never once even met this person in real life, and only spoke to him online for maybe a month if that. 

From then on he made it a mission to stalk my life and those close to me. Because he is deaf he has a very distinct way he writes. He writes almost how sign language would be if a written language. Very broken, missing words. It is an instantly recognizable form of writing, which always clues me in that it is him. 

Since about 2014 he has:

-Made fake Facebooks of an ex boyfriend, messaged me telling me to kill myself. 

-Made fake facebook profiles of ME messaging boyfriends telling them I was cheating on them and hated them. 

-Tried to hack into almost all of my social media accounts, would get dozens of ""you requested a password reset"" emails daily. 

-Messages the people I am dating from his actual account saying horrible creepy things. 

-In 2017, made a fake Ok Cupid profile of me, with a disgustingly sexual bio. Included my facebook profile link and my ACTUAL phone number. Cut to me getting about 50 random texts out of no where within a matter of an hour or so. He also copied my ENTIRE LinkedIn profile into the description box of the profile, showing everyone where I worked, went to school, etc. 

It's been 2 years since I had heard anything and today I got a text from my recent ex that he had made a new Facebook and was sending him messages again about me. He included screenshots. 

When he made the fake dating profile we actually contacted his brother on Facebook and told him if he didn't stop we would contact the police. His brother said he told him to stop, and basically acknowledged he knew it was him who made the profile.

My house currently has Comcast and we have  six adults living here who all use data for something.

There are multiple game consoles in our home and we all have smart phones and all stream videos, which apparently an hour of streaming takes up a gig or a half a gig alone. So six people living their lives over an entire month can add up pretty quickly. 

Apparently there is no bigger plan for us to use and it is not based on amount of people, my

Our other friend asks to join us, we let her in. Keep in mind, the shed is now almost full, unless we stand on a big pile of firewood, which I decided wasnt a good idea. Some girls I hardly know come along and ask to come in I say no, there isn't any space. 

They then proceeded to shove their way in, and record us for a minute, while accusing us of being racist because we let one of my friends in when there was space, who just happens to be white and we wouldn't let five other people in, one of whom happened to be black.

Im open minded an can talk just about anything (hate that it sounds like I'm toting my own horn, just tryna give a picture lol). 

I treat people how I wanna be treated. So women tend to just befriend(friendzone) me cause I'm friendly an I guess I'm not like other guys an get straight to it. I like to get to know them first. I do love giving compliments, letting them know that their outfit looks nice or their hair looks good, I know women like to hear these things. You know, someone acknowledging what they did to get ready for the day. I crush really easily, so in my head we're dating, having fun, great great sex, on occasion I'll see a child (depending on the lady), an then it goes away pretty fast cause I'll see someone else.

 I know what kind of woman I want, I feel like shes the rare type an maybe thats why I feel like I havent haven't gotten any luck. I have insecurities (as well all do). I sweat alot, I'm a pretty big guy, I feel that I can be to weird, but love a great conversation about life an goals she wants to accomplish an try an help her achieve those goals. 

When it's all said an done my biggest insecurity is my penis size. Its average, (which in guys world, thinking they know women, its small) an im currently trying to lose weight just to get it bigger (the shxt we do for women lol). I know some women dont mind it, but I feel like a inch an a half more would be nice, an some more hang time lol. Not only that, but I have the opposite of ED. It doesnt take much for me to get erect. Even something simple as a hug (depending on the person). With all that, my sex experience isnt that high, because who wants to date a guy where whenever you guys just cuddle he gets a boner. I'm afraid their going to get tired of that alone in itself. I'm scared I'm gonna be alone forever cause it's the same pattern, and I live in my head too much (even though oddly I know I'll find someone). 

Sorry for the length, I've had this build up in for years an never said it outloud, this all kinda of just poured out 😅. Could really use some advice/help. Feel free to ask questions I'd be glad to answer them

Thanks

What i got was:  A hoodie with his favorite football team, fun socks you wear to work, they have golden retrievers on them bc he has a full breed golden retriever puppy. Then I found a cinnamon apple candle bc recently he bought a candle and now he just loves candles. Now  feel like the hoodie is okay although its gray rather than the team color (red) but the socks are kinda weird and the candle is definitely a weird gift for a boyfriend. Now I'm so insecure and I want to return it all and make a Blanket online and add photos myself and base it  off of his favorite team.

I got her this cute pot holder set, a keychain lanyard (because she ALWAYS loses her key, and we always joke about how I'm going to get her one so she doesnt lose it anymore) then for her stocking a got a loofah, fuzzy socks and boot socks. Also some candy and her favorite drink flavoring.

828,"    Husband(37 m) doesn't 'do reddit'. So, I'm here on his behalf for advice. 

    Husband currently has an upper management job in retail. Good pay for the area, horrible hours. 80+ a week, no days off as he is salaried. He literally works 7 days a week. Sometimes 18 hours a day. He has been in this position about 2 years. He is, understandably, burnt out. So I urged him to put in some applications for other management type jobs in the area. Here's what happened.

    He interviewed today for an assistant District Manager type position for a well known fast food company. He has another interview Friday with a higher up to discuss job duties in more detail and salary. But we're pretty confident it will be similar hours with somewhat higher pay. Meh. Depending on pay, this option would allow myself to quit my part-ish time job to focus on my upcoming schooling and my not so great health. (Nursing School. Eek.) BUT. He will most likely still have loooonnnngggg days with minimal time off. No bueno. Onto option 2. 

   My husband is ex military. He loved it. Wanted badly to stay in but was given a medical discharge. Also he is ridiculously strong. He loves working out and used to work odd bouncing jobs years ago and really misses it. He's a large guy with a pretty good temperament and great personal morals. All that being said, the local city police station has been asking him for over a year to join the force. Kinda joking at first, but last week the Chief of Police personally asked him to join. Brought him the forms to fill out and told him *he* would be his reference.... he's always been interested in being a cop. I'm a bit scared by the idea. For obvious reasons. But we live in a TINY southern town. Not a lot, if any, hostility towards the police in general. No major incidents in years. Good pay, more than he makes now but just a bit. This job would probably cause some tension in our marriage due to my anxiety and ocd. More than usual, anyway. Also, nursing school would more than likely get put off...again.

837,"My house has a shared driveway with the next door neighbors, but ever since we moved in, no one has lived there. Somebody bought it for remodeling around 2 years ago, and even though it’s done, there are still people constantly there working on it. I’ve seen the HVAC truck in the driveway at least once a month, but usually more. Staging furniture is stored in the garage, and is constantly switched and moved in and out of a truck. All of the services I’ve seen have been third party, which is fine, but some have been kind of sketchy seeming (unmarked vans with stickers referencing sex on the back window), and numerous times my family and I have arrived home to find a van, which we assume is HVAC, parked in the back yard of that house with the headlights on, implying that there are people working. We know the contractors car and majority of the time, he isn’t there while the people working are. 

These people have caused issues for us in the past. Our yard isn’t fenced towards the driveway, and for majority of summer they had a pickup truck and trailer parked in our backyard, plus they always park in the middle of the driveway or in front of our garage. When we got the driveway replaced, they pretty much refused to get the right permits, all the while blaming us for having the wrong ones. They also payed the bills for the driveway the day before we would have been charged extra, but during the paying window (approx. 6 months) they continued to get work done. 

I haven’t seen any of the bills on this place, so I don’t know how the numbers compare, but I still feel like money laundering or something else illegal is going on. We live in a suburb of a big city, so something like that isn’t totally unknown.

So here’s the main part of it. A friend(M20s) of mine(F20s) started asking me and a few other girls We know to smell our feet for a large sum of money. This started about 3 years ago. All of us girls laughed it off and would say no. He was pretty persistent thou. There was just something about it that seemed so strange. That means a lot coming from us because we’ve always been a rather weird group of friends. Not much could be said or done that we’d think much of. But this was just different. 

We all went on ignoring it and went about our lives making jokes about it. “Hey ant, sniff any pretty toes lately” and he would laugh but then go on to explain that he was dead serious. 

Now he’s moved on to asking me and another friend to talk down to him. Like he wants us to text him calling him a loser and a bitch. Saying pretty mean things to him. Out of curiosity I did it. I told him he was a creep for harassing girls and I thought he was a little bitch. 

HE ACTUALLY SENT ME 50$. I’m just so confused and we’ve been friends for 9 years. We grew up together. I helped him through addiction and the lose of his sister. He’s helped me through break ups and school struggles. I honestly care very deeply for him but this obsession is getting out of hand.

So a family of gipsies went to my store. They leave their kids telling and running all the time while they sit in the cafeteria área. The usual
One of their kids stole something half an hour before my exit time . I call my supervisors and they don't answer. I give a quick Run to their station to let them know but ""they are super busy"". (By super busy i mean talking with the store butcher and laughing só yeah....)
I go back to my cashier and someone calls me. It is my supervisor . Saying that She was super busy . I explained what happened and She actually had the nerve of telling me ""go there and warn the family""
I was like ""hmmm.... No! U guys do it or hire a security guy, cause i am not going for sure!""
She was like ""oh really... Ok! ""And hang up. 

Só basicly nothing was done and they Will probably out the Blame on me

1- no we don't have a security guy
2- nothing against gipsies . Some are cool . But we deal with 2 complicated rude families...
3- last year a woman was fired a week before x mas cause someone stole and She didn't Saw it ... But by law She couldn't be fired só.. 🤷
4- i really hope they don't take whatever the kid took from my paycheck or they Will be closed in no time!

Edit : btw in my country gipsies isn't the same as in your country só i should have Started with that. We don't see it as a racial slur and in no mean it is offensive. It is what they are called here. Even they call themselves that. Só don't go report me pls 😅



Só i tell my mom on how my day went and how i posted that exact words u just read on a group for opinions.
We went for x mas shopping in my store . Me , my mom and Younger brother i rarely ser due to their divorce.
We went to the cashier to pay up .
For context only: alot of black people were in line (again for context only!!)
and i got a noticfication from that group saying how racist i was (at the time i didn't knew how they had another definition for gipsies!!)
As i start saying that to my mom She starts to shup me up .. i am like ok then and i did
Outside She tells me how i was saying that in front of black people and how they could be ofended and Kick our asses!
I am like no! They are civil people mom and if i am wrong they should tell me. We can talk!
She got mad saying i ruined x mas. Left me Alone with 30€ in shopping and my dog (not the best combination!)
I had to go cool of before heading home . When i got home they were gone. My brother's gifts weren't there.nothing ! Só i called her nonstop. Asked my little brother via Instagram where they were. He Said on his way to his dad's house.
I called her again. She answered. I Gave her a peace of my mind of course but nothing loud nor offensive. 
Só She went to put him in his dad's house and his dad doesn't celebrate x mas .. doesn't do nothing..

You were all absolutely right telling me to forget about my insecurities and be there for her, which I was. But she told me a lot of things that I can’t deal with right now and I don’t know how to handle this so here they are:

- Jake was indeed some sort of ex, they used to go out, they did kiss and everything was like in a movie but they didn’t stay together because they were too different and would have never worked out

- during our break/break-up, they met and ended up sleeping together. They had feelings for each other, but at the same time my GF wanted to save the relationship with me and Jake encouraged her to give me a second chance

- I have no excuse for the way I hurt my GF, I was a big a*hole, I can give details if someone asks, but her sleeping with another guy during our short break when we hadn’t even discussed if we were to date other people crushed me

- she says she did want to give our relationship another chance and was ready to fight for it, but she’s grieving right now

845,"So, for about 2 years, I had been falling into a weird sleeping pattern. I had seen multiple doctors, I’ve googled, I’ve travelled for alternative answers and taken countless tests with zero results. 

Basically what happens is after work on a Friday, I’d go to bed around 10pm and won’t wake up for even a millisecond until Monday night or Tuesday afternoon. I wouldn’t use the washroom, I wouldn’t eat or drink, and eventually had to be supervised by my mom as it was a big concern, and she had reported that I did not move an inch while in my slumber. I slept a minimum of 60 to a maximum of 87 (so far) hours like this and afterwards my sleep cycle is normal again until the next Friday. I have been woken up in these states and get really dizzy and go right back to sleep.

Also, while asleep, I had the same dreams over and over again. To the point where it’s like another world that I recognize. I had a job there, I had a routine, a boss, etc. I know the landscape. It’s fucking weird.

Side notes - I don’t drugs, I don’t even drink. I smoke weed now but didn’t at that point in my life.

846,"I had a friendship with a girl for about 6 years. Met on Twitter because of common musical act interests, and a few years into it even met each other in person for a few hours during a flight layover for a flight that happened to be in my town. We were never the best of friends but talked fairly often as we had common interests. 

Long story short, about 2 years ago was when I first realized that our friendship would not likely last ""forever."" For context, she's (F21) Indian and I (F23) am Black. At this moment, her favorite musical act did something that I considered to be anti-black/racist. She took it personally, explained that I was wrong, and that was that. I tried to educate her but she shut me down. Because there was no resolution I let it go because it seemed petty at the time. In hindsight, I should've done more. Honestly, I wish I would've ended the friendship right then.

During this friendship, I've supported her a lot. I won't say that she hasn't been there for me but it was 90/10, if that makes sense. About 3 or 4 years ago she came out to me as gay. Well, actually bi, but later gay. After that moment I became a more major support for her as I'm one of the only two people (the other one being her current girlfriend who has at many moments been abusive) who knows her sexuality. I don't mind supporting people. I actually like to do so, but in hindsight I should've limited how much energy I put into her in that way. I should've told her to seek counseling or something. 

Until last Spring, she was in school. I graduated school 4 years ago. Because of this I had more free time and as she was busy, I made new friends. I became okay with the idea of just being acquaintances with her if anything, which was bound to happen. I realized after she graduated school that she wanted to talk to me more often, though. I didn't mind this as I knew she still depended on me as a support, but by this time my ""need"" or ""deep want"" to be her friend had ended.

It will seem petty but a few months ago I began to self reflect more and realized I wanted more support from people, and to do this I had to ask for help. I tested it, and asked her for help with a submission for an art contest. I specifically wanted her opinion of my submission and suggestions for change. She did this, and I thanked her. It went well until I showed her my final submission. Knowing in total I spent weeks and dozens of hours on it, she says ""it's not bad I guess"" and expresses disapproval that I didn't do what she said. The vibe just felt completely off and I immediately stopped caring. A few weeks later she asked ""Everything alright?"" and I responded that it was. We had a short conversation, but that was that. I never sent her another message. That was a month ago.

I don't feel guilty for having ghosted her because of the amount of time I spent counseling and consoling her even when I was exhausted, dealing with my own life threatening health problems and other traumatic life issues. 

There's more to why I want to end the friendship... Just for example, because I'm one of the only people who knows she's gay she goes ""full gay"" mode on me (not my words-- she acknowledges and says this herself) and always makes ""straight jokes,"" and literally talks about how gay she is and other sexual things in about half of our messages. She makes 'jokes"" about Christians (to me\*), knowing I'm associated with Christianity. I feel like she has made her sexuality a personality trait. Her only personality trait.  

\*literally couldn't care less that she makes jokes about Christians, but just do that with someone else 

**I know the ideal is to tell her why I am not her friend anymore but I think that'll scar her more than me just not talking to her is. She's got a type D personality and all she does is with anxiety. I can't say ""When you were in uni and busy I got used to not talking to you and I don't ""need"" you like you needed me when you graduated. I'm glad you're more comfortable in your sexuality but I'm sick of you talking about how gay you are all of the time. About me and whoever else being 'a little' gay. I'm sick of you trashing Christians (to me) all of the time and I don't understand why you can't do that with your girlfriend or someone else when you know I'm exploring spirituality, Christianity in specific. And I hate that you only care on what I have to say on Black issues if you agree with it. None of my other friendships live off of being marginalized and talking about how much of a minority we are, I'm tired of this. I've grown. I don't care anymore.**",23Dec2019,1

My dog has his rabies shot but from what I know those arnet 100% effective and it has bean a somewhat modest amount of time however it’s still bean recent enough we’re I think he’s still fine.


So basically my family saw a opossum outside, it was around 4:15 which is very slightly dusk out but not when I’d expect to see them out. Our dog was out at the time which instantly got us worried as we didn’t want him and the opossum going at it if the opossum has rabies. Guess what happened? The opossum at first played dead and was defensive  but territorial, our dog was a bit more aggressive and gradually approached it, eventually this turned into a mildly aggressive fight that ended with our Dog nocking the thing out for 5 minutes. Our dog left after he won but he did tumble with the thing and bite it once or twice. We got him in a bit after and he seems fine but yeah I’m a bit worried. Iv always had a childish fear of rabies and am really worried our Dog now has it. From what I read opossums do sometimes go out early because of rabies. After he got up he seemed fine and didn’t seem aggressive, he just walked away but again I’m kinda paranoid about this stuff.",23Dec2019,1

I have been talking to Jack for a week now. We met on tinder. We hit it off instantly and have been talking 24/7. We have each other on instagram.

Before Jack, I met Jessica on tinder too. We only talked for a few days but have each other on snap. 

Today Jack sent me a screenshot of a convo between him and Mary. Basically Marry was saying ""stop playing games, don't you see the distance between us, i miss you"" and stuff like that. Jack replied with uhmm what, what are you saying? And stuff like that.

A few moments ago I was just checking Jack's instagram for the first time. I saw Mary comment under his post and checked her profile. There was a 3 week old post, which Jack commented under with ""SEXXXYY"" Another 5 week old post and Jack commented ""Happy birthday babyyy""

Now here it gets more complicated. Mary has many pictures with Jessica. They are friends. What am I supposed to do? If I ask Jessica, she will tell Mary and it will end bad. If I straight up ask Jack, he's going to think I'm a weirdo for finding out stuff like this and going thru comments and shit.

853,"TLDR: feeling empty, reconnected with first love and turns out she never truly loved me at least not the way I loved her, low self esteem, severe isolation.

(23, male) I had my first love at 14 then we started a full relationship at 15 and I lost my virginity to her (back in 2011). Broke up in 2012 but met up every year no matter who else we had gotten with or were with at the time (wrong I know but I was lovesick) and she would tell me I was her first love and how much I meant and then ghost me after a few weeks.
 
Last met in 2016. Since then she started partying and doing coke etc. I spoke to her recently now she’s stopped with the coke and has a good job (biologist). But I feel like I’ve missed out on so many life experiences because I took a break from university due to depression so I will graduate at 24 instead of 21 which makes me feel pathetic in all honesty.

Anyway, I’m speaking to her on snapchat and we’re catching up etc and she’s talking about all these boys she’s been with (over 60, doesn’t bother except because it makes me feel like I mattered less somehow). She mentioned how she still can’t forgive me for being unfaithful in high-school. Yet when I mention the fact she had cheated with far more people she just brushed it off like “it’s in the past” (why bring it up then?). I said “it’s a shame you don’t see our history like I do, but oh well no sense reliving the past.” And she basically confirmed that she doesn’t see it how I did, by calling it “dating” or that there were “some good times” but that it was “tarred by the infidelity”. But in the same breath acts like I severely broke her heart, which would only happen if she cared. 
We were together off and on for over a year and then the whole dating every single year from 2012-2016, and all the memories we have together. Okay, cool. Thanks for that.

Basically, this has thrown my head into a spin. So all this time I meant nothing/I was deluded into thinking first love mattered? Like she convinced me repeatedly to leave girls to be with her, not in some malicious or evil way just by making it seem like it would go somewhere.

Thing is, I don’t want to cut her out of my life again because to me that was just as bad as this but now there is some closure I guess.

I’m guessing someone will say I’m stuck in the past a bit, or trying to recreate it. But the truth is, I’ve found out that a significant relationship from my past wasn’t as important as it felt. Hurts.

I need some outside perspectives here. I’m tempted to just get some casual hookups and get over this but at the same time my self esteem has never been lower, so it’s difficult for me to make the step.

I’ll post separately about the isolation etc elsewhere. Direct replies to this post or private advice in a message are both appreciated.

Thanks reddit...",23Dec2019,1
854,"She ended our friendship over two years ago because I wasn’t being attentive enough to her needs. I was tired of her constant lies so I was having a hard time being attentive when I knew that almost everything she said was a lie. 

For example: she tried to hook up with a friend of mine. She climbed into his bed, naked, and he rejected her. She then tried to tell me that this man sexually assaulted her. The story got crazier and crazier every time she told it. It’s also not the first time she’s cried “assault” when rejected by a man. Another time, she pounded five shots of whiskey and a beer in less than an hour, got wasted, and screamed at the bartender, accusing him of slipping drugs into one of her drinks. The bartender kicked us out and she spent the rest of the night screaming outside of the bar about how the bartender drugged her. I could tell more stories about her unbelievable stories, but I need to get to the point. 

I’ve noticed a lot of our friends that we both spent time with, refuse to speak to me or unfriend me on social media. I’ve also heard from other people that this girl will start talking crap if my name is mentioned. It’s been *two and a half years* since our friendship ended. I was hoping that the end of the friendship would mean the end of the drama. Apparently not. Do I confront her? Or do I just ignore it? I have plenty of other friends. It just sucks that people who I thought were my friends are believing the lies of this crazy person.

855,"Hi everyone so I’ve noticed a pattern in my behaviors. Dont really know how to search for it so i figured I would lay it out in a step by step fashion as best as I could and then yall could help me identify what it is or maybe why I might do it. Ready? Break. 

1) I will think of something that potentially upsets me (ex: I assume dog people hate cats, and this upsets me because i think everyone should love both) 

2) i choose an answer that i want and a reason why (ex: i want a dog person to tell me that they hate cats. By doing this it proves i am correct in my assumption and my anger is therefore justified). 

3) i look for validation (ex: i ask someone if they hate cats)

3a) more specifically i look for validation and control my variables to try and get the answer i am seeking (ex: i ask a dog person if they hate cats 

3b) even more specifically, i skew the results and only look for my desired answer. (Ex: even if someone who is a dog person tells me that they like cats, i will keep asking dog people until i find one dog person that tells me that they hate cats). (This will make it real in my mind, make my assumption true, anger justified). 

4) i feel an emotional reaction in response to the persons answer(ex: anger)

5) i exhibit a behavioral response. The emotion typically fuels this behavioral response. I shop for different emotions based on different activities (ex: maybe anger for weight lifting and sports, calm and reassurane for studying)

I would like to make note that 5 could be healthy or unhealthy. Ive used this to get in great shape and to graduate from college. Ive used this to stay in and drink by myself and cry alone. And everything in between. Also, while my example pertains to interpersonal relations it does not always have to be so. I just need to feel something to then illicit an action. A lot of the time its with people but not always. Maybe ill listen to a song and then pair that emotional response to an activity. Maybe ill look something up online that will piss me off and then ill go be productive. 

However, the take away seems to be that i find ways to manipulate my own emotions in order to produce results in the real world. Anyone else do this? Or have advice in this?

859,"Throwaway as the friend in question knows my main account.

&amp;#x200B;

I've known my two closest friends since we were all 10. We're in our early 30's now. 

One of them is getting married next summer. Last week said friend, his fiancée and I went out for drinks. We were talking about the wedding, when I mentioned the honeymoon. They told me they'd been trying to plan it, but it wasn't easy as the wedding costs were eating a big chunk of their budget.

I thought to myself that I could try to take care of that for them, especially since I haven't decided on a wedding gift yet.

I thought about a two week vacation either to Mauritius or to the Maledives. With that in mind, I started planning. After checking prices I called an airline and asked if it was possible for them to fly until their destination without knowing where they'd be flying to until after landing (a bit tricky since a connecting flight is needed!), but I was told it could be taken care off, especially since I was looking at buying them First Class tickets. Then I went looking for a resort, and found a perfect one online at a 60% discounted rate. It's a bungalow at a 5 star resort, with everything you can think off, private pool, directly on the beach, and all the sweet things. I booked it right away as it was a steal for that price - however it's refundable, so nothing is set in stone yet.

All in all, it's about €18.000. The money itself is, fortunately, not the issue, but my fear is that it might look I went overboard. I'd love to give them the time of their lives, especially to my friend as I love him as a brother, but I'm afraid I'd be then seen as the guy that throws his money around to show off. 

So, the question I need help with, should I go for it/down-scale it/simply buy them a fancy toaster like everyone else and call it a day?",23Dec2019,1

863,"I’m from a single mother family where my mom’s the only type of monetary support I get; my dad’s out of the picture pretty much entirely. I only get gifts (which are usually just cash) from him over holidays so I just save those. My mother’s been in the same job for 3 years now, working full time with no benefits, no vacation days, and a very VERY crappy salary.

It’s been hard for us to get by, we haven’t had a house of our own in years and we’re always moving one place to the other because we can barely afford to live in an apartment anymore. I go to an out of state college, which makes things worse. My mom’s afraid she won’t be able to pay for my tuition and both our health insurances if she stays in her current job. No one will give her any loans because of how low her income is. My mom would do anything to keep me in school and for her, me dropping out or transferring to a cheaper university isn’t really an option.

She’s been planning to quit her job and try to find a better one, but it’ll be hard with her age (50), as I’m sure it’s not that surprising that companies would rather hire younger people that just got out of college. She knows this too but just can’t stand her job anymore as it’s been getting her pretty depressed; she does more than her coworkers but gets less pay than them (not even to mention that she made more money at her entry level job in the 80’s than she does now). So if she quits, we’ll have no income for who knows how long.

I’m planning to get a job this upcoming semester to help her out a bit, but where I go to school, minimum wage is almost half of what it is at home so it won’t be much. I’d basically be working any time that I’m not studying, but I’m scared it still won’t be enough, so I’m wondering if anyone knows any good ways to make some extra cash in college (taking into account that I don’t want to get into any trouble with the university or anything!).

864,"So for some background, I’m in college and 20 and my older sister is out of college and 23. My parents have been unhappy together for as long as I can remember growing up. They were never quite as affectionate or happy as my friends’ parents. So I knew something was up and one day I made the worst decision by asking my mom what was up. Turns out my dad is a pretty shitty husband and my moms been wanting a divorce for such a long time but hasn’t been able to. My dad won’t come to terms with what he’s done and every time my mom brings up a divorce he gets aggressive and doesn’t see the point or realize his wrongdoings.


This is where it gets tricky. From that point it will be my mom having to forcefully get a divorce if things don’t go smoothly. I don’t know the exact specifics of what my dad has done but I know enough to ask him to take responsibility and go about the divorce in a smooth way.


Should I even get involved? I told my mom that after the whole ordeal and us kids are “aware” of the divorce, I’d talk to my dad to talk some sense into him about why it happened and how he can proceed without going to extremes. (Apparently in the past he said he’d just skip town or stop paying for shit and the like.) I feel like if I don’t interject he’ll do that.


And don’t get me wrong, my dad has always been there for me and it’s great with kids but he’s never really respected his wife and trapped her in this marriage because he’s afraid of what his family and others will think once they realize it’s mainly his fault. So he’s essentially really afraid to come to terms with it for the better, and instead gets aggressive and manipulates her into staying when it’s just unhealthy for both of them. I think for him it’s easy and comfortable but he doesn’t realize the effect it has on my mom. And it’s not like his family doesn’t know, my mom has told them she plans on divorcing him so it’s not a whole ordeal. (Family dynamic fucked up.) should I just let them play it out or should I tell my dad what I have to say?


I love both my parents and want the best for them and I truly think a separation is best for everyone’s sake. I just want to make sure my parents, mainly my dad, go about it the right way and don’t go to extreme measures to absolve themselves of blame. But I feel like I’m too entrenched in this.

Every time that I try to bring up him seeking help, he gets annoyed at me, and says that it’s unfair of me to bring up things that are wrong with him when “he cant bring up things that are wrong with me because I’ll get upset.” Normally, I drop the subject because it isn’t my wish to antagonise him, I just want him to get some help. 

The most recent thing I tried to was promise that if he was to seek help with his addiction, I would also go and see a doctor regarding my snoring. I thought that this would be justifiable for him, because in that way we’re both seeking to improve our health for one another. He insisted that it’s not the same and that his drinking habits don’t have an effect on me like my snoring does on him, and that I should see a sleep doctor irregardless.

I’m at a total loss on what to do. His friends won’t call him out, and he thinks his family calling him out is hypocritical because they also have a history of drinking (not addiction, but when they drink they drink heavily). What do I do?",23Dec2019,1

I am smarter than most people of my age but I don't like it at all. I have gotten much better at my people skills but I can't connect with anyone. I feel that there is such a distance and no one really gets me(not a phase mum) . I can't express my true personality bc if I would ppl could be friends with me. I have two close friends now and sometimes can't stand them. I feel so lonely and I don't know what to do.

All of a sudden, the son of the friend develops a crush on my sister,, and without thinking about it, starts loving him out of the blue. I said she isn't allowed to date until she is 18. Perfectly reasonable I believe. The problem? He is the person I was 2 years ago. Cared about himself and nobody else. He jokes about rape, sexual assault and all this around her. Not only does it make me uncomfortable, but my sister laughs at it. I'm getting to the point where I'll put a fire axe between his eyes if this shit continues.

886,"I [M24] have just watched the documentary ""the great hack"" on netflix and one question really struck me. How do you want to go down the history books? All my life I have just done things that were just ""logical"". Go to school. Check. Make friends. Check. Choose a study with lots of work opportunities. Check. Etc.

However now I am really asking myself what I want to get with life. What do I want to do? Who am I? What choices do I want to make? Is what I am doing the right thing? 

Sometimes I really feel like I am missing out on a lot of things. That I am just doing things, because at that moment they give me joy. At the same time I feel like I could play a much bigger role in this world and could be having a lot more fun. All these questions keep popping up and because of all the uncertainty I dont really know what to do with these questions.

892,"Hi

I've never wrote on reddit before but I'm desperate. I don't know where to begin. I'm a high class Escort in London, I make a lot of money but I'm seriously depressed. I sometimes see nice guys who are intelligent, funny and charming. Other times I have to have sex with ugly arrogant men who treat me like crap. 

I dress in agent provocateur and always have a smile on my face but secretly I want to scream in their face. I can't stop doing it because of the money. Its ruining my health. 

6 months ago I started dating a client who was incredibly rich and powerful. He completely used me, told me he wanted my kids ect then dumped me. I can't get over him and feel like a vessel for men just to be used. I feel worthless and ugly. I'm 35 never had kids and am alone. I feel suicidal to be honest. I've always said that I'll commit suicide when my parents die.

I'm very working class and my ex was upper class- shooting foxes upper class. It turns out he sees lots of escorts uses them then fucks off. At the time I wasn't earning anything so could only buy primark clothes. He liked watching me suffer. Now I earn a lot, which I'm very grateful for but I'm still depressed. I'm on the highest dose of antidepressants so don't know what to do.

I hate London. Its full of superficial arseholes. I hate the bankers I have to sleep with who all voted Boris Johnson, they are self righteous cocks.

I think I've made my bed. 

I'm sorry",23Dec2019,1
893,"So prior to my flight to Atlanta, I saw a really cute girl at our gate. We ended up sitting next to each other and to avoid any social awkwardness, I just listened to music and watch videos for the whole flight. But on my way back, I couldn’t get “I should’ve asked cute tattoo girl for her number” out of my head. Is there a subreddit for this lol?",23Dec2019,1
894,"I've known this girl for about 3 years since we met in an orchestra class back in high school, her and I have always kind of been friends but never truly close until recently, like we'd hang out once in a blue moon and we'd both have a pretty pleasant time from what I could tell.

Anyways to the point, we've started talking a lot more and hanging out a lot more in the past couple of weeks and I've been very confused as I'm pretty overanalytical with social situations, but also dense at the same time when it comes to signs and signals. When we hang out though we're usually listening to music in one of our cars and jamming out or I'm teaching her guitar, but there are moments where she'll lay her head on my shoulder or caress my arm while she's talking to me, and when she seems embarassed like at one of her friends' parties we were at she'll lean into me. Shit makes me happy as fuck but I'm confused on if these are supposed to be some signs I'm supposed to pick up on or if it's just me overthinking. 

Would you guys be able to tell me what you think about it whether it seems platonic or more than that,and if it seems like more, some advice on how to move forward if I genuinely like this girl? (Like I do)",23Dec2019,1
895,"I really hope this doesn't come off wrong, but I truly need advice. 

When I was younger I dealt with this but I was a lot shyer and quieter. I hated getting stares from strangers out in public and would hide behind my dad. Originally, I thought I was just really ugly so I would even try wearing baggy clothes, acting like a guy and wear hats! I also always tried to be really good at sports to fit in somewhere. Tho I made guy friends fine I noticed that I only ever had like 1 or 2 girl friends. I was bullied a lot by girls and I would come home crying sometimes asking my mom why I couldn't get along with girls or if I was just really that ugly. They always talked badly about my hair or clothes or made racial jokes about my nose or features (I'm black/AA in predominately white achool). My mom would always say it's cuz I was pretty, but I didn't believe her at the time....

When I started getting older (around HS), I started being more outgoing hoping that if people got to know my personality they wouldn't judge me on how I looked. But this is also when I noticed I was getting more attention from guys - which is the opposite of what I wanted. I had a few guy friendships that failed because down the road they would tell me either really inappropriate things or they would want to date. This made things worse because I felt like not only could I barely maintain friendships with girls, guys started not wanting to talk to me unless it was more than being friends :( So I would still come home crying and my mom would say the same thing except this time she said don't let it get to me and be proud. 

So I finally go to college and I'm working part-time jobs here and there, but mainly in the food industry as a server since they were hiring the quickest. Everytime I would step foot in a new job 1 of 2 things would happen: either some guy would try hitting on me or girls would mean-mug me. I would make it a point to introduce myself, be polite, smile, make conversation and try to relate, help them with extra work and put on my best work performance. But it seemed like no matter what I'd do, girls would be friendly to my face then talk behind my back, or they wouldn't speak more than 2 words to me. I do have some close girl friends who don't treat me this way, but this usually happens when I'm meeting girls, female coworkers, or friends of friends for the first few times. I've had some of them look me up &amp; down or give me attitude and I haven't even introduced myself yet! Lately, I've had to report to managers of sexual harassment from guys and even one of my managers said to me ""it must suck being pretty, huh?"" I laughed, but I still truly don't think I'm all that  and I hate feeling uncomfortable at my jobs :/ 

I am just tired of it all. I'm starting to feel attacked everywhere I go! I've had to walk out on 2 jobs because the emotional stress wears me down. I feel like people don't care  or see my good work ethic all because they're more worried about how I look. I also recently dropped out of school (my ex in my first 2 years of college was abusive) and I'm dealing with heavy anxiety and depression. I'm on antidepressants that seem to not work as well as I hoped. I'm starting to hate life and I just don't want to deal with it anymore. People say being attractive is a blessing but it feels like a CURSE.

I really would like some advice from some women on what to do I these situations. I don't want to give up, but I don't know what else to do.

900,"A year and a half ago, I got a call from one of my sisters saying my parents passed away. It turned my life upside down (we weren’t speaking, my family is crazy in ways that I can’t even explain). I’ve grieved, I’ve lived life, and now I have a boyfriend who A) accepted that my parents are dead and B) doesn’t try to force me to have a relationship with my siblings, for reasons obvious later on. 

A week or so ago, I got a call from my mom. My dead mom. So, clearly, she’s not dead. 

While I don’t want to rekindle any kind of relationship, I need to tell my boyfriend what happened. I don’t trust that my parents weren’t actually in on it, because this is the kind of thing they’d do. Psychological warfare is nothing new. 

How do I broach the topic without him trying to force me to have a relationship? I never want them to meet him or our kids if we have them. I want nothing to do with any of them. If someone came to me and told me this story, there’s no way I’d believe them. People of reddit, please help.",23Dec2019,1
