0,"Alright, a little context so you're all familiar with the situation:
My mom was very fat a couple of years ago, but something clicked on her mind that made her start eating minimal quantities. Even though it's not healthy, she lost weight, a lot...

But now-a-days she's been on the same body for some time, and she isn't fat at all, just has a bit of fat.
I've tried to talk her into a diet combined with exercises, but she says she doesn't have enough time (apart from work, she spends all her days playing Candy Crush and watching soap opera).

Just now she and my father left home for dinner, and I saw two drugs on the table. As I am very curious I went over to check, and looked them up on the internet: anti-depressants and weight-losing drugs.

I know they aren't good for her, help me help her.",06Jul2019,2
1,"I've googled extensively and only half connect to some of the ""symptoms"", and even then I can't tell if these are just cause by who I am or because of some disorder (if you get me?).
I'm generally a very quiet very introverted person.
When I'm alone, outside, I tend to have to just stop sometimes to look around and appreciate everything (a lot) and it feels as if me is small and unimportant and I'm just a spectator of everyone else's life (which in some ways, everyone is, but it's different from when I normally ""spectate"").
The other kind of symptom is that I often just don't believe that me is me. I can look in the mirror and have to almost convince myself that me that I know (my personality) fits this body and this is how everyone else knows me. I can't explain it easily.

2,"My ex-friend [18M] is dating my girlfriends 15-year-old little sister. They have been together for about four months now. My girlfriend has walked in on him with his hands down her pants a few times, but this is the only thing that her sister will admit to.

I believe they have been having sex as well and I‚Äôm unsure if I should speak up about it or not. I live in Michigan and the AoC (Age of Consent) here is 16.

He claimed before they ever started dating that he ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt ever want anything sexual‚Äô with her, yet they‚Äôve been caught a few times.

I have called him in all honestly a creep, pedophile, and most people agree with it around us. He‚Äôs currently resorted to trying to threaten me lately thinking this will stop me.

Am I just being somewhat petty about our old friendship (I broke it off because he always treated me like shit and would act way too immature for me to be around) or does anyone else feel the same.

As well, should I maybe post this question to r/legaladvice ? Or would that be unnecessary?",06Jul2019,0
3,"*Also posted on r/flirting*

There's this really cute guy that I'm interested in.
He's not a direct coworker, but he works in the same company as I do (fishing lodge), and I see him about every other day. He's a deckhand, I'm a lodge-girl.
Twice a week there's a ""Meet and Greet"" for our clients, which is my best opportunity to talk to him. It goes on for about an hour.
We haven't really had a one-on-one conversation yet. Mostly just conversations with a group of people.

Should I just try to have a conversation with him and get to know him a little bit? I'm not that amazing at conversation, but I know I'm not horrible. Sometimes it's difficult since we have to try to talk to the clients.
How should I go about flirting?

I know we both like hiking and I've already gone on a hike with a couple of his friends, so perhaps I should ask him if he wants to go on a hike? Maybe ask all of them, and then ask just him after we all go so he's more comfortable? I can wait for a time when his friends are working and he's not so that it's not too obvious. (They all live in the same apartment)

I asked for his and his friends number at the same time so that I could contact them (for hiking and such), they gave me their numbers without hesitation. It wasn't in a flirty way that I asked, so it was pretty subtle, especially since I asked both of them. 
That was kind of my intention though just so I wasn't too forward. Hope I did the right thing!

Make a plan for me please, you amazing people!",06Jul2019,1

6,"I am 30 year old female and Indian in background 

I grew up in an abusive environment with a mother who is Borderline Personality and it has ruined my life. It‚Äôs made me a codependent mess with emotional issues of my own. I‚Äôve finally saved up enough that I‚Äôm moving out next month. 

I have like two friends. And to them I‚Äôm just a casual friend even though they are my best friends. I have no one else in my life and my mother‚Äôs behaviour over the years means we don‚Äôt have family friends or a real network. My extended family isn‚Äôt that close and I have no cousins my age. 

I‚Äôm Indian and I see people who I went to university with having these 4 day weddings with love and family and friends and I will never ever have that. It really hurts. Even if I make some friends which I don‚Äôt see how at 30, they won‚Äôt be deep old friendships who are overjoyed and deeply connected to your life. Makes me sad to be so isolated and not know what I‚Äôm living for. 

How I build a life worth living? I don‚Äôt know what to do next. What do I even have to look forward to? Meeting someone isn‚Äôt going to happen and even if I did they would quickly see my weird empty life and bolt. 

I can‚Äôt even envision what an alternative life could look like for me. I have to accept that the wedding, family, connection, holidays etc isn‚Äôt in this lifetime for me. What else could it look like? I feel 30 is old to be trying new things - especially as I am not inclined towards being good at anything (thanks to how I was brought up). I‚Äôm afraid of the rest of my life and sad at everything I‚Äôm missing out on. This toxic environment really ruined the fabric and structure to I am/could have been and it hurts.",06Jul2019,1

Today will mark the 4th day without her period, and we are both becoming very worrisome. I have never intentionally or unintentionally ''ejaculated"" inside her, and always use condoms 90% of the time but 100% of the time if we're entering round 2 because i know there can be caught sperm in the urethra. Anyways I don't want any reply's criticizing the fact that we're probably not young enough to make these type of decisions or anything along the lines of that. I just genuinely want some advice and maybe some answers from other people that may have gone through this. The main issue is the fact my girlfriend has a VERY strict and abusive alcoholic mom. So i don't really want her in the picture unless its upmost necessary. Fortunately my mom is very understanding of things, but I still don't want her to know. Whenever i search up asking questions on what to do I get parents perspective points and stupid blog posts that carry very vague information. I live in Toronto, Canada so seeking medical help really isn't a problem. Neither is money. I just want to be prepared in case she does end up being pregnant on what I need to do. As I said before I don't want your opinions on whether you're pro life/pro choice, or you don't like the fact that I'm not married.
Believe it or not, me and my girlfriend are deeply in love and very loyal to each other. So I want to stay on her side no matter what happens. I'm hoping I get answers on what actions I need to take with minimal parents involved. Also maybe information about centers or doctors on teenage pregnancy.",06Jul2019,0

14,"Just over, actually. In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have given it to him considering his shop was in his basement, but he had great reviews (which were probably fake). Sorry in advance if I get a little ranty.

There has been excuse after excuse, and as irritating and frustrating as it was, I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. But I keep having to pester him for updates and this last time, he sent me a photo of a USPS email that said the package was lost. 1) The email itself was dated for a week ago and he never bothered to tell me and 2) the package was lost in March. I didn't even know the guy until May, so I don't know wtf he's trying to pull.

He says he already made some repairs, but he also messed with my motherboard or something while trying to get rid of epoxy or glue that the first shop I went to used. No idea how much I'm paying in labor at this point.

So my question: is there some precedent to how much I should pay if I just want my laptop back now? I'm tired of dealing with this guy and want an actual shop. 

I'm applying to jobs now. I need a computer, so I finally caved and just bought a new one yesterday. I wish I could just leave the old one there at this point, but it has photos and files I don't want to lose. I'm sick and tired of going to the library every time I want to print a resume or apply to jobs. I applied to a tech bootcamp and had to take the aptitude test there instead of in my quiet home. I would just head over to his place to pick it up, but I just moved to the area and don't know anyone who would want to come with me in case he's psycho.

Any general advice is also welcome. Do I just keep waiting for this guy, do I get some other people involved? I'm feeling hopeless about the situation.",06Jul2019,1

20,"I'm 19M Midwest US.  
I am fully dependent on my parents. If they were not there tomorrow I would absolutely be nothing. They send me to college, pay for a car, food, everything.

The care for me but I do not appreciate them or care for them. That is because they are abusive. In my elementary/middle school years they were physically and verbally abusive and in my later years only verbally. They are very toxic presences in my life. Because of this I have confidence issues, depression, etc.

I can't stand being around them. When I was away at college it was the happiest I had felt in a long time. Now in summer I stay in my room almost all the time. Whenever I speak with them I just say what they want to hear so that they don't get angry. Whenever I am dragged out of my room I am very quiet and do whatever they ask.

The fact that I am fully dependent on them makes me sick. They know that I give them the cold shoulder. They say ""you don't appreciate us for all we do"". I completely understand that they do a lot for me but I can't find it in me to appreciate them because they are the reason I am mentally ill. And I do not see myself telling them how I feel.

The very moment I become financially independent I plan on moving away and never looking back. If I ever want something (that I don't need) I make sure that I alone pay for it.

Is it wrong of me to not appreciate my parents? How should I feel? What should I do until I become financially independent? That is why I am morally conflicted.",06Jul2019,2

It was not like full on thrusting but somewhat like humping for maybe 2-3 minutes. I never touched him or made him touch me inappropriately and both of us always had clothes on. I forgot all about these childish acts until today. My cousin is a strange child and acts very strange at times. My mother tonight at dinner suggested that he may have been sexually assaulted. She has no evidence of this claim besides that his other cousin that is much closer to his age is somewhat violent and almost got kicked out of elementary school and has an alcoholic mother. I then remembered what happened 6-8 years ago. I did not mean harm to him during the act but I cant help but think somehow this is my fault. I have such a good relationship with my entire family including my aunt and I can‚Äôt imagine how they would look at me if they knew. Was this sexual abuse?

So it all started with overdoing it on eating an edible about 3 week ago. I took a 30 mg edible which by the way I hardly smoke so it‚Äôs very rare. Anyways since I took more than I was supposed to eat I obviously had a really bad trip. Non stop panic attacks and feeling like I was going to die. A week later my panic attacks were still there. Some of the symptoms that I was experience while on the edible I was still experiences but just in more mild way such as slurred speech, being insecure of what I‚Äôm saying, feeling like I‚Äôm not present, slightly dry mouth, over sensitive of my tongue. For example when I was having my bad trip my whole attention was on my tongue not feeling normal so I feel like I pay a lot of attention to it while I‚Äôm talking and it‚Äôs frustrating. I‚Äôm not saying the marijuana caused all these symptoms but I feel like my anxiety is causing me to think I still have them. But what i want to know is of anyone has ever experienced this before.

25,"28 M. I have a pretty cushy job at a well known retail place and have been working there for many years ( 9 I think). It has helped me go to school, helped me have more time to myself and I am generally well liked and respected by my peers for my knowledge and helpfulness. This is my peers, not my immediate managers who do not see anything that constitutes as ""outstanding"". 

Over the past few years ( 5 I believe) there has been a new Store manager. He is a bit of a prick. He ran out everyone with his carelessness and constantly promotes and rewards the worst employees I have ever seen. I never minded his behavior because at the time I was attending school and generally enjoying my life outside of this place. However, this year when I went to ask for a raise ( a meager 50 cents by the way) I was told that because of my reviews which are just average ( because the department head and management mark the same thing for everyone and change a few details) I cannot get a raise. I argue that I am the most reliable person in the department, but this falls on deaf ears. I am told that because essentially I'm a good little hand that he'll throw an extra dime in my yearly raise. Fine. I understand that this is retail and that I'm never gonna be rich, but I do take it as a very bad sign that my work is not being appreciated. 


So now I am vying for an even cushier position which has weekends off. The first time I applied for this position was like three years ago, which was given to someone else that then lasted about six weeks in the role and then replaced by someone else who has, for three whole years, completely did whatever she wanted and was rewarded for it. She was accepted for a transfer even though she had bad attendance, never completed any of the goals that were set by the company and was breaking equipment ( which was reported several times so that she wouldn't have to do her job). Now that she is leaving I am up for spot and I go for the interview today. 

I think that I did pretty good in the interview, but it's clear to me that management wants me to take the less cushy position with no weekends off because they have no experienced people to man the new department. I explain that I would take the position with the same schedule that I have if I am given a raise that is befitting the position. I am met with some cringey looks and smiles and it's clear that they're setting me up to work like a dog for NO RAISE, NO WEEKENDS OFF and MORE RESPONSIBILITY.

I am still a top contender for the position that I want, but if I don't get it I am going to be very upset. My dilemma is that I need those weekends off so that I could attend more school heavier and have some time with my tween siblings and father.

So, basically, I figured out that my mom used my card to sign onto one of those online diet things, where they'll send you diet meals through the mail. She uses the same email and password for everything, so I confirmed that she was the one using my card by trying to sign into the website via her usual password. It logged me in. Her billing info matches my card. She has several upcoming orders, billed weekly, each costing around $30-$50. I don't have the money to support that. I tried taking my info off her account so that she would have to approach me about it, but it didn't have an option for that. I could only change the card if I put in new information.

Me and my mom have a pretty good relationship. I do know that she can be pretty sneaky with things, but I honestly don't think that she expected me not to notice $30-$50 charges on my account. I really can't think of a positive reason why she would use my card to sign up for this service, which makes this a lot harder to swallow. There was no way that this could end in her favor, which just makes the fact that she did it entirely too confusing to me. 

That being said, I just want to know how to bring this up to her in the least-damaging way possible. I don't want this to hurt our relationship and I'd be happy to forgive her if she puts her card info on the site instead of mine.

* I'm anti-social, kinda the **outsider**, I observe everything and notice everything and I really chose not to interact mostly in family gatherings, with my friends I am still not the most extrovert but I guess that side of me pops out.
* I hate my town and it's people and traditions, I think the way of life is pretty boring and primitive with no real aspirations, I moved to a big city because of college and I hate coming back to town.
* I dream to make it big and I have started 2 businesses which I aim to sell in the next 4-5 years and retire at 24/25 or live in a luxury financial state while doing small stuff I guess.
* I have 10 close/real friends I'd say, but I normally hang out with 3 only.
* As you'd guess not a lot of people in my town know me even though my family is pretty famous.

&amp;#x200B;

*Info about my sister Emily:* 

* She's **16** in school, very smart and majored in physics and math in school.
* She's very traditional in a way that she pretty much has the same aspirations or hobbies or way of thinking, wearing stuff and such as the majority of the girls in my town, however, being smart gives her the option to have dreams to work in a technological company or such other than I guess a normal job.
* She's both extrovert and introvert, but she's definitely not as introvert as me. 
* She's not manipulative or malicious, she's normal and a bit sensitive as she cries sometimes because of some friend that talked about her or about her boyfriend not loving her.
* She's academically smart, but she is still a simple girl, so for me as someone who dislikes being ""simple"" and following traditions I see simple as weakness and as being a bit dumb not to realize your full potential.
* She likes to have friends over and order fast food and basically talk , she watches the normal teenage shows that any girl in her age watches.  

* She cares for me and loves me, I can see it and feel it.  


***The Problem :*** 

&amp;#x200B;

I visit my old town every week or two because I attend college, and when I do we don't interact with each other at all.  
I talk with my **youngest sister (*****8 years old*****)** and hug/kiss her a lot. 

Me and my sister Emily have been close till maybe I was 11/12? I'd say ... 

We didn't fight nor do we had any sort of problem, there's really **no reason** why we don't talk or interact with each other, It's just that we haven't talked for so long that I guess mentally I couldn't just go to talk or interact with her , something **mentally** stops me .  


 *Why now am I posting this?*

  
My mother asked me and tried to make us talk but it just was awkward for us and it would mostly just last for a day as max and then the next day go back to normal.  


My mother asked me yesterday to try and talk to Emily, and my mother is pretty sensitive about this issue, I just wanna do it for my mother, I wanna get out of my comfort zone as well as I see it as one of my weaknesses and I do love my sister even though I don't interact with her .  


***Help me with :*** 

&amp;#x200B;

1.**How do I go about this?** 

  
2.**What's the best approach to talk to my sister?** 

  
3.**and how do I remove this invisible barrier that's stopping me from doing so ?**  


&amp;#x200B;

*Ps: I tried giving some info about me and her, hopefully, that would give you a better picture about us, Emily is a fake name and this account is just a throwaway because the subject is sensitive*   


&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR :** Me (20/M) haven't talked to my sister (16/F) in about 8 years, for no reason, we stopped talking at some point and it became somehow awkward to interact with each other, I wanna fix things yet I don't know how to approach such issue, would love some help  !",06Jul2019,2

They need to sell that cheap 50k apartment to move to the US and leech off me and my brothers while having no drivers' licenses, no social security, or retirement savings.

47," Long story but this is the email i sent to my president with changes made without putting names in It. ‚ÄúCollege A‚Äù is my first school, which i transferred to ‚Äúcollege B‚Äù after my first semester. Halfway through College B, we got devastating news that our school was in financial exigency and was only guaranteed to stay open for the 2019-20 school year and anything after that wasn‚Äôt promised. I realize that i should transfer, but if i do, i will have to sit out again and my credits might not even transfer because of It being a private school. Apparently, the president is not upping any current students scholarship. It is an expensive school and i would be having to pay a lot of money. Ask questions, i probably left out a lot! I‚Äôm guess I‚Äôm asking what to do/if this is even legal. TIA

Dear President
	
	My name is ‚Äî and I am currently enrolled to start my Sophomore year at College B. Last year I transferred after the fall semester from college A. The reason I transferred was my desire to play basketball as a Cardinal. My brother ‚Äî- graduated in 2017 from college B and was a student athlete. He loved College B, and his enthusiasm has worn off on me. Your previous coach, ‚Äî-, didn‚Äôt recruit me even though as a high school senior I was one of the top 25 players in state. Your current coach expressed interest after I committed to College A. I left College A with the hope that a transfer to college B would be in my best interest academically, as well as athletically. Because of my transfer, I had to sit for the remainder of my season, but to fulfilled my desire to compete, I pursued track as a high jumper. I set the high jump school record, was an Conference champ, and Freshman of the Year, and truly enjoyed the season. 
	You know first hand the implications the financial situation has had on College B. I wish to share with you the implications it has had on me and my decision to attend College B. Because of your decision to not give athletic scholarships to returning students, you have basically taken away a chance for me to continue my athletic participation at the collegiate level. Because I already transferred, NCAA rules require me to sit out an entire season if I transfer again. My only option is to go to a division 3 school, which as you know, doesn‚Äôt give athletic scholarships. I love basketball and track and have worked extremely hard to achieve the success I've had. I've already sat out a season and I don‚Äôt want have to sit out another. I know I have a place on the Collge B basketball and track teams, and I am 100% certain I can help turn the programs into something amazing! 
	Coming into College B as a transfer, I couldn‚Äôt receive an athletic scholarship during the spring semester with it already being halfway through the year. However, before my first track meet my parents spoke with both the athletic director and the compliance officer to make sure there would be no repercussions if I participated in another sport in association with College B‚Äôs financial situation.  They also both assured my parents that there was scholarship money available next year and they assured them that both coaches wished to award me scholarship money. As a result, my participation in the track season has hindered me from competing at any level except D3 if I leave College B. My situation is of my own doing, but if I would have been told that the school was in their current financial situation, my decision to transfer would have been different. My family and I believe that my situation is unique because of my transfer; as a result, I'm asking you to please reconsider your decision to not offer returning students scholarships. I understand that the finances are in dire need, but my academic and athletic career at the collegiate level is dire as well. I want to stay at College Bmore than you can imagine. I am certain that if you reconsider your decision, you won‚Äôt regret it.",06Jul2019,2

57,"Hi people of reddit! Need some advice.

I keep getting hired for and taking bad jobs. It's not that every single aspect is bad, but each has been insufferable in some way.

My first job was easy and in a field I liked, but I ended up only REALLY needing to work 2 hours a day to stay on top of things and it was in the middle of nowhere with an hour plus commute.

My second job was way better in terms of challenging me, but I ended up working in an unsafe environment with ethical issues where my boss pretty much told me I was on my own and he'd seen much worse abuses.I quit that job without a backup.

Now I'm in a middle management position but the boss has violent mood swings, doesn't delegate important tasks or let anyone else take,ownership, and is growing the company at breakneck speed with no intentions of expanding staff (among other issues). I had thought my role would be more about strategic growth. I talked about it with my therapist and she phrased it that my boss makes demands and stirs stuff up, and I'm the clean up crew. I think the staff are expecting me to be the challenging voice, but to me it seems pointless because from everything I've seen and heard, this person will never change.

My first thought is that I'm just unreasonable about my expectations. Am I?

If not, I kind of feel like I should just be a loudmouth about all of my opinions from now on for the sake of the staff, even if nothing changes or I get fired. Is that a dumb idea?

Lastly, WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING AND HOW DO I FIX IT?",06Jul2019,1

65,"Recently I was talking to a man about having a threesome with him and his wife. He said he would have his wife text me and we could see if she and I were compatible. She messaged me and we flirted a bit. Then, the next day, I receive a text message saying that the wife was hit by a drunk driver and was in critical condition. The husband texted me and kept me up to date on the whole thing and long story short, the wife died leaving him to raise their one year old daughter.

I know what you are all thinking because that is what two of my friends who have experience with online fuckery thought. But I was too naive and trusting at this point. SO.... I gave him emotional support and guidance (I lost 7 relatives while growing up, so I‚Äôm good with grief). I helped him think of what to write for the eulogy,. Meanwhile, he was texting me, calling me, in-chat messaging me, and Skype-ing me regularly. I know that everyone grieves differently and didn't think anything of it. Keeping routine can help with the healing process. But once I talked to my friends who know the Reddit community as well as the online user mentality, the seed of doubt was planted.

My friends did a bit of sleuthing and discovered where the wife worked. Keep in mind, I was planning a meet up with some GW people and the alleged widower made a $150 deposit for the AirBNB so he meant business. He planned on meeting me and having sex with me. This was not just an online chatting situation. I addressed the seed of doubt with him more than once and he did not come clean. So when the wife was put on the schedule at the gym where she worked three weeks after her alleged death, what did I do? I left a message at the wife's work for her to call me. Why? Because when you marry someone, you don't fuck around behind their back. You talk about your kinks and your fantasies and you figure that stuff out together as a team!

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't contact him after leaving a message for his wife to call me. I DID, however, create a second account on the site to see if he was still signing on to lie and cheat on his wife. He was, but I didn't message him. Then, I was banned from the chat site. The reasoning was that I was making multiple chatters uncomfortable and that there were reports that I was trying to add chatters on other websites and calling them at work.  


I'm not sure how to go about this anymore because I messaged the mod/site owner the following and didn't receive a response:  


&gt;Two weeks ago, after being told the reason for my ban by a mod, I made an attempt to communicate with you the following message:   
&gt;  
&gt;Ban evasion was due to a lack of communication on behalf of the chat owner. As you know, this community is precious. For me to wake up one morning with no means of contacting friends, and no explanation even upon inquiry can cause significant upset.   
&gt;  
&gt;In terms of initial ban, there is another side to the story. I was in no way harassing another user on this site. \[Redacted username\] and I had been talking for over a month about meeting up for an east coast meetup. It began with me and him discussing a threesome with his wife. He had messaged me on Reddit, asked for my number, which was the beginning of countless phone calls, Skype sessions, and in chat flirtations. However, I recently caught him in a very serious lie that shook me to my core. I did not contact him about the lie.   
&gt;  
&gt;I accept the ban but wanted you to have my side of the story. If you would like character references from chat, I would be more than happy to provide them. Again, I believe in open communication and was hoping to provide my side of things.

I know that I should just ""let it go"", but I have made a lot of friends in the chat and enjoyed not only dancing on cam, but also helping people with their problems, joking around, and having a sense of community which I've never had before.

What can I possibly say to the site owner / mod to allow me back into the chatroom?

I have evidence that the guy initiated contact with me off site via reddit, skype, texting, and sent money to me via venmo. But I don't think that the supporting evidence that would help in a democratic setting will support me in this instance.

We had small conversation about it and he mentioned he heard I was getting a PlayStation and said it would be cool to build what was in the Minecraft video that I sent him *with him* so that was cool.

Somehow, one day we‚Äôre all playing Minecraft together and I‚Äôm talking way more with them than I ever was. We connect and we‚Äôre basically friends. Tim then invites me to actually hang out with them in class, and this is amazing I thought. Since then I‚Äôve gotten to know more guys and befriend them  Basically the start of a whole new friend group. Of boys. Not implying that there‚Äôs something wrong with it, just that it‚Äôs different. 

After a couple months of getting used to a new ‚Äòlifestyle‚Äô? (Basically just hopping on the PlayStation everyday and talking with them and others whilst playing games) I‚Äôve gotten to know them all a lot better. I‚Äôve stopped liking Tim, and somewhat Carter due to the fact he‚Äôs done some things I don‚Äôt agree with and the fact he‚Äôs just not  very mature

Tim asked me out. Gave it a try, Didn‚Äôt turn out. Not too long after that, Carter confessed to liking me previously. Fast forward to our end of the school year trip, we‚Äôre sitting in the hot tub (me, Carter, boy #1, and a couple others)
Boy #1 talks about how him and his girl aren‚Äôt a thing anymore, and in comfort, I tell him I‚Äôve been there. He immediately looks at me and Carter with some kind of expression on his face and asks wether or not me and Carter have ever been together and we both respond with no and THEN he decides to ask if me and Carter have a thing for each other. We both go silent. Boy #1 points it out. I don‚Äôt know why I went silent, I guess I did like Carter but not enough for a relationship. And I just didn‚Äôt want to say straight up no. He went silent though. He also asked me if I liked him, I beat around the bush and asked boy #1 if HE liked Carter, he sarcastically replied with a ‚Äúyeah man‚Äù

Later on, Carter brought it up in conversation over mic. Didn‚Äôt go anywhere, I tried avoiding it as long as I could. Until we were in a party late, and he asked me who I liked and I asked him instead (rather than answering) and he said he might tell me. He messaged me on Instagram and he basically told me he liked me and I told him I liked him too. Because I did. No hiding it, but not that I wanted it to go anywhere. 

But I gave it thought and I‚Äôm considering giving it a chance. He said we can take the next step when I‚Äôm comfortable, understanding how my last relationship went. I said I‚Äôd like that. Now I‚Äôm giving it MORE thought and I don‚Äôt know anymore. 
He‚Äôs just not what I want in a boy. I want someone as smart as I am, I‚Äôm really not trying to sound like I‚Äôm way up there but he‚Äôs just a bit slow and he admits to this. I want a boy who has eyes for me and only me and I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôs still not over this other girl by the name of Chris we‚Äôll call her. He liked her previously and according to my other friend, he was talking about the possibility of hooking up with her. It‚Äôs just not a nice thought. But I guess that *was* while I was getting over Tim, (his best friend)

He IS very considerate and supportive though, ands good listener and cares about what I have to say, and will defend if I get shit talked. And he‚Äôs willing to wait and take it slow. Which Tim wasn‚Äôt. But I don‚Äôt think think I‚Äôm honestly *that* attracted to Carter, the way he carries his  body, the shit he says, how he texts, even how his face looks sometimes. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm just not ready for a relationship. 

Basically everyone in my friend group likes me in that way or previously liked me EXCEPT for the gay dude of the group. and it makes me feel like shit because what if the only reason I‚Äôm still here is because they liked me more than a friend and wanted to take it somewhere? 

I feel like they don‚Äôt like me as an actual friend but rather just something to hit on and look at, yet I can think of things that counter this but those thoughts and shitty feelings won‚Äôt go away. 
In conclusion I am undecided on giving Carter a chance, staying within the friend group, or waiting until next year to find a new friend group. It all bothers me but I can‚Äôt open up to anyone but my other two friend that are girls. It‚Äôs really sad because one of these girls are moving away and the other I‚Äôm not as close with. Sorry for the long story, if you happened to read this all the way, thank you (also I‚Äôm going into high school next year you were under the impression we were young, I just can‚Äôt open up to my mom about this and my dad doesn‚Äôt live with me)",06Jul2019,1

81,"Hi everyone so I am just done. I feel as if I wasted the best years of my life doing something so dumb I can't stand life anymore. Last summer my group of friends started hanging out with this group of girls and one of them was interested in dating me. I decided not to date her because I was to busy with my business and saw that she was dating a new guy every month and I didn't just want to be just another guy. (BTW she was dating a lot for emotional reasons and not sex)

When I was a kid I was very lonely and didn't have many friends. I was bullied for how I acted and how I looked. I was always pushed around in life and never had the confidence to do anything. When I got into high school I decided to take a stand to this bullshit and started building a business. I worked so hard to build my business and was so obsessed that when something wouldn't go right I would want to end my own life. Now at the end of my senior year my business makes about 60k a year in passive income and I will probably make 100k a year passively in the next couple of years. This would sound great to the old me and to many others but honestly I feel fucking stupid.

Since freshman year I dreamed that senior year would be amazing. I would have a beautiful girlfriend and I could take her to homecoming and prom and have the kind of relationship I would see in the movies. My dream was so big but I felt my hard work could make something like this come true. Well honestly it did and thats what the problem is. The girl that I decided to pass up over the summer started dating a guy that she continued dating all school year up until today. Throughout the school year I had to watch them have the kind of senior year I have always wanted. Now that high school is over I feel like a huge failure. I chased money when I had the perfect girl in front of me the whole time who didn't care about my money or looks and liked me for me. Something much better than anything I could have dreamed of. Sadly I had to watch this die in front of my eyes. I can't believe how stupid I am. I wake up every morning in utter regret for what I have done. Each day gets worse as I think about what could have been to the point where I don't want to live anymore.

More than anything in the world I want to feel love. I want to fall deeply in love with a girl and care about her more than anything. I feel as if I finally took a stand to this cold world and was pushed down farther than I was before. I was once full of hope for the future and excited for what could be and now I am completely hopeless. This girl is going to the same community college as me next year and I just hope that I will get another chance then to make up for what I should have done in the past. I care about her so much it makes me sick. I just feel like I will never find something like this again in my life or will have able to have the same happiness from it. I would really appreciate some advice on what to do and how to forgive myself for my past. Thanks so much!",06Jul2019,1
82,"I've tried engaging him and asking him nicely to stop, telling him it isn't funny, ignoring him, etc. and nothing seems to get him to stop.

Thanks in advance.",06Jul2019,3
83,"My friend invited me to their friend's camp to hang out and swim for half a day. It's about 25 minutes from my house. I told my mom through a text and she and my dad quickly texted me back with 23 (I counted) questions, including ""How long has your friend had a driver's license?"", ""Why do they want YOU?"", and ""Whose camp is it and what do they do for a living?"", and expressing strong dislike for even the idea. I'm 27.

Am I justified in feeling like I have helicopter parents? This is my first reaction, but then I wonder if my parents aren't overprotective and that I'm just reckless.",06Jul2019,1
85,"I'm honestly not sure if i'm wasting my time, or if the fact that i'm having fun justifies spending this much time playing video games. For the record im a 17 year old boy.

I dont play many different game, i play one game, for hours every day, and i have for 5+ years. For those interested its a gamemode in minecraft called factions, it has a pretty big community of mainly 14-20 year olds, and it is extremely competitive. 

It's a team game, around 2 years ago i started a team or 'faction'. This faction now has 60 members and i'm very good friends with a lot of them. It feels like a big family. 

Last season i told myself, that as soon as it ends, i will be starting to play a lot less, and focus on actually doing stuff irl (1 season lasts 2 months). Well, that was about a month ago, and we are half way into this one, and i'm playing more than ever. It's summer vacation so i can basically play as much as i want.

The problem is that i feel like i'm not doing nearly as much stuff irl. If my friends invite me to something, i'll say yes, but i never take initiative to go out and do something by myself, or ask my friends if they want to do something anymore. 

Playing this game is fun, i feel like it gives me purpose in a weird way, and when we for the first time won a season about a month ago, i think i have never been that happy.

However, it's negatively effecting my social life, physical health (I don't move nearly as much), and my grades (i got the grades i needed this year but next year i need really good grades to go to the school i want to).

One more thing i'd like to add, i have tried taking a few breaks, a few weeks ago i had a 5 day break, and i had so much fun, but that was because i was with my friends and we were actually doing stuff all of those 5 days, so we had fun. However a lot of the time my friends will just play league and not really do anything and i just kinda sit on my pc instead of asking if they want to do something. 

Am i wasting my time? Should i force myself to quit and try to find other interests?",06Jul2019,1
87,"Not sure on where to exactly start this....When I moved into my own place I brought with me my 2 year old (at the time) female pug Willow, after a year and a half I decided I‚Äôd like another dog to keep Willow company when I go to work. I come across puppies for sale on Facebook, but it didn‚Äôt clarify what breed they were and I couldn‚Äôt tell from the picture, so I called the guy and he brought the litter to my house. Tbh, I forgot what he told me because I could tell he didn‚Äôt really know himself. They looked medium size and had curly fluffy hair and ranged from golden to light brown. I decided to buy a golden female who I called Candy. He said they were 7 weeks old buy they clearly were around 5 weeks old now I think about it. Fast forward 14-16 months and Candy is all grown up. Candy is about the size of a Shih Tzu, has medium length curly hair, and her personality is extremely docile. Willow is just your regular pug. All this time I‚Äôve never had any issues what so ever with Candy or Willow. To me my knowledge Candy has never ever shown any aggression what so ever. She literally will roll on her belly the moment she sees you and has never even barked at another dog. At that time i didn‚Äôt think about getting any more dogs as 3 would be a handful, but one day my friend told me his sister is trying to sell her female 8 month old Dachshund because she‚Äôs not allowed pets in her new apartment building. I thought about it decided to one more couldn‚Äôt hurt. The dogs name was Lola and she had a lot of energy. I mean she was crazy excited at every moment. Willow is starting to show signs of age now and pretty much just lays around all day, and Candy has always been extremely docile and laid back. The one thing I did nothing straight away was that Lola would run up to Willow and Lola and jump and nip at their faces in a playful manner, but it was clear neither one enjoyed this. But still I didn‚Äôt see any aggression from either Willow or Candy. Yesterday I was upstairs in the shower and I heard the sound of growling coming out the bathroom window. I didn‚Äôt really think much of it and actually closed the window (my bathroom window allows ppl to see in). I‚Äôd say I was out and dressed within 12-15 minutes from closing the window. I go downstairs and head to my back yard. I walk out and I can see Willow cowering in the corner outside of the mini shed I built for them, which i knew was weird because she‚Äôs call laying inside the shed with her head sticking out the door, and I knew she was scared because she had her ears down. I looked into the shed and I can‚Äôt even describe how shocked I was. There was Lola laying on her side clearly dead with Candy with her teeth around her neck ripping side to side aggressively while making a growling noise. I was so shocked I couldn‚Äôt even move. I stood there for about 1-3 minuets which felt like a like time. Candy at one point even stopped sniffed her and ripped back into Lola‚Äôs neck. I shouted at Candy and she looked up at me, all I could see was her whole head covered in Lola‚Äôs blood, and I noticed Lola‚Äôs blood was all over the walls and floor too. Candy was looking at me panting with her tongue out giving off a vibe as if she wasn‚Äôt just savagely tearing into Lola. I have Lola a funeral in my front yard and bathed Candy. It‚Äôs only been one night, but I‚Äôve kept Candy outside in the mini shed and kept Willow in the house. I‚Äôm now very conflicted on what to do next. I can‚Äôt sell her to a family knowing what she‚Äôs capable, and I can‚Äôt take her to the pound because they‚Äôll put her down. I was looking at her today in the back yard and I just can‚Äôt ever see her in the same light anymore either. I can‚Äôt get over this guilt that I allowed this perfectly healthy happy dog get brutally killed in my own home. Any advice is very much needed and appreciated than you!",06Jul2019,1

98,"This is about a teacher of mine. 

He knows me for 3 years now. 3 years ago I had a class with him. I was going through a phase were I suffered from severe anxiety and depression, so I really underperformed in school. I did well on exams, but couldn't talk because of nervous ticks that prevented me from speaking like a normal human being. Never really noticed that teacher back then, as I was too busy minding my own shit and the subject he thought wasn't really that interesting. 

Fast forward 2 years, I am in a much better place mentally. I still suffer from nervous ticks, but I am working hard to succeed despite them holding me back. I can finally contribute in class and turned into a really good student with no effort beside working on my mental health. 
I get the teacher again, this time in a different class that I genuinely find super interesting and fun to partake in. A lot of discussions about current political issues, economics etc, totally my jam. I do really well and my teacher hands out grades on a small piece of paper. Mine has a little note written on it that says something along the lines of ""amazing transformation"". It's just a little note, but God it means so much to me personally, I still have it to this day. 
The teacher offers presentations for those with low grades, I have a good grade but decide to ask to maybe do a presentation anyway since I want to work on my public speaking skills and this is the perfect opportunity. Teacher agrees and I give a presentation, he thinks it's awesome and even let's me present it in front of another class he teaches. 
Some time passes and he offers that I do another presentation. Amazing! 
I go all out and deliver an amazing presentation, he says the nicest things ever to me and I get a major confidence boost from it. As a naturally extroverted person who loves talking in front of people, finally being able to confidently (most of the time at least) do so means a lot. 
To say thank you, I write a 7 page essay on some topic we mentioned during class and put a little letter with it, nothing serious, just a small thank you. 

Now suddenly, whenever I see him, he looks at me with pure dismay in his face. He doesn't smile back at me when I smile at him, doesn't talk to me, nothing. It makes me extremely sad to say the least. It's not even the fact that he hates me, I am used to people getting sick of me eventually. It's that I don't know what I did so terribly wrong. Usually, I can point to something I did and then learn from it. 
It's not me, it's that bad thing I did. Now that I really don't know what I did, it's just me. 

I recently graduated and I decided to hold a speech in front of several hundred people. I was so hyped, I couldn't have imagined doing this a year ago and now I am standing here, holding this speech. It was amazing and many people told me I did very well, but it was overshadowed by that one teacher's absence. I looked at the crowd, looked at all the teachers that had come, but he wasn't there. 
I kinda knew that he wouldn't come, but there was this slight hope, the hope that he might see me and perhaps even be proud of me. He wasn't. He probably won't ever know I held that speech, even though without the opportunities he gave me, it wouldn't have been possible. Instead, he now hates me and I still don't know why. 

Later today (it's 4 am) I see my grade for the last time and some teachers are going to be there. I know that he won't be there and that I'll never get closure. I'll never know what I did wrong and it kills me inside. The person who said the most genuinely nice thing to me that anyone has ever said decided to abandon me and it hurts so much.

Do any of you have advice on how I can deal with this? I keep asking myself what I did wrong and since I'll never get closure, I don't know how I'll ever be able to leave this behind me.",06Jul2019,1

110," I've posted little things about this before in the past but I'm going to make this a longer post and really break everything down.

I'll be a senior in high school this year. I'm 17, so take everything I say with a grain of salt. I know that I know nothing about life, love, careers, etc.

I'll start with what really slapped me across the face and gave me a dose of reality. I was always a really big introvert and never really had friends. My sophomore year of high school I became amazing friends with this new group of people. For the rest of 10th grade we did everything together. Towards the end of that summer I developed feelings for one of my friends sister and she developed feelings for me. Long story short we ended up dating but then drama started with our group so I stopped talking to my girlfriends brother. He blamed her for it and he would constantly yell at her and berate her and tell her it's all her fault and just scream horrible obscenities at her. Even though I loved her I felt like I had to let her go so she could be at peace with her family. She lost her dad and her mom had breast cancer and I didn't want to be the reason for the family not getting along. So I broke up with her. It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. I missed her so much and I still do. Only recently her brother and I have started chatting again. He apologized and admitted that he was wrong and was the one at fault here. He said he didn't know how to handle losing a friend and took it out on her. Of course I was pissed because I had to let a girl go that I loved in order for that family to be at peace. I wasn't going to yell at him for it, I forgave him because he had the balls to admit that he was wrong. She's in another relationship now with a kid that isn't really that great for her. I know that sounds bad coming from me because im the ex but he's really an idiot and doesn't respect her. He get's drunk all the time and is a huge JUUL fiend. They fight all the time but she still sticks with him and I can't help but feel responsible. Sure I wasn't the greatest boyfriend ever to her. It was my 1st relationship so I didn't know what I was doing but I still care about her.

I told her all of this over the phone recently and she gave me the courtesy of listening to me. I told her how sorry I was that this all happened and that I still care about her and have feelings for her. I know that may have been a scummy thing to do but I felt like I had to get everything out of me to be at peace. Since the breakup I've tried really hard to work on myself. I take cold showers and get up everyday at 5:30 and go to the gym. During the day I work and when I come home I try and eat a healthy dinner and I try to read for an hour. I'm trying to become a better man. I constantly watch Alan watts videos and Elisha Long videos. I try to put all of that into practice. When I was on the phone with her I told her that I know this is all high school but I still really want a second chance with her to prove that I've changed. She said she understands but tried to explain to me that she's just some girl and that she's super proud of the work I've done but she said she is very happy with her life right now. I told her I understand and wouldn't bother her ever again. She even told me that this new guy had done more for her than I did in 7 months. that kinda stung, I get that I wasn't great but I did try. Her family didn't always make it easy for me. Does it make me a bad person for leaving her and not trying to work it out? I do love her that's why I let her go. I didn't want her to suffer anymore. I worry that because I left her I won't get a second chance at love and If I do I'm worried that person will either cheat on me or just leave me because I'm boring.

However, Her brother wants me to come over and hang out again but I just simply can't. I'd be too emotional and her boyfriend would freak out. I see his side of things I'd be pretty pissed too if I was him, that's why I'm not going to drive a wedge between them. He's a pretty hot headed guy, he fights people over the dumbest stuff. He pushed a kid up against a locker because he said hi to his girlfriend. One thing that really upset me was my ex said she wants me to be friends with her boyfriend if possible and work things out so I could be able to hang out. It felt like she didn't respect me at all, how could I be friends with her boyfriend when I dated her! Especially considering I think I've made a mistake breaking up and all. she knows how I feel about her!

Other than that I'm trying to put that all behind me now. She showed who she's loyal too and I respect that. I was the one who left, I was the one who ended things. I know I shouldn't put her on a pedestal but I worry that she was the one for me. I worry that I left a girl who I was mean't to be with. I'm very afraid that I'll never find someone like her again. She was beautiful, smart, funny, clumsy, giddy, etc. She was the perfect girl. I know i'll probably meet more women given my age. I'm trying to see the bigger picture. Life takes over after high school and most relationships in high school don't end up working out anyway.

I'm just afraid of never being able to meet another amazing girl who loves me for me. I know that this fear is something that's deeply rooted in my person. It's something that I have to work out because if I can't be content alone I won't be able to care for someone else again. I'm trying to get over this I really am and I've heard the 1st heartbreak is always the hardest. I know a million other people have probably said and experienced a similar thing, that's why they call it a first love.

Apart from that I'm worried about my life in general. I don't know which road to take. I want a job I can be happy with but at the same time I want to experience as much as I can. My cousin told me that when he was in college he hated it and he wanted to change his life and experience something totally new. So he dropped out and joined the Marines and now he gets to be a crew chief on a UH-1Y and flies around San Diego Bay everyday. He said he thought it was really sad to see all of his old friends back home just being herded like sheep into careers they didn't really want and aren't living their lives. He said the most fun they ever have is going to vineyard on weekends with their girlfriends and he said that it's sad they are doing things like that in their 20s, it's something 50 year olds should be doing. I don't want to end up a slave my whole live just living day by day and watching my life drag on. I want to see and experience amazing things. I'd also like to meet a girl who shares the same dream. I don't want to settle down in my 20s, I don't want the house with the white picket fence and a puppy. I want to live in different places, I want to travel, I want to see and talk to as many people as possible and hear their stories.

I kinda have a plan for the future. My dad works at a local college as a security guard so I can get free tuition. I'm defiantly going to take it, I cant pass up free college. I don't really know what I want to major in though. I know I still have time but I'm just worried I'll settle for something I'll end up hating and then be stuck with it. If I don't feel that college is for me I do plan on dropping out and joining the military. If I can make it through college but end up with a degree I don't like then I'm probably going to join the military as an officer. I do have to take into consideration that I have no idea what life is going to throw at me and my plans will most likely change.

After the big falling out with all of my friends I really don't have anyone to talk to anymore. I just feel pretty sad and lonely. I have some hobbies but I get pretty bored. I guess I just feel like I'm stuck in a rut. I'm sure I'll meet new people later down the road but I don't want to end up like my parents. They aren't bad people at all but they are just very sad in my opinion. They only have 1 other couple they hang out with but that's it. My dad really doesn't have a whole lot of friends and I just think that's a sad way to live. I really don't want to end up like him though. Don't get me wrong I love him a lot and i'm very grateful for the sacrifices hes made for me but he's just a shell anymore. My mom cheated on him twice with the same guy. I give him credit for staying around after all of this. My sister told me at one point he almost killed himself but that's another story for another day. I don't want to meet a woman who will do that to me. My mom is a good mother but she is defiantly not a good wife. What she did was wrong but she's my mother and I can't hate her for it. The thought of that happening to me has me freaked out. really all I want is to meet someone who complements my life when I'm ready to have a stable relationship. I've got a lot of work to do on myself before I can allow that to happen but I just worry that all this effort I'm putting into changing myself will just be for nothing.

I really feel like I'm lost at this point. I guess some would consider this an early life crisis. I'm glad that I'm having it at this age and at this time because now I really see what I want in life I just don't know how to obtain it. I want to create an amazing life and make some amazing friends and meet an amazing woman. If anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it. I'm just a very confused man and I'm pretty intimidated by life. Maybe it's because i'm weak or maybe it's because I'm a pretty deep thinker. Whatever it is I don't know and I don't think I'll ever know, That's the beauty of life I guess.",06Jul2019,1

114,"I'm 16 about to turn 17 in a few days and for my entire life, I haven't been able to go outside unless it's with family or school. By the way ""going somewhere with family"" is literally only church and 10 minute trips to Walmart. No sleepovers, no mall with friends, no movies with friends, basically no normal social activity someone my age would do. It's extremely depressing and sometimes I just don't know what to do with myself. Internally holding the sadness and loneliness this brings me is getting genuinely tiring. I'm also starting to develop a deep hate towards my parents even though I know they mean no harm. I don't have any real friends I can sit down and talk to, any of my online friends and school acquaintances see my issue as a joke. I've talked to my siblings that grew up together (both 25+) and they say they went through it too so suck it up. 

This summer, as of when I'm typing this I haven't felt sunlight for a week, and the last time I did was to go to church and come right back home. Sneaking out and not getting caught is impossible, my mom just babysits her two granddaughters at home all day everyday. I can't describe the pain that comes from girls I had genuine attraction to, and having to watch every single one of them drift away because I'm a 17 year old bot that isn't allowed to go outside lol. Social media's a whole new level of depressing. Just watching everyone live their lives while I'm trapped between 4 walls. I go off to college 2020, and I'm just starting to realize that being sheltered this hard has stopped me from maturing properly and I don't see myself as an adult in any sense at all.

To start it all began when I was around 11 or 12 and my cousin maybe 3-4. I honestly can‚Äôt remember. This happened one 1 occasion that I can remember, I can‚Äôt even remember if the second one happened. I somewhat humped my cousin. It was not like full on thrusting but somewhat like humping for maybe 2-3 minutes. I never touched him or made him touch me inappropriately and both of us always had clothes on. I forgot all about these childish acts until today. My cousin is a strange child and acts very strange at times. My mother tonight at dinner suggested that he may have been sexually assaulted. She has no evidence of this claim besides that his other cousin that is much closer to his age is somewhat violent and almost got kicked out of elementary school and has an alcoholic mother. I then remembered what happened 6-8 years ago. I did not mean harm to him during the act but I cant help but think somehow this is my fault. I have such a good relationship with my entire family including my aunt and I can‚Äôt imagine how they would look at me if they knew. Was this sexual abuse? Do you think these acts could have caused his behavior today. Could he even remember these things. Should I tell my mother about what I did. I don‚Äôt know how to feel.",06Jul2019,1

137,"I just started working at a new pharmacy (I‚Äôve worked in one before) and I‚Äôve been there less than a month but everyone is really nice so far. There‚Äôs 1 lady in particular that I work with very regularly (probably 20 hours a week) and she tells me to do (or not do to) all these inconvenient things, phrasing them like they‚Äôre rules or just what ‚Äòeveryone does‚Äô around work. I took them as the truth because she‚Äôs much older and has been doing this job for 20+ years. One day one of the pharmacists mentioned that she tends to make up some rules. She won‚Äôt enforce them *per se* but ‚Äústrongly suggests‚Äù them and will complain to me if I don‚Äôt do it, or do it ‚Äòincorrectly‚Äô.

I don‚Äôt like most of the things she tells me to do because either they‚Äôre inconvenient, or just don‚Äôt make sense (as in the way I do it makes sense, and her ‚Äúway‚Äù almost seems purely her preference). Usually I wouldn‚Äôt mind if it was small things, but it‚Äôs stuff that completely alters the way I work on things I do for hours every day. I have to go out of my way to do it her way.

Problem is, I don‚Äôt know if these are actual rules, or just the way *she* likes doing stuff. I work with the same 6-7 people for hours every week and REALLY don‚Äôt want to cause any drama cause that can make this job absolutely terrible (and I 100% don‚Äôt want to leave this job). I don‚Äôt want to straight up ask her if they‚Äôre actual rules or not because that might make her snippy and have a bad attitude with me all the time. I don‚Äôt know how to (or if I want to) tell one of the pharmacists that I feel most of the ‚Äúrules‚Äù she makes for me are her own and not actual rules.

I feel like if I ‚ÄúTattletale‚Äù to one of them, they‚Äôll take it as me being a complainer/baby or they‚Äôll agree and tell her, but obviously she‚Äôll know I said something and possibly resent me for it or even worse, make my job harder. She can‚Äôt exactly punish me, but everyone knows if you work with someone and they don‚Äôt like you, they can find ways to make your job suck without breaking any rules or seeming like they‚Äôre doing it on purpose.

So I thought I could get some advice on this situation.

I have some friends, and recently have been having some issues with them.

One of these friends in my group has always usually been cool to me since I‚Äôve been hanging out with him and others around last year. Within the last few months however, I haven‚Äôt had as much time to hang out as I‚Äôve been busy with school work (full course load).

After I had more free time to hang out however, this one friend has been treating me differently.

He‚Äôll be cool most of the time, then out of nowhere make these remarks like he‚Äôs talking down to me. Like I was looking on the side of a soda can, and this particular soda had more sugar then usual, so I said ‚Äúman this has a lot of sugar‚Äù and he responded ‚Äúwell yeah, it‚Äôs soda.‚Äù Or one day I was trying to write something down and couldn‚Äôt find a pen, so I borrowed one from a wall calendar and it wouldn‚Äôt work. After I said it wasn‚Äôt working, his response was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs because it‚Äôs for the calendar.‚Äù And then one day we were chilling and I picked up a drink out of a case and said ‚Äúwow didn‚Äôt expect this to still be cold‚Äù and he responded ‚Äúwell the cold ones are gonna be in the fridge.‚Äù Finally we were playing a game one night and I apparently didn‚Äôt make a good move, and he let out this huge, obnoxious sigh.

This is really pissing me off for some reason. But my other friends insist that it‚Äôs just ball busting, however it feels condescending as hell. Why is he doing this? Am I crazy here?

I can‚Äôt talk to him about it because he‚Äôll tell me i‚Äôm being silly and that i know he loves me.

146,"About a year ago I got a call from my little sister. She was crying and could barely breathe. When she finally calmed down enough to talk, she told me she had just gotten home from school and our mom wouldn't wake up. This was only the first of many calls like this. I go to grad school out of the state so I immediately flew home. My mom went to a rehab facility for a week and came home and seemed fine. My dad was there to take care of her and my sister so I felt comfortable going back to school. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a year, my mom has been in and out of facilities, counseling, meds, groups, and specialists. She has only gotten worse. She barely gets out of bed and won't stop drinking and sneaking pills. As soon as I got home from school, my dad left. He left my sister and I alone with my mom. My sister has taken the biggest part of the trauma. She cries to me almost daily about how she does not want me to leave for school in the fall. She will be staying with my grandparents, so do not worry about her being alone. They just do not know the full details of the everyday situation as we do not like to tell people because it is embarrassing and hard to tell without crying. 

&amp;#x200B;

For a surprise (well deserved) I planned a trip to Disney. When I told her, the joy on her face was unlike anything I have ever seen. We have always been the biggest disney fans. I am tearing up just thinking about the reaction she had. She has been already looking at what stuff in Disney she wants to do and has a full itinerary. I told our dad and he agreed he would pay for our flights and then my sisters tickets to get in since she is a minor. So I put everything o my credit card. I just got his check in the mail and tried to deposit it and  it bounced. He will not respond to any of my calls or messages. I am already in TONS of school debt, this is literally going to send me over the edge. I am a full time graduate student only making money from my minimum wage job and I have been saving all summer for this and it won't bring me near what I need. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I break my sisters heart like every other family member or do I just pay for the trip and be in more debt? I need help and advice please.",06Jul2019,5
148,"I've never liked to talk about my problems, but tonight I guess I've reached a point where telling everything to internet strangers for some help makes sense. Warning, it's gonna be a long text.

So first of all, I've never been a very social person, I guess not having any siblings or cousins and not going to preschool didn't help much. I never really had a lot of friends in my life (I'm 17, FYI), and to this day I am still a massive introvert. Thankfully, when I was 6, I met a girl at my school who also was a neighbor. Long story short we became friend, and she ended up taking the same bus as me for secondary school (high school, kinda). Didn't go at the same school, but we talked a lot in the bus/waiting for it, and with time she became my best friend. 

As I said, I never had a lot of friends, and so I never had any girlfriend. I didn't really mind, I had never really felt like I loved someone, the closest was crushes that I didn't care about enough to ask out (well, that and my massive anxiety). But a year ago, when I finished my school year, I was really close to failing and having to go to another school. It also meant I wouldn't take the bus, and so I wouldn't see her anymore. In that time period, I realized she meant much more to me, and during the summer I felt in love. Every summer, we saw each other at a McDonald's or something and talked, shared meme, that kind of stuff. My idiotic self decided that I should ask her out, something I never thought I would have the balls to do. But I guess love makes you do crazy things, because I asked her out on August 27th. She was kinda in shock, so I nicely asked if she wanted to think about it. She said yes, and we figured we would talk about it in 2 days, during the first bus ride.

4 hours later, I received an email I didn't think I would get. She said she wasn't ready for a relationship and didn't want to ruin our good friendship. This email changed everything. I tried my best to reply something that would hide the pain, said something about understanding and being glad our friendship wasn't over. Two days later, when we saw each other again, things were different. She played the ""nothing ever happened let's ignore it and never talk about it"" approach, which I followed. It took a good 2 months for our friendship to recover from that. 

Unfortunately, I also took the never talking about it approach to my own emotions, and started to hide them. People who knew me probably would've never knew I was extremely sad and slowly getting depressed. For months, I hid those emotions behind constant fake smiles and fake laughter when in fact I wanted to cry everyday. I lied to a point where I was lying to myself and made things much worse. It eventually hit me and I realized I was depressed, and not just the pitiful internet depression, it was real. On February 27, 6 months after the event, I decided I would stop hiding it and stop all the fake shit. For most people, I pretty much changed from a normal happy person to a sad, depressed guy in the space of one day. And once I did that, I was just slightly getting better. Hiding everything made things so much worse, and not having to hide it genuinely helped.

Well, with getting better came a new feeling: Hope. By looking back at it, she never technically said no, so maybe there was a chance. I started trying things out, from going to the movies to asking her to go to prom at my school with me, as friends (I really, really made the friend thing important in that, don't worry). Of course, it never worked out, but not because she said no. It always was something along the lines of not seeing my text, or having something to do that day, things like that. During that time, I was pretty much sad all the time, except for the times when I had hope, tried something, it didn't work and went back to being sad. I eventually realized that, in fact, she knew what all those things meant, and that the excuses weren't always true. While I was happy about them in a way that she did those so it would never be a brutal no and risk hurting the friendship, it killed this feeling of hope and generally made my life worse. 

For months now, I've suffered from this, but she always was there, and even became the only person I talked to about my mental health and my problems (except this one, of course. Maybe she knew why I was depressed, probably wasn't hard to figure out, but I never made it clear and never talked about it directly or indirectly). And now, school is over, for good. High school/secondary school is over and that means I won't see her like I used to. Except for the few times we might meet like all the summers before, we won't see each other. And now, I've lost the only person I could talk to about my problems, the only thing that really brought me happiness, the friend that stayed even after I fucked things up so many times, and I don't know what I will do. These past few days have been extremely hard, and I really feel like I lost the only reason I had to wake up and live my life (nothing suicide related, idk how to write it im tired af). I know I need to find a therapist or something, but I would have to tell my parents about it, but I've hid all of this for so long, I just can't tell them. I genuinely don't know what to do",06Jul2019,1

151,"The fucking vicious cycle in my house I swear, if it's not one bill it's another. I'm currently in the hospital with my fiance, she gave birth to our baby three days ago and everything was great, he's a quiet boy, nice and healthy, cute as hell, my fiance is making a good recovery after the C section, we we're happy to bring our boy home tomorrow and show her family and mine, the hospital is great, fried shrimp for dinner, cheese cake, great nurses (Except for one), all around grand ol time. Until my mom texted me this morning telling me the internet was shut off. It's a $600 bill that they're good to want in full because she didn't pay it, and the only reason it is this much is because she fucking bought $150 worth of movies on the cable box, brought the normally $160 bill to fucking $310 in a month. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a strong believer in that ""Silence is a virtue"" bit, but complete silence all the time really bugs the living hell out of me. I already pay the electric bill by myself that seven people that live in my house use, I'm pushing about $300 a month for that, I get paid biweekly about $680, now that doesn't sound too hard to manage on paper but I now have a baby to afford, I have to pay the rent my fiance pays my mom, why the fuck she charges her for a room she shares with me kills my brain cells but that's $75 a week, my fiance can't pay because she's currently not working, you know, the whole baby thing, having her stomach sliced open, you'd think there'd be some leeway but you don't know my family, money is a fucking wicked tool in my house. What ends up happening is, my family will let the bills skyrocket, never pay them, and when shit gets turned off, I'm backed into a corner because now I have a baby, so that $450 gas bill that they charge my mother fucking THIRTY THREE DOLLARS A MONTH, she doesn't pay for, but once it gets shut off, what do I do? I'm forced to pay it, same with the water, how the hell does someone let the water bill get to $700... I digress I'm getting off topic and I'm ranting. I'll cut it short here, one step at a time, does anyone know anything about independent ISPs? Are they reliable? I'm sure they can't handle shit like gaming but I'm just looking for something good enough to get some YouTube going, some background noise you know?

153,"Hey internet,

These last 2 weeks have been absolute torture and i'm hoping for ""something"" by venting into the void that is Reddit. So without further a do..

I met this guy on tinder at the beginning of the year. He's 38, and lives 220km away from me. We dated for the first three months of the year, until he confided in me that the age difference makes him uncomfortable and the distance was an issue to him, and told me he wanted to remain friends. After i distanced myself i thought i was well enough about the situation to conduct a friendship. We planned a camping trip for a week, just him and I. When the trip was over and i was home i sent him a text pretty much confessing i still had romantic feelings for him. He suggested it would be best for both of us if we ""didn't talk for the time being"" because its ""unfair to both of us.""

It's barely been a week and all i want to do is speak with him, but i cant because i don't want to further destroy what we have left of a relationship. I feel genuinely hurt, and its been taking a toll on my health. I haven't been able to stomach a meal in the last week, and have been living off of pretty much solely water.

On top of that my car decided it wanted to die (some engine failure my mechanic says isnt worth trying to fix). This has me stressed out because i need a car to be able to make it to work, and ive already missed 4 days of work following my week off when i went camping. So my job is at jeopardy.

I stupidly made an appointment to have a dealership pick me up tomorrow and discuss options, knowing well that i only have 700$ to my name, and im too anxious to call and cancel. plus, even if i did have money for payments and insurance, once come September i wont be able to make payments because i decided i need to go back to school.

Which brings up my next issue. I'm unsure if i want to go to school for what i signed up for (Heavy duty Equipment.) I already did my schooling for the first portion of a plumbing certificate, and found out quickly it wasn't for me, and backed out of the field, and i really don't want to take a student loan out and have it happen again. It's hard because i dont know what i want to do, or really what im good at that interests me (i know.. another 21 year old that doesnt know what to do with himself.)

So i'm laying in bed, pit in my stomach. Can't drink, smoking weed hasn't helped, hell i even went and talked to a therapist this morning, and im only feeling like things are getting worse.

So here i am asking for help, or maybe just somebody to help me see something from a different perspective. Sorry if any parts of this was confusing, im more than happy to explain the things i mentioned in more detail, but that the jist of it.

Thanks in Advance.",06Jul2019,0
154,"In my life, I've always got attached to people and things. Maybe it's because I'm lonely or I'm anxiously attached, but when it comes to getting attached to something, it's hard for me to let go. I'm struggling to accept that it's either dead, broken or simply gone. Why? 

My gf broke up with me and I'm having a hard time to cope with this reality, knowing she'll slowly fade away from my life and I can't do anything about it. How do I accept this reality? 

Sure, people say ""sometimes relationships don't work and you have to accept that"", others say ""people change, their feelings change and you can't change how they feel."" I know that, I've heard it all. To ""you dodge a bullet"", to ""she was a jerk!"", to ""one door closes, another opens!"" 

But, the fact that I'm losing someone who was so precious and that has been with me for 8 years, it burns. I just want to accept that this is over, that she doesn't love me anymore and that she prefers to live the rest of her life without me. 

How do I accept everything and just come into terms with my own emotions?",06Jul2019,1

I am at a loss, I don‚Äôt know what else to do. My son for the last 3 nights has left his room while I‚Äôm at work on 3rd shift and has gotten into things that he shouldn‚Äôt, some of them are also dangerous, but we‚Äôve done everything we should do to keep our kids safe. I don‚Äôt know what else to do. My oldest son is 4 years old, we believe he may have some sort of learning disability, though he hasn‚Äôt been examined yet, we can kinda just tell and have been noticing for awhile. So we put baby locks on the inside of his door and on the doors of every other door in the house, we have chemicals locked up and knives and things put away but that doesn‚Äôt stop him. For the last 3 nights he has broken off the baby locks to every door at night and opened up every child proof cabinet, he is like a magician, I don‚Äôt know how he is doing it but he does. It terrifies me, I don‚Äôt know what else to do that I can keep my babies safe while I‚Äôm away at work (their father is home with them at night) but my oldest son is so quiet when he does it you never know he has done it until morning. Well this morning was the last straw, he broke out of his bedroom and dumped his younger brothers formula all over his room, dumped an entire bottle of Ajax on his carpet on top of the formula, pulled up a chair to the kitchen counter, climbed on the kitchen counter, opened up the cabinet above the counter and took out 2 knives and the pair of kitchen scissors and proceeded to stab all his stuffed animals several times. I‚Äôm worried that he will hurt himself, or his 1 year old brother that he likes to ‚Äúvisit with‚Äù in the night when he gets out. I‚Äôve done everything I‚Äôm supposed to do, I‚Äôve locked up everything, but he still gets it. 
We have scheduled an appointment for him to be evaluated and appreciate all the concerns. We have child proof locks on everything, he just knows how to get them off. (Also my kids father does the best he can and I don‚Äôt appreciate the attacks on him, this has been happening for a couple days, he couldn‚Äôt possibly go days without sleeping like some of you suggest.

I‚Äôve only had one real relationship of which I was sexually harassed and physically abused, I ended that relationship a year and a half ago. I have a very difficult trust relationship with females, and it‚Äôs extremely difficult for me to develop a interest in someone. 

As I said, I‚Äôm developing an interest in someone at work, this is extremely weird for me as I‚Äôve never had a crush in a year and a half and I absolutely suck at talking to people outside of my friend group (I mean it takes me months to actually talk to a new coworker). I have this yearning to talk to this person and try to get to know everything about them but I just can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs like I run into a cloud of smoke that blocks all neural pathways in my brain and chokes me, and to be honest I adore that feeling as I haven‚Äôt had it in years. 

However, a good friend of mine who also works at my work is (I think) developing feelings for me. She is noticeably getting *touchy-er* and is trying to hang out with me as much as possible. I have no sexual interest in this person and they should know this. The dilemma arises when she is constantly *bugging* me at work in front of my crush, so, I do not want my crush to assume that there is something between us but I literally have the hardest time talking to my crush.

That conversation taught me that when I‚Äôm ready for a relationship, I will find the person. So, for the better part of 2019 I have been working on bettering myself, my health (mental and physical), my academics, and my career.

Im not the most intelligent person in the world and i really do not think people in more labour jobs are of less intelligence than people in office jobs, but with my grades at school i was always pushed into the ‚Äú white collar‚Äù route of life, believing this was an easy way to earn a huge income. But in reality with so many people going to uni and everything, doesn‚Äôt this mean that the supply for labour jobs has gone down meaning the potential profit could be enormous in the next 10-20 years?

I don‚Äôt know why this feels like such a risk for me, surely if i just spent a year trying it i could get back into finance at the age of 22?

Thanks in advance for any comments.",06Jul2019,1
178,"I do this thing where I have a good relationship with people for awhile and then drop off the face of the earth with no warning and never talk to them again. Eventually they give up trying to contact me. It's at that point, that through absolutely no fault of their own, they're officially no longer my friend. I'm pretty sure I've made a fair number of people feel some pretty bad feelings in this way.

I'm absolutely neurotic about avoiding people I'm doing this to. If I have any obligations that require me to go anywhere near them, I'll skip out on those obligations entirely. Every time I think about the people I do this to, I'm overwhelmed with guilt, and instead of motivating me to get back in touch, that guilt just makes me want to stay away longer.

It's actually gotten to the point now, that instead of only avoiding people I'm ghosting, I just avoid everyone. Most days I don't even step out the door.

I need other people more than ever right now. My mom's been dead for a year and a half, my binge eating's gotten worse, and my depression's reached the point where I feel completely suffocated by the inertia of my own psychological state. Basically, I'm not living, just existing.

Yet, for as badly as I need support, that's exactly how much I fear it as well. I won't let myself reach out because I don't feel safe with anyone. That's the core of the issue. I feel so unsafe with everyone else, in fact, that I can't even allow myself to mentally grasp the concept of how unsafe I feel, and constantly come up with every rationalization I can to convince myself that feeling is anything but fear. For instance, earlier in this same post, I just erroneously referred to it as ""guilt."" As another example, I also do this thing where I project the fear onto its object and convince myself I can't be around people because *I* might hurt *them*.

I try to turn to artificial resources for ""advice"" as a cheap substitute for tangible human connection. Just like I'm doing now. Of course, no matter how hard I try to take the advice to heart, it never helps, because support, not advice, is what I need at this point. Yet I seek advice because I'll do anything to excuse myself from seeking support.

Everything I've seen and heard tells me all of my problems could be getting better if I would just reach out to people I care about and people who care about me. Yet I so fear every single one of them that I won't even give them the time of day. When I try to think about contacting them, I feel an overwhelmingly oppressive psychological force against the prospect. This stubbornness against contacting them is so overwhelming that it feels entirely out of my hands and out of my control, hence why I depersonalize it and refer to it as an ""oppressive force,"" rather than, say, take ownership of it and simply describe it as my own will.

It feels like a fight or flight instinct. It feels like there is some primal part of me that ""believes"" -- if you can even dignify it with the level of higher cognition implied by the word ""believe"" -- that if I interact with people, even with nice and reasonable people whom I like / love, then they will literally hunt me down and murder me with their bare hands. I don't really believe that, but the impression I have of that kind is *like* a belief. Like the lower-brain-functioning analog of a belief, I guess; I don't know if there's a word for that sort of thing.

I could put up with living like this if nothing were on the line, but if things continue this way, I probably won't even go back to school when it starts again in the fall, and that just won't do, because I have to graduate and get a job and a house. Except I'll never get a job anyway, because I have no connections, because I refuse to sustain any.

How can I stop doing this and seek help? I'm already in therapy, but it isn't working too well because I'm very guarded even around my therapist and can't seem to bring myself to be less so.",06Jul2019,3
180,"Hello everyone I am afraid this may be a case of nice guy but honestly I just need someone else to look at this issue that I have. So I have had a crush on this girl for over 2 years. I found out she has a boyfriend and at that point I had to choose if I should still keep talking to her of just walk away. I decided that I should still keep in touch and just try to move on with my life. As the months passes we grew closer and we hanged out several days a week. Eventually I just could not keep my feelings shut any longer and I decided to tell her. She was surprised but she still wanted to be my friend we were already close at this point and we basically knew each other on a deep level. I decided to go along with this but eventually I asked her if she had feelings for me. She told me that she kinda does but that it didn't matter since she had a boyfriend which she has been with for three years. I told her that I was willing to be friends with her even if we couldn't be together. Anyways I decided that I should join the military and I was in the process of trying to decide if I should still keep my old friends (aka her) I felt that because I still had feelings for her even though she was with someone else was not good for me mentally and I had to move on. At this point she was going to go on vacation with her boyfriend and I was going to tell her after she came back. Anyways the day before she left I decided to spend time with her and say my goodbye. She ended up telling me that she just broke up with him and that she wasn't going on vacation. At this point I felt that this was my chance to be with her and during the next few weeks I told her I wanted to be with her. She told me that because she just got out of a relationship she didn't wanted to just start another one. I told her I was willing to wait for as long as she needed. She told me that it could be years from now and I said as long as you love me back I will wait. At this point she told me she did had feelings for me but she didn't really wanted to say that she loved me back. A few weeks later we actually ended up kissing and we actually dated for a whole week and then she told me that we should just be friends and that it was a mistake. At this point I felt devastated, she told me she still wanted my friendship so I decided to stay. I thought to myself that perhaps she was rushing into a relationship and she just wanted time to think. So of course I stayed loyal to her. The next couple of weeks she drew kind of distant and at one point I discovered that she was talking to someone else. I didn't really knew how to act and at that point I thought that maybe she just needed space, talk with other people and eventually she would be ready to be on a relationship with me. She never told me this by the way I found out about this and talked to be about it. Anyways a couple of weeks later I found out she was dating this whole other guy and didn't wanted to tell me. Of course I got mad and I just walked away that day. Now at this point her life was not so great and I deeply care about her so I wanted to help her. I tried to tell her to join the military or go back to college I supported any decision she made as long as she was committed to it. I called her the next day and asked her if she wanted to talk to a military recruiter. She said yeah but I had to pick her up from her bf's house. I this point I was questioning my life and what if this was all worth it. I decided to do it since I wanted her to be committed. Afterwards she wanted to talk and I basically told her I didn't wanted to be friends anymore. Our talk was interrupted by a conflict with her dad. So I decided to drop it and make sure she was okay. For the next few days I just dropped the conversation and made sure she was okay. But now that I am about to leave to Bootcamp (in 2 days) I am questioning if I should still keep this friendship and if should just give up about being in a romantic relationship with her. I am not saint I am a clingy, bad temper, asshole. But she has stuck with me for so long as well. She still wants my friendship because she tells me I am a good friend. She wants to write me letters while I am away but I feel this pain that I have on my heart will only hurt more as I keep in touch with her. What should I do? Should I drop her or continue the friendship? Thank you if you made it this far. The perspective of a lady is preferred and I would like to know if I sound like a nice guy. I probably amüôÉ.",06Jul2019,1

Background of the story
___________________________________________________
I have a best bud who shares the same ex with me. We were dating in different period. I dated her in 2014 and broke up in the same year. A year after I broke up with her, we were come into terms and forgive each other. *After that, I and my ex became  bestie.*

In 2016, I and my ex met a man who became her boyfriend and my best bud. They were dating for two years then they broke up. Their broke up was horrible to the point my ex doxxed my best bud's new crush.

__________________________________________________
This is where the story began
__________________________________________________


My best bud were so angry that he collected proofs of her doxxing and going to report it to the local police. He cancelled it in the last second though. (Me being on my best bud's side automatically makes my connection with my ex cut off again) Nothing really happens after this point until last June. 

Last June, I finally managed to make all three of us forgive each other. We got over of how we hated each other, the bad talks and the doxxing. I thought everything was over and everyone moved on... or so it seems.

My ex still a bit salty about her breakup with my best bud shown me their pasca-breakup chat. I, who happens to have some screenshot in my phone as well (The one from investigation of her doxxing), also shown the ones I have in my phone to her. (I pretended I don't know how I get those in the first place)

Turns out that the one I have in my phone wasn't their chats, but her chat with her new boyfriend in their brink of breakups. Confronted by her of how I get those pics, I was forced to to spill the truth to her. Due to *me not wanting to sell out my best bud, I had to make an excuse*. However, at the same time, my current girlfriend was suddenly depressed and *I have to console her and making an excuse for my best bud at the same time.* 

I ended up with: *""I save pics of my 'closest friends' and deleting it later when it doesn't seem too important""* which basically means I stalk everyone. I know it's very stupid. However, my priority back then was my girlfriend.

Unfortunately my ex believed my words. She creeped out of me for borderline stalking everyone. Now she cut connections with me again and I feel broken as I have to lose one of my closest friend that I worked so hard to reconnect our friendship.

**I wanna apologize to her but I don't know how. I'm afraid that she won't believe me anymore. How should I deal with this? How do I apologize to her?** I get the permission from my best bud to tell her that back then we were collecting evidences of she trying to doxx his new crush.

However, my best bud who found out she tried to make me sell out him to her gets furious again and blocked her again. So I can't count on him to send my apology to her.

Thanks for reading and advice.

187,"I'm a student home for the summer and I've noticed that my mom is really anxious. She's always been a Type A personality, always goal-oriented and work-focused. She's been working more recently and gets little to no exercise every day. She doesn't ever go outside. This paired with the anxiety has made her dissatisfied with her weight, and although it doesn't seem like she has disordered eating, I can tell she has anxiety around that, just because I've experienced it before.

The issue is, she's VERY stubborn. She will not do anything that people suggest to her; she needs to come up with ideas herself. My father's been really supportive and has tried to get her outside in different ways. He's offered to take walks with her in the morning and do fun outdoor activities with her. He's suggested doing work and walking on a treadmill. He's had some great suggestions, but because the ideas are coming from HIM, she doesn't want to do them. It's a pride thing, I think. 

I know she's always wanted a dog, which could help, but she's working all the time and my dad would ultimately be the one caring for it, which he doesn't want. 

She's super engaging when it comes to my schooling and she loves science. I'm a psychology major and was thinking of designing a study where I'd have participants exercise in some way for a period of time. I know she would agree to help me in the study because it would be a way for her to pursue her own goals (weight loss) under the guise of helping me with my studies. The issue with this is that a true research project is a HUGE undertaking and I'm not entirely prepared to do that. 

I've also shown her really cool studies about exercise and brain health, because I know she cares about her brain more than her body. 

I know I can't MAKE someone care about their health- but I know she does, and she's smart. But I'm worried for her, because I can tell how bad it is. I also understand where she's coming from; if someone *tells* me to do something, the LAST thing I want to do is do it. There's got to be a way to plant the seed in her mind so she comes up with the idea herself. Can anyone suggest ways that I can help my mom be healthy without telling her to be healthy?",06Jul2019,1

I don't think I'll be able to handle the stress of the college I will be attending in the fall

&amp;#x200B;

I will be attending my first year of college this Fall. While I can't wait to get out of my small town, I feel like I am going to completely fail my first year. My grades in high school were really good (above a 4.0), but, in an advanced class called Lights, I had to complete a capstone project for my senior year. In this class we got to pick what we wanted to do projects on based on our passions and interests.  I wanted to do my capstone on different theories of creation in different religions and different scientific theories. (I am planning on majoring in geology so I wanted to figure out what I believed about how the Earth was created before I studied it). The thing is, I was so completely stressed out during the entire project that it stopped being fun. The whole point of the project was to research something I actually wanted to learn. I remember my classmates being stressed but still loving their projects. My teacher, who I was close to, would check in on our progress every couple of weeks and I started to fall behind on deadlines. At one point I was so behind and stressed out that I completely broke down during a checkin. While my classmates were working on their projects, I was sobbing at my teachers desk. If I couldn't handle the stress of this project how could I handle the next four years of college? The college I will be attending is known for being extremely difficult, but it has the best program for my major. I'm so scared I will completely stress myself out and shut down. Academics are the only thing that I'm good at and my parents expect me to do not only well, but to make an excellent grades.

216,"I met these two guys online while playing games a few months back and we've been hanging out ever since. However, recently I've noticed that one of the guys is an asshole, like, whatever I say gets mocked or made fun of type of asshole. You can tell he's an asshole because it's not sometimes, it's EVERY SENTENCE. 99% of what this guy says just comes off like he's a pessimistic asshole. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, today I found out that the other friend had a power surge and it blew out his LAN port so he needs a new motherboard for internet, and he wanted to get upgrades for his PC anyway. Me and the mean friend both know a lot about computers, but when I suggested that I also help and provide my insight, he was super defensive, like it was his job and his job alone to help the other guy out. I tried saying stuff but he'd just tell me to shut up. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other guy is kinda in between; Can be nice, can be not nice, but that really doesn't matter, I like him as a friend. I would personally like to ditch the asshole and just have the one guy but they've been friends for really long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the asshole has been going through relationship issues, so I don't know if that's why he's been mean, or if I should assume that he's having relationship issues because he's mean. The worst part that definitely isn't the worst part is that his favorite game is Destiny 2. Like who the fuck plays Destiny 2? I'm sorry if you like Destiny 2, but your opinion is just wrong; It's a shit game, but he plays it 24/7 now because he has to ""prepare"" for this thing in September that's coming out, so he won't even play another game with us 90% of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

We noticed some guys from the next year level laughing at what was on their phones and Ryan got an Airdrop notification on his phone. 

Turns out they were Airdroping memes to each other. They were harmless at first, but the memes escalated to the point where one guy Airdroped a picture of a topless girl. At that point Ryan and I had seen enough. Keep in mind these guys are 14. We both agreed to talk to a teacher about the situation. 

A few days after we did, he confronted them. The problem was, he told them who reported them. Us. My older brother and many other people told me that you shouldn‚Äôt tell on people in high school otherwise they come after you, and I feel like I‚Äôve made a big mistake.

Last night was the 4th of july, so me and my really good buddy took some acid to watch the fireworks as stupid young adults do.  i took it at 6 and expected to be done tripping and get at least a few hours of sleep before i had to work, well i got 1 hour of sleep. Yeah, pretty fucking stupid so far huh? Anyway, i pushed through work and went home ready for bed. I got some bad news when i arrived home and started to cry, the girl (room mates gf) poked her head in my room and gave me a hug and asked if she could keep me company, i was more than happy to have a friend around so i was okay with it, i drifted asleep and she just laid next to me, over the course of the next few hours, i was being woke up for split second at a tame as she moved closer, i was half asleep and it was nice to cuddle someone, i woke up half asleep with a rock hard boner and her rubbing it over my sweats, i was delirious and it felt good so i didnt do nothing about it. She kept going and going more and more all really fast too, and then she was ontop of me and, well yeah.

I feel like fucking shit because i feel like i cheated on my girlfriend. I love her to fucking bits and i wouldnt ever cheat on her, or i didnt think i would, im just really fucking confused rn and dont know what to think. Help.",06Jul2019,1
224,"&amp;#x200B;

So for some background, I have two friends - let's call them ""Z"" and ""N"".

""N"" and I have been friends for approximately 2 years (7 months as well now to be exact). Our ""friend-group"" last year consisted of ""N"", Myself, and two other guys in my form (I'm a student). ""N"" and I were very close - we did everything together (Pierced our ears, Had long conversations online into the night, typical ""teen stuff"").

I became friends with"" Z"" in June/July of last year. ""Z"" also has a stutter to which makes it hard to express herself articulately (This will come in later). I first interacted with ""Z"" for a project, she was calm and chilled out, she seemed to be reasonable. We hit it off, I introduced ""Z"" and ""N"" to each-other, and they seemed to be getting along fine, but I noticed some off-things about her. 

 She always interrupted people whilst they were talking,  Always says ""I know"" when you tell her something, and reverted problems and things to herself (For example, if I took out my input on a conversation with her, it'd sound like she was having a conversation with herself). She later claimed that this was because of her stutter, which was fair-enough. She also has problems with her body and her intelligence, usually talking down to herself in conversations, and get's annoyed when she doesn't get something right/say's something ""stupid"" (Which might be why she say's ""I know"" on any input provided that 

She was into ""Stan culture"" memes/humor, but she used this as a mask when she was actually annoyed about something (in general conversation she tended to be a bit judgmental). 

This was also shown through an incident of when our meeting times for our plans were muddled up (It was understandable she was mad, but she was painting herself as the victim and was **very** passive aggressive.) For further context on ""Z"": During the time of the incident, Her brother passed away in a car crash, and I tried my very best to be supportive and sensitive to her needs (Yet she did act this way before, I understand it could escalate her defensiveness because of said event). 

&amp;#x200B;

Then we had what I call the ""Instagram phase"". This was during holiday break, and ""N"" and I have started to decline messaging each-other, and ""Z"" and I started talking via discord and online messaging through Instagram. This was when she continued to be quite defensive, on any, if all disagreements of her opinions. We used to have heated arguments of me ""hurting her feelings"" when I was trying to clarify what she said and what I said. I empathized, tried to stop, and it still came to no prevail. I understood her situation of her brother, and I tried expressing myself as objectively as I could, but I will admit I was a bit too blunt from experience with the two guy friends mentioned (I had a crush on one of them which was toxic which I have cut out of my life, and the other r/niceguy\-d me, but we're fine now). I understand that this doesn't excuse my behavior, and I was dealing with a person who lost someone very close and important in their lives, but I feel as if this was a problem before the death occurred (as I was friends briefly before, I saw some signs).  

We worked to improve together. But because of all that energy I have put into her, my other friend and I have lessened our strong bond we had before, and I was influenced by this friend so much, that my own coping mechanisms and ways of doing things was lessened by this friend.

&amp;#x200B;

It's was a new school year, and ""Z"" and I have classes together a lot as her mum insisted to the school (she also changed her form to ours to be with us). ""Z"" and ""N"" had classes before, but were changed and don't anymore - yet they still go on the bus and have to text each-other (because ""N"" sometimes gets car rides, and ""Z"" sometimes gets rides from her). Otherwise both ""Z"" and ""N"" go on the bus to get to school. Now this is where the wall is set-up: 

""Z"" and ""N"" go on the bus, talk on messaging apps. ""Z"" and I have classes together, talk on messaging apps. 

""N"" and I do not have any contact otherwise, except for group chats and in-between lunch/food breaks. 

I've tried to message ""N"" privately, but it doesn't really kick off and she ends up talking on the group chat. 

I realize this isn't the fault of ""Z"", but I still feel sad that our bond is diminishing.

I was a bit hesitant to talk about my problems (as she reacted badly to them), so for this whole experience, I didn't really talk about my problems I had with the group. This resulted in me being critical over what my friends did that I suited as ""bad"" which affected my well-being (I know I shouldn't rely on others, but it was what they were doing to me directly), and ""Z"" and ""N"" backed eachother a lot.

I realize that their is never only ""one bad guy"" etc, and I admit that I probably am just as bad as my friend ""Z"". 

We are alright now, it's just during the time I was re-evaluating heavily on my friendships, and I wanted new friends. 

Now I'm not so sure, I know having new friends won't take away any of my problems, but perhaps it could elevate some bad residual feelings of uncertainty. But I'm content. It's just those slithers of the question in the back of my mind. 

Am I in the wrong? Am I too insensitive? Am I too sentimental/possessive?

They definitely do mess you up a lot though. Anyways we did them probably 3 nights in a row, I was on the ‚Äùcome down‚Äù and decided I wanted to go to sleep. I remember my friend laughing as I was falling  asleep, I sat up to tell her to be quite because the high hit her wayyyyyy after it hit us. As I sat up I remembered feeling like I was so far away. A rush of panic washed over me and I stood up really fast freaked out. This will probably sound so stupid but idk how else to describe it: It was pretty dark in my room other than the light coming in from my window, I saw swirling and blue and everything sounded so weird, idk if I was tripping out or just freaking out. idk what you would call it. I honestly think me doing triple c‚Äôs is what started my anxiety. 

Anyways, The reason I am writing this post is ever since that night I still see shit like that, if I get up in the middle of the night and my room is mostly dark my eyes trip tf out.

239,"Just to get it out of the way, literally up until a week ago I've considered myself as an extremely happy person (despite people telling me that I always look sad). I was extremely passionate and had fun everyday just doing my hobbies (video games, movies etc) but for no apparent reason a week ago I've started feeling depressed and anxious.

A few days ago I've started getting a lot of anxiety out of nowhere because of a fear of a sudden random death of me or my loved ones. I was able to come to terms with that anxiety by accepting that death is something that will happen to everyone and I should just try to enjoy life while I'm alive. Now right after I've come to that resolution another problem started, I've started enjoying my usual activities and hobbies a lot less. After making a few changes in my life like going out with friends more I felt my joy starting to come back and that was somewhat resolved (although I still feel lots of anxiety when I'm not with friends and can barely enjoy my old hobbies).

Now I kinda wanted to get this out of the way because I just woke up about 2 hours ago and another problem started, I dreamt that my brother (who I haven't been that close to in years but used to be really close to when I was younger) has died and I felt almost nothing. And since I woke up from that dream I'm scared that I wouldn't feel deep sadness if someone in my family passed and it truly terrifies me.

I don't know what's happening to me, and why there is a chain of anxiety that just keeps building up over the past week. Every time I get over one thing something else comes up and I feel like I'm slowly losing my emotions with everyday and I really need some advice before it might be too late.

246,"I'm doing a summer internship at a startup and find it hard to talk/connect with the other employees in the workplace. 

I'm definitely not a chatty person and most of the people talk about cars, their mods, and other technical stuff I don't follow at all. It gets to the point where 3 other people are having a conversation and I basically don't say anything because I would literally have to ask what every 3 words they are saying means. They're really into the topic and it doesn't seem to be douchy or showing off their knowledge. I just don't have a background or interest in those things and feel awkward being in the circle and not saying or understanding anything they're saying.

&amp;#x200B;

If they're not talking about cars or other technical things, people usually play or watch some kind of sport. I'm not into sports either so I just do really badly when I join games or stand around silently as they talk about the newest drafts, game, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

When it's just me and another person, we talk about things but it's mostly small talk. They don't seem as excited as they would be talking about cars, some technical thing, or sports, and I don't know what to do. Most of my chats with people end in awkward silence (since there's nothing to talk about) and I think I am annoying the one employee who hangs out with me because we don't talk much but end up doing things together for most of the day since I started.

During the whole apartment tour and leasing process, I was never notified by the absolutely terrible noise isolation from the outside.  It is a studio apartment with an entire wall covered by two large windows.  I've come to find out that the windows are not very well insulated, and almost couple times every hour from early morning to night, I can hear each passing train blaring its horns as they pass by the local station.  This isn't a distant blaring horn sound, its an almost in-your face blaring sound that no white noise machine can cure and will absolutely interrupt any activity such as watching TV.

Additionally, I've already had several nights where the distant talking/yelling from what I am guessing are local bargoers have woken me up.  Its not like the bar is next door or in plain sight from my windows, but due to how terribly the windows isolate noise, I can pretty much hear their loud conversation, enough to wake me up in the middle of the night around 2AM.

I've spoken to the landlord about the train noise, and all they say is that tenants usually get used to it, so give it a couple nights first, then we can talk again.  Its been almost a week, I definitely am not getting used to it because of how loud it is and being a light sleeper.  They also recommended installing additional heavy curtains (at my own cost) to try and dampen the noise.  I don't really see how an additional layer of heavy curtains will help here given how loud it gets.

Does anyone know what I could do here?  During the leasing process, I mentioned I wanted to make sure that I get a quiet apartment with good noise isolation, but they did not even mention a bit about the terrible noise leak from outside, and how horrible the train noise can be for light sleepers.  I feel like they intentionally did not disclose this information to me.  I really should have visited the apartment while a train was passing by to gauge the noise level.  I am paying quite a premium to live in this apartment, and while the other aspects of this apartment are fine, I really don't feel good about paying the premium only to be constantly waken up.

FYI, the lease is for 9 months and I am only a couple weeks in.",06Jul2019,1
249,"Okay so I[f18] have like maybe 2 friends, one of them is a guy and he[m18] is such a great friend although we haven‚Äôt been friends for the longest. I trust him the most and he‚Äôs just a good person to be around. Around the beginning of our friendship he confessed his feelings for me, I told him I didn‚Äôt feel the same way and only saw him as a friend. He seemed a bit upset about it for a while but that quickly went away, or so I thought. 

Recently he got a girlfriend which he feels is serious. Im extremely happy he‚Äôs found someone. Now, we‚Äôre not the type of friends to talk every single day or even hang out all the time but we both know we‚Äôre still really close friends at the end of the day. Today we video chatted for the first time in a long time just to catch up. After catching up a bit he asked ‚ÄúHow much do I mean to you as a friend‚Äù which worried me because I felt like he was breaking off our friendship I don‚Äôt know, I can‚Äôt really explain why I felt that, but I did. 

Finally he tell me that he still has feelings for me. He says that he feels guilty talking to me because he wants to get serious with his girlfriend. He really wants to remain friends with me but he‚Äôs not sure how he can do that without feeling guilty. He said he wishes it were different because he really appreciates how good of a relationship we have and he doesn‚Äôt wanna hurt me by breaking off our friendship. 

Breaking it off with him would truly hurt me but I feel like if Im not fitting into his life then maybe it be best to call it quits and not talk anymore. I don‚Äôt see any other solution. What should I do? How can we make our friendship work?",06Jul2019,1

Two of them are newer, but good friends. One of them is a friend I met three years ago, and one of them is a childhood friend. 

One of the newer friends was a horrible friend to us, so it wasn‚Äôt super hard to cut her off. However, recently, my childhood friend got into an argument with the other two, and they don‚Äôt speak at the moment. 

When discussing possible solutions to the issue, I told my childhood friend that I planned to still talk to the other two, slightly less, but I still would. I also told him that I wasn‚Äôt dismissing their actions towards him, but they still meant something to me so I‚Äôd like to keep them around. 

In return, he told me it was fake of me, and that I should cut them off because he would‚Äôve cut them off. The thing is, I would never ask him to cut off anyone for me because it‚Äôs not ‚Äúfake‚Äù in my opinion.

255,"Hey there, I'm a 21F who only falls for guys who are emotionally/physically unavailable. The second someone wants to commit or expresses interest in me as more than a hookup, I lose all feelings for them and end things. It's not a conscious choice of ""oh, I don't want to commit"", it just happens even though I would love a long term partner. The only exception to this pattern are two guys who were both emotionally and physically unavailable. One was my freshman year of college, the other one, this past year (my junior year). One was moving at the end of the year and the other said he wasn't in a good place emotionally to commit, and for some reason, these are the guys who I continued to see, hoping I could get them to see me as someone worth more than just a hookup. Of course, I failed both times, wasting over a year on one and about 6 months (and counting) on the other. Fun! I don't want to be like this, but it's hard to control your feelings for people. I think this may have something to do with the fact that I've only ever been in one serious relationship when I was in high school, and that person was emotionally abusive and cheated on me multiple times. My question is, does anyone else notice this as a prevalent pattern in their lives, and how do I get over it?

257,"What are your thoughts on this?

&amp;#x200B;

So I have come quite far in a recruitment process for a job at big company. The company is doing very well financially, and has been doing so for a long time. There is also good opportunities for growth within the company. So, the company itself is really good. Also the job position is suitable, even though an entry level job the expectation is to move to another position after a while. Also the position would provide knowledge and skills that are valuable also outside of the company, and having worked for this company probably looks good on the CV. So far so good.

&amp;#x200B;

But, the hiring manager gives some pretty bad vibes. He is very vague when answering questions about the job position, the recruitment process etc, and has at times seemed to almost take offence when asked pretty standard questions. He himself asks questions during interviews that are very personal and borderline illegal for an employer to ask during recruitment. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I have been expected to do something, deliver some information (that I might depend on other people to get) there has been a pressure to deliver NOW. When several days later checking in with the manager he has said ""oh, I didn't have time to look at that yet"". So, it wasn't all that urgent... Perhaps this is something to be expected, especially from a bigger company? Or perhaps a way to test me. But I haven't experienced something like this in a recruitment process before, and find it odd. I would say that all relationships, including employer-employee should be based on mutual respect, and this is instilling the opposite. Or am I fuzzy?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I have seen/heard the hiring manager say things in front of his employees (and me) that was putting the employee down. I have through my personal network received feedback saying that the manager is arrogant towards people. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am also quite certain that he has lied to me during an interview. From his perspective it was probably just a small white lie, but for me, if I hadn't caught it, it could have had implications also outside this recruitment process. (Sorry for being vague, don't want to go into details about it). I mean, if I would lie during the interview and they would catch it, they would see that as a huge deal. So when looking for jobs, should I not be able to expect also the employers to be truthful?

&amp;#x200B;

So, if I get a job offer, do you think I should take it and try to survive the manager before going to another position internally or externally, or should I decline?",06Jul2019,3

262,"I'm a skinny 21 year old guy (in case that's relevant) and was leaving the hotel a friend's family was staying at tonight at 11 pm when a couple asked me to jump start their car. Actually they asked my friend's dad first, but he told them he was trying to take my parking spot after I left, so they asked me as I was leaving. 

&amp;#x200B;

These people (again just in case it's relevant) were a 5'2ish Mexican man who spoke broken English -- not uncommon in my Californian town, there are a lot of native Spanish speakers who don't speak English -- and a tall overweight white woman. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't really feel worried as my friend's dad, a pretty tall imposing ex con/veteran, was right nearby. Anyway I agreed to jump their car, which I'd never done before, and popped the hood and let the guy hook up the cables, and their car didn't seem to be starting, it would make engine sounds then go dead. I didn't notice at first, but they had the hood of the trunk propped up with a wooden baseball bat. At some point I guess my friend's dad went back up to their room, but mentioned to his wife that I was jump starting someone's car, and she came down and kind of intervened, basically telling me to go home and telling the two other individuals that the hotel could send a car down to jump them, and these people kept declining that offer. I drove off, and apparently they did too shortly after, so unless my jump somehow ended up taking effect, their car had been in a functional state. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel very na√Øve to have been taken in by this scheme, assuming they were actually trying to do something. They acted polite and not aggressive or pushy, and my friend's mom is a little bit crazy, so I was initially a bit skeptical when she texted me saying she thought they would have robbed me, but the fact that they left right after I did in their car with a supposed dead battery (again unless the jump start worked and was real in the first place) and that they declined assistance from the hotel staff does cast the situation in a bit of a dodgy light. I guess I want to trust people, as I've been in that situation before and had strangers help me, and I've helped others before and it's always been genuine.

276,"So I liked this girl. Or love. I honestly cannot tell. We got close when we were playing in the same band. Me being the ""nervous around girls"" type of guy, this is something really special. She's always so cheery and somewhat hyper. Seeing her always made me happy and made me feel all warm inside. At first I didn't think too much of it. Until she appeared in my dreams for a couple of nights. And each time I dreamt of her, it gives me the same warm and happy feeling of seeing her. Then I started thinking, could this be love? I don't know...

After having that thought, each time I see her, the feelings got much more intense and makes me want to just be by her side at all times. I texted her. Replied to her insta stories. We were laughing at rach others jokes. I decided to confess to her. Told her that she's been on my mind and how she made me feel. Then she replied. She apologised, saying she don't feel the same way. I honestly thought I wouldn't care being rejected at all. I wouldn't date me even. Low self-esteem I guess. But it hurt. My world just grew darker by the minute. Then she uploaded an insta story. A photo of her with her new boyfriend. I tried to be happy for her. But is till hurts. Tried to ignore it. Still hurts. So I slowly pull myself away. Stopped texting her. Stopped replying to her stories. Unfollowed her on instagram. Delete any photos or videos I have with her in it. And a couple of months passed. Still think about her sometimes but it started to hurt less.

But then one day when I was on my home from work, I saw her. I took half day off from work. So I was out around lunch time. I saw her with her boyfriend holding hands, walking in front of me. My heart just started to beat fast and hard. Like 9000bpm or something. Hard to breathe. Perspiring like mad. I didn't understand this feeling at all. It's all new to me. So I just tried to control myself and just walk pass them and get on my bus. I had a major change of image from a super long hair to my bow super short hair. So I got lucky that they don't recognise me. But it hurts. It really did. I was still catching my breathe in the bus. Trying to gain control of myself.

277,"I feel really lonely and hormonal and all that stuff right now. I‚Äôm facing a decision, and I‚Äôve already made up my mind. I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the wrong decision.

I have great grades. I am confident that whatever career path I choose I will do well in. I‚Äôm about to be a senior. However...

I‚Äôm being pressured by my family to go to college, because nobody in my family has before me and they are proud of my achievements in school. I can‚Äôt blame them for that.

But the career that I‚Äôm interested in doesn‚Äôt require me to go to college. I want to be an actor. Also, do stand-up on the side. 

So I asked myself the hard-hitting question everybody has at one point or another: do I follow my dreams?

Like I said earlier, I am confident I will do well in whatever I choose to do. And I choose to be an actor. (and do stand-up as a side gig but that‚Äôs not as important right now.) 

My plan is to move to LA around this time next year, alone, living in a van. 

I know any other thing I try to do will not satisfy me. I know I will be depressed if I, in 10 years, am still not trying to make my dream a reality.
I know it‚Äôs tough, and super competitive. But I‚Äôve never been more sure of anything. I doubt myself constantly. But not on this. I‚Äôve had this dream ever since I was able to create my own independent thoughts.

Maybe I‚Äôm not asking if I should do it or not. That‚Äôs kind of set in stone.
Maybe I just need clarification. Or moral support. Nobody I‚Äôve talked to has been on my side. Everyone is doubtful. But that gives me hope. That tells me that maybe I am making the right decision. Because everybody I‚Äôve talked to has not been as successful as they‚Äôd planned on being. Why should I listen to their advice?

You become your environment. If I‚Äôm surrounded by those who‚Äôve still yet to find success, I should get out of there, and create my own.

280,"So basically My best friend for 5 years whom I haven't seen over a year texted me she wanted to visit me but we live quite a distance from one another. And She mentioned picking me up from my home to hers so we could hang out for a week. However, I don't really wanna hang out with her since last time I did I got really homesick and cried for the whole day since I was missing out on my older sister's birthday.

I then started coming up with excuses such as summer school which is relatively true. She was bummed out and told me oh that's a shame when out the blue the next day she texted me she's on her way to the state where I live. I groaned since whenever my friends from school want to hang out with me they come alone and I'm an introverted person so I am able to hang out with one person alright. 

However my bff brings her WHOLE family wherever she goes they always follow her and I'm just sick and tired of it. She's 16  for christ sake! She can take care of herself but her parents are heavily Christian. It always wears me out when every single family member talks with me. But I try my best to respond to every single person since I feel awful not responding. 

So far I had real excuses this week of why we couldn't hang out but I felt disgusting for avoiding her whenever she tries to put effort to make plans with me. We are finally going to hang out on the last day before she leaves back to her state.

She has 5 people including herself in her family. I really want to tell her I'm tired of hanging out with her since it wears me out and I just don't feel as comfortable chatting with her since I've grown and my interests and personality had change after a year. 

But she seems so happy and excited when we finally made plans on the day she's leaving. Could someone please tell me how to gently tell her all this?

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  üëî  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‚Äòyou make me sweat, Graham‚Äô and I said ‚Äòwhat?‚Äô then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‚Äòwtf‚Äô she then dropped her arms and walked off.

286,"Hi. First off thank you for reading this post looking to help me. I am 21(M) and freaking out really. 

I have been in a relationship with a girl since last October. Me and her became really close and I believe we were in love. We both went to a junior college with plans of transferring. This is my 3rd year in an engineering program and it is finally time for me to transfer. Long story short i decided to go to UC Riverside. This girl will still be going to the junior college though. 

The whole time we‚Äôve been in this relationship I‚Äôve been under the impression that this girl had an IUD implanted in her. And I know for a fact that she did because at a certain point I felt it but this has changed. 

Before I left this girl started asking me questions about what if she were to get pregnant. I told her if she were to get pregnant I would wanna get an abortion but if that didn‚Äôt work out I would stay around and be a father to the child. She would smile and say I had nothing to worry about because she doesn‚Äôt want children right now anyway. I was leaving so we were having unprotected sex pretty often. From that day forward I continuously asked her if her IUD was still intact which she assured me it was. 

I left Cali in early June. For the past two weeks this girl has been telling me she missed her period. I continuously asked her do you still have the IUD and she assured me she did but yesterday she finally told me that she got it removed almost a month before I left. She told me theres no reason for me to be mad tho because if she were to get pregnant she would take care of it(like it‚Äôs just as easy as that). She also said it would be okay because she drank so much she threw up yesterday. But she is making no efforts to get an abortion!

I feel so betrayed and lied to. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm not ready in my life for a kid. Am I still responsible for this kid even tho I was blatantly deceived into this if she ends up keeping. Am I overreacting? Wtf do i do man?",06Jul2019,2

289,"The love of my life is having panic attacks almost every morning before work because of how nervous his job makes him. He is 21 and works as a phlebotomist in a big city hospital. He swears that it‚Äôs not hard work, just busy, and yet he dreads going in so much that he works himself into hyperventilating. I feel so helpless, like all I can do is hold him and remind him to breathe, but I don‚Äôt think it helps much. 

He leaves early at 3:00 am and drives an hour into work, and it scares me enough as it is that he‚Äôs on the highway so much (he‚Äôs a new driver) without the attacks... This morning he texted me, on his way to work, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can do this‚Äù and for a second, I thought maybe he was suicidal. I know it‚Äôs a terrible thought to have, and it only lasted a second, but he‚Äôs had severe depression before and when you‚Äôre with someone with the history, you‚Äôre always on the lookout for signs. 

He‚Äôs wanted to work in the medical field for years, and we all suggested phlebotomy as a way to get a hospital job just to see what it was like, and what field he‚Äôd like to work towards. But he‚Äôs done several phleb jobs now and none have made him very happy. At one point he thought maybe he‚Äôd like to be a lab technician, but he‚Äôll have to get a degree for that and at the moment we can‚Äôt afford it, so he‚Äôll be stuck doing phlebotomy for quite a while. I‚Äôve mentioned several times that he should find a different job in the meanwhile, because of how much he detests his current one, but he says he can‚Äôt find any phlebotomy jobs anywhere else and he refuses to get a job where he‚Äôs not using his certificate. I think he‚Äôd be much more suited to go into a veterinarian job, because he loves animals so much more than humans and he‚Äôd still be doing a medical job and ‚Äòhelping people‚Äô, as that is what he is striving for in his career. And he‚Äôs been more open to that idea, but I can‚Äôt seem to convince him to actually look into it. 

Anyway, my main goal is to see him stop suffering. I can‚Äôt watch him go into any more attacks, it breaks my heart. I try to help, and he says I do, but I can‚Äôt stop them and I can‚Äôt stop him from going to work. I want him closer to home, where he isn‚Äôt driving on dangerous roads, and I want to see him happy. Above all, I want to see him happier. Is there anything else I can try? Am I being too pushy? How can I better help with his attacks? I just don‚Äôt know what to do at this point... he‚Äôs so stubborn and I‚Äôm so scared. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",06Jul2019,3
290,"This is a bit weird, since it‚Äôs not my kid, but here‚Äôs the situation. I (35/f) live with my sister (26/f) and her son (5/m).

I already hate myself for what I allowed to happen and I can‚Äôt imagine how she feels since she was on the receiving end of my stupidity and evil act. In August I had begun to like my girlfriend( before we started to date) but my friend who I trusted (I no longer talk to him and cut him out of my life for manipulating me)  managed to manipulate me and push me away from her as told me a bunch of lies about her. This naturally pushed me away from her. Additionally he convinced, manipulated me, into asking out someone I had liked in middle school. He told me to stop talking to my current  girl friend (let‚Äôs call her abby) for reasons I forgot, but it worked. I avoided abby for months and it really hurt her. She loves me more than anything in this world is an understatement, you‚Äôll see how much she loves me at the end of this. My friend who manipulated me had something against Abby and used me to make her life hell, I at this time didn‚Äôt know I was being manipulated. I broke up with the girl my friend convinced me to go out with cause it felt fake cause I was manipulated into it. However I still hadn‚Äôt talk to abby again since then. Some important details about Abby is that she‚Äôs extremely depressed, Bipolar runs in her family, dad left when she was young, only friend told her to kill herself in middle school, she dropped out, was abused sexually and physically by ex boy friend, she was hurt badly even before I came along. I sent her a text over winter break to check up on her after she had made a scary Instagram post. She replied with I thought you hated me, and I said I didn‚Äôt and we started to talk again. Even though I still loved her I was still being manipulated by my friend and wouldn‚Äôt ask her out. I essentially led her on for the next 3 months only to reject her over and over, making her life even more of a hell. I finally had enough of my friend telling me no and this and that and asked for her forgiveness and for a ‚Äú9th chance‚Äù. She of course happily said yes, she still loved me like crazy even after that. However now we are at present time and she just told me randomly through the day she cries because she is hit with an overwhelming feeling of dread and that I don‚Äôt love her. She thinks I chose my ex over her and played with her. I was being manipulated into doing al of that but In the end I did do all of that. However she says she can‚Äôt be mad at me and blames her self, I don‚Äôt know what to do, she won‚Äôt tell her therapist and I can‚Äôt change what i did in the past and i hate myself for everything I did.

The problem is that I just recently graduated highschool, so college is on the way, and a few months ago my dad was diagnosed with cancer and has been receiving chemotherapy. My parents did try and find a therapist for me when I first started having panic attack but our insurance doesn't really cover much so we gave up the search. However, I don't think I'm improving much on my own, mentally, and think I would probably benefit from a therapist. I just don't know how much my family's insurance would cover if I were to have a therapist while my dad is still going through chemo and I don't want to make things harder for anyone in my family.

My ex would get confused and annoyed since I'd always say ""we"" when talking about me and mom, as if unsure who ""we was"" then bitched i used ""we"" every sentence and was like ""who is we!?"" My ex said I've no selfidentity and need to not be so co-dependant on my mom. My older brother says i need to stop acting like a literal child and he won't come around since the family is dysfunctional. My younger brother says I'm selfish. My therapist is really a social worker and is useless. She tells me useless excercises and routine yet it doesn't help address the underlying issues. 
I'm really afraid of conflict and i lied to sabotage my relationship with my ex and no one else is going to put up with me. I've psoriasis and literally 10 cats in the house. Me and mom feed a colony of strays where we used to live since we want to save them. Even the non-profit rescue organizations stopped helping us.
My ex said i can't save everything and we disagree and we're going to try anyway even though we can't afford it.
I'm afraid to speak up to mom, as i can't have anyone mad at me. It's bad enough my ex broke up with me.
It's hard for me to tell anyone my true feelings unless it's mom and I'm afraid of her being mad at me.
How do i learn to be assertive? Mom's boyfriend is really great, yet he calls me a nickname for a loose woman and we never say anything since I'm scared. Mom won't do anything since he's paying her bills and my dad was an abusive drunk. So there's no one to speak up for me not even me. Mom's boyfriend forces me to eat inside places and he eats super slow and my anxiety is horrible since i never eat inside places. He says it will help me and my ex said he's likely hoping people will see us and think he's a young gf. Mom won't intervene or do anything so I'm forced to do this. Yet i always jump at the chance to help mom's bf with stuff around the house or his house since we appreciate his help with bills and things.
My ex said that was weird and it's pathetic I'd want to pick up sticks in the yard or hand a wrench. And that my brother should be the one helping or my mom. Mom's bf hates my brother since he's lazy.

Tl;dr, I've a dysfunctional family and need to learn how to be assertive. I ruined by last chance at a relationship. Now we have a limited time to save the stray cats where we used to live. We've already saved 50 and people are getting annoyed we keep feeding them in our old area.

He keeps letting himself into my apartment when I'm not there, leaving things like a fruit basket or cake on my kitchen table. As I said - I don't mind, I trust him and he's just a very sweet, old person despite this boubdary pushing - only I have a very large (think 100lbs) dog living with me, who's mentally messed up (dog dementia) and hence will act aggressive at times, especially with people entering my apartment unasked. 
I take my dog with me whenever possible so he's not home alone too often, but I'll work more hours soon and he'll be at the apartment then for longer periods of time. So far, we've gotten lucky and the landlord has not yet encountered my dog when he let himself into my place. Thankfully.

My dog could easily kill him, if he saw him as an intruder, and I don't know how to get that across to my landlord. I've asked him countless times to wait till I'm home to bring stuff over, but he rarely does. I've explained to him that my dog would not like him and possibly try to harm him as he is a stranger, but he didn't believe me and told me to not have a dangerous dog in my home. I don't think he has the mental capacity anymore to truly understand this issue. He always just laughs and nods and then lets himself in again. 

I'm legally required to provide him with a spare key, so I can't just change the locks. I tried giving the neighbours a key so he'd have to ask them every time, but he grew tired of this quickly and just had a copy made again. Locking my dog in a room also won't work. It's a studio apartment and basically just one big room plus bathroom, which is so tiny that my dog won't even fit in there fully.

314,"I will try to keep this brief, and will leave out details that could identify me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Context: We have a staff of 3 people. I am the leader in charge, with two assistants. I do not operate in the typical hierarchy of ""I am the boss and you are the subordinate, so this is how it is going to be"". I treat my assistants like a team and I take their input on almost everything. If they both feel strongly against something I want to do, I do not mind going with their ideas or opinions. To add context, I  consider both of them to be close friends and I care about them deeply. 

&amp;#x200B;

Situation: I am having trouble with one of the assistants, because we want to take our business in a new direction. One of the assistants and myself are both 100% on board, with the third person strongly against it. The issue is that we are doing something that (on paper) makes a bunch of improvements, fixes a ton of the issues we are having, and will have a greater impact on our bottom line. The problem is that no one in our field has done it this way, so there is a lot of fear/hesitation on the side of our 3rd person. I also believe that as ""the boss"", I have operated in a way that was always more democratic and gave a voice to my assistants, which I believe has led this one to become entitled to having more power than they actually should have. In my effort to consider their opinion, it has come to a point where if I DON'T do whatever it is they want, now I am a dictator who does not listen. It is very frustrating.

Issues: The person that is against the new direction has no counterpoints to why we shouldn't do it. They have no ""alternative solution"" that would address any of our issues but in a way that would make them feel more comfortable. They cannot defend or argue their position. It is purely emotional because the third person is scared/uncomfortable with doing something that they have never done before. The new change does directly influence significant parts of how they would do their job. Because of that, we cannot have reasonable debates about it and reach a consensus with the team. It always turns from debate into hostile arguments, where things are said that shouldn't be. No amount of logic, reason, or evidence will bring the third person on board. The more I try to convince or reach out, the more they lash out and dig their heels in. The fights that we have had have led to us basically not talking, being resentful of each other, and me feeling like I have to reduce the responsibilities and ownership of what we are doing of the third person. It has also lead me to go forward without taking their consideration in things at all, since I feel that they cannot be reasoned with, and trying to reach out and get their take on things always escalates the problem and makes things worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Where I need advice: I am at a point to where I want to completely cut out this third person from the decision making process involved in our business. I want to, in regards to this particular person, strictly make it hierarchical, be ""the boss"" and simply tell them what to do and how to do it. I have tried to ""reach out"" and hear them out with their concerns, and it always seems to make things worse. 

  
What is the best way forward in this? What would a ""good leader"" do? Do I have to sacrifice my entire pride and ego, and apologize to make amends, even if I am not the one at fault in this? Do i cater to an employee who is being emotional, resistant, and not open to change, debate, or dialogue?

316,"This is the first time I've tried writing a poem and I was hoping for some thoughts &amp; advice. It's short and just kind of came to me, I'd like to improve it with editing or adding more:

Seven years 

Day and night you're all I see
Through thoughts and dreams it's clear to me
The one I love who stole my heart 
Left me alone in the dark

I don't know how it came to be 
Young and dumb I couldn't see 
I had it all and let it go 
The prettiest girl I call pookie 

A heart of gold and a face to match 
I pray to God I get her back 
So sweet and kind and full of love 
I pray one day we release the doves 

With skin that glows 
And a heart that grows
A soul so pure it's become so clear 
I need you now and I hope you're near",06Jul2019,1

Background info: my brother sexually abused me for a long time when we were younger, among many other abusive behaviors. When I finally told my parents and a couple other people about it, I was blamed for everything and was told I was ""keeping the family apart"" by taking ""too long"" in therapy

I moved out to start college and have been able to distance myself from my brother a little more, living in different states helps. I don't want a relationship with him (for what I thought were obvious reasons), but have had a difficult time writing him off completely because my parents (especially my mom) love it when all of us get together, as it makes them happy. Parents' anniversary is coming up, brother wants to have a family reunion type thing for them.

In school, we always hide the fact the we like each other and we end up unintentionally hurting each other but we feel obligated to do so in order to protect our relationship.

327,"So yeah, let me explain real quick. So I‚Äôm 12 and yes Ik that most people that are 10-14 think they have very mental illness in the world but at this point I honestly have no idea but let‚Äôs go to the begging, YEET. So there I was in my room and suddenly I think about the diary of a wimpy kid and then I remember that he‚Äôs a sociopath. Btw I‚Äôm really sorry for the horrible grammar, I‚Äôm AG in reading and usually don‚Äôt talk like this. Anyways out of pure curiosity I take a sociopath test not knowing what it was (it was on quizlet btw) and got my results back which said I was a sociopath, but I didn‚Äôt believe it and took two more and they both said I have sociopathic tendencies, I then took the first test i took again and it said I had sociopathic tendencies, after taking the test I then remember watching a YouTube video titled: By the way, are you a sociopath? I watched the video again and got half of the questions right, the youtuber stated that this was a test created by professionals. So I then look up on YouTube the characteristics of a sociopath and I click on the infographics show.   He then said that the traits of a sociopath are lacking remorse, being manipulative, and caring about what people say about you. Now I can‚Äôt really say that I can relate to the last part but still lol. But the other two perfectly match me. I wouldn‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm manipulative to the point where I‚Äôd do ANYTHING to get my way but I do try to get my way out of things like washing dishes ( yes Ik) and just doing stuff that I don‚Äôt really feel like doing. But I‚Äôm definitely not remorseful when it comes to some certain situations. When my baby brother was 3-4 months old me and my mom was watching him while watching tv (yes I have a dad he was just at work) and he was toothing so he started chewing on plastic keys wrapped around in a keychain and I guess he bit too hard because he started crying out of no where, my mom starting trying to comfort him while I started bursting out laughing, at this moment she then told me that this wasn‚Äôt funny and that I Goulding be laughing. Later on in the day my dad comes home and my mom tells my dad what happened, he tells me the same thing my mom told me and then went inside his room, after he went in his room I started thinking why I should be sorry and to this day I still feel no sorrow. There was also another time where my mom was feeding him milk while I was downstairs ( no she wasn‚Äôt breast feeding) he had his eyes closed and I decided that it‚Äôd be funny if I held his nose closed for just a second, but for the most part I just wanted to see what happened. So I did it and he started to gasp for air immediately after (note that I did this for atleast 1-2 seconds. And of course my mom tells me what‚Äôs up. Now I‚Äôm not saying she‚Äôs in the wrong for doing it as it makes perfect sense to do that and I would‚Äôve done the same thing. And if your asking why I‚Äôm like this let me tell you I was not always like this but I was definitely not the best kid alive when I was younger. Idk ay I‚Äôm adding this but I‚Äôm 2-3 grade I tried to choke my friend I‚Äôve known since kindergarten in front of his younger brother for no reason (I can‚Äôt remember my memory is horrible). And it‚Äôs not like I have no friends, I have plenty of friends and have also had girlfriends and also known as the funny guy in the group, yes Ik this sound like a quityourbullshit but please help me out.

330,"TL;DR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

Please excuse any wording errors - English is not my main language. 

 

I'm in my mid twenties and two months ago I moved in with another girl to save costs. Up until this point I've only ever lived with men - both romantically and not, and I've found it to be pretty chill (albeit a bit messy at times).   
I am kind of experiencing the exact opposite problem in this living situation, and it's taking it's toll on my mental health and wellbeing.   
   


This girl and I had some classes together in the university, and I've spent some time with her and her friends, having a lot of fun!   
When she broke up with her boyfriend of four years I brought wine, chocolate and a shoulder to cry on. I took her with me to meet my friends from far away at concerts to get her mind off the breakup. She's also been a person I could talk to anytime about anything, and we've had a lot of fun just the two of us.  
   


I've got a full time job, but as a student she needed someone to live with to save costs. It sounded like a great idea at the time as we were such good friends, and we found the perfect place in the middle of the city - it was a great oppurtunity!

  

She wasn't onboard with the apartment at first, and as I had to get out of my old apartment fast I let her have the biggest bedroom (about twice the size of the other one) for no extra charge - despite me being the tallest one. I got a smaller bed for it to fit, and she got herself a bigger one since she had room for it. 

   
  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

I already felt bad about it the first week we were living together, but I figured talking about how we'd want things to be and compromising would make it all better. She has shared custody with one of her exes for a dog, which barked A LOT the first few weeks. I talked to her about it, and her response was ""Oh, yes. You'll have to learn to sleep with earplugs, or else you won't get much sleep"". 

The way she talkes about the apartment to her friends is that it's her and her dogs' home - and I've had to remind her several times that ""I'm here too, and your wiev is hurtful to me"". 

The dog is calmer now - only barking when looking out the window, but most of the time I'm the one that has to drag it away and calm it. 

 

She also has a ton of stuff. Our storage room is about 90% full of her things, and I can't really get to mine. The freezer and the fridge is pretty much the same, and I can rarely shop for groceries that need to stay cool. 

 Her biggest concern with the apartment we're renting is the cost, and I've had to fully pay for our vaccuumcleaner and TV, because she ""could never afford those things as a student with a car and a dog"".

 Despite this she does monthly lash-extensions, shopping sprees, botox, and is out drinking every week (some weekdays even, now that it's summer). She goes to concerts, festivals and coffeeshops everytime someone she knows are doing the same, and she's extremely concerned about strangers perceiving her as high-class.  
   
 The greatest difference between us is probably the fact that I enjoy my own company very much to the point that I sometimes prefer being alone, but she can't stand being by herself, and is never seen without her phone in hand. 

 

One of my biggest pet-peeves with her is that she'll chat with 3-4 boys at the same time, all of them thinking that they're the only one she's interested in. I am aware that I can't really be mad about it as it's her life, but I feel so sorry for them and I don't think they deserve being led on like that. She also has a habit of lying to make people interested in her, which in my opinion is not OK.

 

I have to admit I'm not the easiest person to live with. I'm a bit messy (I keep it mostly to my own room), and I have to have stuff in cupboards and drawers sorted and left where I put it or I'll be uneasy.   
My job requires me to get up before 6am, so on weekdays I need her to be quiet by 10pm, and if I don't get enough sleep I'll get distant, irritated and difficult towards her.  

 I need things to be like I want them to be, and I don't always have a reason for it - which she can't seem to accept.   
I've lived completely on my own for about four months at one point in my life, and I've been told by people who knew me then that I was a much more chill and pleasant person to hang out with. Now I'm stressing over meaningless things, and I fear that I'm manifesting it on her as a person.   
   


 Still, I can't shake the feeling that she's using me to make herself seem more interesting, and that she doesn't respect me.  
For instance; I've told her multiple times to stay out of my bedroom, but despite agreeing to my claim she won't respect it. She just doesn't leave traces anymore, but having lived with three siblings I have ways to know if the door's been opened.  There's other issues involved as well, and they're all in the same tone. I tell her to ""please don't do this"" and she either pretend she's stopped doing it, or she does something else to demonstrate.   
   


 

Writing this down has made me realize I can't keep on living like this. She's been out of town for a few days now, and I'm thriving on my own. I just recently applied for a higher position in my company in a different city - and if I get the job it would be the easiest way to tell her I'm moving out. It's very possible that I won't get it, but I'm using it as a deadline for myself deciding to move out.   
 

 

I really need advice on how to let her know I'll be moving out without hurting her feelings. I believe she wants to be a good person, she's just not a good roommate, and I'd like to be friends with her even after we part ways. 

Advice about how to make it work in the meantime is also very welcome! 

 

 

TL;DR: Moved in with a good friend. Two months in it hasn't gone as well as I imagined and I'm looking for a kind, but definite way to tell her I'm moving out as it seems like it won't get better.",06Jul2019,1
331,"Ill start this off by saying this, i never truly stuggled in life, i always had a roof over my head, and food in the fridge completely thanks to my grandpa. He might live like a pig but hes the only reason ive never known street life.

     Im 16 rn, gonna be 17 in less than a week, and ive really been thinking about life. Like what i want to do, where i want to go, and most recently, whether its worth keeping my parents in my life.

    My dad comes from money, they werent rich but they definitely were high middle class. Lived like a douchebag until his late teens and went to trade school to become a plumber. My mom grew up as the youngest of 5 siblings, she went to trade school to be a pediatrician. They met at this same trade school where they dated for a short while and eventually after school, my mom moved to my home state with my dad. My dad took over as the only one working for quite some time. Their relationship was supposedly fine (although they did live with my grandpa) until me and my sister were born. Around that time he became emotionally and physically abusive towards her to the point she nearly left him at one point, though she was stopped by my grandma and she heard my dad out and he 'apologized' to her and said he would try to be better. 
 
     They continued in this rocky relationship for a long time, until my dad was out of a job due to his workplace being shut down. He applied for a few more places and kept getting turned down before eventually saying quite possibly the dumbest thing ive ever heard. ""I guess god doesnt want me to work."" And would you believe it, he didnt work agaon for quite some time, i was seven at the time, just going into the second grade so i never did grasp what he said at that point but i still remember it. My mom took a job at Subway, where she would stay for 4 years, working for just over minimum wage. Oh yeah, and the reason she doesnt work as a pediatrician? Because my dad told her that she would ""bring sickness back to the house."" 

    Around fifth grade, i began doing homeschool, where i would basically teach myself, unsupervised for 6 hours a day because all my dad did by this point was sleep, eat, and give his unwanted opinion. There were points in which we would argue over stupid things like the time that he literally starts screaming at me for things that i literally didnt even do, i cant mention them here as its illegal in my state but lets just say some 'crumbs' were in one of my drawers, which he used to use. 

     Fast forward to now. Some time after i turned 15, my dad got in some fight with my grandpa in which my dad through a chair at him. My grandpa called the cops on him and my dad somehow managed to not get arrested by saying that he threw the chair at the wall, and not near my grandpa. My grandpa told us that we had a month to move out. By this time, my mom had began working at a local supermarket for around $13 an hour, but that wouldnt afford rent for all four of us, so for the first time in nearly a decade, my dad actually got a job. We moved to a more urban area where my grandma had to sign on with the lease because my parents credit was so bad, though we paid the rent. Or at least we were supposed too, as it seemed like my grandpa would alternate between paying our ($1300) rent or my moms ($400) car payment, and my dad would only pay the utilities despite making more money than my mom. When i turned 16, i got a job working at a local family style restaurant, it was quite nice actually, while it lasted. 

      My dad would argue with me consistantly, trying to regulate how much i can work my own job, for my money, it wasnt like he was suggesting i go easy, no he would demand that i work less, and id remind him that im homeschooled, and my grades were never effected. Eventually i managed to convince him to back off. I started savinv money to buy my own car, a good idea i though, until i realized that my mom never had any money and would dip into mine when she ran out. At present shes told me she'll 'pay me back' almost $1300 but i dont see it happening. At one point my dad was having me or my sister wake him up for work, why he couldnt art an alarm was beyond me at the time. One day, id just got done working a full 10 A.M to 12 A.M. shift at my job and still got up the next day at 6 A.M. for school, as you can imagine, i was tired so i went to sleep afterward, trusting my sister to wake my dad up for work, she didnt. When he finally did wake up, he was of course mad, and decided to show that by yelling at me and telling me im ground for a week due to not waking him up. Having just gotten woke up, that pissed me off even more than it would have normally, i simply told him ""I'm not gonna deal with your shit right now"", not my best choice of words i know. But i preceded to walk back upstairs when he grabs me by the back of my shirt collar and pulls me down the stairs, and pins me to the wall and starts yelling at me, he gets so close that i push him back from me, which he responds to by hitting in the face and holding me to the ground with his foot on my throat. We would later get into a fight on new years which sparked by me saying i would get rid of some trash when i finished what i was doing, him not likeing that and taking my ps4. He went to take my phone as well, but i told him no and that i pay for my phone unlike every teenager ever and we get into another fight when he tries to wrestle it from my hand. Not as one sided as the last but i still ended up losing with a swollen jaw and busted lip. Any time ive fought with my dad he always talks down to me afterwards and says that its my fault and how i should ""submit to his authority"" while my mom perpetuates it by again telling my its my fault.

      Coming up on my 17th ive had a lot of time to think over this and realize how shitty my parents are. i want to pursue a career in cooking and live on my own as soon i turn 18. But i was wanting reddits opinion on whether i should even keep my parents in my life after i move out.

336,"Okay, I know that the title sounds very wrong. Please let me explain:

After graduation, I [F 21] agreed to be in a relationship with my research adviser [M 31] who is married and have kids. 

After our thesis, he kept on pursuing me but I constantly rejected him because he was married. I did like him though but was just not ready for his complications. I and a few classmates became really close with him and would hang out with him several times besides school stuff. Until one drunken night, after I sobered up he told me he asked me again and I said yes to him while drunk. I was so confused but eventually believed him because I was thinking this was probably what I wanted. He once told me that everything we say when drunk are our honest thoughts and so the idiot I was, I believed him. 

The whole time we were together, he convinced me that he and his wife were separated and was working on their divorce. He also told me that his wife was already seeing someone else. We were together for 2 months until the wife found out about me and confronted me.Turns out, he was still with her while he was seeing me on the side.  

The wife almost ruined me by posting my face on social media, but she deleted it and everyone calmed down eventually. I was ready to forget about all of these but my mother, behind my back, decided to report his misconduct to the university. She convinced me to file an affidavit of complaint because she wants at least some form of disciplinary action. I was thinking to just go along with it in the hopes that this will not happen again with anyone else (I am aware that he was also pursuing one of his research advisees before pursuing me but was rejected so he definitely did this plenty of times). However, the complaint was filed and labelled as sexual harassment.

Now, the wife contacted me to not push through with the complaint. He, on the other hand, contacted my mother, indirectly blackmailing her that he will present to the school board all of our conversations and it might definitely affect me. I am completely aware that everything we did was with my consent. I was just thinking that what he did, pursuing his advisees (and prob other else) while still being with his wife, was completely beyond the line, and I decided to support my mom with the complaint so that he wouldn't have the chance to do it again. 

I am completely at odds now at what to do. I wanted a disciplinary action to prevent his cheating (or pursuit of innocent college girls) in the future from happening, but if we pursue it, I'll be ruining his reputation and family. He is a well liked individual, very charismatic and reputable. My mom is adamant to pursue the complaint though. I however don't think I can live with the thought of a ruined family's life in the future. I am completely ashamed of what I did and am ready to face any consequences for my actions, but I cannot bear the thought of being to blame for their ruined family.

I wasn't really sure where to post this, and I don't even know what answers I'm seeking, if there are any. I just don't get it.
Yeah, I do get horny and all, and I do masturbate 3-4 times a week - it's just nothing compared to my friends who fap the same amount in a single day.
Never have I ever masturbated more than 2 times in 1 day, and nevet have I ever even enjoyed it the second time.

I feel like this is boycutting me from scoring with girls. It's like I don't even want to have sex bad enough to really want to go out of my way to get it. I'm almost missing opportunities, because I don't think with my dick, when I really need to.

341,"Okay, I know that the title sounds very wrong. Please let me explain:

After graduation, I [F 21] agreed to be in a relationship with my research adviser [M 31] who is married and have kids. 

After our thesis, he kept on pursuing me but I constantly rejected him because he was married. I did like him though but was just not ready for his complications. I and a few classmates became really close with him and would hang out with him several times besides school stuff. Until one drunken night, after I sobered up he told me he asked me again and I said yes to him while drunk. I was so confused but eventually believed him because I was thinking this was probably what I wanted. He once told me that everything we say when drunk are our honest thoughts and so the idiot I was, I believed him. 

The whole time we were together, he convinced me that he and his wife were separated and was working on their divorce. He also told me that his wife was already seeing someone else. We were together for 2 months until the wife found out about me and confronted me.Turns out, he was still with her while he was seeing me on the side.  

The wife almost ruined me by posting my face on social media, but she deleted it and everyone calmed down eventually. I was ready to forget about all of these but my mother, behind my back, decided to report his misconduct to the university. She convinced me to file an affidavit of complaint because she wants at least some form of disciplinary action. I was thinking to just go along with it in the hopes that this will not happen again with anyone else (I am aware that he was also pursuing one of his research advisees before pursuing me but was rejected so he definitely did this plenty of times). However, the complaint was filed and labelled as sexual harassment.

Now, the wife contacted me to not push through with the complaint. He, on the other hand, contacted my mother, indirectly blackmailing her that he will present to the school board all of our conversations and it might definitely affect me. I am completely aware that everything we did was with my consent. I was just thinking that what he did, pursuing his advisees (and prob other else) while still being with his wife, was completely beyond the line, and I decided to support my mom with the complaint so that he wouldn't have the chance to do it again. 

I am completely at odds now at what to do. I wanted a disciplinary action to prevent his cheating (or pursuit of innocent college girls) in the future from happening, but if we pursue it, I'll be ruining his reputation and family. He is a well liked individual, very charismatic and reputable. My mom is adamant to pursue the complaint though. I however don't think I can live with the thought of a ruined family's life in the future. I am completely ashamed of what I did and am ready to face any consequences for my actions, but I cannot bear the thought of being to blame for their ruined family. Also, I don't know what else he can do to ruin me when he's the one that is mostly at fault (but tbh he can be very manipulative and a total two-face).

342,"So there‚Äôs this girl, let‚Äôs call her ‚ÄòA‚Äô. 
I love her, so much. I‚Äôve been in love with her for 6 months. She‚Äôs the most beautiful girl I‚Äôve ever seen, among her other great qualities that I won‚Äôt list as that‚Äôs not the purpose of this post. I‚Äôve never felt this strongly about anyone before.
Me and her have been friends for quite a long time, as we shared the same Food technology class. We have quite a complicated friendship, and although we are in a great place at the moment, we‚Äôve had some rough patches. I suffered from depression from around October 2018, ( I can‚Äôt pinpoint exactly where it started ) and went through help and counselling until May this year. I am feeling in a better place now, but during this time, I treated her and other friends unfairly due to my mental state being a mess and in March we lost our friendship and she cut me off on social media and avoided contact with me in person where possible. We didn‚Äôt speak between March and late April and I was heartbroken over this. In late April, we spoke and she apologised to me, said she didn‚Äôt handle the situation properly, it was her fault we lost the friendship and she overreacted and made more of a mess of things than I did. I was over the moon at this, and jumped at the opportunity to apologise for my wrongdoing‚Äôs too and become friends again. Then, during the May half term school break (I am in year 11 going into year 12 / sixth form, having finished my GCSE exams) I was out in town with some of my Male friends and we bumped into her and two of her friends. I didn‚Äôt expect anything to come of this but the two groups mixed and we ended up spending the rest of the day together. Me and ‚ÄòA‚Äô talked, she hugged me a lot, told me she was sorry again, we took pictures together and it was generally just really nice. When she hugged me I felt like a human being again after feeling like a monster for months due to my depressed state. Since that day, we‚Äôve been better friends than ever. On occasion she‚Äôll call me and we‚Äôll talk, we speak on social media everyday and she seems engaged in the conversation and will start conversation too. We‚Äôve also met up twice in group meet ups outside of school so I‚Äôve seen her in person quite a bit, and we‚Äôve spent time talking in person and having fun. She told me I‚Äôm one of her best friends and she appreciates me so much. 
Now, here‚Äôs the tricky part. All this is great, I couldn‚Äôt be happier that me and her are close again after losing our friendship back in March. But I love her. I‚Äôve never felt this way about anyone. But I‚Äôm stuck on what to do as it‚Äôs very much a gamble. 
There‚Äôs this other boy, let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄòX‚Äô. He likes her, and he tells her he wants a relationship with her. She‚Äôs told me she‚Äôs had on and off crushes for him in the past, and she‚Äôs thinking about trying it out with him. ‚ÄòA‚Äô is a very fragile person, she‚Äôs been hurt and messed about by lots of boys in the past. She‚Äôs opened up to me in the past and confided in me, telling me she wants to feel loved and hasn‚Äôt felt like she‚Äôs been loved properly by boys. She‚Äôs lonely, and most of her friends have relationships. She feels left out, and she also is very broken and insecure over the fact she is only known by a lot of boys for rumours and lots of people have taken the piss out of her in the past. I want her to be happy, therefore when she told me about the situation with ‚ÄòX‚Äô I told her to not compromise on her happiness and do whatever makes her happy, she should let herself be happy. She told me it means a lot to her that I ‚Äòcare so much about her happiness‚Äô . This boy ‚ÄòX‚Äô has a bad track record with girls and hurting them / messing them about, and has a reputation for just wanting girls for sex. Admittedly, he does seem genuine in his behaviour towards ‚ÄòA‚Äô, and that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs considering giving it a shot. He is also going to a different college in September whereas me and ‚ÄòA‚Äô are going to the same one. ‚ÄòA‚Äô is unsure on what to do with ‚ÄòX‚Äô. Naturally, I want to tell her how much I feel about her, and that I‚Äôll love her, and I‚Äôll do my best to be the best boyfriend I could be. When she told me she hasn‚Äôt been loved properly, I wanted to scream pick me , pick me ! But I‚Äôm not sure what I should do.
Other friends of mine that are girls say her behaviour towards me is very positive, and things she does and says suggests I have a chance. My cousin, who‚Äôs a girl has recently spent a week with me and I told her about the situation and the way ‚ÄòA‚Äô behaves towards me, and she thinks if I tell her how I feel that she‚Äôll realise I love her and realise that I‚Äôm a good choice and choose me over a relationship that could potentially end in a lot of hurt with ‚ÄòX‚Äô. 
However, despite people giving me confidence to go for it, I personally think she‚Äôs way too good for me, and it‚Äôll end in disaster if I tell her how I feel. I‚Äôm also fucking terrified of losing my friendship with ‚ÄòA‚Äô by telling her how I feel. I also don‚Äôt want to overwhelm her when she‚Äôs in the middle of confusion over ‚ÄòX‚Äô. 
I do really love her and I‚Äôd drop everything for her if she gave me a chance but I‚Äôm afraid that the way she treats me is no different from other guys, and it‚Äôs all an illusion and I don‚Äôt have a chance at all, and it will end up in me losing a friendship that I hold so dear to me. I‚Äôm not sure how she feels about me and as much as I‚Äôd like to believe in the confidence other people give me, I don‚Äôt. 
What should I do ? Should I tell her I love her and see where it goes ? Or don‚Äôt say anything ? 
It‚Äôs a gamble.",06Jul2019,1
343,"I am 16YO male and I have a serious issue with self-control.

I will tell myself I will not do it again , only to immediately relapse the day after.

344,"Hi, so we've been together for almost 4 months now. We both just finished high school and going to university in october. The whole story is more complex, but I'm gonna keep it short. The last few days we've been constantly arguing that I'm not the only one who should make compromises, and this argument started from the fact that for these months she kept asking me to change in ways I didn't really wanted to, and I did it to some extenct, but I just couldn't take it anymore. And she said that only I should make compromises and all this kind of stuftf, just because I'm the man in the relationship (I'm 19 she's 20) and that pissed me off really hard and now I just keep thinking that I should break up with her.

345,"One day I saw this girl 3 years ago in high school and for some reason something just clicked with her. I found her attractive and she was social but always seemed shy and very quiet type. She never seemed mean  and was in honor classes. However I never really got to say Hi to her because at the time I was going through my own stuff and I was working on making myself better. Now one day i just happened to notice one of my friends walking home with her and found out it was my friends cousin. So now this is kinda a moral delima because one time i made a joke about asking her out and he seemed bothered by it so i left it alone.

Fast forward to today and I'm in a better place than in high school. My mindset is strong and I am moving up to a supervisor position and going to school to even go further in life. I follow this girl on social media and get butterflies when i remember high school. Idk i know it seems weird, but part of me wants to do something and i just don't know what.

I went to work and when I finished that 10 hour work day which is illegal I later found out, they said I‚Äôd sign them tomorrow I gave them the Benefit of the doubt and the next day after 8 hours of work,  I was never allowed to sign the papers despite asking several times.

I‚Äôm owed 195 dollars by them for my $10/Hr and 3 hours of overtime where I got $5 more for work.

357,"Hey there! I (19F) am at a bit of a crossroads at the minute. I‚Äôm supposed to be starting university in September, but honestly, I just know that I‚Äôm not a college person. I hate learning and being in a classroom setting and if I go to university I‚Äôll have to take out student loans for a degree I‚Äôm not even that passionate about (I have to pay for the entire thing without any parental help).

However, the only thing keeping me from saying no to college completely is the fact that my parents are making my life hell. I currently live at home with them and I pay them to live there, but even though I pay my way, they still hold complete authority over the house.
My mother is a complete narcissist while my dad just watches her do whatever she wants while I and my siblings suffer. 
If I go to university I can get away from that life- NOW. I can actually breathe and not have someone nagging me every five seconds about how I can‚Äôt do a thing right. 

I know some of you will say move out and get my own place, but there‚Äôs no way there‚Äôs no way I can at the moment. My job is minimum wage so the pay is barely enough to keep me going. I don‚Äôt have a car and there‚Äôs ZERO public transport where I live- the closest town is a half an hour drive away. 
That means if I stay at home and continue working, I‚Äôd be stuck there until I could afford a car which would be a longgggg time. 

If I leave for college, I can get out in a month. I‚Äôm starting to think that maybe college would be the best for me, even if it means putting myself into thousands of debt. If I have to stay with my parents for even a year longer, I genuinely would kill myself. 

What should I do Reddit? Even if I hate learning, will the degree pay off in the end? (I will be doing a teaching degree). Will the debt be worth the freedom if it means I can finally escape my parents?
Or am I better off sucking it up for a few more years a home until I can afford to buy a car and look for a better paying job?

They aren‚Äôt bad people, but I think it‚Äôs an issue of compatibility between our personalities. Sometimes A and B say off hand comments that are jokes, but they still hurt. (Note: A and B are sisters)

So for example person B said: ‚ÄúYou should get muscle I think it‚Äôs a serious issue‚Äù

I‚Äôm a really skinny person, thanks to my very high metabolism, and I have been going to the gym. When she said that it hurt quite a bit. She could‚Äôve meant it in a caring matter but I think on her tone of voice it was meant as a joke. 

Also multiple comments on how I‚Äôm really slow  (don‚Äôt blame them I am) and how I should be faster and contribute more, since I‚Äôve been there for 6 months, have made me question if I‚Äôm really worth the money on shifts and made me feel useless.

I think fast food isn‚Äôt just cut out for me and to preserve my mental state I should quit, but there‚Äôs his part of me calling me a quitter and that I haven‚Äôt tried enough, that I‚Äôm running away from the problem and taking things too personally. 

I also think my speed in packing hasn‚Äôt improved by anything commendable over the last 6 months, and it‚Äôs supposed to happen naturally.

She screamed like she was possessed by a demon.  she said, ""you're just trying to act hard"". after many failed attempts of trying to get me to leave by force, she grabbed a metal pole. at first, she used this for intimidation, hitting the stuff near me or just swing at me. But this escalated, she called our parents and kept saying she was going to kill me. she kept breaking stuff in her room and kept hitting me with the metal rod. I got angry at this so I pulled down her curtains. Our parents came. My father was very angry at me he tried to hit me but my mother got in the way of both of us. I told my mother what happened in as much detail as I could but she said you shouldn't go into your sister's room and blamed me. There were no repercussions for her beating me with a metal pole but I was blamed for this because I stepped in her room. I contemplated calling the police but I am afraid and don't know what to do. Currently, I am unable to photograph the bruises on my arms due to being grounded. This happened in England and me and my sister are both minors but she is 2 years older than me.",06Jul2019,3

I won't take a pregnancy test until I'm a few weeks late for my period- right now, my period isn't due for a week. But here's what's going on.

I track my ovulation, both by calendar and discharge. During my calendar's listed ovulation cycle(Which has been accurate for as long as I've been using it), my discharge never.. ovulated..? My discharge didn't change like it should have.

For the past five days, I've felt nauseated, but haven't thrown up. 

My stomach has always been relatively flat, I guess- it's usually pretty soft, it's not slim, but it usually does fall flat by the time I wake up in the mornings- lately it's been bloated when I wake up, and extremely firm to the touch. 

My lower stomach feels like a tightening pain, it feels like a cramp, but not a period type of cramp. 

I've been extremely turned on, for maybe two weeks. I saw a pair of baby wearing the cutest pair of sandals in Walmart the other day, I almost cried. that's not something I ever do- but it was SO fucking cute to me.

I thought he wanted to be friends when we first started hanging out and since he was older I didn‚Äôt think it was suspicious until he gave me alcohol and slept me me. he tried to convince me that what we did was okay.

I definitely want to get married and have kids at some point, though I am enjoying the freedom of being single right now.

392,"So last Sunday I matched with this guy on Tinder, we hit it off quickly and added each other on Snapchat the next day. We've talked every single day since then and things were going fine. During our conversations he sometimes mentioned being all alone and hating his life, but due to the context it was being said in I just assumed he had a bit of a dark humour. It just didn't come accross as something he said because he was suicidal or depressed. 

Last night I suddenly got a message on snapchat from him, just saying ""today is the day I'm going to die"". My gut instinct told me this is just his weird humour again, but it scared me nevertheless so I sent him a message asking if anything's wrong. He left me on read, so I got worried and asked if he could call me. Again left on read. I asked if he was serious, which he simply answered yes to. So I freaked out. I spent 45 minutes trying to reach him, but never got a reply (for a while he read the messages, just didn't reply, but everything I sent after about 30 minutes didn't get opened). 

At that point I was really worried. He lives 4 hours away from me, and I don't know anyone in that area, so I decided to call the police. I told them the situation, that he told me he was going to die, said he was being serious, opened some of my messages but never replied more. They thanked me, and said they'll find a way to contact him. 

I spent the next 2 hours worried sick, not knowing what to do. I tried calling him regulary on snapchat, but didn't have any other way of contacting him. Finally he sent me a message back asking if I'd called the police, so I said ""yes of course, it seemed like you were actually going to kill yourself"". We talked for a bit after that, and he was really mad. Said the police had contacted him mom, and he was getting calls from the police in my city as well as in his. He just didn't understand why I would call them for something like that. He thought I should have understood that he wasn't actually going to kill himself, he hates his life so that's just the sort if thing he says, and I've caused a lot of drama in his life now because of this. At this point we were talking on the phone, and my stupid ass made the mistake of laughing at something (I laugh when I'm nervous) which set him off and he hung up on me in anger. It was about 1.30 AM at this point, and I had to get up at 6 AM for work, so I just sent a message saying that I care (he hasn't answered), and went to sleep. 

I've spent the entire morning feeling sick and at this point I don't know what to do. I don't really regret calling the police, because from the information I had it truly seemed like he was going to kill himself, but I still feel like I'm in the wrong and have probably caused him a lot of trouble with his mom. I'm scared he'll cut me off because of this. He's a person that truly interests me, and I really enjoyed talking to him. It's past 3 PM now, and I haven't heard from him yet. I want to reach out, but I'm scared that it's too soon, and that it would just make him even more upset, I'm probably the last person he wants to talk to now. 

Should I just wait and see if he contacts me? Should I send him a message? Any advice or thoughts  would be greatly appreaciated.",06Jul2019,1

414," 

it's my first time here and i'm not quite sure if i'm in the right forum but i need to get this off me before the frustration takes over.

Recently i had the biggest epiphany, my **dream job has always been to be a flight attendant(male)**. I live in the Philippines, 26 turning 27 this year and i know it's a little late(age-wise note: even though the max age limit in hiring here was banned in airlines ages ago the bias against older applicants are still there) to try and pursue this but i wouldn't have it any other way. I really want to try my luck to be one. **BUT** i am not qualified since i don't pass yet the initial requirements. it is because i am a little over my BMI and my teeth need fixing. i'm confident that i have the looks and complexion and height for the job aside from what i mentioned. so i decided that i will devote all available resources to making myself a suitable candidate to be a cabin crew. but i need a job to do that. you see i just got off from my last job this January as a call center agent(worked for 3 months) had to resign because a bank that i applied in said to prepare for the final interview(I didn't get the job due to technical reasons) and before that i have 2 years experience working in the government as a contractual employee.i haven't save much money and i don't know why i kept on spending them on useless things but i realize now it was because i never really had anything to save for. now a company i applied a month ago wants me to go to their clinic for the medical exams and final interview. i have high hopes that i am gonna get hired this time and finally start on my plan to be a flight attendant. but there is just one problem:my parents.

**\*in the next paragraphs i'm going to write a bit about my past**

**(flashback)**

you see it was them that has always been deciding on any major decisions in my life. early on before college i told my mom that i want to be a pilot or a flight attendant. but i realized i hated math and to be a pilot required a lot of money so i wanted to take tourism as my major to be a flight attendant but she insisted that i take nursing **so i could go work abroad and make a ton of money**(was a common stereotype back then). i should've insisted on my plan but hey, i was a stupid kid and i didn't think the consequence of what i was doing. took a year to realize that i was miserable and i shifted course. once again i asked to take tourism. ""maano ka man pakagrad mo ma tour guide??""**(what do you plan to be when you graduate to be a tour guide?)** is what she said and again i was stupid. i should have insisted on what i wanted instead i followed what she wanted. so i took business management class instead since she said that that's were the money was. and after number of years later i somehow convinced myself that **this is what i wanted**. stockholm syndrome maybe? when i graduated i worked at an office 8 to 5 like your regular joe. i enjoyed the environment but it took me a while to realize that i don't want to be stuck in a cubicle for the rest of my life. **I WAS MISERABLE.** i enjoyed the company but not the job. so when i had the chance to jump ship i did. after 2 years i found another job this time in a bank. or so i thought. when i received the email saying that i need to come in for an interview i immediately quit my job(i don't regret it for one second) but i encountered setbacks along the way and pretty soon i had run out of money. so i had to get a job and i found one as a call center agent which actually **PAYS MORE** than my previous one. and to tell you the truth despite the toxic environment it was **one of the most enjoyable months of my career.** there was just this thrill and sense of fulfillment when you successfully turn an irate client to a calm one and this pleasure when i know that the customer is pleased with my help. i guess i've always been fit for the customer service industry. **I HAVE NEVER FELT MORE ALIVE.** BUT in early January the bank that i previously applied for called and said they want me to come in for the final interview and medicals. the company i worked for doesn't allow 3 consecutive absences and it just so happens that the set interview schedule and medicals was in their main office in **Manila.** i live in the province, and the bus ride would take 12 hrs just to get there. so that's 1 day for the medical and interview the next day. the overall trip would take 4 days so i had no choice but to leave. **i didn't get the job.** this bank is strict when it comes to the ""no relatives working on the same company"" policy. as it turned out i have a relative that i didn't know work on the same bank. i wasn't heartbroken actually a bit more relieved to be honest. that's when i realized that **i'll never be truly happy** working in an office. **NEVER.**before i really tried hard to love my job but i just really can't. only when i was a call center did i have **that** happiness. **but even then it was lacking**. but what could i do this was all i know and so i kept looking for a job. my parents were helping out as well and they didn't want me to return to be a call center agent again. you see **their idea of a dream job is a stable job, a SAFE regular office job in the government.** just like theirs. and i don't blame them because that's all they know. but deep down i want something more. i know they keep saying that they are happy where we are now and that we should be thankful for what we have and not ask for more but i just can't. **i'm not happy.** months of job hunting and i came across an ad. open day at philippine airlines. i didn't much attention to it at first but i got curious so i searched in the key words FLIGHT ATTENDANT on google. i dug deeper and deeper. i got to youtube vids. saw the pros and cons salaries benefits the behind the scenes the struggles to be one the training that they go through the qualities you need to possess the bonding. **AND THEN I REMEMBERED.** that was when i remembered what i always wanted to be. i wanted the challenge that the job brings the problems that come along with it and the benefits. it was perfect. it explained so much why i enjoyed a customer service based job. it explained so much as to why in college i was more active on volunteer works, events management, my need to be always on foot, to be always active. **MY DESIRE FOR ADVENTURE AND TRAVEL** over my academics. because **deep down i know what i am supposed to be.** i am committing myself to make my dream come true. and if i fail i'll have no regrets.

**(the plan):** get a job and use the money to start and reinvent myself. lose weight get braces for my teeth. try on classes that would help me qualify more as a flight attendant. i estimate this would take 2 years at least(i'd be 29 by then) but i don't mind. hopefully airlines are still hiring by then and that the age limit bias would be gone as well.

**(presently)**

now after many companies one called in from Manila again and i have a good feeling that i will get this job this time but it would mean that i would have to move there. no problem for me i saw that as a pro so i could practice being independent and which is part of that ""reinvent myself"" part of the plan. when i told them this they didn't seem happy. they were against me moving out but they were being passive aggressive about it\*\*(note that in filipino culture it is rare for the kid to move out before he/she got married esp the eldest since they are obliged to help send their siblings to school, i am the oldest of 3 btw)\*\*. they were trying to convince me about the cost of living there, how sure am i that i would get the job, etc etc... now what they have done was basically call in favors left and right to actually find me a job that's close to home. they did find one but it would take longer than what i have now before i am hired and i can't risk it. i know the job isn't a sure thing yet but i really want to try my luck because i hate being safe all the time because i have never really grown as a person following the path they want me to take. **I WANT TO GROW.** **I NEED TO LEAVE AND BE FREE TO LEARN.** you see the whole time that i have been living with them i feel like they have been holding me back. don't get me wrong, i love my parents to death and i certainly don't resent them for their decisions because i know their pasts and i also enabled them too. but in this aspect, i want to be in control. i need to be otherwise i don't know and will never know what kind of person i can be when left alone. **I'M 26 FOR FUCKS SAKE.** i want to know who i am without them. while i'm writing this my mom is literally searching and chatting friends for favors to get me a job here so i don't have to leave. **I WANT TO LEAVE. I WANT TO BE FREE.** i don't want to be stuck in my hometown working 8-5 doing paperworks in a fucking cubicle. i belong in the air. every inch of me existence tells me so. i need to pursue this plan because i have nothing else left. but i don't want to let my parents down either. i haven't told them about this plan yet because i know they wouldn't support it. and believe me **I KNOW.** i've been in many arguments with my parents before and i know how they react. once i told them that i will take a job in s.korea as a factory worker since it pays a lot. 80kPHP with medical food and lodging per month and after your 3 yr contract they give you a quit claim of 900kPHP. they said no they don;t like the idea. but later on when a friend of theirs told a story about their son taking **the same job i told them about in korea** they immediately changed tune. it was too late the hring date was over by then. **that's how low they think of my decisions**. and that's how i know what their reaction will be when i tell them my plan. i am writing this because i while ago my mom just came into my room telling me to take that opening at an office job here. pays too little for me to save up for my plan. but i know they will insist. i'll say no and we'll have a fight. i can't stress enough how frustrated i am with my situation. i don't know what to do anymore. i feel like if i don't push through with this plan i would kill myself. **it's difficult when the people you need support from the most are the ones that actually hold you back.** i want to be a flight attendant but at this point now i don't know what to do.",06Jul2019,0
415,"Hey guys, just using a throw away account. For context, i've been studying to be a game artist and have been in some courses for the last 3 years. In the past i've been in some objectively terrible groups for team projects, like members slacking off, being entirely absent, screaming and intentionally bothersome. These events mostly happened in my first year but the thing is i'm still finding it difficult and now I am unsure if it is because i've been conditioned to be cautious and negative in the past or it is because I have consistently ended up with not the best of people. What do you recommend for someone who has to work in a tough group or recommendations to seeing how you can improve yourself into fitting into a group?

Some issues that I think I may be doing are:

\- Asking too many questions about the project to be certain about what we are doing.

\- Negative outlook on things, unless our concept has been solidified and we know what we are doing.

416,"So for my entire adult life, and most of my teens, i was never interested in romantic relationships. Then a little over half a year ago someone new started at my job, and as soon as i saw them i was hit full force by ""love at first sight"". Infatuation is stupid, let me tell ya.

Anyway I made myself chill and get to know them for about a month before i asked them out, and they told me point blank that they were all for being friends, but they don't experience romantic attachment (side note: it bothers them that they don't)

We've been hanging out regularly, pretty much every week when our schedules allow it. We get along great and have a lot of fun, they're easily one of my favorite people even without factoring in the stupid emotions.

I know they like me, but I'm under no delusion that the love me. Thing is, that really doesn't effect things on my end. I care about them in a way i just don't care about other people, and the knowledge that they CAN'T return those feelings doesn't bother me at all.

I know it won't lead to anything, and I'm scared it might fuck up a good thing, but I also want to be able to be more open with my affection, even if it is one sided. Should i tell them how i feel?",06Jul2019,6
417,"TL;DR: I don't think my roommate is financially or mentally responsible enough to move out yet. 

This post will be kinda long, but I feel it requires all of the background information to really understand what's happening. 

I (F/18) just graduated high school about two months ago. Months before graduation, I was accepted into my dream school, which is about an hour away from my current hometown. I really wanted to live in a dorm for my first year; especially since I am double majoring and involved in some of the higher music groups at my uni (wind ensemble, orchestra, etc.) and with the hefty course load and needs to practice, I figured it wouldn't be the worst idea ever. 

There was another person (F/17) from my school who had also been accepted into the university. Since I am very introverted and get anxious around new people, I figured I would ask her if she'd like to be my dorm mate. I didn't know her very well, but I had seen her around school often and we occasionally spoke in the hallways or at lunch. She said she'd love to room in a dorm with me and that she was excited to get to know me more. We both had plans of double majoring, so we figured we would have a similar schedule and it would work out great. 

Well, she wanted to find another person/people to share our dorm with. My uni lets you dorm with anywhere from 2-4 people. I told her four people in one room might be a bit much because the rooms were pretty small (and honestly, I didn't really want to find a third person) but I agreed to let her find one other person. I figured it would be beneficial to meet someone new to dorm with, while also having someone I was sort of acquainted with. 

We found our third person and everything had been going as plan, until our federal aid results all came back and our new room mate (F/18) told us she couldn't afford to stay in a dorm. She would've had to take out $10,000 in loans, per year, for the dorm let alone, which didn't seem very feasible. We all decided we would instead search for off-campus housing. They had agreed to let boyfriend (M/20) come with us since he is going to a community college near my school, and having four of us on the lease would be easier. 

The third roommate we had found eventually bailed on us because she decided against going to school this year (due to financial issues), but by the time she told us this, it was too late for us to turn in a deposit for a dorm, so we were stuck having to find an apartment or alternative housing solution off campus so we could be near our schools. My boyfriend and I figured this wouldn't be a problem because we work consistent hours per week and can easily manage to save and work while attending school (we work at a restaurant and had plans of transferring). However, the initial roommate I had found (the one who went to my high school) didn't even start her job until LAST MONTH--a whole month AFTER our graduation--and she only works a few days a week. 

She told us she had plans of work, so we had assumed she had a good job under her wings. However, she works at a fast food joint and makes very minimal money. So far, she hasn't a penny saved to go towards a down deposit (she couldn't even afford any of our application fees; my boyfriend and I have been paying for them all), yet she has already spent her money on buying things for the place--the place we don't even have yet. I understand she's excited and I think it is smart to get some of the things out of the way, however, I told her I think it'd be smarter right now to just save money so we can afford the initial payments, which is typically the most expensive. 

Now she's saying she'll be quitting her job soon because she's going to be doing a two week school to become a CNA, so she can make more money once we move out. This means she'll have to cut her hours at her other job, so she won't even be working for two weeks. There was even a time where she knew she wasn't making enough money, so she wanted to get her boyfriend to sign on one of the leases just so we could use his paystub...her boyfriend wouldn't have been staying with us. I told her it was FRAUD and not a good idea and she tried coming up with excuses as to why it would be okay. My boyfriend and I recently found out that he wasn't accepted for any federal aid so he had to pay for his college out of pocket, which would be nearly impossible if he had to pay rent. I also found out if I stay at my current work location, they can move me up to assistant managing very soon, where I would be making excellent money. My school is only an hour away. I recently got a beautiful new Volkswagen that's excellent on gas, and I told my roommate that moving out just seems really stressful for us right now. I told her I would feel more comfortable commuting to school and I  could give her rides. My college is only an hour away and with the times our classes are, it wouldn't be during any rush hour. However, she thinks it's more irresponsible because it'll be about $100 a week for gas; mind you, I have told her my mother would pay for our gas (which she has agreed to do). She still won't budge and told me she still  wants to look for places, and that she ""understands our stress"" but she wants to make a more ""financially responsible"" decision. 

We have already been denied two places and she threatened to SUE one of the leasing agents because before applying, I guess she was told our income would be enough (but we were denied for insufficient income). She also upset one of our leasing agents because she told them that she was currently JOB HOPPING and then got mad when the leasing agent said ""I don't want to hear that from you"". 

I understand why she wants to move out. She's a very sweet girl and I don't want to let her down, but my boyfriend and I are no longer comfortable with moving due to our current financial situations--and the fact that our roommate isn't as responsible as we first thought her out to be. She has bought a bunch of kitchen and bathroom supplies, but hasn't helped kept a job long enough to where she can seem reliable. She  hasn't saved that much money and doesn't seem to have a backup plan for a job when we move out. I think it would be better of us to wait until after the first semester, that way we aren't worrying about rent. I feel terrible because I know she wanted to stay in a dorm initially; it just didn't work out that way. I don't know how I should tell her this abruptly because every time I've tried, she keeps pushing away my ideas. I'm sorry for the super long post, my boyfriend and I just really need some help here.",06Jul2019,1

423,"Sorry for the long read.

Not too long ago, I felt like I knew what I was doing in regards to university and all of that. At least to some extent. I have a girlfriend that I have been seeing for about three years and we were making all of these ambitious plans for what we were going to do in the future. We were going to go to the same university. And we made promises as to the future but right now the university part is what is important.

This past month and a half I went abroad on a little exchange trip, I guess you could call it. And despite it being a short time, I absolutely loved it. It was a great experience to leave the country more or less by myself and see what life is like outside of my country of residence. After coming back, I realized that I want to go back for longer. The time I was given wasn't enough for me to really get used to the new atmosphere and although I learned some of the language, I want the opportunity to really emerge myself and learn.  
After coming back, I also really feel like ''my eyes have been opened'' or something. At least in regards to university. If I stick to the unis my girlfriend wants to and can get in to, I feel like I will be limiting myself a little. She wants to study something that is somewhat specialized, that is to say that not all of the universities will have the program she is looking for. And while what I want to study is found at essentially every university across the country, the quality definitely varies. I want to apply to more competitive universities and also just different universities than she wants to. Sure there are a couple in common, but they are neither my nor her first choice.

Having said that, my brain still can't accept the fact that we just shouldn't go to the same school. If I do the exchange year, the time difference is something that would be difficult, because it means we would have even less time to talk than we already would have with classes and going out with friends. I love her to death and I don't know what it would do to her for me to be gone for so long, and without being able to visit often if at all since I'd be so far away. Not to mention I would also miss the hell out of her. Plus we were planning to go on a trip together for a week right out of highschool during summer holidays before uni. And this would sort of throw off everything.

I feel that I already know that I should not miss out on the experience and that I won't be able to do this when I'm an adult and have to work. *But how do I tell her?* She seems set on being together and in the same uni, and so did I. I'm starting my final year of school after summer holidays. *Should I tell her soon and risk a break up? Or should I wait until right before we are planning on buying the trip?*",06Jul2019,1

425,"I‚Äôve been dating my best friend for 5 months, but have knew him longer. He‚Äôs just incredibly amazing and honestly one of the best people on Earth. He has helped me through so much and has supported me through everything, and I can say I‚Äôm in a better place because of him. However I‚Äôve had to keep him a secret because I‚Äôm also Bengali. Bengali culture is that you can‚Äôt have a boyfriend, and when your of age it‚Äôs your parents who choose a husband/wife for you, which on my part, I don‚Äôt agree with. I can‚Äôt imagine being with anyone else besides him. Another problem is that he‚Äôs black, and as racist as it is, my dad  wouldn‚Äôt accept him. My dad is a fair man, and chooses to solve conflict through advice, however recently I‚Äôve been in a whirlwind of turmoil. I live in an area with a lot of Bengali people who love to talk, its to a point where they somehow know everything, and tell everything to everyone. I have this Bengali lady that works in my school as a hall monitor, and she found out about me and boyfriend and was trying to tell my dad about it, which she did. She got the number from me, although told me that someone else needed it, and my dad met me outside the house and lectured me on how I shouldn‚Äôt be doing anything wrong, and that was the end of that. I had no idea what he had meant, but I would later find out she did tell him. So after that my dad started picking me up after school everyday. Recently, which was yesterday actually, was what left me shaking to my core, I‚Äôm still a bit rattled from what had happened. I was coming back from a field trip from a program I was in, and I was walking around with my boyfriend, I was taking him to a store to get something because he was thirsty, and tried to find him a bus stop because he wasn‚Äôt from my side of town. He had his arm around me at one point and this when a Bengali guy who knows my dad (every Bengali people knows everyone) was following me with his car and video called or took a video of me walking him to a bus stop, then sent it my dad. I then got a call from my dad who was screaming at me saying ‚ÄúWhy are you with a black boy, get home right now, your ruining my reputation, (Bengali guys name) sent me a video of you walking with this guy‚Äù This is when I quickly showed my boyfriend the bus stop, let him in on what was happening and left, (it happened to be that the bus stop was a block down so he missed it and had to stay there for an hour for him mom to pick him up, and he felt like he was being watched) on my way home, a car pulled up and it was the guy that recorded me. He was asking where I was coming from, I told him I was just finding a bus stop for my firmed, he asked me what time I left my house. I walked away, then I walked back  and told him why‚Äôd he take a video of me, or something like that and he was like I didn‚Äôt. I decided to drop it and went home, my dad came back from work and was basically screaming at me, and broke my phone. I then broke down telling him everything about my boyfriend besides the part that he‚Äôs my boyfriend. I told him how much he had helped    Me, and then I told other things to my dad I wouldn‚Äôt really like to say. My dad then tried to tell me that bengali people have this negative mindset, and find wrong in everything, and how much they will twist things up, then tried to tell me to get negative things out my mind and stuff, and I just blanked out at this point. My dad got me a new phone, then later apologized for yelling at me, I still felt something was not right so (it was my boyfriends idea) I sent my dad essays of everything I‚Äôve felt over the years that I never told him, including my boyfriend part, except saying that he‚Äôs my boyfriend. I explained everything and ended it in an I love you, and my dad said it back. We never really said I love you to each other. I still feel off and just distraught by everything that happened, especially the fact that someone recorded me. I don‚Äôt want to leave my house, I don‚Äôt want to keep my boyfriend a secret, and I don‚Äôt want to put him in this place (he said that no matter what he‚Äôll never leave my side), and I just feel guilty.

426,"My partner will (hopefully) be attending graduate school this coming fall. I won't be, and thus will be looking for jobs. 

However, I'm not exactly sure how to approach the job hunt process with respect to her grad program apps. The way I see it I have three main options:

1. Start applying early, around August or September. Larger companies in my field - computer science - start recruiting their new grad cohort fairly early, so you need to apply pretty early on. This has the pro of letting me secure a job early, but unfortunately may (or likely will) mean I won't end up in the same place as my partner if I get a job in november/january (we graduate in may). This would suck!

2. I could wait until she gets accepted to a program she wants to attend, then start applying for jobs in that area. However, grad school acceptances start coming out in january/february, and can often come out as late as april. This means that I'd have about four months (april through august) to find a job, which doesn't seem like a very long time!

I really don't want to do approach (1), since I'd much rather be with my partner than have a high paying job (especially since jobs at large tech companies are.... ethically questionable). At the same time, I worry that approach (2) could end up being the worst of both worlds - no job and therefore no way of ending up in the same location as my partner.

Is there some other approach that combines the best of both worlds? Or should I just choose between the above two sub-par options?",06Jul2019,1

428,"Hey there,

I'm not sure if I'm using that term correctly, but I think I'm dealing with a lot of racial hypersensitivity.

I'm a white-white female, techically my grandpa is 1/4 Sioux but that has no affect on my daily life and I realize how small of a fraction of my genome that represents.

I constantly feel bad for thinking anything but an overwhelmingly positive thought about a POC, specifically african-american or southern asian cultures. I went to high school that was 30% hispanic, but only about 1% black or asian. We hosted a South Korean exchange student when I was in high school.

Things like this happen often. Some recent examples are:

- I work in the ER. I'm not clinical like a nurse, medical assistant, or doctor. I just take notes. On principle, I don't open the door into the department for pedestrians. (I'd let someone into the waiting room, but not into the actual ER) I let registration or a nurse do that, because they know who should be coming in or out. I have never done this for anyone regardless of race. This morning, black man made eye contact with me as he waited by the door. I just walked by, like I would anyone, but I feel horrible because I must not be letting him in because of his race. 

- I don't support Kamala Harris because of some of her cases as a prosecutor and her interventionist foreign policy ideas. I do recognize that she is a very successful woman. I still feel like maybe that's my white bias or something coming through.

- Sometimes I don't find certain white people attractive. Sometimes I don't find certain hispanic people attractive. Sometimes I don't... etc. But if they aren't white, it must be because I'm racist.

Things like this happen every day, and I feel like the actual racism is me tiptoeing around people of color instead of actually thinking about them as I would anyone else. 

How do I stop this?

TL;DR- I feel bad for not liking, helping, finding attractive, etc. people that happen to be POC. Even though it's never about their race and it isn't every person of a specific race.",06Jul2019,1

I am in the process of moving in with my boyfriend. He has this roommate that is an old friend from high school. We told him at the beginning of the year he has to start looking for a place on his own because we want to have the house to ourselves among other reasons that I'll get into.

He has a room with an attached 1/2 bath (just sink and toilet.) He pays less than $200/mo for everything- he doesn't help out with utilities. Doesn't help pay for internet. Nothing. So he's got it pretty set considering that's less than $200 for a room, private bathroom, unlimited heat, electricity, water, free internet, etc. He works as a fast food manager. I did the same thing while I worked through college so I know it can support a single person in my area as long as you have decent money management. However, he keeps pushing back when he says he can move out and really hasn't been actively looking for a new apartment. But whatever, maybe he has financial woes I don't know about.

He can be quite messy, leaving dishes in the sink, not keeping his space clean, leaving trash and clutter in our shared spaces. His girlfriend is rude to us and our friends when they are over, has little respect for my boyfriend or his house, will be loud in the middle of the night despite us telling her we have to work early in the morning, and worst of all she is mean to our animals!

Lastly, the most heinous crime. The main bathroom has the only shower. He only uses that to shower, he uses his for all other business. We buy nice, multi-ply toilet paper because we are civilized people. Multiple times I have found our nice, cushiony paper switched out for cheap, bargain single-ply bullshit. 

He recently went away on a 10 day long vacation. It was SO nice having the house to ourselves. He first told us April, then June, and now it's maybe August. He's a nice enough guy, he is still our friend, which makes the situation kind of dicey. He has no lease or anything signed. My boyfriend is too nice of a guy to kick him out without a place to go and hasn't really been too firm with him at all. I fear the roommate realizes this and may be slightly taking advantage of his kindness. What would be the best way to get him out without damaging the friendship?",06Jul2019,1
431,"Not sure if this is the right place to post, but looking for some advice. 

In his defense, he works A LOT. He is a police officer and works days (until 12) and is in charge of drug enforcement so goes back out around 4 at least four days a week. 

We have a one year old child and I feel like a single parent. I sympathize with his work schedule (that he loves and finds fulfillment from) but I don‚Äôt enjoy that he seemingly doesn‚Äôt care that he doesn‚Äôt get to see me or his baby very often. 

He naps on days he works extra (in between shifts) since he gets home around 10 and has to work at 5 the next day. His naps are between 1-3 hours. He‚Äôd sleep longer if I didn‚Äôt force him awake. He naps on days he only works the day shift. He naps on rare days that he has off (even after sleeping in). 

This is our only fight. We constantly argue about his sleep. I thought I reached a compromise when I pulled up articles that long naps are unhealthy and we agreed that he can take a 20-minute power nap every day, but he won‚Äôt wake up after 20 minutes. He just won‚Äôt. 

I get annoyed that his naps affect his sleep at night, he can‚Äôt fall asleep, he ends up falling asleep late, wakes up tired and the cycle continues. He doesn‚Äôt seem to want to make a change. 

I am a teacher so I‚Äôm off in the summer but I would get annoyed when I‚Äôd come home from work and he‚Äôd need to nap and I had to take care of the baby after a long day at work. I don‚Äôt remember the last time I napped. 

His days are basically just working and sleeping. The only time he‚Äôs awake is at night when he should be sleeping but (understandably) can‚Äôt fall asleep right away after work. He doesn‚Äôt get any house work done except on his days off if I ask him to.

If I should stop worrying about his sleep and let him be I‚Äôm willing to try that because I‚Äôm tired of having the same conversation about his sleep but please let me know if you guys have some suggestions.",06Jul2019,7
432,"*TL;DR I was successful now I'm a depressed looser how can I be successful again* 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a very strange life. When I was younger (age 10) I got diagnosed with Asperger's/Autism and everyone thought I would't make it in mainstream school. I was determined to prove them wrong and ended up going to mainstream school and getting straight A\*s at GCSEs, won the judo national championships for under 16's and was one of the school's star pupils. I did so well that the mayor gave me an award for ""outstanding achievement and triumph over adversity"". After that I made it through to one of the UK's best universities to get a 2:1 in mechanical engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time my parent's made loads of money and we ended up moving to a fancy ¬£1,000,000+ mansion. I never really ever worked in my life and from the ages of 16-20 ended up taking in around ¬£70,000 from benefits and my parents' money before I graduated. I joined air cadets and did well, rubbed shoulders with some powerful people, was socially successful and everything looked good for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

When I left uni everything pretty much went down the toilet. My parent's company slowed down and leeching off that wasn't possible anymore. My mental health just collapsed and I got somatic symptom disorder and couldn't really do anything because I was always at the A&amp;E. I failed miserably to get any decent job and when I did get one I lost it because I couldn't focus. I had an arranged marriage to a really cool hot girl (with her own issues) and managed to talk her into being a nurse so she could look after me and she was cool with it and now we're hopefully getting married soon.

&amp;#x200B;

But now I have no idea what to actually do with my life. I've been out of work for two years and I think it might be too late for me to be an engineer now. I've done countless applications but nothing sticks and I feel like it's over for me. Sometimes I really want to kill myself because I'd rather be dead than a looser, but I don't because of my religion. I keep telling my future wife that things will be fine and I will sort my life out but I feel like I'm lying to her because I really feel like it's over. I feel like everything I did before was for nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

What practical steps can I take to make myself better and able to support myself as an adult. How do I start doing something respectable with my life?

*P.S before any MGTOW, Incel or TRP/TFL goes ""oh she's only marrying you for money she'll leave you straight after"". Not true, it's not a legally marriage and we have a team of lawyers making sure she won't be entitled to anything if we split up to make sure she's legit.*",06Jul2019,1

435,"Like I said, I‚Äôm an extreme introvert who hasn‚Äôt exactly socialized beyond friend groups developed during middle school or early high school. I‚Äôve only had one real relationship of which I was sexually harassed and physically abused, I ended that relationship a year and a half ago. I have a very difficult trust relationship with females, and it‚Äôs extremely difficult for me to develop a interest in someone. 

As I said, I‚Äôm developing an interest in someone at work, this is extremely weird for me as I‚Äôve never had a crush in a year and a half and I absolutely suck at talking to people outside of my friend group (I mean it takes me months to actually talk to a new coworker). I have this yearning to talk to this person and try to get to know everything about them but I just can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs like I run into a cloud of smoke that blocks all neural pathways in my brain and chokes me, and to be honest I adore that feeling as I haven‚Äôt had it in years. 

However, a good friend of mine who also works at my work is (I think) developing feelings for me. She is noticeably getting *touchy-er* and is trying to hang out with me as much as possible. I have no sexual interest in this person and they should know this. The dilemma arises when she is constantly *bugging* me at work in front of my crush, so, I do not want my crush to assume that there is something between us but I literally have the hardest time talking to my crush. I also do not want to immediately assume that my friend is coming onto me, but I am not comfortable with her behavior, I just want to avoid being a complete dick to her. 

My family visited during the early part of 2019 and I had an incredible conversation about relationships with my Aunt. And to be clear, my family doesn‚Äôt know anything about the harassment and abuse I went through, I deal with pain through my entire life by myself. That conversation taught me that when I‚Äôm ready for a relationship, I will find the person. So, for the better part of 2019 I have been working on bettering myself, my health (mental and physical), my academics, and my career. I have developed an understating that whatever problems I have I do not need to believe it can be solved by a relationship. I can safely say that I‚Äôm ready, but relationships are still hard.",06Jul2019,1

442,"Let me give some context. I (22 F) live with my dad(46 M) , my younger brother (20 M) and my dads GF (40 F). Up until recently we all had at least one cat apiece, with me having two(I'm going to list them by the initials, T was my dads , H was his Gfs , M was my brothers and J and C were mine) .  Of the five cats that we had, three of them were indoor/outdoor cats basically coming and going ( T, H, and J) and the other two were mostly indoor( M and C). 

A month and a half ago a really big storm hit my town and T , H , and M were outside when it hit. theyve been missing since then and ive been trying to look for them and find them. I've joined local lost pet groups on facebook , visited some of the local animal shelters and have been double checking with neighbors by going around passing out missing flyers. 

But I recently have been feeling like the rest of the house hasn't been as on top of this as I have. I was the one who finally started looking for the cats after they had been go for a week. I was the one who created the missing posters to pass out and the one who started posting online to let people know they were missing. But I don't feel like I'm getting the same level of effort from everyone else. I feel like I have to constantly prompt them or tell them to go talk to neighbors or post flyers or I have to constantly tell which shelters to check or what every single detail about what they should be doing. 

To give them the benefit of doubt , when they have helped, theyve helped a lot, my dad printed the posters at his work and my brother would help me walk the neighborhood to talk to neighbors and post the signs. Plus everyone in the house has different work schedules (dad works 8-5 plus some weekends, brother just started a new job with a really erratic schedule , gf works 5-5 most day, and I also have an erratic schedule) so sometimes everyone is just too exhausted to do anything let alone go out in the heat and look for a couple of cats.

However they didn't do either of those things until prompted and on multiple occasions when they've had plenty of time to go out and do more they haven't. 

I'm at the point where I just want to give up and say , this isnt my responsibility to find your guys cats. Mine are all here and I shouldnt be the one doing the most work here. But, I also know that because of my erratic schedule I tend to have more time to look for the cats then rest of my family does. 

Tldr; my family's cats are missing. I started the search to find them but i have been frustrated that it seems like I'm doing more work than everyone else. Am I? Or am I overreacting? Either way what should I do?",06Jul2019,1

Recently, after a pretty crappy breakup with my ex (find my post in r/offmychest for details), I've been trying to improve my mental health.

She wants space and I have to respect that, but the time between seeing professionals is dragging me back. I'm finding that I'm craving the help, but all I'm doing is screwing myself over by trying to reach out to her.

I've lost passion for my specialism. I'm 2 years into a graphic design degree but my heart isn't in it anymore. I've been burnt out for the past 8 months and attend University away from home.

I attended counselling for this, where I was asked what I'd do if I wasn't studying graphic design. Ultimately, I have no idea. I don't think any other career path would fulfil me. I spoke of taking a hear away from my studies however for several reasons decided this wasn't an option for me, nor would I want to do it.

Essentially, both the counsellor and my father (who I spoke to today) think I should stick in just to say I graduated. They think it will be better once I'm in employment, and maybe they're right.

For now, I'm lost. In the immediate future (next 2 years), I'll be studying just to reach graduation. And then what? I have to compete for a job in an industry my heart doesn't long for.

After we started searching for 2 other roommates though, we were only able to find to other guys who my roommate (also F) sorta know who were willing to move in. 

We moved in and signed the lease at the beginning of the summer and it was me, the two guys, and a subletter. Everything was going pretty fine, however I didn‚Äôt prefer the place (it was very messy and dirty when we got there) and I slowly started realizing that I would prefer living on my own or with people I knew well. 

A little less than a week ago I was studying in my room and I heard screaming, and when I tuned in I realized that my roommate and his girlfriend (who‚Äôs over like 24/7) were fighting. Not gonna go into too much detail, but after going downstairs and talking to my roommate I made the executive decision to call the police because the things she was yelling were terrifying and I didn‚Äôt want to risk anything. Lots of police came and were there for a while, but they ended up making her leave and let him stay. I was still scared of him/being there, so I went to stay at a friends for the night.

After all of this, I obviously didn‚Äôt want to return so I‚Äôve been staying with friends ever since. I‚Äôve been reluctant to make a decision because I don‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm overreacting, but I for sure don‚Äôt want to be there for the rest of the summer and want to move out tbh. 

Other things are that: he may be moving out after the summer, but I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs moving in, and my other roommate is still subletting until next year, so I also don‚Äôt know who I‚Äôd be living with in general, which freaks me out.

I already signed the lease, so my question is, am I justified in moving out to another place/subletting somewhere else for the rest of the year? My landlord said I can‚Äôt terminate the lease, so I would have to find someone to take over my lease or sublet. Just looking for thoughts because I want to move out but also really don‚Äôt know what to do and don‚Äôt want to abandon my roommates/put anyone else in danger.",06Jul2019,1

I reworded the example to not plagiarize. She read this and said ""This isn't following the format. Why is it so hard for you to read the sample. Read the sample."" I was pretty pissed off that she talked to me that way, but I wasn't taught how to stand up for myself, so I didn't know what to do about it.   


I could tell her ""I'm always polite and respectful to you, so please don't talk to me like that."" But what if she just keeps doing it? The school doesn't have a rule that says teachers can't be rude, so I can't report her. I would just risk embarrassing myself by engaging her and losing.

468,"This might seem like a weird question, but I would like a serious answer. I am 13 years old and I'm ""different from my friends"". Sometimes I will see something, and could instantly start a conversation about whatever I looked at, and my mind will wander constantly. If my friends don't know what to do, I can spit out an idea in under a minute. Sometimes I feel very anxious, and other times like a complete extrovert. If I'm watching a movie or TV, I cannot sit still and get reminded to try to stop talking about the movie and just watch it. My friends are very supportive (despite all being teenage boys lol) and understand I try not to do all this. Yesterday I was playing CoD with my boyfriend and I started talking about the game in a good and controlled voice. Pretty soon, I was rambling about it in a hushed voice, but I didn't even realize. My BF sometimes has to remind me to quiet down and just chill out. He is very supportive and doesn't seem to be bothered by my ""issue"" at all. Sometimes I just wonder if this is considered normal or not. Here is a list of things that seem to be ""not normal"" (according to Google lol).

1) I tend to change personalities every now and then. Not extreme changes but I can go from shy to extroverted in a few minutes.

2) I will take dares that the rest of my friends won't do. Things that are considered risky or nasty I can usually do without much of a problem and enjoy making my friends laugh at that.

3) Anger and social withdrawal. Usually I will get really pissed at something, but try my hardest to not to lash out. After a day at school, I will do something to spill out all my anger without anyone seeing. I have hurt a few people by punching them or hurting them in other ways and after a moment I realize that what i did was wrong.

4) Trouble thinking clearly most of the time and never really pay attention in school. I have good grades, but not grades on my behavior. I can actually be very funny and almost always get on the teachers good side because I'm a cool person once you get to know me.

Again, this might sound like a dumb thing to ask, and you might need more details, but I would really like to know if this is all normal. (Btw I am biologically female, although mentally I am definitely male.)",06Jul2019,1

Last friday and saturday (28th/29th of June) I had a final semester test I had to study for, which made up about 1/3 of my final grade. On the 24th and 25th (Monday and Tuesday), I stayed up until about 1 am (I usually go to sleep at 9pm or 10pm and wake up at 5am) to study. On Wednesday (26th), Thursday (27th)  and Friday (28th) I tried going to bed earlier (at about 8:30 pm) in order to relax a bit for the exam, but was not able to sleep well.

Despite my classes being over since last week (29th) and me having nothing to do in the meantime, I still haven't been able to get some propersleep since June 24th.

I'm not sure how many daily hours of sleep I've gotten recently. I feel constantly tired and numb; I have lost my will to exercise, eat or simply do anything; my skin started to break out; I now have really, _really_ dark circles; and my eyes (I'm not sure how to describe what I feel) hurt if I close them. 

I have attempted lots of things in order to get some better sleep: exercising half an hour before sleeping; sleeping in another room and another mattress; sleeping with more blankets and pillows; having some tea (passionfruit and chamomile); taking a hot shower; spending the entire day w/o using my phone, laptop and tv; trying the 4/7/8 technique; et cetera.

Now, JGEC being a government college is easy on the money where as if I go to HITK I'll surely have to depend on loans. 

But I cannot decide which college I should choose. HITK is situated in Kolkata a metropolitan city, it's a more rushed life with more opportunities in proffesional and social life and my girlfriend lives there. We have been in a committed relationship for 4 years and it's going strong, I do not want to risk that, which will definitely happen if I go to JGEC which is 600km away from Kolkata.

Both the colleges have similar faculties but JGEC is a government college which makes it's placements better, also the govt tag is a big thing.

Truthfully I do not care about the placements as I'm determined to go for Gate (A competition exam for M.Tech.) and a masters degree. The primary concern about studying in the private college is the fee which is considerably higher than a govt college and putting that pressure on my parents seems morally evil. 

But my relationship is a high priority in my life and I do not want to loose a girl so mature and understanding in a world almost deviod of true feelings. I want to lead a hard-working productive life but want my relationship to survive. I just can't understand what decision I should take. 

If I choose JGEC and my relationship breaks and I don't have my peace of my mind, it'll be a huge regret but then again giving my parents the financial trouble, it's a freaking chaos in my mind. Can someone please help, please. Advices, personal incidents, every insight is welcome.",06Jul2019,1
477,Hey! I wanted your opinion on a situation. I like a guy that I dated a few years back. 3 months ago I told him I still like him while we were watching a movie and while cuddling and he told me that he isn't looking now for a relationship.

Again recently we watched a movie at his house and we were cuddling but without him making any move to kiss me. Next day I messaged him to arrange to go to the beach and he told me he isn't sure if he will be able to make it due to him having a lot of projects to do. I wonder why cuddle with me if he doesn't have any intention to date me. He hasn't even kissed me all these months. Any idea what could be going on? Tysm!,06Jul2019,3

483,"Hi, it's a long story, but I really need help.

I'm currently 15, and I'm korean, but I was born and raised in China and have been attending international schools my entire life (AKA all curriculums are American-based and taught in English). Nationality is 100% korean.

I promise this is not a sob story, I'm asking for advice as to what to do, but I need to provide a lot of context because its kind of a special case. 

Basically, I don't have any memories between the ages of 5-8, but according to my sister (who is 21), it all started when i was 5. My dad is an alcoholic+physically and mentally abusive, my mother is also physically and mentally abusive, but not an alcoholic. They used to fight A LOT, and when i say fight i mean blood, glass shattering, shrieking, etc. I've called the police 4 times (as far as i can remember) in my life, let's just say, it's been crap. 

My mom doesn't beat me, but she does hit me from time to time (not sandal thwacks, she hits my head and scratches \[it bleeds+bruises\]) and she's emotionally abusive in the sense that a. she didn't let me leave her side for a while by guilt tripping, once actually refusing to give me my passport, b. she constantly called me worthless, undeserving of education, told me she wished i'd never been born, told me i was a piece of shit, etc, and now continues to deny she ever did. This is a general sum up, there's a lot more. My point is: I'm not here because mY mOm wOnT leT mE hAnG oUT wIth mY gIrLfRiENdS.

My dad, as mentioned before, is an alcoholic, and my sister and I both agree that he is VERY bipolar (he cannot control himself when he's angry, he goes BALLISTIC), he's a narcissist, constantly tells me I'm never thankful enough for all that he's done for me and that we're shit daughters, tries to excuse his behavior with everything good he did for us (keep in mind i always thank him for everything he does. EVERYTHING. I always search for less economically taxing options, and never ask for things that i don't need. I also never tell people i had a terrible childhood, because i know and remember how much i was loved when i was tiny), and years of sitting in front of the landline from 9PM-2AM crying and begging my dad to answer and come home screwed me over quite a bit, and yeah... It's a lot. He thinks beating the crap out of my mom and my sister to the point where i had to call the police was excusable. 

Tl;dr, its been crappy.

So this March I reached my max and quit school to visit my sister (she lives in a diff country) to escape from both of them for a while after my dad told me ""then lets just fucking kill ourselves"" after i told him i was feeling suicidal and wanted psychiatric help. I ended up more depressed (i was diagnosed about a year ago) because of the sheer isolation so I returned (May), but decided i couldn't fit into the school environment, so I compromised with dad and we decided online schooling would be the best.

My dad always made it clear he was unwilling to fund anything after secondary education, so I knew from the start scholarships were my only option. So i worked/am willing to work HARD.

And trust me, kowtowing to my dad and mom after everything was HARD, but i accepted my fate as a 15-year old underage kid from a country where the general culture is ""adults are always right"", so i was going to suck it up for a few more years until i could get into college. See, that was under the assumption that the verbal/emotional abuse continues, but I don't feel physically threatened, because though i had been hit before, i had never been beaten--not to the severity that my mom and sister experienced.

All of that changed a while ago when I was arguing with my father in a cafe, and he went BALLISTIC after i tried to leave mid-fight because he was making me uncomfortable and it wasn't going anywhere. I packed my bags, tried to leave, and he started yelling at me (actually yelling), then I was so terrified that I began running. He chased after me bellowing ""YOU DARE RUN?"" down a few streets but i hid in a car in a small alleyway, and he gave up trying to search for me.

Before anyone says ""just talk it out"": I felt physically threatened. I thought he was going to kill me. He almost did, in the case of my mother and sister. And this is the exact lane my sister walked down: small verbal fights, escalating into arguments, into slamming of tables/objects to intimidate, to chasing. and whenever she was caught, it got bloody. I am not willing to go through that.

Before anyone says ""live with your sister"": I, along with my mother and father, agree that my mental age is older than hers. We're too different, and she, as a hurt, young child, also said and did things to me that I cannot get over to this day. We're on talking terms, but I still flinch when she's too close, and I'm also scared of her. I tried that in the few months i spent with her (after escaping my parents), and it didn't work out.

Before anyone says ""no matter what, they're still your parents"": i fully acknowledge that. I dont intend on completely cutting contact and never helping them when they are in need. I know they're not crappy people deep down, and I love them in a sense, but I cannot take this. I'm scared of my thoughts, of what i do to myself, of what i could do to myself, and i know that if i continue to suck it up, im going to end up doing things that terrify me. I just need to get out of here.

A little more information: I'm korean, but i know nothing of korean culture, and the language i'm most comfortable with is english. My parents split a few months ago, my legal guardian is my father. The mental effects have been taxing at the least. I've been diagnosed with depression, and i have insomnia. I SUSPECT social anxiety, dissociative amnesia (no memory between 5-8), binge-eating, BPD. Not confirmed because call for helps were ignored.

Now, if you got to this point.. thank you so much for caring. I really need advice on what i can do next. I cant stay here (korea). No relatives, no friends. Child protection services are bs here. One of my friends in the states told me I could go to the US and contact a government organization for a state attorney and see if i can be placed in a foster home/be adopted, even if I'm not an american citizen. Is that true? Is there anything else i can do?

I've tried talking, forgiving, understanding, and i understand the POV of any parents out there telling me to just try to be more understanding, but I can't bear constantly living in fear of my own safety.

496,"I live in a 3 bedroom apartment with a couple(m29/f29) in one room and a married guy(whose wife is in another country) in the other. I started renting out the apartment with the couple and we later rented out the third room to the married guy so we could afford the rent.

I recently came back from a trip in San Francisco where I attended the Pride Day Parade. One of my souvenirs was a rainbow pride flag. I decided to hang it on my door on the outside. After I came back, the female of the couple sent me text saying ‚Äú[she‚Äôd] like it if i removed the flag and put it facing the inside because visually it didn‚Äôt make the house look nice. sorry for anything and thank you.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt think the flag was a big deal because they‚Äôve known since day 1 that i‚Äôm not straight and we‚Äôve lived together for 10 months now. I had a horrible feeling in my gut when I read the text. I don‚Äôt know if I should be offended or not. I just don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs fair for them to ask me to remove the flag off of my bedroom door. They placed a cross on the front door of the apartment because that‚Äôs their beliefs but not mine. However, I never really minded and have tolerated it.

Should I tell them I‚Äôm not going to remove the flag and ask them to tolerate it or is it okay for them to dictate how I decorate my door, even if it‚Äôs just a flag?",06Jul2019,3

501,"So I'm posting on here hoping someone out there could guide me or give me advice because I feel lost and my life is falling apart and i don't know what to do.

I've been feeling depressed for a few years, I use to work a third shift job that was very isolating and I lived with my family. I had no friends, no social life and my family was very controlling and clingy. I felt very unhappy and wanted to give up. During that low point my job liquidated my position and told me and the rest of the crew they would have to move to a new location or find other jobs. I couldn't move to the new location due to how far it was and I've had difficulty finding a new job so I asked them if there was anyway I could work the day shifts there. They were really on the fence about it because the work was different from what I did and the job was way more social than my shift but I really pushed and because how long I've been there they gave me a chance. I did the job very well and really grew into my position but I was still socially awkward and couldn't handle being around people well and I felt like I was weird or a creep, I felt like I didnt belong but as the rest of that year went by some people started talking to me and i opened up a bit more and became more outgoing. While things at work started getting a bit better my life at home was starting to spiral. My moms health wasn't too good, she has arthritis and has multiple problems that doctors can't seem to identify. She lost her job and now lives on disability checks. My sister works check to check at a factory job she hates and constantly comes home angry from the people she deals with. We would get into fights about me not making a lot and how I don't help out around the apartment, she'd lose her mind whenever she saw me get a package in the mail saying ""oh you can buy yourself stuff but not pay more on rent."" I wouldn't be able to handle it so I'd go outside for walks and come back with my mom down my thought being worried where I was and what I was doing. The holidays became the most stressful of times and I couldn't take it anymore so I decided I'd have to get out. I started working nonstop doubles wearing myself down so I could save up to move out but I still couldn't live on my own. I need at least a roommate to make it but I had no friends and didn't want to put some ad and get someone I didn't know living with me. I decided I'll ask some coworkers if they'd be interested in living with me, I felt better about that cause at least I saw them on a daily basis and knew they'd be someone trustworthy since we work together.

I Eventually found someone at work that I remembered was looking for a roommate at the time. She's a really cool person. Very chill the only problem was she was a girl and I was a guy so I didn't think she'd want to live with me cause it'd be weird so I moved on but then she got back to me and we both agreed to move in at the beginning of next year. We started off the year pretty rocky and because I was still socially awkward and didn't fully know basic social interactions I think I creeped her out which I didn't mean to. I felt like because of that she didn't like me and tried to avoid me and It was something that effected me cause I felt like I was a creep and an awful person. I tried to keep to myself so to not make things worse but then some guy at work she likes started ignoring her (which is not something he does, he always talking to her) she went and blamed me for it, telling people that I was uncomfortable with the guy that I must of said something to him. A work friend told me this and I told them that I dont care about what she does or who she hangs out with and I just want to avoid the whole thing. Eventually she found out he was being an asshole to everyone and was having some kind of off week or something but even finding that out she never apologized for accusing me of something like that, but I was just glad it was over. I've tried throughout the weeks to fix things or at least try to make things normal but probably made things worse, she would avoid me more or not acknowledge me. She started blocking me on social media and complaining about the things I do to people at work like ask for rides and stuff. I felt like she hated me, she's a nice person and it's my fault. It would replay in my head of all the things that I screwed up on and I would try to hide how sad I was getting because of it. I started breaking down one day and some work friends started asking about it and me needing  to let it out I started talking to them about it. Of course this wasn't the best idea cause they were her friends too and my words got twisted and found it's way back to her. The next morning we had a discussion about everything. She told me about all the stuff that bothered her and how she didn't hate me but didn't appreciate my actions, I tried to tell her how I've been feeling and how everything was just a misunderstanding but my anxiety ruined my ability to back up my side of the conversation. After that she left for work and I messaged her an apology and she responded saying she hopes we have an understanding and for it to not happen again if we are to keep moving forward. Since then it's been awkward all the time, I never how to talk to her or even be at work when we have shifts together. Occasionally she talks to me about work or we watch TV and I think things might be fine but it goes back to avoidance and awkwardness again. I'm trying to avoid her as much as I can because I can't afford to be out of a roommate.

Meanwhile I'm just trying to make friends but I can't even hang out with people because everytime I ask someone they want to hang out it's a ""maybe another time"" or a sure but then a last minute cancelation. I had people from work invite me and then cancel, maybe they felt bad but then realize itd be awkward. My 2nd sister only hangs out with me cause she feels bad I'm alone. Id buy stuff for people like I'd bring cupcakes to work in hopes they'd like me enough to be friends even tho I can't afford it. Which leads to the issue of me wanting more money but I'm afraid of starting over at a new job were no one knows me, I'm afraid of falling back into that antisocial hole I was in. Even tho the people I work with don't hang out with me, they still at least talk to me and I think like me, that's honestly the only positive I have going for me, but with money stress, roommate problems and being isolated, I'm starting to fall back into that depression. I'm unhappy and feel like some loser creep who no one gives a care for. I'm trying to talk to my mom about stuff to ease my mind and because I feel like she's the only one I can talk too at this point, but I'm noticing she's been forgetting things and she repeats herself a lot. It's something my grandmother did before eventually being diagnosed with alzheimers. My grandma's passing was one of the hardest things to experience in my life and it hurts so much to even think my mom could be eventually going through what she did. I feel like I'm in the middle of the ocean drowning and I have no one to help.

I'm sorry for this long post I just don't know what to do anymore.",06Jul2019,2
502,"I‚Äôm starting this out by saying I specifically chose this sub to ask for advice on this. Idc if you think I‚Äôm petty, an asshole or whatever. I just want to know if and how this would be possible. 

I currently owe a family member a small-ish amount of money ($800) from poor choices made in my youth. Now this family member has decided it‚Äôs my fault his life is shit, he still lives with his mom and has a car from the 90s. He‚Äôs also decided to convince multiple other family members that this is all my fault. 

But he chose to work for minimum wage at a grocery store from the age of 19 until he was forced to quit due to it closing last year. He has a college degree in a subject that he could easily get a job with in our city if he tried. 

However, I‚Äôve been working full time since I was 17, worked multiple jobs, went to college and now have a career position in a very respectable company. I don‚Äôt have a car, I use public transit, and I live with my partner in a shitty apartment that had a $200 security deposit. If I didn‚Äôt live with my partner, I‚Äôd be back at home as well cuz even tho my job is good, it‚Äôs 2019 and it costs too much to live. 

I want to make a point that $800 wouldn‚Äôt fix his life and it isn‚Äôt my fault he isn‚Äôt happy. The car has really been the point of contention from the family members that have now taken it upon themselves to berate me for this.

Didn‚Äôt want to hound her but she said I overreacted just cause I brought up my feelings but I just knew something was up l. Felt it in my gut.

Being a priority for someone felt amazing, as if, it doesn't matter how much fun they have with other people, you're still ""number 1"" for them.

I'm pretty sure my girlfriend and family would see me that way, but since I'm away from them, makes me feel that, that one friend I got, should be the one that makes me ""the closest one to her"". 

I've never really had a good friend in my lifetime, and she's the closest one to that, I believe.

I know I shouldn't be expecting anyone to make me their priority, but I just can't help it. 

Not having anyone that priorities me, just feels, lonely. 

And it has been bothering me for the last couple of weeks.

513,"I‚Äôve been in my apartment for 10 years, and my boyfriend moved in 2 years ago. It‚Äôs pretty large 1200 sf, but had no yard or dishwasher, washer dryer or even window screens. I live in the Bay Area, so even though the rent is high, it‚Äôs below market value. I have awesome landlords. I‚Äôve done a ton of upgrades over the last few years, including appliances, paint, flooring, bathroom tile, kitchen faucet, ceiling fan installation. When my boyfriend moved in, we designed a custom elfa walk in closet for the two of us. We also have a huge kitchen, a huge living room, and a sun room/ workout area/ guest bed. We have a one year old dog who gets a ton of walks and a daily trail run with one or both of us. 

So that‚Äôs the current situation. We love it. We had talked about staying out for a few more years to save money to move out of the Bay Area in search of more affordable living/ buying a home. 

But now, my neighbor across the street (nice woman- know her casually from walking our dog) asked us if we want to move in to a second home she owns (also across the street from us).  Her tenant of five years just relocated and the house is up for grabs. 
It‚Äôs $600 more than we are paying now. This is actually affordable, and frankly still below market value for our area. The house is an actual house (our current apartment shares walls with four other units), huge fenced yard perfect for our dog, washer dryer, dishwasher, big patio in the yard, off the street by a good 20 yards, screens on all windows and doors, off street parking, not as much street traffic noise. Landlord said she‚Äôd love to have me living there, and will buy any plants I want to grow in the yard. I would probably landscape the shit out of it! I‚Äôve always wanted a garden but haven‚Äôt had one in over ten years. She is flexible on the move in date, to allow us time to give notice at our current place. Basically she is set on having us live there and willing to be flexible because she‚Äôd rather live close to someone she already knows and likes.
Downsides are that the house is a good 400 sf smaller than our house, with smaller rooms/ not much storage.
Should we move? If we do move, it will eat into our ability to save for a big future move. We probably wouldn‚Äôt want to move again for at least four years. I don‚Äôt want to feel trapped if we make the move and then hate the place or feel like it‚Äôs too small. But I think the incredible outdoor space will make up for it. And our dog would be so happy to have a yard. 
My boyfriend would be fine either way, but is leaning toward wanting to stay put. I want to move. We have to decide in the next day or so. Decisions like this are really hard to make! Moving is a ton of work. We both have good jobs here and don‚Äôt have to move. I don‚Äôt want to waste my money on a move that might not work out for us in the long term. Plus, working to improve a rental unit‚Äôs garden won‚Äôt leave me with any long term equity- I‚Äôll just get to enjoy the garden until it‚Äôs time to move on. So many pros and cons.

We got drunk and it just kinda happened. After we had sex the first time, we figured why not do it again, so then we fucked on a table.

We fucked for hours, and I‚Äôm not going to lie it was really fucking good. But this time there was someone in the guest room and on the landing, so I‚Äôm afraid they heard. Idk. I‚Äôm like really bugging out. 

I‚Äôve considered rolling up bills and leaving a coke tray out so that my family will find it and assume we were just doing coke instead of fucking. Or maybe even weed but like I wouldn‚Äôt be afraid of them finding weed. Cocaine is a different story. I def hide it from my family. 

And lastly, my little cousin gets drunk and grabs my ass and I‚Äôm afraid people will start to notice. I don‚Äôt know how to talk to him about this issue, because we just don‚Äôt talk about it. And like, he kissed me during sex which was even weirder. We also don‚Äôt use condoms and I‚Äôm not on birth control so now I have to ask if he came inside of me.

Today, he messa me and told me that he needs help, as in he needs weed. So I told him I'm not selling anymore, which is true for everybody, but friends.

542,"Hi guys. 

I‚Äôm currently a mental mess now. I come from a very conservative family (Muslim) and I don‚Äôt really follow or believe my parents ideologies. I‚Äôm a 21 y.o girl, recently graduated about to take my boards and then began job hunting.. 

A little background... I am in a relationship (1y6m) with the most amazing guy. In my religion that‚Äôs a huge NO NO.. it‚Äôs marriage and nothing before that. The girl stays home with her family up until marriage. Living alone as a girl isn‚Äôt a option. I disagree with this and my beliefs are far away from those my family believe and frankly I haven‚Äôt been following any of these values. It‚Äôs all behind their back though. They sort of sense I‚Äôm not following their values because I am never home. Today they told me ‚Äúgood Muslim girls don‚Äôt stay out late everyday.‚Äù I do stay out pretty late almost every night because I don‚Äôt like going home. Only reason I actually end up sleeping at home is because my mom goes off and thinks I‚Äôm selling my body to guys during the night (complete BS). 

My problem is I want to marry and just be with the guy I love. I‚Äôm in love with him. I can‚Äôt really introduce him to my family because they will go off saying ‚Äúhow could you have met this guy for a year and a half and not tell us?!‚Äù On the other hand if I introduce him as someone I just met they will say ‚Äúwell we don‚Äôt know him, forget about it, we will find you a good guy to marry.‚Äù 

I live 20 mins away from my bf and my parents sort of sense I‚Äôm not doing what they think is right (hanging around bad people blah blah blah) so they decided they want to move about an hour away. I can‚Äôt do that. I can‚Äôt move out randomly and be away from the person that basically helped me through all the shit my parents put me through. I feel like I have NO CONTROL over my life and decisions. And it all comes down to culture/religion. 

I have the option of taking my boards, finding a job and staying here. But that also leaves me with the problem of marrying my boyfriend. My parents won‚Äôt approve of someone they don‚Äôt know. He‚Äôs also not as strict &amp; religious as my family which they will not admire at all. 

I‚Äôm so confused and lost. I wish I came from a more understanding family that would listen to me and put aside these beliefs. I want to ‚Äúplease‚Äù my family but I also want to stay in the area and live my life with the guy I love. It‚Äôs really hard on me.

547,"So let me just say that my friend means a great deal to me.  Every-time I‚Äôm with her I‚Äôm happy.   It that she makes me happy,  it she‚Äôs one of the few people that I‚Äôm a completely different person with.  

We‚Äôve known each other for over 2 years and I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I continue have dreams about her even when I‚Äôm dating other people. Her laugh makes me smile and giggle, and then we both keep giggling.  I would never say I love her because that‚Äôs shortsighted, and I think love requires two people to feel the same thing, but I really like her.

So for example, the other day she cooked me dinner,  After I told her I missed her and we ate dinner in her bedroom for reasons.  It was a great time, but I wanted to grab her and hold her and kiss her.  But I never have.  Then we went out and walked together for an hour with plans to do something the next day.  I know standard friendship standards are out the window because she‚Äôs polyamorous but I just feel. So much when I‚Äôm with her.  I simply don‚Äôt know how to tell her that I‚Äôm attracted to her because I feel it might be a betrayal.  I‚Äôm helping her with something and I don‚Äôt want her to feel that my help is dependent on sexual reciprocation.  She had apologized for being busy and not paying attention to me.  I realize we‚Äôre both adults with full-time jobs + other commitments and this isn‚Äôt‚Äô high school/college.  I never feel slighted cause I can hardly keep track of what I‚Äôm doing.

We have a day or plans together but I always feel ( but don‚Äôt know) that I‚Äôm disappointing her. But I don‚Äôt want to weird her out. I‚Äôve already gone through the stages of reading crap into what she says.  She called her partners bro and dude so I can‚Äôt complain about being friend-zoned.  Let me just say I don‚Äôt care about being friend-zoned, I just happen to have feeling for her.  She makes me feel,and act like few people have.

 TL;DR:  I don‚Äôt know wha to ask or how to phrase it.  I feel paralyzed. My friend means so much to me and has changed  me as a person, I know I‚Äôd feel s huge loss if she were gone.

563,"This might be a dumb post but I guess I‚Äôm kind of stuck. For the past 5 years I‚Äôve had crippling depression. It was the worst it had ever been in 2018. I couldn‚Äôt keep a job, went to rehab to try and get better even tho I don‚Äôt have a drug problem. But I did smoke weed a lot as a way of comforting myself.

Now I‚Äôm finally getting back on my feet. I have a part time job, I‚Äôm taking classes for pre-reqs to a graduate program. And I‚Äôm doing worlds better mentally. But I‚Äôm still smoking weed a lot and it‚Äôs enabling my laziness. On my time off I would prefer to smoke and hang on the couch than push myself to do an outside activity. For example, it‚Äôs almost noon on a Saturday and I would rather put a movie on, lay on my couch and get high all day than find someone to do something with, go to the gym, etc. My therapist said this is fine because I‚Äôm doing so much more than I used to be, I‚Äôm just adjusting. But I still feel like a lazy POS and am wondering if I should quit smoking weed as a way to progress? 

Feel like this matters for context so I‚Äôll put it out there: I‚Äôm really overweight. I should be more active and need to lose weight. I was super healthy and fit all my life but the last 3 years I gained over 100 pounds. A lot of this was due to my depression, but I‚Äôm positive smoking weed contributed as well.",06Jul2019,1
564,"Hi all, sorry if this is long! Long story short, 2 years ago I moved halfway across the country by myself on a whim (after a break up) and I really enjoyed it. I was out there by myself so it forced me to make friends and do things alone and it really helped with my confidence overall. Right before I moved I reconnected with previously mentioned break up, and within my first year of living away, I decided to move home to live with my ex and then current boyfriend. 

Things were rocky for a while because I feel like I had very high expectations that were not being met, I was being impatient and neither of us were communicating correctly. We stayed together for another year and a half doing well most the time but I think we hit a point where we were in a bad spot and both of us gave up, so we ended up breaking up again 6 months ago. We (of course) reconnected again about 2 months ago and have been doing really well (not officially dating yet). One of the main reasons we broke up this time was because I want to be married and have kids and he was second guessing his decision, but since has changed his mind. We‚Äôve gone to counseling because I was skeptical and our counselor said it takes a long time to turn a boy into a man, and since he‚Äôs come back around I‚Äôve noticed a huge difference in his behavior and I really would like to see things out with him.

My biggest reason for making the move back across the country was for school. The schools in my new state are a bit cheaper so it would‚Äôve made things easier for me since in my home state I have to work a bunch of jobs in order to afford my living (rent, groceries, bills) AND pay for school. Then because of that I had very little free time. Just recently my father (who I have also recently reconnected with) INSISTS on me staying with him and only paying the difference in utilities. This obviously would give me way more time to focus on school without having to work 24/7 to afford everything. It also keeps me closer to family and friend and is easier with my dog.

I love my new state but I feel like I was rushed/pushed to this decision by my mother who picked these dates because July 3-8 was when she had off and was available to make the drive with me. In hindsight I definitely should‚Äôve stuck up for myself and said I wasn‚Äôt ready but it‚Äôs too late now. I‚Äôve since gotten into a HUGE argument with her AND my uncle (in all honesty, not trying to be funny or snide, I think there is some sort of mental illness going on with them) and so I‚Äôve stayed with my ex boyfriend for the past day in our previous home shared together but he‚Äôs currently moving into a new place and needs to be out of here by tomorrow.

I now have an apartment, a job and a ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô in my new state and I feel bad if I bail. I‚Äôm really torn on what to do and I don‚Äôt know who to turn to for an unbiased opinion. I‚Äôm having trouble making a decision and am feeling totally overwhelmed. I don‚Äôt know which is the better option and I‚Äôm also slightly afraid I‚Äôm putting too much emotion into all of it.",06Jul2019,1
566,"I was shocked that my 16 year old brother has a gf, while a 26 year old like me is still struggling. 

Don't get me wrong I love him, but he's one of the laziest person I've ever seen. He spends the whole day enjoying the only hobby which is video games. He barely helps around the house. And everytime I ask him questions, he always says ""I dont know"". He's scared of ghosts so he's been sleeping in mom's bed for years. 

All of those made me question my selfworth. Even my brother can get girls, then I might be a less valuable person than him.

My parents and family members praise my brother for being handsome and having a pretty gf. They never made fun of me, but I feel like inside they're judging me. It hurts and it feels like sh!t.

I'm graduating in Engineering next year, but man every time I think about that, I feel like giving up on my education. I tried making friends in school, but it seems like all the college folks just want to keep to themselves. The word ""friends"" just stay as long as we're in the same class.

567," First time poster of literally anything but I need advice. Sorry if I'm not doing this right tho. Also, trigger warning? Idk if i'm supposed to put that but anyways,

Somebody close to me has threatened to hurt themselves and me multiple times in the past two days. She's on a bender and been trying to start a fight with me for the past week but the suicide talk has just been the past couple of days, even though my sister said she always says that, for me it's just been the past couple of days. I'm not worried that she's going to hurt me but more so herself. I can't remember the last time I saw her this bad and everything in me is saying to baker act /51-50 her but she's on drugs. She's been taking suboxone which is for people coming off of opiates for the past 5 years. I guess i'm just worried that if I baker act her that they wont give her the suboxone and she's going to have to detox. While that's not the worst thing in the world, I'm also not trying to force her to detox. I just want her to not kill herself. Like, what if she did and then I didn't do anything. Also, idk what she's on right now and what if when the police come they find something. I don't want her to go to jail. I just want her to be somewhere safe until she realizes that she's going to be okay. Plus I think my sister is going to be mad at me which again isn't the worse thing in the world but like, idk.

568,"Hi! I have very bad social anxiety. I'm working on it currently, but I need advice for what to do in the meantime about practicing my instruments. I am a college student who usually lives in the dorm with one other roommate, but at the moment it is summer and I am home with my family. I have anxiety around my roommate and I barely talk to her, and regarding my family it is quite similar a situation. I used to be able to play my instruments all the time when my family was out, because sometimes I got home from school before them. This year I haven't been able to play at all. I live in Toms River, New Jersey if that helps with any ideas you guys have. I play piano, harmonica, and ukulele. I just really miss my instruments and I don't know where I can go to be completely alone and just practice. I can't think of anywhere I can just walk around and not see anyone. Plus, I don't really go out by myself as often as I want to... mostly because I get anxious and paranoid. I've thought about going to the local community college (OCC) but I really don't know if I'd be allowed into the empty rooms for that long to play my instruments. They'd probably hear me eventually and I just can't stand the idea of being caught sitting in an empty room (cause summertime) playing my instruments all by myself. I don't have a lot of money as all the money I earn goes to college and food, so I can't rent any spaces.

569,"I am a 25 year old female.  I live in a town about 1.5 hours away from family and friends and live with my partner of 7 years.  For the last 6 months or so, I've become increasingly unhappy with my job due to poor management, petty drama, and inconsistent workload (very slow and boring at times and then stressful and anxiety inducing at other times, depending on the time of year).  My partner and I also recently have decided to break it off and find our independence.  Because I am unhappy at my job and now going through this break up, I thought the best thing for me right now would be to move to a city closer to family and friends.  Without even having an interview or housing lined up, I stupidly told a few people at my work that I was planning on leaving and trusted them to keep it a secret.  I don't have many friends and thought I could confide in these people about the issue I was trying to work out.  I just recently found out they have told many people and this eventually got back to my manager.  She emailed me yesterday asking if this was true and that she would support me in any decision I make.  I did tell her this was true and that I would like to speak with her in person to discuss this a little bit.

I had a couple interviews yesterday and actually got offered a job right after.  I was expecting to feel relieved, but instead I started to panic, because I can't help but think that maybe this will be a big mistake.  When I weigh the pros and cons of both decisions I get this:

Moving- pros: closer to family, maybe better chance at making friends and not being so isolated; cons: less pay, not as good of benefits, don't like the city I would be living in, not quite enjoying what the job entails and i don't feel confident in what i would be doing.

Staying- pros: i like the town i live in, good pay, good benefits, job, i am confident in my skills; cons: not closer to family, could be isolating, unhappy with management at current job.

So, with all that being said, anybody have any insight on what may be the best option for me right now knowing this information?  I don't have many friends I can confide in about this, and I kind of want an unbiased opinion.  I also am feeling incredibly embarrassed about how I went about this whole thing with my current job, now that so many people know that I was planning on leaving, and my boss now knows.  If I decide to stay, how should I go about this situation?  Or how can I get out of my anxious mind and realize this is not the end of the world and people can change their minds?  I just sort of feel like a fool right now....",06Jul2019,1

Eventually, I introduced my online friend to my friends in real life, and they seemed to like her for the most part. Soon after, however, some of them enjoyed gossiping about her and I enjoyed being apart of it. We made fun of her personality and other things; at the same time I felt bad for what I was doing but also thought it was entertaining.

She wants to meet me in real life one day, but I‚Äôm hesitant on it. I feel very insecure, and the main reason why I might‚Äôve opened up to her in the first place is because she‚Äôs online.

I‚Äôve been talking to this one guy. He thinks I‚Äôm funny. Says he gets butterflies talking to me, and calls me pretty. All are things I like hearing, but... that‚Äôs all. Still, I tell him ‚ÄúI love you too‚Äù, even though I feel it‚Äôs way too early to throw around that word, and let  him turn down this other girl he‚Äôs been seeing because he wants to peruse me. 

In my defence, he said he wasn‚Äôt really into her. Said he just liked having someone into him. To which I gotta say.. mood. Still, I feel real damn guilty. 

I feel like an asshole about it, but I mostly keep seeing him because sometimes he gets ‚Äúexcited‚Äù and... it‚Äôs really damn validating getting a guy off.

Then I made this super close friend at university and she's treated me like her boyfriend ever since we met and I find myself doing the same to her whenever I'm drunk (but we've never actually kissed or anything).

Multiple people have joked that we should just fuck already and have teased us about being into each other. Never really thought too much about it, but recently...I've been developing actual feelings for her I think.

I feel super close to her and I miss her like a motherfucker when we're not together. We match in every way except for the sexuality thing, but I almost feel like how much I like her as a person has made me be physically attracted to her as well.

I wouldn't call myself bisexual, but is it possible I'm gay and she's just an exception? One of the problems is that if I did go for it, she/everyone else would think it was weird as fuck for the supposed gay best friend to be coming onto her.

What do I do with my life to make it seem more fulfilling? Consider all the things I have said above. I didn‚Äôt write them for pity, I want help I wanna move forward. That was for you to almost build some sort of picture of what‚Äôs going on.

589,"I moved in with a guy a few years old than me about 8 months ago. He just broke up with his girlfriend, so needed a lodger. We basically pay half everything, so I'd consider us more flatmates. And we're both 20's guys. So should be fairly friendly.

We're both reasonably socially awkward but we've spent hundreds of hours together watching TV, chatting and making jokes. But we never go into personal detail... and in a strange way, it still feels like we're acquaintances than friends. Just by the by of being socially awkward... you never know who your friends really are. 

Anyway, he has been staying in his room for like 3 weeks now. He will take sick days off work. He will come home from work early. And he will just go to bed. Basically the behaviour of a depressed person.

I always make the effort to spend time in the living room, ask him how his day was, ask how he is, and I go out regularly so he has the flat to himself. I'm not convinced I could've done or said anything wrong to make him shy away because we barely talk about anything deep. Never argued. Not even really debated on light subjects. So there's no bad blood.

Just now, he hasn't left his room all day. I just went to my room, and then I hear his bedroom door open. And that happens a fair amount. But it's like he's avoiding everyone, not just me. 

I don't know his friends or family. We're not connected on social media (I don't really use it), so we don't have mutual people to bring this up with. And we're in no way close enough for me to just flat out ask him what his problem is. Don't know what to do. Just let him get on with it?

Hey Reddit, I usually don't do these kinds of posts, but after years of trying I don't know where else to ask.

I live in Scandinavia, I am 21M and my brother is 24M. We're both studying Computer Science and have similar interests (gaming etc). For the last few years I've been trying to connect with him through our mutual interest in tech, among other things. Our family has somewhat of a long history of mental problems, My father is a bit of a workaholic, and although he is good at providing, he barely talks to us and has never been much of a father figure to speak of.  My mother is highly neurotic and has an addictive personality (her dad, also a workaholic, committed suicide before I was born). I think this is important to mention in order to provide some context.

Over the years my brother has grown increasingly resentful of everything and everyone around him. Every conversation with him spirals into some cynic rant, he is unkempt, his face is full of spite, and he spends most his time playing games/watching movies. I am concerned because I know his attitude is gonna leave him miserable in the future (I used to have the same problem). I know he is hurting, and he is showing clear signs of being depressed and nihilistic.

To give you an example, I recently asked him if I could grab some taco after he had made himself dinner (he was done eating and there were leftovers), he got angry when I asked him this because ""he was saving it for later"" and proceeded to insult me instead and told me to make myself some food (there was no more food in the fridge and this was a very minor inconvenience to him). I went down to the grocery store and bought myself some food and did just that. I am also on meds which reduce my appetite a lot. He's aware of this already, and eating enough food was already a challenge for me before I started. Not saying this for sympathy, just to give an idea how much he doesn't care about any of us. 

My brother is fairly well-off (living at home + free college) and has a decent career ahead of him. Despite this, he still insists of spreading this infectious attitude that is making everyone in the family worse. As a family we've gotten a lot better over the years, I've developed a decent relationship with my parents, but any attempt to connect to him feels like a dead-end. My mom wants to kick him out, but she doesn't want to because she knows it would set him back economically.

Last year I bought him an FPS game for his birthday and we played together....once. Every single time I try to talk to him (our conversations usually last less than 30 seconds) he just closes up and isolates himself. I am really at a loss for what to do. Should I confront him and tell him to fix his life? Small things like these don't seem like a big deal, but if this the tolerance level it takes for him to become extremely toxic to the people around him it makes me ask myself if anyone he knows (co-workers, friends, women) will ever want to associate with him in the future. His attitude will be the death of him one day, and I know he will start to hate living itself if it continues. My parents don't view it that way, but I was in that place and I know what it's like. I don't like it when he does these things, but he is still my brother. I can't just do nothing.

596,"I'll start this off my saying my dad is abusive. Physically only to my mother, though. He however has made us all in this house fear for our lives on multiple occasions. It's me, my dad, my mom, and our 3 small dogs. Before anyone says anything, leaving him right now, or calling the cops is just not a viable option at the moment. My mom is disabled from a car crash almost a decade back, and she can't work much, and I can't possibly hold it down, so we've decided, since he's not abusive ALL THE TIME, that it's safer to stay with him until I save up some money and turn 18.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where it gets complicated. I really want to take my mom with me so we can finally be free of him, but she is emotionally neglectful, dismissive, rude, and sometimes even abusive to ME. I am on the autism spectrum and I am part of the LGBTQ+ (This may sound scripted and made up, but it's not), and we argue and fight (not physically most of the time) a lot. She is always telling me that my sexuality and gender identity/expression are gross, sinful, wrong, invalid, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

She also, even though knowing I'm clearly not neurotypical, still is always yelling at me for talking a little too long, or bringing up things that only matter to me a little bit too much. She even threatens that once we're out and I'm providing, that she will still not let me be myself under my own roof with my own money! She's even seriously said that if I were to, let's say, wear a dress or paint my nails after she was dead, she would haunt me. It makes me feel like she hates me, and that I'll never be right in her eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

But then again, I really want her to not have to deal with my dad because as bad as she can be, he's even worse. So, either leave her with a constantly angry, abusive dad who will definitely blame her for my absence, or take her with me, and during the years where I'm supposed to form my own identity and become independent, have to deal with her in my ear all day long every day, and probably hold that stage of my life off so she can screw with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe there's a third option I'm not considering, though, and if anyone has something, please let me know, because I don't really think I could bear leaving her with him, or bear suppressing who I am for possibly a decade longer.",06Jul2019,2

I know that when I have a close friend it adds so much to my life and there‚Äôs a lot of love. I want to share my life and make memories with a close friend or two. 

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with my social skills, my social skills are actually one of my best qualities. I get asked to hang out all the time and people do want to be around me but... I just never feel like hanging out with people I‚Äôm not close to. But, I know that to eventually become close to someone... I need to spend time with them. 

I'm perfectly content with spending time with my boyfriend and family, seeing people at my job and talking to people in my classes. Nothing in me wants to then add a coffee or drinks with a new friend I‚Äôm getting to know. Even so, I want some close girlfriends that I feel super bonded to so much.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  üëî  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‚Äòyou make me sweat, Graham‚Äô and I said ‚Äòwhat?‚Äô then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‚Äòwtf‚Äô she then dropped her arms and walked off.

607,"(Throwaway account before anyone asks)

Yeah, I know this sounds bad. 

So I'm 22 now and never been in a relationship. I am on the autism spectrum to a lesser degree if that's important information. Any relationship I may have ever had never went through for a variety of reasons - usually down to me not taking care of myself and punching well above my weight. For some further context, I went to an all-male high school and I'm now on an Engineering course at a small college with absolutely no girls on it either, so prospects of me meeting other people in education are next-to-none. 

I'm in far better shape today, but I'm not really experienced at all with dating, let alone serious relationships. I recently have been talking to a really nice girl from work and it's pretty clear she's into me - the signs are all there (physical contact, waiting around for me after work, blah blah blah).

So I finally decide to try and give it another go - I leave work with her one day and ask her if she's ever thought about going out for drinks with work ever. She says she'd love to, but she can't yet, not (as I initially thought) because of money or whatever, but because she's 17 years old. 

My knee-jerk reaction was ""Wooooah ABORT"", and I excused myself after she said that and went home. It's been a few hours since, and now and it's really bothering me. She's a lot more mature than other folks that work at our job who are her age - that's part of the reason why I assumed she would be older. When I told her I was 22 after finding out, she made a comment about not expecting that, and saying that ""mentally"" we weren't really that far apart.

For what it's worth, I agree, but I'm still really unsure on what to do now. She's 18 in December, but I don't want to be a creep or do anything inappropriate. At the same time, it's kind of dawning on me that I do *really* like her, and if I have to turn her down when both of us are interested, it's really going to upset me. 

Folks have given me varying degrees of advice from ""if you're both interested, go for it"" to ""don't be a weirdo"". So what should I do, Reddit? Wait a few months, let her down gently? Something else?",06Jul2019,7

609,"Okay first off just a little background of the situation that I'm having right now. 
Husband=H, Roommate=RM Roommate's brother= RMB
Okay me and my husband live in a 2 bedroom apartment and one bathroom. We help our friend out when he didn't have a job or a place to stay. We had him sleep on our couch cause we had H parents living with us (we were having problems with them too but we finally kicked them out) so he was okay with that, after awhile he found a job work there, found himself a girl and moved out of our place after almost a year. Jump to February of this year H parents finally moved out (left us with a huge mess I clean the walls and carpet the best I can but it still like filthy) our RM moved back in with us a few months prior cause he lost his job and his girlfriend left him. He moved in the second bedroom and blah blah. Now jump to May H brother drop off his 3 boy (7-11 yrs old) he was sleeping in his car and ask us to help him for the month and he'll have a place by the beginning of next month. I said no cause we were having financial problems and having 3 more head will cause more problems. But H brother drop them off anyway and left, he fucked up so many times that month that we had to keep them for an extra month. I tried to commit suicide cause of the stress I was having both at work and at home. But anyway now in the middle of June our RM literally went down on his needs begging me and H to let his brother live with us for a little while. We ask how long he said 2 week and he'll moved in with someone else. We said that's okay. Fast forward to this week, H brother had to take his kids cause we told him we could not take care of them anymore financially. Our RMB had been with us since the middle of June we were letting say longer cause of something was taking awhile. So we were not having any problems so far. But now that the kids are gone and we can now focus on our living situation we been noticing some problems here and there. First off RMB is living on Social security cause of his health condition (btw he's obese,he weighs approximately 270 to 300 lbs.) We live above ground (the building only have 4 apartments, 2 on the bottom 2 on top, we're on top) so he have to climb up stairs, the only problem is that just 20 steps makes him wheeze. So here's the problem he NEVER leaves the apartment at all, he play games all day on our RM PS4 or on his Switch,or he's playing Buddy fight or Magic with H. He get 900 a month from Social security, but when he did got the money he pay half of the rent cause RM barely starting working and both of them were okay with that. But afterwards he spend most of his money on cards and Grub hub or Doordash, and he'll complain that he has no money to buy more food for himself. He applied for Food Stamps but he only got $15 on it which is not enough help replenish the food in the fridge. The other problem with RMB is that since he is obese he tends to eat more than what H, RM and me can eat, he'll literally eat that night dinner for lunch, cause he was hungry, what I mean is that we take out frozen meat and let it defrost in the fridge over night so we can make it for dinner, it's usually 3-5 pieces of meat or taco meat. The other problem is that he is not very social but whenever he does socialize he says inappropriate things or he inappropriately touches even though we tell him that it's not right to do this. He's a definition of a neckbeard. Also with him being big whenever he goes to the restroom he leaves streak marks on the toilet front and back and I have to keep spraying cleaner on it and wiping it down before I go to the restroom. We brought up the issue before but he still leaves it like that. Our electricity bill is over $400 cause of him but we already settled that problem (hopefully), the other thing is that whenever we tell him how to do something he'll always tell us that he has a memory problem and he can't remember things that well. So we tell him everyday about how to do something and I'm getting to the point where I might as well do everything by myself if I have to keep tell him to help or how to do something, he remembers all new episode of an anime but when it comes to cleaning or help clean he can't do it cause of his heart condition or he tells me he'll do it later and when it's later either he did it but he did half ass or he didn't at all. So what can we do to make him realized that his brothers begged us to let him stay here, and it feels like he's taking advantage of our welcome. Tbh I'm tried of helping out people just so they can screw us over and not feel any remorse about it. Believe me H's parents full on took advantage of our kindness, same goes for my brother-in-law. They acted like we had everything and that they can just do whatever they want just cause. Right now we're trying to start up our own life ever since we got married 2 yrs ago we never focus on us it was help his parents out help his brother out one after another. We don't even have a driver license or a stable income cause of all this. I just don't know what to do any more I don't want to sound like a bitch whenever I confront him about the problem he is causing I just want to let him know gently.

She was kind of a bait and switch cat- super touchy and lovey at the adoption facility and for the first few weeks of having her, then as she became used to us and our home she became really distant and never really wanted attention just food and sleep. On top of this, she did not like my first cat. Any attempt at playing she would scream as if he was attacking her, and they took on like a bully/victim relationship. Even him looking at her she would get pissed. He never approached her aggressively, but it became a game to him to pick on her.

The first 6 months of having her was really hard and we considered returning her to the clinic, but it didn‚Äôt seem very mature or the right thing to do to return an adopted cat simply for her not ‚Äúfilling a role‚Äù per say of companion to my first cat. 

We‚Äôve now had her for a year, and while she‚Äôs definitely attached to us (she only comes out when we‚Äôre home, and never likes being in different rooms than us) she still doesn‚Äôt crave attention, and still does not like my first cat. They don‚Äôt fight as often, but it‚Äôs still once every few days he‚Äôll try to chase her and she‚Äôll scream at him to back up.

Now, my grandparents are super cat people and since they just lost their cat, they were looking to adopt kittens but are worried about the pets outliving them. I considered giving them our girl cat and I just found out they are interested. 
I‚Äôm stressing over this decision because despite everything I am attached to her and it will be hard to part with her. I also know the transition will be hard for her to become used to new owners. I do believe the quieter lifestyle would overall suit her better, she could have all the food, naps, and peace she could want. This would be an opportunity to find another cat friend for my first cat but I also know the grass may not be greener and we could end up in a worse situation with an aggressive cat or some sort of terror cat. My last concern is that she‚Äôs only 2 and still there is potential that she could outlive my grandparents and that wouldn‚Äôt be fair to her (granted they will still adopt new kittens if they don‚Äôt take her- my grandma has her mind made up).

I am close to my aunt, uncle and cousins. I went away for college and have slowly gotten back into the area. I will speak to the various nieces and nephews of my aunt but do not openly associate with them.

My aunt's nephew decided to light fireworks off at my family's farm (my uncle farms it). He brought his dog, did not keep it tied up and the poor thing ran off. After 36 hours, it has not been found.

&amp;#x200B;

The wife of this nephew (I have never met) has tearfully put on social media about this dog. Everyone is reposting it but the issue is, they are not posting it for the right area. The farm is located close to 3 counties. They are posting on the ""across county"" when half of the comments are its not for this area.

I think this is stupid for the nephew to do this situation at all. He is literally dragging MY family through the mud as the location is MY grandmother's house. I also feel horrible for the dog as their stupidity caused this to happen.

I kept my mouth shut until this morning. I then posted on a nearby area ""set of towns"" which is in the area where the dog ran.  I along with my cousins are working and cannot physically go around and search for this dog.

About a year ago my mom landed in a hospital due to  health issues -  connected to smoking.

She told my Stepfather (Michael) that she was gonna quit smoking cigarettes once she was out - he agreed and said he was gonna quit too - since he runs marathons and it would improve his preformance.

A couple months later my stepfather is smoke-free with iron will , a nicotine spray and a LOT of sport.

He enthusiastically tells me about how much money he's saving , how he can breathe easier and his stamina has gone way up - he drops me off at home and zooms to work.

I go out to the balcony and catch my mother - lighter in hand - smoking.

This shit has been going on for about a year - I tried to talk to her about it , tell her that not only is she ruining her health but also her relationship.
She made promises to quit and failed each and every one of them.

Michael has no clue - they literally got married 3 months ago - I've tried my best to just keep my mouth shut but I know that its only a matter of time until she gets caught - and that will end in tragedy.

I've been in a 4 years old relationship with a lady of love so so much. But, she's always complaining about our finances. It doesn't help my case especially seeing others spending money extravagantly. I've tried getting jobs. Nothing. I've attempted entrepreneurship. Affiliate marketing, Dropshipping, Binary Options, Freelance writing, Website Development... It's an endless list there. 

I'm practically on the verge of giving up. I don't want to lose Joyce. But I feel that the odds are stacking against me with each passing breath. Saying I'm homeless is a far cry but I'm not where I want to be. I don't eat what I want to eat. Do what I want to do. I'm just existing. And I'm exhausted. I'm always angry. I feel life's not fair. 

I'm smart enough to go into fraud, that's like the goto job for young people here. But, I feel I have potentials to be something more. Better. More impactful and honorable. Make anyone who cares proud. And others disappointed. But right now, I don't feel so motivated. I listen to goalcast videos and instead of being inspired, I just cry. It'll make me weak if I end it all. But I would not be there to know who'll miss me. The whole world maybe? I have so many ideas, plans, dreams...

And my only source of happiness, Joyce, is now seeming tired of my 'grand plans and no progress'.

634,"(Sorry for all of the possible mistakes I could've made, English is not my first language.)

I've known her since 2017, she was always like a savior to me. Always listened, never judged, made me smile when nobody else could. She's the funniest person I've ever met. She lives only 2 hours away from me, in a city I'm actually moving to in a month. We never met in real life. We're both teenagers, her parents are conservative and don't trust anyone on the internet.

The first time she left was in November of 2017. She never even spoke to me about it personally, just posted a statement on a website we were both using at the time and shortly after deactivated her account. I couldn't help, but blame myself for it. We'd had a falling-out a week prior and I thought I pushed her over her limit. She's always had issues I could never figure out how to help her with. I was very hurt, but learned to cope with it.

2 months later, in January of 2018 she was back online. We started talking again and she apologised. Our friendship thrived. She was still her old self, and I kept falling in love with her. We didn't talk as much, but I figured it was because of school and her parents. She was always very affectionate with me - calling me pet names, etc.. I thought she felt the same and made the mortal mistake of confessing my feelings. Surprise, surprise - she didn't! It made me sad, sure, but I accepted it because I still wanted her in my life. Even she wasn't my girlfriend, a friendship was better than nothing.

A few months later she started talking about how she was getting more and more paranoid about her parents finding out she's not straight. She was contemplating deleting all of her social media accounts. She said that if they found out, they would kick her out. 

About 2 weeks ago she messaged me asking if 'she really meant that much to me' and explained that she's been feeling terrible lately and considered leaving again. She said her goodbyes and closed her Instagram account (which was the only media we used to communicate). I haven't heard from her since.

I'm moving to the city she lives in a month, I'm going to be living with my father and go to school there. She knows about it. 

How do I cope with the abandonment? And the knowledge that she's so close, yet I can't meet her? I always assumed that we would just be friends in real life if I moved, but now I'm not so sure about it. I feel so helpless.

How do I improve on becoming more mature. He says one of the reasons is because don't think about my future.

First off, I'm a 14 year old male. I have a 16 year old sister who basically tells me everything. I'm the one who accompanied her to get birth control. 
Now, here's what makes me scared. My sister basically is using birth control, the name is ""Yasminelle"". She never misses one pill, always takes it at the right time, etc. Last month, she told me her boyfriend came into her. I was angry about it because  who the hell tells your whole sexual life to a 14 year old? But anyway, because I was angry, I told her that yes, even if she takes birth control she can get pregnant. 
Fast forward, her period came. I'm in a state of relief.

Alright. You have to know that me and my sister smoke. When we don't have enough money for cigs, we steal them from our father. His cigs are unsmokable tbh, but I never complained about it. She told me 3 days ago, that she was smoking a stolen cig from our dad, and the smell was so bad that she was about to vomit - like - actually vomiting.
We eventually laughed it off. 
Yesterday, she told me that she vomited in the night. Not for the cig obviously. 
I told her that she probably ate something bad, and didn't care much about it.
Now she's complaining huge headaches too.
Wtf do I do? Am I just paranoid? 
She didn't tell me that she was scared that she could probably be preggo. 
Well, I have to say that she is out a lot. She went out to the sea yesterday, she took a lot of sun. That  could probably be insolation, or am I wrong?

Third year I was put in the same class as her, we haven't really been talking but many times we found ourselves just looking at each other, but neither of us actually made a move. 

In the fourth year we had to choose schools and we went to the same one, and now I've been having an even bigger crush on her more than ever.

Now it's the 5th year of knowing her, we've only talked once and that was because I had to find a partner and she was the only one I was able to ask, but sadly she had a partner already. I have one more year to be able to see her beautiful and cute face and I really want to make a move.

I dont know how I should approach her, she is truly beautiful and I doubt that she doesn't have a boyfriend. It would also be really weird to just come out of nowhere and ask her what's up and try to have a conversation. Also, I do speak the same language as she does, but since it's her native language, I'm a bit scared. She does speak English really well, but I feel like I would look like a weirdo by talking in english with her. 

Please help me, I feel really lost but at the same time I want to give it a try, I just font know where to start.",06Jul2019,1

I want to do something with my life other than be a burden on my family. I feel pressured to go to college but I don't want to wake up one day and realize that I regret paying a lot of money for an education that might get me a job that I probably won't enjoy. College has always seemed like the last step in education and to not go to college would mean i'm a lazy and unsuccessful person.

684,"My bf is a doctor working for the NHS here in England. He has a surgeon's license meaning he can perform operations, and he's aspiring to be a plastic surgeon one day. He's incredibly smart, conscientious, patient, and an all round great guy. I really look up to him and feel lucky to have him.

However, I'm worried for his life.

At the moment he's not employed by a specific hospital but is in fact under - or rather at the mercy of - an agency. He works at different hospitals around the country at random and unpredictable times. This means that sometimes I don't get to see him much for a while, which is crap and also kind of ties into what happened this evening. 

A lot of doctors his age are in this situation. They've studied for years, dedicated their lives to their careers, and they're at a stage where they'll do pretty much anything to prove themselves worthy of promotion. My boyfriend is no exception. His superiors and employers take gross advantage of this, giving him almost impossible hours and even assigning him jobs that he hasn't been trained for. He told me that on a few occasions he had to learn how to do an operation from YouTube, within hours of having to perform it. 

That's just to give you a taste of how doctors are treated in this country, not to mention the risk to patients.

Today, my boyfriend almost got killed, not just once, but on five different occasions within an hour. This is how it all went down.

My bf was on-call for 24 hours yesterday, finishing at around 6pm. He was called so often that he didn't get any sleep at all during those 24 hours, which is pretty hard but he says he's used to it, that you have to be in order to be a doctor. The hospital he did this 24 hour shift at gave him a two month placement just over a month ago. Getting this placement was a big step up for him, it shows he's excelling in his career, so as you can imagine he's desperate to prove himself worthy and capable.

I should also point out that this was the second 24 hour on-call that he'd done in three days, and he got very little sleep during the first one too. Not to mention the times he's been pretty much bullied into doing work for his superiors and overtime that doesn't go onto his timesheet. To top it all off, some lazy ass didn't get around to processing his contract and paperwork so he didn't even get paid for the entire first month. 

I'm sure that must be illegal.

Right at the end of his 24 hour he looked at his phone to see he had missed a call from his agent. She tried to contact him because he'd been offered a couple of shifts at another hospital this weekend. He wasn't able to answer because, surprise surprise, he was treating a patient. As if to punish him for not answering, the agent agreed on his behalf to do this job.  Of course, he couldn't turn around and refuse to do it, because to the employers it would look as though he'd agreed and then changed his mind at the last minute, and that would have looked bad on him.

Now get this, the first 12 hour shift that his agent forced upon him started an hour after his 24 hour ended. The hospital where he did the 24 hour is just over two hours from the second hospital by car. So, my bf was given less than an hour to make an over two hour journey, after going 24 hours without sleep.

Now I come in.

I live a lot closer to the second hospital than the first, though it's still nearly an hour's drive. Instead of paying for hotel he came back to my place after his shift had ended. When he got to mine he told me that he hadn't slept for nearly 40 hours, I could see him struggling to keep his eyes open and losing focus as he tried to talk. He got a few hours sleep, but not nearly enough. He should have stayed closer to the hospital but he wanted to see me, as we haven't seen each other much since he took that placement in the first hospital. He left for work and I made him promise to text me when he got there so I knew he was safe. He did. He also told me about the journey.

He said that he'd fallen asleep whilst driving. I asked him if he was joking and he said he wasn't. He said 'I think there was a guardian angel' and then told me that he fell asleep and almost crashed five times. Twice into cars, twice into lorries, and once into a motorcyclist. Five times he almost died, or at least got injured, or injured someone else. At one point he had no recollection of where he was, and as soon as he parked his car he just passed out at the steering wheel.

I don't know what to do. This situation has put him in so much danger, not just him but other people too. The NHS is supposed to look after people, save people, provide care. But all I'm seeing is a highly qualified doctor over worked to fatigue, given impossible hours, not being paid, and having his ambition exploited by those above him. This has ultimately put his life in danger, and other people's lives too, including his patients. That motorcyclist would definitely have died if my bf had hit them.

I'm so sick of watching this happen and not being able to do anything about it. I'm scared that something bad is going to happen. Right now he's doing another twelve hour shift, he finishes in the morning and he's talking about driving back here afterwards. I'm terrified.

What can I do? Is there anywhere or anyone I can report this to? Will he get all the blame if I do? I don't want to ruin his life but I don't want him to die either.",06Jul2019,1

689,"So I‚Äôve known this girl for the past 9, almost 10, months. She started dating her boyfriend about 2 weeks before she met me. 

We‚Äôre best friends, we do everything together. I‚Äôve confided in her about everything from school to sexuality, and even suicidal thoughts. She‚Äôs done the same. 

A few weeks ago she texts me: ‚Äúgoing on a date w/ my bf, talk to u soon.‚Äù Then about halfway through her date she mentions how he was on another girl‚Äôs instagram and he was ignoring her the entire time. She told me she was considering breaking up with him. 

I text her back later that night and she doesn‚Äôt respond, then at around 11 pm, she texts me ‚Äúit‚Äôs all good, I‚Äôve made up with him.‚Äù 

It honestly infuriated me, this wasn‚Äôt their first fight, it was at least their 15th. And she tells me: ‚Äúit‚Äôll be different this time, he said so‚Äù; which she‚Äôs also said at least 15 times. 

I then choose to be honest with her, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not acting in your best interest‚Äù I said, and described the situation as I see it. 

As I‚Äôm talking to her, her boyfriend(T), messages me. ‚Äúfuck off out of our lives.‚Äù ‚ÄúKNOW YOURE(sic) PLACE‚Äù and a plethora of other insults. Which honestly riled me up further. 

I was expressing how I felt about the whole situation to the girl and he decides to get involved with a ton of insults, and the whole thing felt childish. He then deleted all of the texts, where he was being aggressive and sent screenshots to the girl. 

This led her to losing it and getting mad at me, which is justifiable because from her perspective: I messaged him first and began throwing insults. Me and her had a long talk about what this all meant and the only thing that came out of it was that she was going to keep her relationship with me and her relationship with her boyfriend separate. She isn‚Äôt gonna talk to me about him nor to him about me. 

I was in the wrong here, I know that. I shouldn‚Äôt have said the things I said and that‚Äôs my fault. But the real problem is because I don‚Äôt know what to do now. 

She wants to be my friend still, and I want to be hers too. But whenever I spend time with her, I‚Äôm instantly brought back to the situation, how she took his side and attacked me. Some nights I stay up looking at screenshots from the texts, trying to see what I could have, should have, said.

Bit of back ground, we were together for 4 years, she (40) has been a single person most of her life, me (27) first proper relationship. She originally only wanted to be lovers/friends with benefits. I insisted on a relationship, she‚Äôs been trying to break it off each year or so but we work though. We moved up to Scotland two months ago. (She one day suddenly wanted to move up to near her friend) Stayed with a friend as we didn‚Äôt have a house (plan was she goes up first to find a house and then I come up later once she had found one) but two weeks later we found one but another two weeks pasted before we could move in.  Had to move her horse during then. Then two weeks later her friend moved next door.  Also then move her horse, then parents were coming up a week or so later. (This is relevant as I didn‚Äôt apply for jobs due to all this happening, and assuming getting job was easy) basically two months later I go back south to get the final bits from storage to have her call me up saying she can‚Äôt cope with me living with her anymore. 

1st txt
Sadly it didn‚Äôt work out and I‚Äôm back in Ipswich now, but I think it‚Äôs for the best, as we were both inadvertently makes each other miserable and tryingto make the other into something they weren‚Äôt. We had been basically roommates on and off for a while. So if it did t happen now it probably would of later on and not on good terms. But we both are still talking to each other, she even kissed me on the lips when I was leaving (considering we were only hugging sort of over the week) which was a nice surprise, mum and Simon came up on Friday and I left that evening. So I‚Äôm staying at the parents house short term until I save up for rent as Simon and his family are also moving in to save up for a deposit on a house, so want out as soon as I can. 

2nd txt
Yea, was a bit of a blow tbh, I was done in Ipswich picking up her plants my car and trailer, when she phoned me the day before I came back up said it, but we‚Äôve been talking and sorting things so it‚Äôs not the worst situation but maybe this is all for the best. I‚Äôll be staying up here, I do enjoy it up here.

Hi dan, bit more of an update, things had taken a nose dive, we were talking and I mentioned that I may not be back for like 2/3 months if at all, which she ‚Äúdid wonder about that happening‚Äù but she seem fine, continue chatting, about ‚Äúwhat could be fun for you and all the possibilities‚Äù etc, I had been saying I‚Äôll miss the all aspects of physical stuff, then I mentioned dating apps 

(bearing in mind for the last week she‚Äôd had originally said about us being a couple without the formality and being lovers or FWB, but had the been drumming in to me were not in a relationship, we‚Äôre friends maybe in time, we‚Äôll see how things went)  

so as soon as I said that I knew I goofed up, she stopped texting, I try to explain and ask to talk to her, she then said the ‚Äúneed space and time text‚Äù on Tuesday eve, I try again Wednesday, she sends the same text again Wednesday eve, Thursday morning I‚Äôm at breaking point she texts back saying I‚Äôve not given her time or space, I need time and space, but that time it felt like it was actually her saying it rather than an automated text. 

I had been saying I just want to understand what‚Äôs going on (tbh the last two weeks I‚Äôve always been on the back foot, she‚Äôll say something, like you‚Äôve got 6weeks, get job and go, ok fine, then she‚Äôd change a few days later to 1week get job, ok fine, then a couple days later she says are you being realistic about getting a job, in that time, I try to explain I did say I‚Äôd need time, but there was nothing I could do, I had to go. 

Yes I understand she needed her own space back, that she could live with me anymore and she thought she could last 6weeks whilst I save up and it made her miserable, I got that and it was getting worse the longer I was there. I was trying my best to get out without having to go back home. But enough was enough and I left. 

So I don‚Äôt know wether she still likes me to still have a relationship or just FWB or anything as I yet again don‚Äôt know where I stand. I thought I did. She may just need time to think. But it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs had nearly a week since I left Scotland and before that probably 2-3weeks from when she initially had the idea whilst I was down here

5th
That‚Äôs I know you‚Äôre busy at the mo. I was going to give a week or so. But the original plan was for me to save up down here working them find a place back up there, but when I was down here I did mention there‚Äôs more for me down here. And I may not be back, but I guess me mentioning the dating apps sort of sent the message though or forced her to think about things, but it‚Äôs all a bit of a shit show. 

The thing was I felt guilt as soon as I said that dating app bit, but considering what I‚Äôd been though and my awareness of the current situation was. I shouldn‚Äôt of been. But I had asked her a week prior when I first got back up there could we be exclusive FWB/lovers which she said yes, but from then on with everything changing I just assumed that friends was it and that stuff was a possibility potentially

6th
Yea, I‚Äôm trying. The rational side knows exactly what needs to be done and is happening, but the uncertainty and emotional side is really doing a number on me, trying to think positive and look forwards, it just feels like a huge overbearing feeling of guilt and frustration about no knowing.

I do really apologise about the essay

Summary,
At this point as of Thursday morning I‚Äôve not spoken to her to give her space. ( I‚Äôll text her next week) Because I do genuinely think she is thinking about us and the future, as she has been caring about things, she tried to make it work with me living there. She offered to let me store stuff there until I come back. We had left on good terms. But the other side of me is just thinking I‚Äôve been taken for a ride and she‚Äôs using this ‚Äúspace‚Äù to just hide from it all. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs the former I suspect it probably is. 

Hell, this is just one big old custerfuck. I‚Äôm currently in (moved back home with 7 people living there) 

TL:DL I‚Äôm fucked, got kicked out, not sure where I stand or what I should do

695,"I‚Äôll try to keep this short. My mom and her partner are currently watching a 7 year old boy. The boy is the mans grandson. They have been watching him for about 3 months. The boy is originally from Arizona and they are currently residing in Montana. My mom recently retired, sold her house and all three are living in a motorhome. They recently took a trip down to Arizona to see her partners daughter to try and reestablish communication because of their strained relationship. They ended up taking her son back with them to Montana. They found out the boys mother was recently homeless and living in a van with her scumbag in and out of jail boyfriend who also has three of his own kids living with them. My mom decided to get the boy out of that situation and take him back to Montana in the hopes the mother would choose to come with them. The mother refused and they have not been able to make contact with her in over two months. They suspect she is a drug/substance abuse addict and does not want her child anymore. Keep in mind the man my mom is with is an alcoholic who hides liquor bottles from her and refuses to get help. My mom has said he is verbally abuse to her but has not threatened to physical abuse in her. I don‚Äôt believe her because of what recently happened. She wants out of the relationship but feels she has some responsibility to help the boy. I have told her to kick the man out and tell him to return the boy back to Arizona into CPS custody. The. It thinks all this is temporary and that his mom is coming up to Montana. The boy has expressed interest in going back to Arizona as well. My moms boyfriend has not been able to hold a job for many years and I don‚Äôt think he is in anyway able to care for a 7 year old. I suspect they boy is afraid of him because he always goes to my mom for things and avoids the man. 

My mom recently told me they were in a grocery store shopping when the boy accidentally ran into her boyfriends back leg with the cart. He immediately got angry at the boy, threw his hand back into a fist and verbally threatened to punch the boy in public. I told her she needs to get out of this situation and call CPS. Currently she is giving him 60 days to get his things in order and move out. I fear that may not happen because she has tried multiple times to leave but she keeps going back to him. I know he is manipulating her 100% and using the boy as leverage so she doesn‚Äôt kick him out. What can I do? I live in another state. Should I call CPS in Montana and Arizona and explain the situation and see what they can do? My mom is not the boys legal guarding. She said her boyfriend has temporary custody of the boy which the mom signed over when they were in Arizona and if she does not contact them within 6 months, her alcoholic boyfriend could have full custody. I‚Äôm just thinking about the little boys well being. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you",06Jul2019,1

For about 4 years of my life my sister(twin, I am 5 minutes older) Has been constantly picking on me.. before I get into that I'll talk a bit about myself.  


I'm kinda chubby and i take intrest in science, I also wear glasses and I'm stronger than I look but I'd never hit anyone except for self defense, I'm imbetween the age of 10 and 14 so I'm not very old.  


So my sister is messy haired, constantly bullies me and takes intrest in art.   


Everyday  I have to endure her calling me a Fatass  and calling me a nerd and my parent's dont do anything about it because it seems like they cant, I have a tiny video of her harassing me but i dont think it would matter at all. I've tried to make a truce with her and after just 2 days she decided it shouldn't happen and went back to what she was. Everytime I get near her I feel like I'm not a part of her life.. like she doesn't see me as a brother and she would be better off if I was dead.. if I never existed she wouldn't care.. I wont go into any more detail because it pains me to waste your time with her harrasment towards me.  


So here I am.. asking for advice from you guys. Please find a way..  
(Additional Information: If you try to talk to her she ethier wont understand or wont listen, Parent's wouldn't work. I wouldn't hiit her and I always forgive her but she just go's back to herself.. today she told me to kms btw but I hear that alot online and IRL. Its like every attempt at trying to get her to understand is useless.)

My name is not important... Iam a 20 years old guy, with as you already read by title, Butterfly disease (Dystrophic one).

And i need advice, from you. All of you. All my life i was playing video games (mostly WoW,ARK: Survival Evolved and stuff.) and i still play alot to this day. I was maybe weird or maybe iam weird to this day i dont know :-D But i never felt like i needed a girl. a Love. Until 8 months ago, i met somebody. Somebody that changed my life. On my ARK server we met, i fell in love. Sadly, she was already taken and it broke my hearth. I still love her to this day, and the love just doesnt fade away. But thats another story.......  
I want to find a love, thats all i want. I dont know what to do... I tried Badoo and some dating sites, no girl just wants to even try to chat... I never felt like this but iam missing something, a piece of me, that can only be there if i have somebody to love, and somebody who loves me back... Thing is. Even when iam 20. I am not, and i will never be self-sufficient. I need help with changing bandages. I spent time for changing bandages and all this stuff every single day of my life....It affects skin, but it does affect inner organs and stuff. Right now i have very hard time to even eat... So there is a chance i will get a PEG (in short something that is on your belly and you put food right into it.....sorry if this made you sick) and i wonder, is there a woman that would live me? is there? I dont know where to search or what to do....Lately i feel very depressed, i will admit i cry. Why do i have to be 20 years old and 20 years alone...Why do i have to feel all of this everyday. Maybe iam just weak, i know for sure there are people that are much worse than me...But i just feel this way lately....All i want is love... But as person with DEB i dont know what to do... Where to search. And if there is a chance for me at all. In my free time i take care of discord server(570 users) and ark servers...I dont go to school... I dont go to work... So i dont know many people. I dont go outside. Because i dont know somebody that would go with me or places that i could go. Iam not that type of person that would go to party, and clubs and stuff. I would much rather prefer to stay at home, watch a movie and cuddle, but thats just me.  


Iam writing this here, because i need every advice i can get. If you read this thank you, and if you responded to this. Thank you alot, it means alot that somebody out there, cares and spents their time to atleast respond. If there is anything you would like to know more, about me, my story or just anything at all. Feel free to ask me here, or in PM.  


Thank you everyone.",06Jul2019,1
700,"For a few years now i had occasional changes in my mood. At the beginning they i was just feeling sad for apparently no reason. It used to last a few days every few months. As time passed they began to last a week, then two and so on. I also began thinking about how useless life is. No meaning at all. I still think about it, we are so insignificant compared to the universe. 

Like i said, i feel sad and unmotivated. Life is not interesting. I feel lonely even when i talk to people regularly.  The strangest part is that i don't have a difficult past, i do well in my studies, i can be social, i know there are people who love me and care about me but... i can go weeks without replying to them WhatsApp or Telegram (unless it's my family since we talk face to face) . I isolate myself and cry. For no reason at all. I tried to talk with a friend about it but it didn't help me understand why i do it. I actually thought about the fact that maybe i seek attention from the people around me but  it doesn't convince me (or maybe i am still in denial ). I can't seem to understand the reason behind all of this. 

Now it got a bit worse. It began a few months ago and it didn't go away. I even thought about giving up on university but i know it's not serious and i will continue  since i have only a couple of exams left.

It's also strange because these feelings i have are somewhat comfortable. They made me more carefree. I used to be really anxious about exams and had lots of insecurities about my intelligence, appearance and skills in general. Now they all vanished, i even get out of my comfort zone because i think that nobody would care even if i do it  (or not do it).

What should i do ? Try to talk with someone about it again or just let it be?",06Jul2019,1

702,"Hello!
(TLDR at the end)

I am currently experiencing a shift in my life: got out of school last year, started a new job (my first one with a good pay), am in a stable relationship and am planning to move out in the next year or so.

But a big issue in my life atm are friendships.
I have never been very good at making friends, as I have always been a generally awkward and shy person (althought I open up as I get close to people).

My only current friends are a group of friends from highschool and an old friend from middleschool. These people have been consistent in my life for the past few years, however as my life/personality/ideals change, I find myself being constantly annoyed around some of them and have since recognized that I only try to keep in touch because I‚Äôm afraid of not having any friends besides my boyfriend.(Besides these people I also have my coworkers, whom I am friendly with but wouldn‚Äôt consider my friends I guess).

The problems I am dealing with are:

-I‚Äôm afraid of cutting ties with some of my friends because since we are all part of the same friend group it would be awkward and I would end up drifting away from all of them bc of it;

-Don‚Äôt know how to connect with people now that I‚Äôm out of highschool because I don‚Äôt really get a chance to because of work and because I‚Äôm not much of a party person.

-Don‚Äôt wanna be the asshole if I ultimately decide to cut ties with these people.

Any advice? 

TLDR: I‚Äôm becoming an ‚Äúadult‚Äù and I‚Äôm changing and am starting to not relate to my friends from highschool anymore. I don‚Äôt know how to smoothly ‚Äúdisconnect‚Äù from them without being an asshole and also have no idea how to make friends since I‚Äôm not much of a social person (don‚Äôt usually party).",06Jul2019,1

This might seem like a weird question, but I would like a serious answer. I am 13 years old and I'm ""different from my friends"". Sometimes I will see something, and could instantly start a conversation about whatever I looked at, and my mind will wander constantly. If my friends don't know what to do, I can spit out an idea in under a minute. Sometimes I feel very anxious, and other times like a complete extrovert. If I'm watching a movie or TV, I cannot sit still and get reminded to try to stop talking about the movie and just watch it. My friends are very supportive (despite all being teenage boys lol) and understand I try not to do all this. Yesterday I was playing CoD with my boyfriend and I started talking about the game in a good and controlled voice. Pretty soon, I was rambling about it in a hushed voice, but I didn't even realize. My BF sometimes has to remind me to quiet down and just chill out. He is very supportive and doesn't seem to be bothered by my ""issue"" at all. Sometimes I just wonder if this is considered normal or not. Here is a list of things that seem to be ""not normal"" (according to Google lol).

1. I tend to change personalities every now and then. Not extreme changes but I can go from shy to extroverted in a few minutes.
2. I will take dares that the rest of my friends won't do. Things that are considered risky or nasty I can usually do without much of a problem and enjoy making my friends laugh at that.
3. Anger and social withdrawal. Usually I will get really pissed at something, but try my hardest to not to lash out. After a day at school, I will do something to spill out all my anger without anyone seeing. I have hurt a few people by punching them or hurting them in other ways and after a moment I realize that what i did was wrong.
4. Trouble thinking clearly most of the time and never really pay attention in school. I have good grades, but not grades on my behavior. I can actually be very funny and almost always get on the teachers good side because I'm a cool person once you get to know me.

Again, this might sound like a dumb thing to ask, and you might need more details, but I would really like to know if this is all normal. (Btw I am biologically female, although mentally I am definitely male.)",06Jul2019,2

I felt like he wasn‚Äôt happy and that started to really bother me... so I decided to end things. He was okay and didn‚Äôt even try to work things out. 

I tried to move on. But I love him. I love him so much. I dated this one other guy but I felt guilty because I couldn‚Äôt get Ayden out of my head or heart. 

Two months after the breakup Ayden texts me. He starts apologizing and begging to be back together. I said that it‚Äôs way too late. Because 1: I was dating and 2: I was scared that if we broke up once... we‚Äôre gonna breakup again. But he kept insisting, so I ignored him.

Last month he texted me again. He cried. He apologized again. At that moment I was mentally dying. I was so sick and tired. I felt like I was trapped. My love for him keeps growing. It seriously hurts. I talked to him and asked him why didn‚Äôt he open up to me? What was the problem? What was going on? 
He told me something that really shocked me. He told me that he has PTSD and that it was really standing in the way of our relationship. He said that I deserve better. That he is a mess. That I was the only one who stood up for him and understood him. 

Anyway.... 

We got back together... now that I know why he was so distant. But now there‚Äôs another problem.... literally everyone that I know is against this relationship. They say that I‚Äôll regret taking him back. I‚Äôm so stressed right now and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I need advice. How can I get him to be comfortable talking to me and open up to me?

My relationship with them isn't necessarily bad but it's not good same goes with my mother.
My father is the real problem  to me at least. He would always act as if i don't even exist and whenever he would acknowledge my existence it would be to either scold me about a bunch of horeshit  where the actual reason he does it is cause he's angry and wants to let off some steam. However there isn't really a ""big event"" that i can point to and say ""hey what you did fucked me up"" it's just piles that even taking the chance to talk about would be way too long of a conversation wich eventually would lead nowhere since he would never admit his wrongs even if it's as clear as daylight that he's the one at fault. A year ago he traveled for work (and still is) ever since i only talked to him twice(and i don't really know how to feel about that), once to talk about why i don't call and another to ask why my grades dropped.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  üëî  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‚Äòyou make me sweat, Graham‚Äô and I said ‚Äòwhat?‚Äô then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‚Äòwtf‚Äô she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off.

I left a little while after because I've been packing for my upcoming move. Neither of us want a relationship or anything serious, we don't want feelings involved, and clingy is unattractive. 

I don't want to come off as clingy, but I do like him as a person. I don't like very many people but he's witty, funny, and makes me laugh, so I would like to keep talking to him and maybe be actual friends who happen to sleep together every now and again.

728,"So basically the jist of this situation is a girl online told her audience of 6,000+ fans that I had been going onto her tiktok to publiclly mock her on my public instagram story. The only part of this that's true is that i stalked her tiktok- because i liked them and was too shy to follow myself. Because i wanted to be friends with this girl. Because i loved her style and thought her videos were really cool and sometimes pretty damn funny. 

i guess she saw something i posted and took it as a direct attack against her. I've never even thought a mean thing about this girl, I really don't know why she's doing this. But yeah, she made a video and dropped my instagram @ so that her 6,000 fans would come onto my page and tell me that I'm ugly and a bad person for something I never did. 

If she had just talked to me before publically accusing me of things I never did or at the very least never meant to do, she would have realized this. This girl has also NEVER spoken to me in real life. Pretty much every person I've talked about this to has told me they don't understand what she's talking about, and these are close friends who have watched pretty much all of my instagram stories for the pats several months at the very least.

I‚Äôve tried going to the ywca, telling someone (I get shamed and am kept on silence for it)

I have been abused physically, sexually, socially, probably more, probably worse. 

Asking for help has done genuinely nothing. 
Pretending I‚Äôd be okay eventually has brought me nowhere closer to safety or medical examination and treatments. 

Nobody is themselves or cares to be where or how I‚Äôve been kept and they‚Äôre all fine with whatever happens to them. I‚Äôm either dead or half alcove elsewhere and nobody seems to care to intervene unless it makes them feel validated in having hurt or harmed another continuously. 

I‚Äôve tried using my phone but that‚Äôs either long gone, or someone takes it from me. Often harming my hands and belongings in the process. 

I feel surrounded by harmful ejaculating heavy breathers whom choose to cause harm to themselves and others and am and have been left to die even in places wherein I should be able to see or hear myself or surroundings. 

But there‚Äôs nothing, nowhere. Every ‚Äúchance‚Äù I‚Äôve had, ruined or turned abusive by someone else. 

Cops have been of zero help. When I walk to a police station (because I try to do those things), I never make it inside or ask for someone to help me call, I can‚Äôt or they can‚Äôt or whatever.

I would like to know what brief ideas you all might have to help. 

I don‚Äôt know what I was supposed to look like or how I sound or why my face keeps ending up with metal hooks and needles and whatever else inside of me. 

I‚Äôm either almost dead and somehow sometimes able to feel or incomprehensibly still Not helped and kept from having been able to have been. 

So. Would like to know when a prayer or whatever might bring about some tiny excuse for hope, which I‚Äôm also blinded to, might bring about some reasonable amount of awareness and change into relocates safe environment. If not biologically, then socially.

734,"My husband adopted a dog when we were just starting to date. He was in no position to get a dog but got one anyway (a husky puppy). I had no say in the matter and was no part of it. I expressed my concerns with him getting a dog let alone a husky puppy, but the concerns fell on deaf ears (not like I was a vet tech and a grooming assistant at the time so I know dogs well). 

Puppy was a handful and a half to say the least. Fast forward to us moving in together after about a year together. Pup, my cat, and I were alone for 12+hrs at a time due to his schedule. Pup gets jealous of me and harasses the cat. Jealously turns to aggression. To this day I've been bit over 3 dozen times. Twice I should have gotten medical attention but I was scared to and got lucky I guess. About 6ish months in and many fights later I tell him to surrender her to a rescue. He said yes but took it back. Cue the worst panic attack in my life. He makes it clear repeatedly it's his dog, not ours and he would never get rid of her. 

He does try and train her and it gets better for awhile. Mostly bc his work hours changed to normal times and he took over her care. Fast forward again and were married and in our first home and now two cats. She seems better with the cats, her antianxiety meds seem to work, and generally happier. Except when shes alone with me. 

The second hes not in her eyeline she screams and howls. Even when its other people and I in the room and he leaves, she screams and panics. Anytime he goes away for the weekend to do his hobbies, my whole weekend is screaming, howling, pissing/shitting the crate, tearing up the house, and being impossible to do anything with. I got one good walk out of her and that's it. We have an enclosed backyard but I cant let her run bc she tries to escape to get away from me. I cant have anyone over, cant do anything without paranoia, and I often feel like shit from a stress induced migraine from her. She acts terrified of me like I just beat the shit out of her, but I'm not. I'm just trying to make it all stop. The worst I've done is scream at her. My sister joked about me dropping her off on the other side of town and letting her be free and I'd never do something so cruel, but my mind fantasizes about that when I zone out.  

So now I'm sitting here crying, head throbbing,  with a sore throat from screaming. I've grown to hate her and resent her and my husband. I really dont want to, but if she wasnt in the picture, things would be so much better. We could focus on fixing our marraige and being happier. My husband blames me for all the bad shit between us and that I'm an awful dog mom, but Im literally am the one who cares for her when hes not here, I'm thousands in credit card debt bc of her (vet bills), I buy all her shit.... I'm just done. 

I want nothing to do with her. I didn't sign on for this when I first agreed to be with him and maybe I should have ended things before getting this far. But I'm here now and trying to figure out what to do. Trying to get the courage to tell him we need therapy... I'm just tired of feeling like I'm less than a dog. Tired of the screaming and biting. Tired of being broke all the time from all the bills and paying off a dog we can't afford. I wanted a corgi over half my life, but I dont even want that anymore. I feel like the corgi would become her and that im not good enough for a corgi.

748,"Hey guys i got a life question because i recently have been REALLY frustrated with my family. So, I'll give you a bit of an info dump. My family have been doing a lot of work this summer on the house and garden, sort of a tradition for my mom even though i can't stand yard work. So pretty much each day, i offer my help to whatever task is needed, and usually i get no response. So one day, this happens yet again, i offer my help, and no one says a thing. So obviously i go about doing my own things through out the day. You can probably guess what is gonna happen, if not that's ok. So at the end of the day my sibling(sister) and my mother complain about me not helping out enough. I bring up that i offer my help pretty much all the time, and if not they need only ask nicely. Somehow this is twisted logic, i need to take responsibility because its my fault they didn't take me up on my offer. Im paraphrasing but this is the gist of the conversation, i think it's insane. They complain about me trying to get a social life(online schooled since elementary so i'm trying to learn social skills), when the only thing i ask is that i'm driven every Wednesday night/some other odd days to meet up with friends in the making(i give plenty of warning for the odd days and ask nicely and ask if it fits my mothers schedule). Today, my mother made some pretzels and salad for dinner. I find a pretzel and im like alright, im not that hungry, im gonna just eat that. So i finish and my mom is saying i need to eat the salad. I'm not hungry in the slightest, pretty full in fact, so i make up how i don't like it or somesuch, clearly an excuse because i love salad. My mother proceeds to pile salad on my plate, along with another pretzel. Now after not eating, and my sister harassing me to eat it(she kicked me even), my mother finally takes it away saying i'm a piece of work. Shit like this has been happening all the time, and it's really killing me, i'm about to burst out on them if they keep doing it. What the hell am i supposed to do about this reddit?

However, I'm not exactly sure how to approach the job hunt process with respect to her grad program apps. The way I see it I have two main options:

1. Start applying early, around August or September. Larger companies in my field - computer science - start recruiting their new grad cohort fairly early, so you need to apply pretty early on. This has the pro of letting me secure a job early, but unfortunately may (or likely will) mean I won't end up in the same place as my partner if I get a job in november/january (we graduate in may). This would suck!

2. I could wait until she gets accepted to a program she wants to attend, then start applying for jobs in that area. However, grad school acceptances start coming out in january/february, and can often come out as late as april. This means that I'd have about four months (april through august) to find a job, which doesn't seem like a very long time!

I really don't want to do approach (1), since I'd much rather be with my partner than have a high paying job (especially since jobs at large tech companies are.... ethically questionable). At the same time, I worry that approach (2) could end up being the worst of both worlds - no job and therefore no way of ending up in the same location as my partner.

Is there some other approach that combines the best of both worlds? Or should I just choose between the above two sub-par options?",06Jul2019,1

753,"  I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven‚Äôt talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  üëî  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‚Äòyou make me sweat, Graham‚Äô and I said ‚Äòwhat?‚Äô then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‚Äòwtf‚Äô she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt got a boyfriend you know, Graham‚Äô I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",06Jul2019,0
754,"Hello guys hope youre having a good day (English is my second language), im a super private guy yet so open to my loved ones, dont take me for a freak but i 100% respect boundaries and shutting down people who are crossing the line is my thing, and by people i mean the kind we all agree not to like, who just want to know literally everything just for the pleasure of knowing which apparently is a thing to them, idk how to describe that kind of people but if you met one youll know, so one of my close friends is cool and everything but he gets weird sometimes, i mean he gets this way only with his besties which are two me and my other friend but totally normal with everyone else, and by weird i mean obsessive, i want you to help me describe this thing idk what its called, not to mention the times i shut him down for asking things which is none of his business but he gets a little pale when i shut him, one time i told him i need a ride to the shrink i have a car but i needed someone it was my first time, so he told me he want to get in and insisted and i refused then he got a little pale as usual even though i told him people tend to not feel open and comfortable when going to the shrink, he said: ‚Äúits okay its up to you‚Äù with a depressed way, and theres this time when i was talking to him over the phone and he asked me what do i have today and i told him i have a dentist appointment, he told me can i go with u i said no proplem, (then I realized ‚Äúhey! hes not normal! set boundaries again!‚Äù) then i said but you wont come inside you have to wait in the chairs then he got mad and i said what is wrong with you? He said its okay to tag along with a patient to the doctor, i said this is a dentist the only thing youll see is my mouth wide open he said its fine, the phone call got long and weird i was explaining how he is not normal and its not normal to do things like that, he got mad and wont listen he said its a point of view and not necessarily true, after this twisted talk he said how about we hang out and talk about this then i said: ‚Äúno, i said what needs to be said‚Äù then told him to end call cuz im late, then he called like a dozen of times and i didnt answer then he texted: ‚Äúyou know I sometimes get a little curious ^laughing face^‚Äù i didnt reply, then I realized how often he calls me and its ALOT, i mean i always shut my phone silent and ignore every non family call cuz i dont feel like going out and stuff, and i have alot of missed calls from him maybe too many?, and I forgot to mention the most annoying thing, he stares alot in a creepy way like when you‚Äôre sitting far or anything he stares at the back of your head and when you turn around he looks away, theres one time i was playing video games and he was staring at my most of the time (someone else saw him this time i couldnt tell because when i look at him hes looking at me i thought he was looking at the tv the whole time) he asks about alot of details when he knows i went out, and gets gloomy when he knows i gone out with someone else, theres one time i was playing fortnite and i gave someone a heart emoticon he asked me what is this? I lookedat him and said what the heck? he got all stupid and I burned him with what the heck is wrong with you you stupid axe dumbo then he said that he meant what are those emoticons and what do they do in game and that is not what he meant, i want to point out some things: he didnt and dont like playing video games ever, hes kinda illiterate and yes despite those major differences we‚Äôre friends, and lastly, hes 100% not gay, i know one when i see one, despite all of this hes a good friend he helped me alot even financially and is a great example of a good friend despite the issues, Sorry for all this but i really need an advice and thank you so much for reading this dull paragraph youre the best for helping people!",06Jul2019,1
755,"**TLDR; I have no sense of belonging, leading me to far-right hate groups, but I need something to be a part of, and I also really need to find out who I am and what I‚Äôm supposed to do in the future.**

I‚Äôm 16, and have struggled with increasingly worsening depression and anxiety for a number of years now. It got especially bad just over a year ago, and this is when I began to seek help from doctors and therapists, although with no success. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm this way, my life as it is right now, and my inability to move on and change my way or thinking leaves little room for happiness or optimism. I‚Äôm mentioning this because I think it‚Äôs probably relevant.

I‚Äôve been thinking deeply about who I am, and what I aspire to be. I feel like I don‚Äôt really know myself, and my ambitions for the future in terms of career and lifestyle change all the time. 

Should I go to university? What would I study? Or should I instead ditch further education, and focus on making money through stocks, and e-commerce? Do I plan on early financial independence? Will I travel the world, always on the move, or will I settle down? City or smallholding? 

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm always asking myself these questions, I‚Äôll latch onto one idea for a bit, thinking I have a plan, but then I‚Äôll drift off to something completely different. Is this an age thing? Do you grow out of it?

With that, I‚Äôm also uncertain of my philosophical and political beliefs. I‚Äôm realising how much I‚Äôve been following my heart, and not my brain. What typically happens is that I‚Äôll militantly join and immerse myself in group, and become completely invested in it. I lack a sense of belonging, and I love the community ‚Äúus vs them‚Äù of it all. Or at least I used to.

As I‚Äôve deteriorated as a person, I have had a growing interest in increasingly worse ideologies and groups. A few years ago, these alt-lite gatherings were more popular, and weren‚Äôt under as much fire. Either that, or I was just in a bubble, and didn‚Äôt realise the backlash we were getting. Whatever the case, I‚Äôve gone from centre-right, to dabbling in the whole cultural Marxism thing, and, have upvoted and shared less than kind things about LGBT people, women, and minorities. Most of the time, I don‚Äôt really agree with what‚Äôs being said, but it‚Äôs been a relief to me to see others (if I feel as though I‚Äôve been hurt by them) get put down, and groups I belong to defended. ‚ÄúUs vs them‚Äù really strikes a chord with me. Don‚Äôt know much about the EU, but I supported Brexit. And I feel kind of bad because I‚Äôm realising not only how shitty this behaviour makes me feel, but also the harm it‚Äôs doing, empowering hatred. But I‚Äôm able to convince myself of completely ridiculous ideas, and can make sense of anything. Even fundamentalist Christianity has sounded appealing recently.

I‚Äôm active on social media, and criticism of my ‚Äúviews‚Äù is inescapable. If I see a video arguing for feminism where the presenter is somewhat intelligent and reasonable, I get angry and try to find fault with everything they say. Then depressed afterwards for the rest of the day, if my opinion on something has become indefensible, or at least unpopular. 

I‚Äôm not saying all of my beliefs are wrong, but I would like to come out of the darkness and be more level headed, and I would like to make more informed judgements. **Any advice on how to do this, and how to stop finding appeal in these hate groups?**",06Jul2019,1

759,"I'm attending one of my good friend's wedding soon. And I'm curious to what you guys think is a reasonable wedding gift?

&amp;#x200B;

For some background, it's an out of town wedding, so I'll be flying there. And I also attended the out of town bachelorette party and spent \~$500 on travel, the air bnb, and bars. I've also recently moved this same month to a new state for a new job (without relocation assistance), and I really don't want to keep digging further into my savings (I'm only a few years out of college and am very focused on saving money).

&amp;#x200B;

Is between $50 to $100 on a wedding gift too cheap if I'm going without a plus one? I basically want to know how little I can spend without just being an absolute ass hole..

&amp;#x200B;

After everything, this wedding will be close to \~$1000 ($500 bachelorette, $200 airfare, $ 150 hotel, + wedding gift). Because I went to the bachelorette party (and also spent $40 on a gift for her there, as well as a lot of drinks at bars), does that alleviate me a little  bit from giving so much at the wedding?",06Jul2019,1

761,"We dated for a few years, years shortly following a close family members passing. This led to some emotional and mental challenges, especially around this time of year. We split last year, and I asked for no contact because I think I was the more vulnerable one at the time and that would help me move on. I was updating my phones calendar today and saw a reminder that this was the day that family member passed away, and I recalled how difficult a time this could be.  Part of me considered reaching out, as not many people were aware of this. But also, since I was part of this person‚Äôs support system , would doing this be a net negative and make things worse? 

So my question is, do I reach out in a delicate way to simply check in, or would this be more hurtful than helpful?",06Jul2019,1
762,"I (finally) have a full-time position pending with a company and I have a trial shift scheduled for Tuesday to see how I feel working there. It‚Äôs the last step before an offer.

I want to make good money but I don‚Äôt think the full time job is right for me because the manager said it‚Äôs extremely demanding position with a lot of pressure and responsibility. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a good idea to jump in the deep end like that after not working for a year. 

I feel like a burden to everyone that‚Äôs been helping me with money.

763,"So yesterday morning I was woken up by mam ringing me. As soon as I answered I knew something was up. She told me that while she was pregnant with me she found out my dad was having an affair and got the other woman pregnant. She decided to stay married if he cut ties with this other woman. I don't really know if she still loved him after this but she said they worked it out. I guess her main reason for staying married was for me and my older brothers sake. 

My dad also had another daughter from a previous marriage (let's call her Dee because this will get confusing with two half sisters) who was living with them at this time. Around when I was born she moved to England to be with her mother (we were living in USA at this time). Looking at it now I guess her move was probably a result of the affair.

So my parents decided to stay together and agreed they wouldn't mention the affair to us. They went on to have two more kids, my younger sister and brother. When I was 6 we moved to Ireland and that's where we grew up.

My Dad and Dee lost touch and little bit but that was due to other reasons. She's much alot older than me and had alot going on. A few years back they got back in touch and for the first time she was getting to know us properly. 

So 5 years ago my half sister from my dads affair (let's call her Ginny) wanted answers about her dad I guess. So she managed to find him on facebook, my dad isn't active on facebook but she was able to contact my uncle who in turn contacted my dad. I guess it's important to the story to know that we're not close to my dads side of the family. So anyways Ginny and her mam were gonna be in Ireland as a graduation present and she wanted to meet my dad. My dad went to meet them and they spent a few hours together. He never told my mam or any of us that this happened. 

So because she contacted my uncle looking for my dad that side of the family learned about her. Earlier this week (5 years after my dad went to meet Ginny) Dee, my older brother and my little sister recieved facebook messages from a cousin we don't really know and Dee has never met saying that we had a half sister that she thinks should be part of the family. 

So this is when my mam called me. She said she wanted me to hear it from her before my cousin could message me to.

I'm kinda still in shock about finding all this out. I'm pretty angry at my cousin for how she told my siblings. My older brother is autistic so there was no way of knowing how he would react to this news. I don't know if Ginny does want to have contact with us or not but I feel if she did and told my cousin that she did my cousin should have brought it to my dad to tell us instead of taking it into her own hands. 

My dad has called all of us since we found out and apologised and answered questions.
I don't really feel angry at my dad, it happened before I was born and him and my mam resolved it. I do feel ashamed and disappointed though, I had a really close relationship with him and always looked up to him. I feel pretty let down. 

My mam is pretty angry that he met up with Ginny and didn't tell her. She feels there was no point in hiding it from her as she already knew and that if he decided to go meet her that he should have told us about everything. 
I can understand why he didn't tell us about going to see her but I do feel he shoulda talked to my mam about it. 

So I guess I want to know if others have been in this situation? Should I try to reach out to Ginny? Or wait and see if she wants contact?
Has anyone mended a relationship with a parent who had an affair? 

Thanks for taking the time to read this ramble. Sorry if this was all over the place, I'm currently in work and my mind is just all over the place.",06Jul2019,2

772,"Me and my gf live in KY and we are currently in our first apartment. its very spacious and on the 3rd floor and is low rent but it has a lot of issues. 

The landlord said it has central AC which it technically does, but since the building is so old it does not work to cool down the apt even when its running. with that and a window AC and a box fan running 24/7, it can only ever be about 10 degrees cooler than whatever it is outside (which is bad bc its currently about 80 inside bc it is about 90 outside right now). 

The landlord has called people to try to fix the AC issue multiple times but it looks like its just a shitty building.

We are paying about $200/mo in gas + electric for a 1bed/1bath ~700 sq ft apt bc of all of this. 

also we were told there was laundry on site and there is not bc the previous management company nailed the basement door shut before the landlord repoed it from them. 

Basically, it is getting unbearable and we desperately want to move out but neither of us have the savings to afford a security deposit/first months rent/movers (bc were on the 3rd floor and theres no elevator)/etc. 

My dad is saying i shouldnt do it but its very tempting. I hate coming home every day. I would expect to have a p high APR bc i am 19 and my credit history is less than a year however i do have a car loan and a credit card and i have never missed any payment on either of those so my credit is above 650. 

i think it would be worth it but everybody else is telling me it wouldnt. I dont know when we would have enough money saved up and still have emergency funds left over that could take years.

it also seems like i cant see what my payments/APR would be without actually applying for a loan? or am i just being paranoid are loan companies allowed to do that?
