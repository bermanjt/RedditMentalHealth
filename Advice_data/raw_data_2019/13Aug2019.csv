1,"I know you're all probably already typing out a comment telling me it's their life and I need to respect that but hear me out. I've been procrastinating reading through hundreds of other posts here before typing this because I'm so worried. Also I'm using an alt account because some of friends follow my main and I'd prefer them not to see this. Also sorry for the terrible formatting I'm on mobile so I'll try and keep this as short as possible.(failed)

So my(16M from uk) parents don't have a good relationship. Not good at all. It's been the same all my life and it's just been getting worse. I say they don't have a good relationship but the truth is my dad is just verbally (and sometimes physically) abusive to both me and my mum. He also has a bad drinking problem. Every day when we're all together something tiny will happen e.g. one of us will give our say into a normal conversation and perhaps dad hasn't quite finished his long speech on the subject. This will result in dad shouting at both of us if it was me(she allowed me to do it and now isn't backing him up) or just mum if it was her. This will then spiral out of control and then when I decide to just leave and go upstairs to get away from it, like you're taught when you're younger, I'm called an immature pussy or such.

Recently mum had been sleeping in the spare bedroom and this has been happening without my knowledge because I normally go to bed before my mum but a few days ago my mum felt ill so she went to bed early and I found she wasn't in her usual bed. I asked her why and apparently it's been like this for weeks.

Something more disturbing which happened was last week when we were on holiday, there was a huge horrible argument. I honestly can't remember what it was about but after I had just gone to my room in the air BnB(very small apartment so I could hear everything) I heard a slap then my mum started crying. I ran in and saw my dad over my mum screaming at her calling her a cunt and a useless bitch and everything in between. I simply pushed him once to get him away from her and then he was like, ""so, you want to get involved as well?"" My mum screamed and tried to get in-between us but I managed to kick him onto the sofa in the stomach. He was a few bottles of wine down at this point so easily toppled onto the sofa, mum started actually getting angry at him and saying how she hates him and how maybe he should just fuck off. All with me in the room. Dad goes into the bedroom and tells mum she can sleep on the sofa and he'll leave and go to another hotel in the morning. Mum then comes into my room crying saying sorry and that I didn't have to see that, she says dad will have forgotten in the morning and it will be fine. He hadn't forgot and he did leave. This happens alot, something horrible will happen in the evening and then mum will just hope he forgets then the next morning they'll act like nothing happened

The few days where it was just me and mum were the nicest few days I think I've had in months. And when we met back with dad the day before our ferry back he said his were too. That night though the same happened again, this time I don't know if he hit mum but he shouted when I confronted him ""what are you going to do about it big man?"" I felt like I was in some American step dad abuses mother, teenager film. 

EDIT: just reading this back now and ik people will be just go to the police, it's not as easy as that. Dad's told me all my life of I did that I'd be being a traitor and even me going to a therapist was me being a traitor. Also I still don't want to go the the police because its still my dad.

There's a few more layers to this story you need to understand first. Firstly I go to a very expensive fee paying school in the UK. I went to one councilor session about this after Xmas because there was quite a rough patch then. They advised me Flexi-boarding(boarding 2 or 3 nights a week) so I had a few nights away from the arguing so I could actually get work done. My gcse's last year were poor(still got an A*(8) in maths) and I probably could've done much better and the same with my mock a-levels recently. This caused my dad to phone the school and ask them what he should do with me. I then had a meeting with my house parent(guy who runs the boarding house and is basically like it says, my parent in school) and he said enjoy my summer, do a bit of work and come back in September and work hard then. Dad thinks however he said 3 hours work every day and no screens at all(if you're wondering how I'm typing this I'm on my old phone my mum's letting me have because she says it would be unfair otherwise but she doesn't like hiding it from dad for me though) and no staying away from home so no partys or sleepovers. And then with the 3 hours a day that means I can barely see my friends. 

Sorry I just went off on a huge tangent then and I didn't mean to. What that was getting to was that my house parent texted me after the 2 incedents on holiday happened asking me how everything was going so I replied by telling him what I've just told you. He simply didn't reply. This is the teacher who in my meeting he asked what I want from life right now, I replied to be happy and not have to worry and so much stuff about my parents and to get rid of my anxiety and depression and he just smirked and said no, I'm not worried about that, you want to do well in school don't you. 

Whenever I do work dad is always there, shouting at me reminding me how I failed my mocks and did awfully in my gcse's so I should work harder but it really doesn't help. It just makes me want to cry. I used to cry alot actually but now I just don't even though worse things are happening, idk if that's good or bad.

My grandad(dad's dad) ran off away from my grandmother when my dad was 12 and that really messed him up and at one point he said to me that if that hadn't happened he probably would've left my mum by now. Mum however says that it's stupid and of course she not going to split up with my dad.

Is there any way I can make my mum know how I feel without deeply offending her and causing another argument. It also seems they are fine when I'm not around either so it's it my fault?

3,"So one of my best friends has recently gotten back together with her ex despite him being abusive, used her and in general just being a complete cunt to everyone. 

She has come to me countless times before crying over the phone about how she feels like shit and how he's pressuring her constantly to have sex with him, but she is way too loveblind to see that he's the worst thing for her.

Also, I kinda have a crush on her as well which is killing me every time anything happens.

5,"When I was in 8th grade, I wanted to keep in touch with my middle school friends who were all going to different high schools, so I created an email account. My parents found out, I was hit, lectured, distrusted, and just generally scolded for a long time afterwards, even to this day (almost 5 years later).

The only thing my parents allow is text messaging, but -- let's be realistic -- there's so much information you can get from sites like facebook or even reddit that you can't get from just texting the limited number of people whose numbers you might have. So, when I was a junior in hs, I created a facebook account, which my parents do not know about. Every day, I get more and more worried that they'll find out, and with college just around the corner, there are a lot of things (like buying books, finding a roommate, etc) that I would do through Facebook but can't because I'd have to explain to my parents how I found the information in the first place...

The one thing my parents hate more than anything is me lying to them/not telling them things, and I want to tell them about my account, but I'm just too scared, I don't think I can deal with being hit so much again. I'm thinking that once I get to college, it won't be a problem anymore, but...what do I do? Should I tell them? Is there a way to soften the blow? (I actually wrote up an essay about what I believe are the benefits of FB and why I think it's a necessity for connections and information etc, but I doubt that'll make any difference if they find out)

Thank you if you read this :)",13Aug2019,2
6," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",13Aug2019,1

8,"In freshman year, my best friend, a girl, told me she liked me. But she had a boyfriend, but we kinda j sent hearts and stuff, and never did anything. Then we ended it, but it was bad. Then 2 years later, she added me on Instagram, and asked for streaks on Snapchat. We started talking, and after a couple day, I got some nudes and after that we were becoming a thing. Then one day, after 12 days, she told me not to open the next snaps, and when I tried to see what it was, it was someone telling me it was her boy friend, and I “best stay away blood”. Now I know there is a guy, her ex, who is blackmailing her, but she’s still friends with him and talks with him all the time. We used to snap constantly btw, we snapped the most out of anyone else she talked to. Then she randomly told me her mom saw something, and she has to un add me on Snapchat, but she said we can still talk on Instagram. But now, she takes hours to respond even though I know she’s on her phone. I thought everything was going amazing, because she was really into me. But now she won’t respond to my dms, what should I do?
It’s been 2 days like this. 

TL;DR: talking to ex, after two years, she’s really into me, unadds me on Snapchat saying her mom forced her too. Now takes hours to respond even when she’s on her phone. What do I do?",13Aug2019,2

11,"Title says it all... this morning my friend (let’s call her Em) commented on my Instagram post, but deleted it a few moments later when I tried to reply to it.

I asked her why she did that as I was curious, she played dumb until I eventually said to her I saw her comment where I proceeded to say it word for word. Em opened up saying she couldn’t let her FWB (let’s call him Jo) see the comment cause it might stir shit between them.

Now my understanding of a FWB is no strings or emotions attached, but regardless we’re nothing more than friends. So I said to Em “but we’re just friends? I don’t get why you or I can’t comment/tag eachother in photos? Why do we have to worry about Jo?” It then followed up with “because he actually likes me and is very protective and hates any guys talking to me”.

Now for me, my breakup with my ex of 3.5 years (~6 months ago) was due to her being unable to be seen with me, show me off and essentially it was because she was cheating. I’ve promised myself that I’d learn from that and only put effort into those that put effort into me.... and right now it’s just making me question our “friendship”. Because last week she went to the bathroom while out with my friends for some drinks (which I invited her to come with). It ended up being over a hour later where I got a text from her saying she went home cause something came up.... no explanation, nothing.

I got her and I a ticket to a festival which sold out almost instantly. I didn’t have to get her this ticket, but offered as long as she payed me. Majority of my friends missed out on tickets and I’m honestly considering giving her money back, and selling my ticket to a friend who actually WANTS to go. Note: She didn’t thank me either, and was hanging out with Jo when I got the ticket.

So my question is, would it be reasonable to give Em her money back and sell the ticket to a closer friend? Or would that be wrong? The tickets are under my name and account.....

TL;DR: “Friend” said she cannot he seen talking/with me as it will make her FWB annoyed.",13Aug2019,2

14,"I fked up. 

So 3 days ago I got a response from the HR department concerning my job application and she gave me instructions on how to proceed to continue with the job application, which involves going to the government and ask whether I am admissible to the program, since the program is funded by the government. I wanted to respond to the message and send a message to HR when I actually have a response and know about the status of my file, because I thought it would be easier with much less hassle. And so I went, but the bureau was closed when I got there. And today I went again thinking that the process was going to be fast and swift, but it seems that the procedure is way complicated than what i was expecting. So I sent the HR person an email saying sorry for the delay of 3 days because i miscalculated how long the process was going to take and told her that i would send her a message the minute i get an answer about my application in the program. 

But im wondering if that is enough. If my wait of 3 days have left her sour about my job application, that i am now out of the running, if i should give her a call in addition to the email presenting my apologies for the delay

The past few times that I've seemed to develop some sort of relationship since this long hiatus I've gotten ghosted, gotten used, and I've ended up feeling undesirable.

However, I think it would be nice to have my own spending money, and plus it would look attractive on a resume. 

My main concern is not being able to handle all the responsibilities. Last semester I frequently became burnt out due to the amount of work I did for class, and I'm afraid the job would worsen that condition if it arose again.

17," Alright so I'm posting this on this alt account. 

 Anyways. I live with my grandmother and my mother. I'm going into my senior year of High School and I'm wondering how to handle this home situation.

 My grandmother lately has been treating me more like a servant than a grandchild. I'm not being overdramatic, trust me. She calls me up to do so many things for her many MANY times day, like constantly filling her cup up with water, making her food, watering her plants, and other stuff. My issue isn't that she's asking me for this stuff, because she isn't. She commands me to do it. She always talks to me in this dismissive yet commanding tone, never saying please and thank you. She doesn't even call me by name sometimes, she'll literally just give a command and if I don't get up within 5 seconds she starts yelling. 

 I don't mind doing stuff for her, like reaching stuff she can't get to or going downstairs to grab something since she can't get up and down stairs very well. It's just the way she talks to me and treats me. If I question a command she gets an attitude and gets mad at me. If I don't get up to do something fast enough (which isn't long, trust me) she rushes me. If I don't do something correct and gets mad at me, even though she gives me very vague instructions and sometimes doesn't even give me instructions at all. Cusses at me for no good reason and other just bitter things. 

 However. The whole tone changes when my mom is around. She never asks me for anything, she'll get up and get it herself. Which she's capable of doing, she's not wheelchair bound or very frail. She can get around fine when she wants to. She changes her tone with me completely. This is because my mom knows that she's capable of doing stuff on her own without issue and her calling me is mostly an act of laziness. Also my mother gets very upset when she talks to me in an aggressive or very commanding tone. It really bothers her.

 But the second my mom leaves she goes back to the way she usually is. Honestly, I don't know what to do. 

 I've told my mom about my grandma's behavior multiple times but she refuses to talk to her about it. If I try to say anything it's me being inconsiderate or selfish.

 Part of me thinks it's because I'm going to be leaving off to college in about a year and she doesn't like that. Especially since I plan on going pretty far away. I don't want to leave home with this kind of relationship with my grandma because I'm worried it might make me not want to come and visit often. She wasn't always like this. She wasn't even this way when my grandpa passed away. I don't know why her entire attitude toward me just changed so suddenly.

 So what should I do about it? Just wait it out? Do I say something? Distract myself?",13Aug2019,1
18,"I am a guy and I was close friends with a few people in college. We would hang out and they knew me pretty well. After college most people kind of stopped talking to me. I would reach out and they wouldnt reply or barely reply. One girl I knew would say we should hang out with some of our friends or would reply but then she would just stop and never reach out herself.

Her birthday came up and she invited me to go and I did. I tried to keep in touch but again she would barely respond and I decided to leave it alone. If she cared she would reach out. My birthday was a few months later and she never said a word, didnt text me or anything, not many people did regardless. 

After that I realized she wasnt that good of a friend and decided to stop caring. One thing she had done was try and make me admit I was a virgin at a party twice. I never told her I was but she probably assumed it. She already knew how hard dating was for me and what I was going through but that always stung. It has been like a year and a half since that stuff happened though.

I was not popular, outgoing, or ever even had a relationship like her or the other people we would hang out with.

Anyways, she reached out to me now, almost a year later, and is asking me to go to her party. I dont really know what to say. I feel like not responding like she has done to me before. I feel like I have been there for her and many other friends many times so it feels shitty being reached out to now, like I am just there to add to her group of friends rather than actually be her friend.

Another guy we would hang out with also randomly reached out wanting to hang out a few weeks ago. He would barely reply to my texts, most of the time wouldnt at all, so I told him sure to just let me know when. He never said anything since. I was really dumb before, I would be really available and basically show up to anything or go along with what they were doing to be with them.

I've done dumb shit and said dumb stuff like literally everybody on the planet but I'm worried it's gonna come back to me. Like I've said dumb sexual stuff for shock value that I don't believe in and stuff like that, and I'm a better person now so I've let it go and I don't do stuff like that anymore. I think I'm a good person, I've just gone through a crappy period in my life I've recovered from.

Today I got a series of weird messages on Twitter anonymously (using a service called Curiouscat) calling me a freak and insisting I'm a freak and that I'm ""easy to laugh at"". I don't really know who they are, but I'm not very attached to my twitter so I made a new one on private 'cause I don't want some weirdo sitting on my page and reading my posts to make fun of me. When I changed twitters, I got a message on my Tumblr saying I'm a ""sickening human being"" and that they're tired of breathing the same air as me. I have a pretty decent following as an artist on tumblr and I don't wanna just ditch an account, and I don't want to have some terrible post digging up dumb shit I've said prior to crumble my online identity. I'm an artist that makes money off commission work, so it's important to me. If I knew it could come back to bite me, and that me being respected online was kinda important in the future, I wouldn't have said all that dumb shit. I've changed my username, disabled anon, moved twitters, etc.

Am I worried for no reason? I don't really know who this person is or why they'd be mad at me, or if it would be anyone I've said wack shit around. What should I do? Do I make statement about it or something? Wait for something bad to happen? :/",13Aug2019,1

They all seemed pretty nice and we seemed to be having fun. A little later, one of the friends kind of ran past me and started dancing with the male friend. She then asked me to please leave her and her friends alone. I kindly agreed and a short while later it dawned on me that she probably thought I was trying to get with the guy.

I was thinking I can finally buy a house for my mother, make her life comfortable with all the appliances I could buy for her. I also thought of being able to fly to another country for vacation.

He asked me recently how I was, and I told him I wasn't doing good mentally. I had some dark thoughts that were on my mind. I was at work, and he offered to talk anytime if I need to. He said he would be there for me with anything. 

Anyways, I talked to him for a bit and he helped me out a bit with the things on my mind. It feels really good to talk to someone, especially a close friend. However, I thought of more things after we talked and kept asking to talk. At this point I felt almost like I was being that person who needs attention and ""that depressed friend."" Like when he sees my messages asking to talk, I feel like that would annoy him. However, he keeps telling me that it's no problem again since we are friends. 

He went on vacation yesterday and we talked a bit about that. At the end, he told me to message him if I need anything no matter what.

But in my mind, I still feel like I am annoying him. Do I have trust issues with people? I don't know how to make myself believe it's okay. Even if he hasn't said anything, I still believe I am annoying.

29,I work at an income tax place and I will be there for 2 months now on the 25th. Since I will be going back to school in August I was thinking of quiting. I am studying psychology. Would those two months of work be good still to put on my resume. I will probably only focus in school until January and I plan on. Getting another job until then. I wanted to stick out the job but I only get paid 7.25 And I know it's winning me money but I feel like I will be stressed. Alot of people tell me I'm lucky to have that job since I only have my high school degree but that job is not making me happy and I get really nervous everyday just thinking that I will go to work. I can do the work it's just since I don't know much and doing taxes does not interest me is why I don't want to keep going partly. Will I be doing wrong if I quit or should I opt out to other choices.,13Aug2019,2

In the past we got into a heated argument about washing hair. She was saying how she washes her hair every 3-4 months and I was trying to tell her that she should be washing it at least a couple times a week. I believe that she’s in denial about her bad hygiene so that’s why she didn’t take my advice in the past.

Chris Brickley went UL as player and learned the game from one the best coaches to ever do it &amp; got in the coaching game at a D1 school when he was 24 because of the connection to Coach Pitino.

In particular, a kid I used to be better friends out of anyone in our group has just fucking picked on me. Like, he’ll judge anything I wear, size of my skinny arms but my fat belly (lol) and literal racist jokes about my mum. I fucking hate him. Everyone else finds it funny and they’re all so immature to me now. 
None of them support me in any way and I just can’t stand it anymore. There’s only so much ‘jokes’ I’m willing to take 
They all pick on me about my weird size and anything I bring up (literally fucking anything) somehow turns out into an argument because the one kid HAS to disagree with me. 

For example, I said ‘you should’ve gone to that party, I would’ve gotten a taxi there lool!!’ 
HE SAID, ‘no you wouldn’t have 😂😂😂😂’

43,"Hi, thanks for reading!

Well, I'm not sure how to explain this, but I feel like, in the exterior, I'm not the same person I am in my mind. I have always thought that there is this duality in me, like I'm two persons at the same time, one is the one everyone can see, and the other is the one that lives in my mind. I think that I identify more with the one in my mind, but she is not the one in charge, she's only there, passively waiting while the other one lives her life. I'm sorry if this sounds confusing, I don't know how to explain it and English is not my mother language.

I would like to have the one in my mind be the one in charge, as she is more confident than the other one, but I don't know if it's possible to do that... I'm not even sure why I feel like this. It's not like I feel like I have multiple personalities or anything, it's more like in my mind I am a different person than the one I project to my exterior.

If anyone has some advice on how to change this or some books or things that I could read, I would really appreciate it.",13Aug2019,1
44,"Im (25m) wondering which is the best move to make. I definitely have a strong desire to travel to Australia for a year to experience living out of my home country and beat the very bleak and depressing winters here, and to gain life experience. I never really had the oppurtunity to travel before, I didnt have enough money in the jobs I worked when I finished school, then I was in a relationship for a few years and couldnt really do it then either. I am in a job and position now to travel now as I can afford to do so. I feel a massive need go do this at the age of 25, I have spent the last 7 years hanging around my hometown working for close to minimum wage and never going anywhere other than nights out with friends locally or the occasional holiday. The thing is, I have no real qualifications from education, I have a very low level qualification in horticulture and landscape gardening but recently got a job with a Civil Engineer and I have been loving working in this field. I have been really lucky to get this oppurtunity and I absolutely do not mind getting out of bed in the morning to do this job and has been very rewarding. I have grew up around building sites and construction and has been my place of work through different jobs for the most part of my working life and would not really want to work in anything else. I have been doing this job for over 6 months now and think it would be a wise move to get properly qualified by going to college for at least 2 years to be properly qualified and have a career as such. I can also achieve this through open college, which would mean I could contiue working and gaining experience/A wage as I get qualified. If I take this route, I will get qualified and have a career for myself that I enjoy, but I will also be at least 27 by the time I get to travel and I feel the need to go explore and see the world before I get any older. 

I have no problem only getting qualified in a particular field closer to my thirties or only pursuing education now in my mid twenties, but I do have a problem with letting another 2 years roll by without scratching that itch to travel.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation or can lend any adive here?

46,"I have no hobbies. 

I want a hobby to make friends - I have no friends right now, as well as struggling to meet people (which may be helped if I had a social hobby) the issue is that without hobbies I seem boring as when asked what I do the answer is...'nothing'.

I've tried but nothing seems to stick, unless it's being done with someone else or it has the potential to make money I struggle to see a point. I suffer depression which also makes it hard because nothing excites me at all, and everything feels so dull without someone to enjoy it with. 

I commonly pick up hobbies from SO's - I loved camping, off roading, rockhounding, geocaching, investigating missing persons, etc. but they all were with my ex in a different country, in my home country and without someone to do this with (as I don't drive) these aren't options. My home city is a very boring place, especially by comparison to where I used to live with my ex SO.

I used to go geocaching here, I also liked visiting local places and taking photos - but as I don't drive I can't go far, I've been everywhere locally a million times and without a camera I can only do so much with taking photos. I can't afford to drive, to travel further afield, or buy a camera. Outside these things, which I was into a few years ago, I can't remember really having hobbies.

I've tried indoor rock climbing, archery, and dance classes but on my own it was just no fun. I used to go to the gym regularly but again on my own it was no fun and the fact I wasn't making progress made my depression worse. I've tried going to art classes but it was all old people, I've tried a zine workshop but I'm terrible at being creative and while everyone else got on...I just don't seem to be able to gel with other people, even when I try hobbies to meet people it fails.

Things like drawing at home seems completely pointless, I've tried making miniatures and sculpting but...I see no point in it if it's not either making me friends or making me money. I just can't get into these things, at home I spend most of my time online and the idea of sitting trying to force myself into being arty isn't appealing.

I can't afford anything like buying a camera, an instrument, etc. as I've little disposable income and this is another barrier to finding a hobby. 

I have no real interests, maybe politics but I can't educate myself enough to get into that and it just feels like it'd be a load of drama - I'd not want to get into local politics, I go to the odd talks about political theory but I always feel like a total idiot there when compared to better educated people. 

I've been trying years, I'm not sure what else to try or how to try to force myself to like something.",13Aug2019,1

I've been trying to figure it out for a while, I've actually ended up with more questions than answers. I live in MN, and every time I try to get a quote for health insurance online, it never ends up helping me at all. In fact it actually caused the exact opposite, and because I had to always provide my phone number, long story short once I got 97 phone calls in a span of 24 hours from different phone numbers, people who for sure weren't professionals, nor were they very nice. Each one is now blocked. I'm so confused why this happened! I live in the middle of nowhere currently, so as far as I know I don't have anywhere near to go for help with this. I'm lost on where to go next or what to do. I'm scared I'm going to get myself scammed trying to figure this out.

I work two jobs, neither one considered full time so I am not provided benefits through them. I also live paycheck to paycheck so something affordable is crucial. I have illnesses that need regular check ups, and medication I have to be on. I will be off my parents plan soon so I'm desperately trying to figure this out.

51,"This happened just a few hours ago and I’m feeling very lost. I used to work as a server at a sports bar, but I’m a writer and performer on the side. 6 months ago I found out a show I was working on got into a festival with a number of performances that would take place over a week and a half. I immediately told my managers to request the days off, and got a chuckle from them asking so far in advance.

Over the past 6 months we lost a few people at work and became functionally understaffed, but kept things going because everyone was good at their jobs and no one was upset at making more money.

The month before is where I fucked up some. Though we have to request our days off in advanced it’s also on the servers to find people to cover our shifts. Another server decided to take the same time off work the same time I was leaving, finding people to cover their shifts very quickly. I was overworked preparing for my show as well as a visit from my family and it became clear pretty quickly no one else at work would be able to cover my shifts along with the other server’s. I had been working on this show for nearly a year at this point all in preparation for this festival, so I assumed I could rely on the fact I had asked for these dates so far ahead, and I made no effort to hide that I was leaving as I wasn’t willing to sacrifice all my hard work into the show because of a work conflict.

So I just left. I got a call from my manager a few days into the trip to tell me it had been on me to find my replacement. I knew I messed up so I admitted my fault plainly, (I think my words were “I don’t have an explanation or excuse, this mistake is on me and I’m sorry.”) My manager said she would work to find coverage for me and “this is something that can never happen again. If [Owner] finds out he’s not going to be happy.” I apologized again and got sent a schedule for when I returned that would have had me covering everyone’s shifts for a week.

I went into work today expecting to be chewed out but instead was immediately told by Owner that I was fired for leaving without finding coverage. I figured no use in arguing or putting up a fuss so I accepted my fate and left.

I’m not entirely sure what I should do next. They were justified in firing me as I definitely put the bar in a bad position in my absence which just makes being fired feel shittier. I’m not sure yet how big of a fuck up this is yet, like if I’ll be able to get another serving job with this stain on my resume  (this job is my only experience as a server/food runner which feels important for finding another), or what I should say when I go to pick up my last paycheck (or if I should say anything at all).

How do I manage this?",13Aug2019,1
63,"Just a heads up this is going to be long so thank you in advance if you read the whole thing.

For reference I am F17 and my friends are all the same age, some are 18. Anyway we just graduated highschool and I'm really conflicted. For the sake of the story the friend who Im having problems with is friend A and my other friend will be called friend B. I've been friends with A for 5 years and B for 10.

Okay so for the past year almost I've been having these very..bad thoughts about friend A. It all started when we had this big fight over something I personally thought was really stupid. Friend B and I had plans to hang out together we had a whole day planned. Friend A asked friend B to go to a Halloween party with her. B told me about it but said she didnt want to go since it wasn't really her scene and she didn't want to cancel the plan with me. So I talked to friend A and asked if she wanted to join B and I she said no and I explained to her why B didnt want to go as we already had plans. A ignored me after that and after messaging her constantly about what's wrong she replied very angrily and that just made us both really mad. That fight lead to more I guess we didn't talk for a while and after a week she sent me a meme and I asked her if we could talk about what happened since we both said some pretty mean things but she didnt want to talk so it was left at that.

There were things she said and did during that fight that still bother me now, the fact that she said what she wanted to say then didn't allow me to tell her how I felt. Or the fact that she ignored what happened and tried pretending it didnt happen when she said that would help her but she didn't think about how I would feel about it. She accused me of not being understanding about what she wanted to do while she did the same. I wasn't able to talk out my feelings with her since she told me not to tell her. They've just been bottled up.

Fast forward to January. We get into another fight. Another really petty and honestly pretty stupid in my opinion. She has a crush who also happens to be a teacher at her school. (We go to different schools) I'm following him through my fan account per her request so she can she his stories and posts etc. On the day of the superbowl he posts something about the halftime show and I reply to the story saying ""and they didnt even do sweet victory🙄"" he replies back saying ""ikr"" 

I show her thinking it's something funny but she gets furious. Dosen't say anything other than expressing some anger. I don't say anything learning from our last fight I give her time. Again she sends me a meme a few days later after not talking. I ask if we're good then that sets her off. She goes on a tangent about how creepy and disrespectful I am blah blah. I tell her as calmly as I can that I genuinely don't see what I did wrong. Then she brings up something that i did back in freshman year that I'm very insecure and ashamed about and she knows that as I've talked to her about it multiple times. She says maybe that's because you thought it was okay to do -----. Then goes off again about how terrible what I did was ans how creepy I am for following Jim in the first place..even though shes the one who requested me to. I don't reply I don't know what to say and I was honestly really hurt by what she said. I learned from our last fight not to say things that could be hurtful in a fit of anger. She didn't.. she was acting the same way she did after our first fight and I believe that's because we never talked about it. A couple hours after her little rant about how terrible i am she sends me a meme..again. At this point I've had it, people tell me I'm a pushover and I was fed up with her not trying to resolve anything with me and just ignore it. I tell her this and she says ""this is my way of trying to be okay"" and I ask her what if there are things I want to talk about? I mention the last fight we had and how she did the same thing that time. After some talking and arguing she reluctantly agrees. 

So I tell her what I've been feeling since the last fight everything that I've felt since then and now. How I think we both could've handled it better and how I think she could have. I asked her if there waa anything she thought I could improve on in the future. She leaves me on seen. This was.back in January. For a few months after that we were on really weird terms. Not really talking we weren't bad but just awkward. For me at i was in a really bad place and I didn't really have anyone. So feeling like I had lost one of my best friends wasnt helping. At the same time though I had grown this anger for her that had been there growing since out first fight. I hated it. I would feel anger about everything about her. And feel mad and envious for everything she did. I would feel like she didnt value me or respect me even though I know that may not be true? Just all the small things she did annoyed me. It was lile the feelings you get when you hate someone but I don't hate her..right? 

These feelings wouldn't go away I just felt this unneccessary anger towards her and I hated it because I love her and I love being her friend but my mind would say otherwise. I talked to friend B about this and she told me just to talk to friend A. I was apprehensive, friend A and I were already on shaky terms and we were very awkward with each other but I figured things would only get worse so I told her..almost everything I told her obviously in a more gentle way. I understand that it's a hard pill to swallow but I waa hoping we could talk it out
 Nothing happened she said a few words like ""oh I'm sorry you feel like that"" and that was that. 

One day she having a real bad day and she really needed someone so she came over and I think that's when all the awkardness and beef sort of dissipated. That was back in April. We are on good terms now but I still have that feeling of anger and..everything else.

I hate this feeling. It's like feeling like I hate her but I know I don't. I don't know what to do. I feel like such a terrible friend for feeling like this but I'm truly at a loss. Am I toxic? Is she? Or am i just crazy...

I have no idea what to do at this point.",13Aug2019,1
64,"So I have 3 plain nice leatherbound A4 notebooks that I haven’t used in months, simply because I don’t have a structure to plan and include everything I want to include.

I don’t have the patience or desire to do a colourful and pretty bullet journal (although if that’s your thing, keep going at it) nor do they seem really that effective for what I want, they’re just kind of art pieces (which again, is fine, but not what I want).

The charge is a check fraud charge and it is a six month sentence. My daughter she seems to be handling it fine. I told her right away about it and she reacted pretty calmly. I told her mom did the wrong thing and is rightfully serving her punishment. They have a good relationship. The main problem I have is she will see her mom in a jail jumpsuit and see guards and other inmates that could be intimidating.My daughter doesn’t seem Scared but rather enthusiastic and excited but I still am not sure it is a good idea. Seeing someone she knows in jail could “humanize” the place. You want to go remain a place for “bad people” and seeing her mom there will probably take away that effect",13Aug2019,0
66,"Hi all,
I (f17) decided three days before my school started to switch schools from public to private. I’m honestly tired of being depressed all the time and wanted to change something. A few months ago my parents asked me if I wanted to switch and I was dead set against it. But lately I’ve changed my mind. How can I expect different results if I keep doing the same thing, right?

Because it came out of nowhere, the hardest part was telling my boyfriend (m17) of two years. He’s really upset that we won’t be going into our junior year together. He’s glad I’m taking care of me but he’s still sad. My other close friends are taking it a little better but they’re also still sad. Any advice on how to make the transition better for the people I care are would be awesome.

Recently, I’ve got into a bit of a tough situation..

Well, about a year &amp; a half ago I dated a man for a short period of time. The relationship lasted approximately 2 months. After our relationship ended, he begged me to go back and even cried to me on the phone saying he would randomly show up to my apartment or the gym I attend.

He got back with the mother of his child and they seemed happy. She found out we dated for a brief period of time and I told her everything that happened because she asked. I told her we were intimate because I guess he said we weren’t.

Fast forward to now, a year and a half later. I’ve had well over 20 fake accounts follow me to see what I post. I’ve had numerous messages harassing me. I have had accounts message my current boyfriend and his mother. I’m assuming all of these people are my ex. His girlfriend even messages my underage sister threatening to beat her up and find out where she goes to school. He has threatened to kill me and my boyfriend. He has also threatened to show up to my apartment to harm me.

I forgot I had sent him an explicit video, which he sent to my boyfriend’s mother. He also said I was cheating on my boyfriend, which is a lie. To make sure it was my ex, I looked at his girlfriend’s twitter account where she described the video and laughed about it saying it was “gross”. 

I filed a police report and now I have a court date for a restraining order. I’m very nervous he’s going to try to retaliate even more. I’m not sure if he remembers where I live. I’m constantly anxious and paranoid. 

Did I make a mistake by doing something about it &amp; going to court? Or should I have ignored it? I’m all mixed up right now..",13Aug2019,1

71,"Hi everyone, 

The title says it all really, I'm looking for some advice and to see other people's opinions on my partner not finding me attractive anymore.

For a bit of background we have been together nearly 7 years, we started dating in college, and we've been engaged for a couple of years as well. We have lived together for over a year and have a nice home together and two great dogs. I know we both love each other and we're completely comfortable with each other, we like to have long open talks about everything. 

We've been trying out being Polyamorous (I've done this in past relationships and it's always been just fine but hadn't ever done this with my partner), he actually suggested we try it out a few months ago and while I've been chatting to a few different people I haven't met anyone yet (overall I'm not actually that interested in other people). I can see the benefit of him having more experiences as he's only ever been with me and I think more perspective in general can help him. I have Multiple sclerosis and after work I am tired most days and get a lot of pain; I still try my best but he often wants to do certain things that I just can't manage anymore so I thought why not let him have fun with other girls so he isn't frustrated. 

Anyway in a recent conversation, it came out that he's more attracted to other girls than me, one in particular that he's very into and has already met with. We had set rules for being Poly and he did break all of the rules he came up with when he was with her which he apologised about and we've re-established some rules, I'm still feeling insecure about it but it's 50/50 between being a negative and positive thing to try out.

I'm just not sure how to deal with the fact that he finds other girls more attractive than me, and that he doesn't find me as attractive as he used too. I know there's a few things I can work on right away like losing a bit of weight, put more effort into dressing etc but any other advice / opinions would be great. We discussed what we want to do and we don't want to break up but we also don't see how things can be the same, we've decided to move forward and try to think of our own relationship in a more casual sense, just try to have a bit of fun for a while and try things out with other people to see if he still wants to commit to a real relationship with me. In the meantime how do I deal with not feeling wanted / unattractive?

Thank you.",13Aug2019,1
72,"I went to this club with two of my closest friends.

We were meeting up with some of his friends too. But they didn’t have any girlfriends, no friends that were girls. So it was me, and 5 guys.

So basically we’re celebrating because we finally get to go to clubs (we had just turned 18). While we’re celebrating, some of the guys mainly try to hit on me. 
I keep my distance, and try to find my way back to my friends.

I don’t think they noticed me by them (I wouldn’t blame them, i’m like 5’0) but I still try to make it known i’m there. Turns out that was a total fail, because their conversation was about, guess who? Me.

I’m lurking over them to hear what they say. 
They mainly talk about my attitude and my looks. 
one of them, (let’s call him C) he goes  “Oh, I would wanna be in a relationship with her. Just scared of getting rejected.” 


BUT WAIT!

When I finally am able to get their attention, and they both say hey. C acts as if i’m invisible and the other guy is visibly trying to urge him on to say what he said earlier. 

(TL;DR)
I went out with some good friends. 
One of those friends has feelings, but when i’m around him he acts as if i’m not there. 
Advice?",13Aug2019,1
73,"Let’s just get this out of the way real quick: this is a defcon 7 first world problem that I don’t expect sympathy for. Nevertheless, I’d like some advice. Quick summary: I’m a former high school humanities teacher in the US and now I get paid a little over $100k a year to ensure that doctors, nurses, and other clinicians know how to use a popular electronic medical record software. 

Sometimes I make interactive e-learnings, sometimes I host webinars, but most of my time is spent as an on-call expert that our doctors can call and ask questions like “Why can’t I change the pharmacy this med is being sent to?” or “How do I order a low dose CT scan?” Most of the questions are not particularly challenging, and the clinicians always seem to like to end the call by complaining about how poorly the software is designed. I agree with them; it’s a UX nightmare. Most of the other elements of my job are not intellectually challenging either. Great example: my boss asked for suggestions on how we could feasibly train 1500+ physicians on a major change to the software and I proposed that we make 15 minutes of interactive e-learnings that they could watch and then attend a sort of “open office hours” where questions could be answered online. This was well received and a slam dunk and I feel like I didn’t even try to come up with a creative idea. Just struck me as a common-sense scalable strategy. 

My hours are not difficult. I work 8-5 and completely from home or otherwise remotely. Despite these excellent conditions, I don’t feel particularly fulfilled or that I identify with my job and I find myself fantasizing about going into careers idealized by society pretty regularly. Maybe that’s fine though. My wife can tell I don’t particularly enjoy it but my parents tell me not to rock the boat (I grew up in relative poverty).

Because I always want to ensure I’m clean down there but at the same time I don’t really like receiving. On the other hand though I like giving but I don’t trust the way he cleans himself and he told me that was selfish of me and I think yeh that’s true, so eating him out is a bit scary to me but we’ve done it before so I guess I could do it again... so last night we decided to do it in his car and he said he cleaned and all so I did the foreplay and everything and gave it to him and it was good but bcs I was tired and bcs of his medication (adhd, antidepressants, and what not) he takes forever to finish as a side effect so I kinda finished about half an hour in and he got a bit upset about that but it was alright bcs I could go for round two. But the thing is, when round 2 was happening I could smell something awful and I knew what it was so I kept going but after awhile I couldn’t take it and said I needed a break.

Literally that’s a big fear of mine and I could only imagine the embarrassment he would’ve felt... and it was just silent as we drove home... it was actually everywhere but he doesn’t know that.

And I wanna say I told you so and I wanna say that I’m a bit traumatised and that I can still smell it... but on the other hand I wanna be considerate af bcs he’s been slowly getting off his anti depressants and he’s having like mood swings and stuff and he has to get back to therapy and also as a top and as his partner I shouldn’t be grossed out with that type of stuff but I am.... and I just don’t know what to say to him",13Aug2019,1
79,"Hi reddit. This is a bit of a long one. Bear with me, please. 

My husband’s English and his family is from a lower class background. His mom and his step-father are both recovering alcoholics. As far as I am aware his mom has not had a job for some years. They live about 15 minutes away from where we do by train/car, in a pretty bad area of town. Their home is really run down and extremely dirty, including mouldy walls and surfaces covered in thick layers of dust. 

I’d say I’m from a middle class, maybe upper middle class family and I suppose had been quite sheltered. Never really met anyone with such dire living circumstances as his folks before and we don’t really have any common ground. I think it’s also fair to say that I’m more of a withdrawn and reflective personality as well and that I don’t make friends easily. I also don’t have the gift of easily striking up conversations with people. I think they see me as quite stuck up. I make a lot more money than my husbands step father and while I don’t talk about money to them I do have nicer clothes, things, furniture and so on than they can afford. 

When I met my husband he was between jobs, so of course I encouraged him to find some employment. My husband later on told me that his mother didn’t like me for that as it stopped him from being able to visit his family during the afternoon on weekdays and also meant that he moved into my flat eventually; it’s in a bigger city with more job prospects - about 15 minutes away from his fam. I ignored it at the time, thinking she’d come around. After all, what mom wouldn’t want her son to have a job and career. 

In the past 5 years his family has visited us once. I have invited many times, but there is always something last minute that prevents them from visiting. I think it may be because our home is too fancy for their likes, but I don’t really want to compromise on buying cheap and nasty furniture when I work hard and can have nice things around. It’s not like I rub it in or expect them to be extra careful. To be honest it isn’t that fancy either, but we do have cups and plates that were like 4 dollars each and the one time we had them over it looked like they were handling the Queen’s favourite porcelain set, rather than an everyday item. 

The return side of the equation is even weirder. I don’t think I have ever been invited to visit them. There are some dates we, or more accurately, my husband is expected to visit - but it is never talked about. However, if my husband doesn’t show up - it’s perceived as a great offence. In my family it would be quite normal that my mom, grandma and aunts would ask each other what each family is planning for Christmas, birthdays, etc. We’d then agree who is hosting and what to cook/ prepare and so on. On my husbands side: nothing. Not a word. But if you get it wrong it’s big drama. 

Now despite not being invited he brought me along a few times and those visits were super awkward. Mom in law basically just played FarmVille on her PC ignoring me and my husband the entire time. We’d not even be offered a drink of water, snack or anything else. I fumbled my way through some stilted conversations with the step father mostly to prevent hearing the crickets outside. I’d caused some offence by bringing flowers for his mom. She seemed viscerally uncomfortable with me having dropped 25 dollars worth of money on a nice bouquet for her. I likely messed up more on her birthday, buying her a simple scarf - which again was treated like I’d just wasted a fortune on the unworthy. 

To make things weirder, his mom is the only parent I ever met explaining to me in one of our rare conversations that her son is really nothing special and didn’t amount to much. I was so taken aback by the conversation I didn’t really know what do other than trying to say nice things about my husband in a polite way. 

Now that I got this out of the way, onto recent events. Last October my husband had an emergency appendectomy and was in live threatening condition. He was pretty spaced out when he got to hospital, so I tried to take care of all things and let his mom know what had happened. He later told me he’d not have done this to avoid being disappointed. 

My work is in the medical field, so while I’m no expert on appendices I do know that 12 hours is long time for an operation of that kind and that my husband must have had a serious complication. I asked his family to make their way to the hospital to keep me company waiting and be there when he’d wake up. His mom told me she didn’t want to come. Figuring that affording the trip may play a part I offered to pay for a taxi - but no. They didn’t even call me or stay online on Facebook messenger with me to find out how the procedure went. I updated them anyway and saw the messages being read the next day. My husband eventually came out of the ICU a few days later and was making a good recovery, but remained in a different ward for another two weeks. Mother and family didn’t visit once. No explanation offered. 

Since released from hospital my husband had to cancel a day trip he had planned with his mom, because he didn’t yet feel up to it physically. He was struggling with adjusting to going back to work and just needed the weekends for rest.

At some point after this we hit the ignore list. She unfriended him on Facebook, doesn’t answer the phone or email and it’s like we’re dead to them. 

I simultaneously feel like I am angry with her for treating her son like shit and like this situation is my fault. I’m of half a mind to send a letter to let her know just how hurtful and frustrating this whole situation is. Another part of me thinks it’s not really up to me to do something about it. My husbands so dejected he’s just given up and says he doesn't mind if there is no more contact, but that doesn’t really ring true.

So I check it out and I don’t see anyone, I peak my head around the corner and open the screen door and see a 50$ bill and a 20$ bill laying on my drive way.

82,"I am 25, starting to buy this single-room, bachelor apartment in the most luxurious/centric place of my country, surrounded by big skycrappers and all that shit. It's under construction but I already got myself a unit under contract. It's affordable but the catch is it is small, only 48m2. It's split between a bedroom/bathroom  and kitchen/laundry/living room, plus a balcony that connects both sections.

I've been living in the area, renting rooms for years and I don't even need a car, I just walk everywhere, job, gym, groceries, park, mall, etc.

I am not sure if this is/was a good idea. In my country/culture you usually leave your parents house when you marry and buy a family house. But I cut ties with all my family, I am all by myself and I take carr of myself. I am a very ""special case"" in my society. A lone wolf.

Deep down I want a wife, kids and a family house and life but I admit I have many flaws and accept that I am very likely to never marry or breed. So I saw buying this as a great opportunity.

I am opting for a 20 year mortgage instead of 30 years, I want to finish paying stuff in my 40s and I think it would be easier pay off my debt and sell the apartment this way.

What are your thoughts?",13Aug2019,3
85,"As I mentioned in a previous post, I decided to look into options where I can work on my math skills. I picked my general education classes along with intermediate algebra. I'm taking 3 classes this semester due to my full time job and to see how I do in college. Intermediate Algebra in my community college is basically HS algebra retaught, which I need since it's been 2 years since I graduated from high school.

Exactly how behind I am into majoring in Computer Science now that I'm going this route? I picked Intermediate algebra so I can build a good foundation since for Computer Science, I need calculus 1 and 2 before I go and transfer to a 4 year uni. Any advice will be appreciated.",13Aug2019,1

I just finished college and now that I’m not going to class everyday I don’t get much human interaction beside with the relatives that live in the house with me. I need friends. Friends that are my age (almost 25). But I don’t drink. I hate going to clubs. I don’t dance. I really prefer to do things during the day time if possible. 

So my question is how do I find places where I can go and meet people my age who have similar interest? I don’t want to become a hermit.

91,"I feel so sad never being in a relationship before and I am 24. I've never had a boyfriend or been on a date before. I feel like every woman has had some dating or relationship experience at this age but I have absolutely none. Men never approach me and I am barely hit on or shown interest either. I don't think I am ugly (at least with makeup on, but without makeup I know I don't look my best) and people say I have a good body but men just don't notice me. I have never had a guy ask for my number or leave his number for me. It doesn't help that when I go on social media, I literally start crying because all I see are relationship posts and I am still single. I would rather meet someone irl but I have tried an app before. Usually the guy will compliment me and then later the conversation fizzles out or he stops talking to me later. I really get super worried or depressed thinking that I might be forever alone. Only 6 more years and I will be 30 and I feel like nothing will change and I will be stuck in the same position----single and never dating anyone.",13Aug2019,1
92,"Absolutely terrified in writing this, but here it goes..... so basically I’ve realised that the values I feel make a person either good or bad are absolutely different to everyone else, and I’m having an absolute crisis in feeling I am 100% out of sync and no longer trust myself to navigate through life. So a bit of perspective, I grew up in a very abusive home. I was sexually abused by my Grandfather from 7-10, physically and emotionally abused by my alcoholic father. Emotionally abused by my alcoholic/mentally unstable sister and was taught by my Mum to walk on eggshells and not “wind people up” should I not want trouble. My Mum is amazing and honestly has always done the best she could. I know that parenting doesn’t come with a manual and there were so many obstacles for us to face in our family. I’ve always been extremely anxious and fragile, but always put my shit aside so full attention could be paid to my Dad and Alex who always had to take the limelight and have their problems in the forefront. I’m the youngest and the dynamic in our family is that my Dad and Sister are the messed up ones, and I’m the good one. The peacemaker of the family that puts their stuff aside for the greater good of the family. I always did this instinctively as a kid, but it’s recently dawned on me that it’s really fucked up my perspective of what is right, as I grew to accept certain behaviour as normal (and unstoppable). My sister would steal from me ALL THE TIME to the point it’s almost second nature to assume she’s always out to get me or my things. My Mum has also been in trouble for shoplifting during my childhood. I know that stealing is wrong, but equally I’ve been exposed to behaviour which in my opinion is so much worse. Fast forward to current times. I’ve shoplifted a few times as a teenager, but I’ve never been a big one for stealing..... until now. I’ve been struggling with poorly managed anxiety and had a bad run of life events recently. Last year I had to quit my job due to post viral fatigue syndrome, also had a total crisis in wondering if I chose the right career (health care), financial issues associated with having to take time off work etc. during this time I’ve started to self medicate by drinking and I KNOW this is obviously not a good idea. Unfortunately, when I disclose my situation to my GP I generally get told that my situation is not serious enough to warrant immediate mental health/rehab support and I’m put on a waitlist. Most of the time I’m okay, but I’ve had 3 instances now where I’ve had total panic moments in the small hours of the morning (when I’m alone in my flat). In these times I have stolen small quantities of alcohol either from communal areas, but I’ve also entered their room too. I never touch anything else and never have. Equally, I’ve been caught out and know that stealing is stealing and they don’t believe me even if I haven’t touched anything else. I’m so conflicted because in every other sense I’m what’s considered a good flatmate and friend. I’ve NEVER taken flat money and never will. I never touch their food. I handle most of the flat affairs. I clean, and try my best to provide A LOT of emotional support to my flatmates. Yet, these moments of utter desperation have destroyed all of that. I don’t understand why I go above and beyond for some things, yet thought that stealing a bit of alcohol was somehow okay? How the fuck do I go about realigning what is right and what is wrong? I genuinely try so hard to do the right things, but when whenever I mess up.... it always ends up being things that people consider abhorrent. Maybe my childhood normalised stealing? I feel like an utter piece of shit and that every good thing I’ve ever done is totally irrelevant.",13Aug2019,3
93,My brother has always isolated himself from people and has bailed on so many family events. I always just thought it was him being lazy. He even dropped out of college in the middle of his first semester a few years ago. Finally he had a panic attack the other night and told my mom how he hasn’t felt happy in years. Now he’s on a leave of absence from work until he gets better (it was hard to get him to do work in the first place but he needed some pushiness from my family). There’s a lot of background to this but I’m not going to type it all out... basically I feel like I saw some depression signs but I just chose to believe he was being lazy or making up excuses to avoid dealing with people. I feel awful now. How can I support him? I also deal with anxiety and I’m not sure how to communicate or show my support for him. My mom is in the process of finding him a therapist/psychiatrist.

Every conversation and every interaction I have with everyone.  I tell myself I'm awkward, I feel awkward and I hate it. I feel like people sense it. I dont even want to talk about it to my boyfriend because it's so embarrassing and especially lately, I have been not feeling like myself. I dont feel like I'm pretty enough for him anymore. He has gotten so handsome. Not that he wasnt before, but even more so now. I feel like hes ""out of my league"" and I have just been in a very negative mindset. Its just so many things that plague my mind, that it makes it hard to be confident in myself and around others in my every day life. Its seriously affecting me and I havent  told anyone because I know I need to seek professional help but it's hard to admit to myself I really need it, let alone actually reaching out for it. I just needed to get this off my chest because its affecting my happiness and my outlook at life. I dont want to be that bitch who finds fault in everyone and who is jealous of others because I'm so unhappy with myself.",13Aug2019,1
96,"So over the past 4 months or so i had been going through a break up and that really impacted my ability to interact with people.

97,"So let’s get this outta the way.... back in December/January I started having a crush on my coworker. We started hooking up but he had a long term girlfriend. I knew about it but I honestly didn’t really care. I really really liked him, and I knew he liked me back so we just kept going. After about a month him and this girl broke up and it was brutal. Me and him stayed steady. We went to mutual friends parties together, and worked together and he actually helped me become one of the upper managers with him at the job we share. Over the course of seven months we expressed so much love to each other. We broke up about a week ago now and it was a harsh break up. We both expressed a lot of love to each other but that he felt guilty about how his past relationship ended.
We were cradled on his couch and telling each other that we loved each other but there were hardships and he needed to heal and get over the past.  I left the next morning. 
We still work together and for the first few days it was hard. I nearly cried any time anyone talked to me, and I know he took some days off. What hurt most was he became my close friend and I felt like I lost that. 
Well we started texting. Just memes and small things and we kept it light hearted. 
I offered to hang out with him today and we did and he kinda let out he hadn’t gotten any sleep in the past couple days and he was super grumpy at the end of it. He apologized and even said we would hang out and do something fun again soon. 
When I went home he was clearly tired so I sent him a small meme to cheer him up.  There are small things that are the same. He still calls me small nicknames he gave me. We used to stick our tongue out at each other at work because it’s how we communicated. It was just a cute thing we did. Well we’re still doing that. 
He bought me food and even invited me to come to his place to wake him up to hang out... 
idk I need advice. How should I feel. What do I do? 
I wanna wait in a way. I know I still love him and in all honesty it doesn’t feel like anything has changed at all. We’re still really close.  We still even pick on each other the Same if not meaner now. 
We’re also still upper management where we work.  We still have to see each other.  
Idk if these are signs well get back together or if I should try my absolute damdest to just never contact him.",13Aug2019,2

102,"first off I’m 17. I honestly can’t even think straight but I need some advice. My mom (41) was married to my father for 19 years this November. Lately however, my father has been distant and said that he was going out to hang with his friends but stayed up really late, and not answering my mom’s phone calls. While my mom was pregnant at the time.We he did come home, him and my mom argued. But things did wind down and my younger brother was born. Everything was good and I was beginning to think that it blowed over. But he seemed weird, and didn’t hold my baby brother much. Anyway so it goes by and months pass. Then he stayed up late again, and he claimed it was his friends again. The thing is he turned off his phone because my mom was calling him nonstop at like 3 AM. He finally comes home and another augment happens.  This time 3 times as worse. Days passes and he doesn’t say a word to my mom and when she buys/ makes dinner he refuses to eat and stays in his bedroom all day. Eventually  my mom calls me to talk during a day and mentions she founded a hair tie in his new car. He claims it was her’s or my sister’s but they said it wasn’t. I prayed he wasn’t lying but their relationship got even worse. That led up to today where my mom was very upset when I got home and looked like she been crying. She said that she looked at the call logs and found a number he called at work and looked it up and it was a real estate number in our area. She asks him about when he comes home and says it was his friends. They stop fighting and then she goes to take my sister to her softball practices and watch it. So I go in my room to play with my friends on some games. Until I hear her screaming at my dead even through my headphones. I don’t want to relieve what she said, but she got a message from a guy to tell her that he was cheating on her.He said he hired a private investigator to spy on his wife and found her going to my dad’s car at work and more, claiming he had proof from the detective, doing stuff I honestly don’t want to think about. This was going on while she was pregnant with my baby brother to. They fight in the worse way I’ve ever seen and he lied the entire time.She left the house with my baby brother and went to my grandmas house( her mom) I’m watching my younger brothers while he packs up. I just want advice on what to do at this point. This has been the worst day of my life and I honestly don’t think I can ever forgive him much less look at him",13Aug2019,2

104,"Hi. I'm a 15 year old guy.  I have really severe social anxiety. I feel, mentally incapable of handling myself in school. I feel like I'm using this as an excuse not to do work but I just feel significantlly slower socially to the point where it affects me academically.  


I was parented pretty badly by my mom and my mom who I know definitely does have some issues and that affected me as well. Things she did could be called emotional abuse. Here is some more backround info on my parents if needed: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/cm83o1/do\_i\_have\_some\_unresolved\_family\_trauma/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/cm83o1/do_i_have_some_unresolved_family_trauma/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)  
I think the reason I hate making noise was because my parents (mom specifically) would always tell me to shut up and yell at me to be quiet. When I was younger (even now tbh) I'd wait ages if my pencil was broken to go to the pencil sharpener. If I had no pencil I'd be so scared. Cause that'd mean I'd have to ask, or panic and find one. Everytime I didn't have a paper handout I'd freeze. One girl last year literally said she did not even know I was in the class the whole year I'm realizing now how bad my social anxiety is.  


 I am an only child and I comfort myself with my animes, and watching youtube videos (I'm not addicted but they help soothe a lot of emotional pain). I never had many friends growing up and  I don't really feel close to any of the friends I do have who I talk to in school only. My family never goes on vacations and I'm pretty much at the house a lot. I like anime, and drawing, and all types of other geeky stuff. I'm not stupid and not lazy, I've been in Honors English classes for the past 3 years of my life, and I have an intermediate amount of skills in photoshop, and video editing.  


So I went back to school today. I went in feeling confident and went out feeling awful. I got really upset cause I didn't have friends in most of my classes, and it was all people I didn't know at all.  
I really don't want to go back. Like it's not a bad place. I just can't handle social situations. And thinking about I think the only reason I was ever content with going to school for a long time was because I had friends to make things bearable. I don't want to make new friends and most of these people I honestly don't like. I can't handle change. I can't handle new things. Maybe I'm a big baby who just can't handle things.  I just want to stay at home.",13Aug2019,2
105,"Hey guys! Thanks in advance for reading

So I'm feeling really stuck right now. I went to college, got a 4 year degree in fashion design. Moved to Los Angeles and have been working in design for almost 6 years now. I have a decent paying job, generally nice people I'm working with, but a shitty commute. Overall mostly living what a lot of people consider ""the dream.""

At first I thought I didn't like my earlier jobs cause I was low on the totem pole doing shit work, then I changed companies and thought it was just company culture, and now I'm at a job that by most definitions is great. And I still hate it. I've realised I hate my field. Any job postings I read in my field just make me wanna hurl.

I dont know if I can change fields at this point or how. I cant think of any jobs that fit my personality. Any career field suggestions would be much appreciated!

- INTJ personality type
- strong work ethic
- great creative and out of the box thinker
- good at ""big picture"" planning
- can also hyperfocus for hours on a specific task
- good at adobe photoshop &amp; illustrator
- can sew/create models/craft
- like to be walking around/changes of scenery
- Introvert
- not great at teamwork
- not a morning person
- hate rigid schedules

I've considered event planning,  but there is too much human interaction. I had once considered a career in scientific research but i dont think I could swing going back to university. I am stuck in Los Angeles (with sky high rent) for now because of my boyfriends career.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty.

It was a civil divorce and they were still in it for both of us, but they both had to work full time and custody was set to only see my dad on weekends and once a week for dinner so I grew up with him being for of a cool friend rather than having a father figure. 

They never talked to me like I was a child growing up but they are nice, reasonable people. It’s all made me who I am so really can’t complain. As long as I had good grades in school I was mostly free to do what I wanted when I wanted. They were busy being single parents and that left myself and the internet/video games to raise me and form around the base morals they engrained into me. So I was able to force myself to do good in school for the sake of freedom by day (A’s and B’s for the most part, I think I got a C and a D on a report card one time each) so I could go home and eat junk food and absolutely wreak havoc on people’s lives in Halo 3 by night. 

Starting around sophomore year of high school I started smoking weed and isolating myself from people because the powers that be [insert tragic, depressing, more of my batman origins sob story here; family passings, broken leg, relationship problems blah blah] really dove into the pit of darkness of believing there was no god and if there was he hated me (back when I took god literally and thought he was a dude floating around in the sky). 

Video games were what kept me sane through my darkest times in life because it was the perfect outlet. I never had to take any of my anger or frustrations out on the random people in my actual life when I could have everyone I know like me and just go online to my alter ego and wreck people then tea bag them to the point of sending hate mail. Wasn’t a healthy coping technique turns out because people started walking all over me in real life and treating me like a pushover. 

My mom knew I was going through really hard times but her way of letting me get through it was giving me space (I always argued with her as a teenager, turns out I’m exactly how she was with her mom growing up) and letting me find my own way through, [my dad unfortunately had a really bad motorcycle ouchie when I was 19 leaving him with severe a TBI [lots of other bats flying around this story] .

So I flew off the wagon and couldn’t tolerate when people were fake or partake in any group think of any kind. I lost a lot of “friends” and was either loved or hated depending on what kind of people I was around. I made the decision in my life to always try to “cause no harm, but take no shit”. I never turned to alcohol or did drugs unless you count smoking weed all day everyday. 

Then after 4 years of working 36 hours a week at a sandwich shop and doing lots of goblin leisurely, online and in the real world a switch flipped when my mom and I were arguing one night and she was finally able to pierce through my stubbornness and made me realize there are things in this world that I love and are still worth loving(her being a major one) and just need to figure out how to succeed. 

I decided to cut all ties with the toxic environment I had created for myself and quit my job, got a new one an hour and a half north in the mountains, and start a new life based on peace and love.  I’m currently on my second year up here after that move and have a full time job working nights at a ski resort and have an apartment to my self for the first time in my life. These past two years up here have been amazing but of course comes with its own highs and lows. 

So I have an understanding that life comes with its highs and its lows and you wouldn’t be able to feel one without the other. I realize that I love everything just as much as I hate everything. There are two sides of every coin. I understand there are reason for evil and reasons for love. I believe everything happens for a reason ( God for religious people, the unknown/universe for curious/scientific people). So, I just need some advice on how to take control of my life and get my goals achieved. 

My goals are limitless. I want to do everything. I want to experience everything. I want to be happy, be sad, hated and loved. I just can’t bring myself to settle for only getting a job then raising a family and that is the end of the road. I do want to raise a family one day but I need to experience life first. I need to mold myself into a great father figure for my children rather than never having the chance to grow up myself like my father before me. My goals go beyond material success but that seems to be the part of the puzzle that is holding me back. I always write out all my goals in big bubble charts, break them down into manageable steps, write timelines/deadlines but it seems like I just don’t have the discipline or work ethic to actually achieve any goals. I will start something, do decent at it, then give it up and continue on daydreaming about all the steps and my life in the future. If I even can bring myself to start in the first place. So, I guess how can I bring my dreams into reality? 

The plan I have set for myself now is go to business school during the days and work my job at night still to fund living expenses. I wont be able to attend the college here with instate tuition until I have been a resident for over a year (commuted for the first month then lived off the books with a roommate in a cabin with no paper proof up until this April) and really have no aim or direction in what I could be doing to gain success in the meantime. 

My end goal in life at this point would be to make enough money that I could reasonably go where I wanted when I wanted, go to any fancy restaurant with my whole family and not worry about the bill, and something I remember I always said I would do as a kid was buy my Mom a lake house in the Rocky Mountains. I’m more than willing to go through the highs and lows and work hard but I can’t find motivation that is lasting. I always just end up daydreaming then not acting on these dreams. So enough rambling, hopefully I managed to make sense through this. Thank you if you bared through that with me. I wish you all happiness and good luck in your pursuits!!!

121,"I found a bump and a few days later it popped and is bleeding on and off.  I am a huge germaphobe and am terrified of catching a std. On top of that, I'm a very anxious person so I'm stressing pretty bad. 

The most I've ever done is hold a guy's hand so I'm pretty sure it's not an std but the symptoms match most of the google research I've done. I do share a bathroom with a roommate, maybe I caught it from him somehow? He doesn't wash his hands (my room is next to the bathroom and can confirm he doesn't). 

I scheduled a doctor's appointment this week so I'll probably get an answer soon. I don't have anyone to talk about this with so I figure posting it here can get me some relief until my doctor's appointment this week.

I’ve told them about a hundred times that I’m looking for relevant jobs but if not it doesn’t matter because it’s only for a year, as long as I have *a* job (I can do freelance on the side).

129,"Okay so it's kind of a long story but about 2 years ago my mom brought home a dog she found wandering around outside after a snowstorm. She had seen him outside for a week before she decided to bring him home. Before deciding on whether or not to keep him she tried looking for the owners (took the dog with her and asked people if he was theirs, and went around with a picture asking people while also looking for fliers). After about a month of looking and not finding anyone we decided to keep him. Now me and my fiance were living with my mom at the time and had already had another dog (who passed a few months after) and were in the process of looking for an apartment. We moved out about a week after our first dog passed, to an apartment about 20 minutes away from my mom's house so we could walk the dog to her every morning so he wouldn't be alone while we were at work. Fast forward to last week Wednesday and I'm taking my dog on the usual morning walk to my mom's before work when this random lady stops me and asks ""where'd you get the dog? This is my dog, give him back or I'll call the cops."" I told her I didn't know what she was talking about and I wasn't going to just give her the dog. She then tries to get me to go to her house to look at the papers and pictures that she has for him. I told her I wasn't going to her house and she keeps threatening me with calling the cops so I tell her to go ahead and start walking again. As I'm walking I keep looking over my shoulder to make sure she's not following me and I don't see her at all. I get to my mom's drop off the dog and start telling her what just happened. Lo and behold when I walk back outside to go to work this lady is standing right in front of my mom's apartment with a kid and some papers in her hand. And she starts with the ""give me back my dog or I'm calling the cops"" again. So feeling harrassed at this point I call them and explain the situation. When they get to my mom's the lady is still there and has called a 2nd adult over for whatever reason. She tells them that I have her dog and won't give him back and that she has papers and apparently he's a service animal for her son who gets bullied. Now again we looked around for the owners for about a month and looked for any posters that said anything about a missing dog and there were none. But because I don't have a paper saying that I purchased the dog the cops tell me that I either have to give him back on my own or we can go to court where they'll test the dog for blood work and see if it matches because she apparently has all of this paperwork. I talked to my fiance (who was at work when all of this went down) and we agreed to get the bloodwork done without going to court (because we don't have the money) and we can look at the results ourselves. We both agreed we'd give him back if it matches since it's her son's dog. But my fiance and mother go to talk to this lady, watch 1 video and look at some pictures and decide that he's actually their dog and we would give him back that saturday. Feeling betrayed I had to fight with both my mom and fiance to agree to the bloodwork like we had originally planned because I don't want to be near this lady at all after she followed me to my mom's. Not ONE person told her anything about following me by the way. So now I'm paranoid walking in my own neighborhood that I've lived in for years before I moved out. We bring the dog to the vet after basically hiding him in the house for the last few days and they tell us that bloodwork and even a DNA test wouldn't be conclusive being that the bloodwork can change and dna tests for dogs aren't as accurate as for humans. So now I'm wondering what paperwork she has that supposedly says all of this. We haven't seen whatever papers she claims to have but the cops did. But the vet told us the only time they have that information for dogs is when they need transfusions. They told us to contact the aspca and see what they say about the situation. We are very confused at this time in terms of what to do. We tried to get the answers ourselves but there is no definite answer. Should we give the dog back or do we keep him? We really love this dog and I can't really imagine giving him up so easily but I know we should do the right thing. If anyone has any advice at all please let me know and thanks in advance! 

TL;DR: We rescued a stray dog and 2 years later a random lady followed me to my mom's house claiming it's her dog and that she has papers for him. Cops did nothing about her following me. We tried to get bloodwork done but was told that as well as a dna test would be inconclusive. We have no idea what to do so if you have any advice at all please feel free to share!

131,"It's so much more complicated than this, but the question basically boils down to: is it fair of me to go see someone I've slept with in the past while my fiancee and I are traveling through where she lives? My fiancee is NOT happy about this and is very jealous of this girl. Now here's a lotttttt of context:

My fiancee (we'll call her Jane) and I live in different countries, she's Austrian and I'm American. We met while volunteering and have been in a long distance relationship for over a year. In less than 2 months, we're going to be traveling through South America together for several months, and will basically travel to as many places as we can until our money runs out and it's time to settle down, probably in Austria.

Now for the context of this other girl (we'll call her Maria). She lives in South America, and we met at the same place I met Jane. Jane had left there about a month before I was scheduled to leave, and right before she left, Maria showed up. Now, at the time, I was not looking for a relationship of any kind because my wife had died just 2 years before and I just wasn't ready... not only that, but I had promised myself to stay away from women because I was convinced I would never be okay again and that I would only hurt any potential woman I tried to have a relationship with.

But then I fell in love with Jane. I was fighting it at first, as hard as it was, and was trying to keep from following my heart to avoid the risk of hurting her. Then Maria shows up, and this was also during the 2nd anniversary of my wife's death, and while I was trying to fight my love for Jane... it was a tough time, no excuses, I'm an asshole and sleaze... I slept with Maria. We were both there for each other, and while neither of us kidded ourselves that it was love, we comforted each other and formed a strong friendship.

Fast forward to the end of my time volunteering, I skipped my flight back home and instead took a flight to Austria, where I spent a month with Jane, falling more and more in love every day and still fighting it and remaining adamant, in all our many conversations about the topic, that a relationship could never happen. At the end of that month, the night before I flew back home, I told Jane about Maria. We cried a lot, about the goodbye and about the betrayal. I felt terrible and I hurt her so much.

Fast forward again, four months later, Jane and I are still talking every day, even with a 9 hour time difference between our two separate countries. I keep making promises that I'll stop telling her that I love her, and I keep breaking those promises. Finally I can't fight it anymore and I tell her I want to be with her. Eventually, she flies to America and we become a couple and start the long distance relationship that we've been in for over a year. We talked a lot about Maria at first, and still do sometimes, but it doesn't usually get as emotional anymore. Still, Jane is still definitely hurt by what I did and very jealous of Maria. Maria and I are still friends and talk frequently on the phone.

Now we're going to be in South America, soon, and I can't imagine being where Maria lives and not going to see her! We're such good friends, I miss her, and this might be my last chance, or at least one of the very rare ones, to see her. But obviously Jane wouldn't like it and it will hurt her. And would I expect Jane to come along, to spend time with Maria? How can I ask that?? Isn't it so insensitive? But South America! It's so far!

I don't know what to do!",13Aug2019,0

136,"This is going to be a rather long post but I'm on the verge of homelessness, and quite frankly considering suicide if I am. I just graduated highschool, 3.4 GPA, 1250 SAT and got accepted to a great technology school, alongside some others nearby. I love tech and was planning on going to a nearby school (living with parents while attending for 2) until a dispute between my father and I came up. It got rather heated to say the least, I ended up swearing at my father &amp; vise versa, in my regard. I regret it badly. My mother ended up saying: I'm not going to choose between you and him, so you're going to have to go(the night of). I thought of solutions as fast as I could because I didn't want my future to be homeless, or forced into a school I do not have any desire to go to.   


To to be frank, I've treated my parents horribly for years, not going to blame it solo-ly on ADD/ADHD but it does play a large factor. I've been rather selfish, never did sports, spent a great deal on my computer, avoided family events(always made great grades though). I have started cleaning up after myself, really doing the most I can to show that I can change for them, and that I aspire to go to the school of my choice, but they won't buy it. They want me to go to a university (farther away) to help me 'grow up' but I don't like the campus(at all), the tiny dorm I would be in; I wouldn't have my friends nearby, girlfriend(my best friend), family, pets, everything I've known for my short 18 years lived on this earth. Their response to that is: ""many kids are going to be doing the same thing you will be doing!!"" I have a great personality but struggle greatly with making good friends; I have social anxiety, which is why a lot of my friends are online. I've always been a third wheel in real-life friendships, if you know what I mean by that-- I know that is a crucial part of life, introducing yourself, relating, but that is not in their ideology of me ""growing up"", that's something I've never voiced and only kept to myself until recently.  


 \-- I've made it clear that is not what I want for my future, at all. They threaten me with ""guess you'll be homeless"" ""guess you'll be living in a tent"" &amp; constant forcing/urging me to go to the college far away from here. I've voiced my opinions, and stand my ground firmly on this. ""College #2"" AKA: their *Plan B* when shit hit the fan during the middle of this summer, is not an option. I've shown them at my weakest; tears, on how and why I don't want to go there, and that all I need is a year, maybe two to get: a nicer car, first 2 years down, get to a healthy weight, better mental health, and some money to my name since I'm basically broke. Not sure if I should make this a paragraph of it's own but I want to go to the college nearby because 1. it's close, 2. the campus is 110% prettier, 3. I have some friends already going there 4. I have a job nearby 5. I would still be able to live at home, (14 minutes away)

I don't want to seem 'entitled' or 'stuck up' in this post, I just know what I want for my future, I know the college I had in mind and still have in mind, is the one I want to go to. I also want to note a couple misc details, nothing has happened (disagreements) other than the one regarding this situation, the college. The dorms at ""college #2"" for single/double are almost all booked, college starts (presuming I go to the one \*we\* all had in mind pre-circumstance) near end of Sept.  


Reason I'm putting this in #depression is because I would honestly rather commit suicide than be homeless. I don't see myself having the desire to dig myself out of the ""drop-off"" I would be living in if I can't go to the college I yearn to go to. Sure, there's success stories of thousands out there who never went to college, I'm not here to argue that. I just need to know what I can do to sway my parents minds, or really get back on the track of what life was *going* *to be like* until the issue came up. + your thoughts, idk. anything you think would be useful. this has been more than stressing me out all summer, literally all I think about anymore.",13Aug2019,4
138,"My (ex)girlfriend recently broke up with me. She broke up with me b/c her mom found out we were dating and her mom told her to stop dating/talking to me.

141,"Hello reddit,

On Friday, I flew from the east coast of America to the west to visit a childhood friend for six days. We grew up together, but she moved back to the west when we were 14. We spoke of me going to visit her for years, and here we are, five years later, I’m on that very trip. My only problem is that I’m having an awful time. 

First of all, my friend has basically become a stepmother to her boyfriends newborn, which is very sweet of her, but she is not really open to many activities as transporting the baby around is a hassle. I understand this, but I’ve been a good portion of my trip sitting in her house which has no WiFi or cable, and time has been dragging. We’ve done one touristy thing in the few days I’ve been here for, but I’ve spent most of it sitting around. 

Here’s where things get a little wild:
This morning, she took a couple of pregnancy tests which turned out to be positive. She let her mother know right away, who instructed her to tell her father and her boyfriends parents. They were extremely upset, especially her dad, and being in the middle of this situation during my stay here has been extremely uncomfortable. I feel super selfish for saying this as I know it’s a lot for her, and I’ve tried to comfort her but she’s not the one to go to others to vent or for advice so the most I’ve done is sit around.

My dad told me before I left that he could arrange for me to come home early if I needed to get out of there, and it seems that his predictions were true. However, I really don’t want to hurt my friend’s feelings by leaving a trip early that we’ve talked about since middle school. I just don’t know if I can stand to sit around like this until the end of the week.

What do I do?",13Aug2019,1

I could go on and go on.

I can't stop thinking about those things and they're making me feel stressed, anxious and overwhelmed but I can't go to therapy. Those problems have always existed and they'll always exist but if I spend all day thinking about them it's worse, I can distract myself but the momment I have time alone with my thoughts...

144,"Yesterday I found out my boyfriend was talking to another woman he met out of state while working. He claimed they were just friends, but it later came to light that he’s developed feelings for her. 5 hours of discussing/fighting later, we went to bed on semi decent terms in separate rooms. Today was strange, he’d go from trying to kiss me, to snapping at me the next minute. At one point today I told him as calmly as I possibly could that he had kind of annoyed me because as soon as I asked him to help me clean up around the apartment, he decided he needed to read over some paperwork he’s read over at least half a dozen times, and just watch me clean by myself. He snapped once again and called me a bitch. Typically I wouldn’t mind that and it’d roll right off my back, but he did it in front of my 17 year old niece and 11 month old son.

146,"For the past month or so I have been babysitting  2 kids, ages 3 and 9. It's a part-time job and I'm 18 years old. In the family's living room, there's a very nice modern table that they use for everything - playing, eating, you name it. Today, the kids wanted to draw in some coloring sheets. Normally, whenever the kids do something on the table, they must use a placemat under what it is they are doing; it's the family's prized table. I didn't know, but apparently the pens they use for coloring are permanent markers, and  I didn't realize it but the 3 year old started coloring in the sheet without a placemat underneath. She colored for about 5 minutes before I noticed and lifted up the paper. As I'm sure you can guess, the pens bleached through and stained the table. When the parents saw, they were so upset about it and I felt absolutely horrible - I feel responsible because I am the adult who's supposed to be watching them vigilantly and remembering the rules of the house. The parents talked outside for about 10 minutes, and then when they came inside they were visibly upset and they disappeared without saying a word to me. I felt so uncomfortable, ashamed, and upset. As I was leaving, I apologized to the dad about the table, and while he seemed upset and exasperated, he told me ""It's fine. She's 3."" Nevertheless, I still feel like it's my fault and feel absolutely terrible. I know I might be overreacting, but the degree to which they seemed upset was really unsettling.  I want to make it up to them in some way, but I'm not sure how. I was considering offering  to work for free (if they need to refinish the table, that is going to cost a lot of money, and I figured they could use the money they would otherwise pay me to pay for the table) for at least a short time. I could also offer to pay for refinishing the entire table, but that would cost probably all of the money I've made from babysitting and I feel like this might be a stretch. While I do need the money and working for free/paying them for the damages wouldn't be optimal and would be a little frustrating, I understand if that's the best thing for me to do at this point. Anyways, apologies for the rambling, but any and all advice as to what I should do is welcome. Thanks.",13Aug2019,3
147,"This is a throwaway account due to some of my friends being on here, and this is a situation I have not explained to many people in my life. This is my first post on here, and something that I have debated putting on here for awhile. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this.

I (18F) currently live with my parents, and in two weeks I will be off to college (first year). I also have an older brother who is 25, lives with his girlfriend about 2 hours away. My stepdad is plainly an asshole (anger issues, never liked kids) and he and my mom are just together for convenience. They don't sleep in the same bed, hardly ever talk besides at work (they run our family restaurant together), and even then it's just constant yelling and fighting. My mom suffers from extremely bad depression, and has for most of her life. She believes it stems from a traumatic childhood, and a constant feeling of loneliness throughout her life. She has had a gambling addiction, been an alcoholic, was a smoker, however all of that stopped about 2 years ago. She has attempted three times in her life, the last time was when my brother was 4. I first started noticing my moms addiction and depression when I was in 6th grade, when my brother first left for college. As the years went on, it only got worse. 

We are a fairly low income family. The family restaurant is the only source of income we have, which pays the bills but hardly gets us by. My mom is always stressed and anxious about money and the future. She can't get out of bed for days due to her depression, and the restaurant can't open without her, and therefore it is a constant cycle of stressing about money but being so depressed that our only source of income is slowly deteriorating. In April of 2020, my parents will be ending the lease on the restaurant building and shutting down the restaurant. Their plan is to then move to Virginia where my stepdads brother and brothers wife lives, and live with them until they can get back on their feet. My mom has explained to me that she doesn't want to go, she doesn't love my stepdad anymore and doesn't want to be with him once the restaurant business is over. She doesn't know what she wants to do with her life anymore, I don't know what to do. She has shown signs of being suicidal but has explained that she won't because of my brother and I. She has explained she might have to file for bankruptcy, she doesn't have any other work experience besides owning a restaurant, and even then, her depression would just cause her to lose any job. I can hardly get her out of bed some days. 

My grandma lives in Thailand with my mom's brother, who my mom does not have a good relationship with. My brother is trying to start his life with his girlfriend, paying off their student debt, living in an apartment. We have never been able to afford proper help, my mom has been to doctors appointments to discuss her depression and has been given medication but refuses to take it, and since we don't have health insurance the bill only stresses her out even more. I don't know what to do, I don't know what there is for my mom to do with her life. 

TL;DR: Mom has bad depression, after next April she won't have anywhere to go and she doesn't know what she wants to do with her life. No job, home, or partner. I'm going to college, older brother is living in small apartment trying to start his own life.",13Aug2019,1
149,"I am a 17 year old rising senior and soon I have to decide what I’m doing for college. For a few years now I’ve always had this want to create stories and I’ve really settled on this idea of TV production being what I want to do in life. The issue is A majority of my family (specifically the part that is helping me pay for college) is not behind the idea. They want me to go into Marketing or Business. They aren’t even happy with psychology or anything not science, nursing, or computer related. 

I know TV producer fits the description of “oh it will never actually happen. It’s just a childhood dream” or “I’ll end up unable to support myself” but it really is a strong dream. My family has made me very doubtful of following this but part of me can’t let go of the what if of following it. 

I guess what I’m asking is, should I play it safe and just go into something I’m less passionate about and be realistic, or should I take the risk?

Side note: I asked my family if they could do anything in the world guaranteed they would succeed, what would they do. All of their answers came back to the idea “whatever gets me a lot of money for little work.” And I can’t help but find it sad, nothing else speaks to them except money. I will be the first to admit (coming from a financially struggling family)I find money such an  important part of a job, but even without any guarantee of money something still strongly pulls me to TV Production.",13Aug2019,1
150,"So I’ve been friends with this guy (jake) for 5 years and he’s always been kind of an asshole, but I felt with it because I have other friends, we basically have a full group that started with just me and him. For the past 4 years he has always done his best to turn out other friends against me and say really terrible things to me and pass them off as jokes. But whenever we hung out 1 on 1 he’d be really nice. Last week he went way to far and accused my parents of shorting him on his grad money only giving him $20.18 when his parents gave me $50. I kept quiet because I knew my mom kept a book of all the gifts people gave me to write thank you notes in.  So after that night I checked the book, turns out I was right and they only gave me $20 and he made all my friends think me and my family are bad people that night. So I came to him with the book and asked him for an apology, he freaked out and accused me of calling his mom a lair and blocked me, now he’s doing what he did 2 years ago, slowly turning my friends against me to kick me out of our group again. I just want to keep my other friends and he can be friends with them too but I can’t with him telling them all this shit about me. So I need advice, should I just move on, go back to school and put this chapter of my life behind me. Or can I win somehow?",13Aug2019,1
151,"I know I fucked up and this isn’t an excuse whatsoever.
I cheated on my boyfriend, Jay earlier this summer, I never physically touched him (Matt)  but the texts were enough to call it cheating. Me and my boyfriend had a rough patch after that, it’s a long story but we made up and it’s been a lot better than we’ve ever been.

I cut off the Matt and told him why. I blocked him on everything, Snapchat instagram phone numbers. It’s not like he’s missing anything either, I met him on vacation and we live in different states. This was about a month ago. Today he texts me on a different number, I told him we shouldn’t talk to each other. He calls me “hot stuff” so I blocked that number. Then about 15 min later my boyfriend and his mom both get texts from a weird number with a girl who looks a lot like me doing NSFW things to a dude. I’m freaked out, I have no idea how that would happen. I didn’t give him any of my boyfriends info. It’s not online, and his moms number certainly isn’t.
Is there a connection or am i being paranoid? It’s not me in the video.",13Aug2019,1
153,"We only had sex once, it was May 10th of this year. I used a condom, I believe I put it on correctly, and I took it off as soon as I finished. The only way I can imagine any semen went inside of her was from precum, I put lube on my penis before putting on the condom, an then put some on the opening of her vagina with the same hand right after, then I put some on the condom. I masturbated a few hours before and don't remember if I peed between then and when we had sex. Since then, she has had 2 periods and said she had pms both times, and I think withdrawal bleeding. The first was extreme, she had horrible pain and was vomiting, she said she's felt it build up to that before if she doesn't take anything to help the pain. the second was normal for her, both were ""late"" but her cycle is always long, and it almost always comes after her app predicts. She had a cold for almost a month, I know she had a sore throat and a stuffy nose, but I don't think she was nauseous. She went to her gynecologist after her really bad period and got birth control pills, recently she finished her first pack of them, she bled on placebos for two days and said it was otherwise normal excluding it's length. I feel like deep down I know she isn't because of her periods, but I get so fucking scared that she really is, I hate feeling irrational like this and I know I should just buy her a test but she doesn't love that idea because she says she doesn't need one, and knows she isn't, I don't know how she knows but she says she does.",13Aug2019,1
154,"Should probably be asking this in a car / auto sub but even those places seemed a little inappropriate based on the requirements for posting.

I am 23 years old and a recent college graduate. I have zero debt. I am happy with my current living situation and I have a well-paying job. Four years ago, I fortunately, luckily, and undeservedly ended up with a 2012 Mercedes-Benz C300 Sport 4matic. The vehicle has served me well all the years I have driven it. As of now, it has just over 83,000 miles and is in need of repairs / maintenance (brakes, tires) in the foreseeable future.

I am highly considering trading in the Mercedes for a Honda Civic Hatchback ST. I understand this could seem nonsensical, but I would ask that you see some details below and help provide any advice - should I drive my current car into the ground or trade in for a new one?

1. I fear that the value of the Mercedes will be diminished greatly around the 90,000 - 100,000 miles mark. Additionally, since it is quite costly to repair, I think that getting the estimated $9,500 KBB trade in value for it now would make sense.
2. This is much more of an existential thing to me than I've found it is for other people, but, while the Mercedes is a fantastic car, never once have I driven it and said to myself, ""I love this car."" This is because the car has never really been mine. I feel so fortunate to be driving a nice vehicle that is paid off, believe me. But, I have this burning desire to love the vessel that I utilize every day whether it be getting me to and from work Monday through Friday, or driving several hours up north for an overnight hike in the mountains. I long for the good feeling of earned ownership.
3. The most recent quote on the specific vehicle I am eyeing was $25,975 before taxes, fees, etc. With a trade in valued at $9,500, I'd plan to add a $3,000 down payment on top of that. Assuming I can get the full value of my trade in (which I know is rather difficult) I'd have \~$12,500 down. $25,975 - \~$12,500 = $13,475 (before taxes and fees) to be financed .

I am nervous about incurring a car payment. I could go on about my current monthly expenses (such as rent) and throw out the nitty gritty figures, (I could still provide) but I figure it'd be best to save the breath there. The long-short is that even though I know I could afford it, a car payment just seems daunting.

Not really sure how to end this so I suppose I will just ask for thoughts and opinions, experiences and perspectives. Trade in, or run the Mercedes into the ground? 

Thank you in advance.",13Aug2019,0
155,"Okay so I’m currently 20 years old and have been friends with this girl since I was 15. She and I were SO close in high school, there wasn’t a weekend we didn’t spend together. My junior year she had me join this group of volleyball friends she had, and I started liking this guy. She was super shady about it from the beginning, like texting him constantly. Well long story short I got denied by him, and the next morning she tells me that she kissed him and planned on dating him. I was destroyed. Another situation was she refused to drive me home and made me walk because “it was only 5 minutes”. Like she legitimately just didn’t want to do it so she made me walk home. She also refused to talk to me for a week because I confided in a mutual friend about my feelings towards her and wanted advice, and that friend told her and that made her upset. There were so many more minor occurrences during high school but I ALWAYS forgave her, I stood up for her when people told me she was shitty and I always made decisions based on what she’d think about it. Well then in January of 2018, I was raped. I told her the night after it happened. She was the ONLY one who I told about it, and I made her swear not to tell anyone until I was ready. The next day her mom calls mine and tells her about it. I didn’t get my own time to prepare or get myself together or anything. She took that from me, but that’s not it. She reassured me a million times that I could tell my other friends on my own time. I had 2 main friend groups, but I told my college friend group first due to the fact that I could be face to face with them at that time, and then I told me high school friend group. Summer of 2018, my high school group (there were 4 of us) had ignored me and “she” (referring to whom this post is about obviously) was the one who caused it. She purposefully talked about me and anything she could to make my other two friends not want to be around me. Well I finally tell my friends like months after, I waited until they were home from college. They at first were very supportive, but a few days later I’m out with my boyfriend to eat and I get a message from them about how unfair and disrespectful it was for me to tell my college friends first. And She was the one who had told them that I told them last. But again it was so that I could tell them face to face. I was destroyed, heartbroken, and alone. I had never felt so awful. That is the exact reason why victims don’t tell anyone. How do you even justify that? Fast forward to now. Me and her had taken a break of being friends, and that break lasted 3 months. And in those 3 months I grew up and realized with her not being in my life, I was able to be myself again. I had less anxiety attacks, my depression improved. I genuinely bettered myself. We’re friends again and it at first started off great and we were back to us again. Now I’m feeling the same sort of bullshit from her, but I’m not upset or anxious about it, I truly don’t give a damn about her. I have moved on from that toxic friendship. But is that wrong? Am I being too focused on the past? I’m worried that I’m taking things to loosely and becoming anti social or i don’t even know the word for it. I just need advice, any or everything. Sorry this was long I kind of ranted. Thanks for reading if you made it here.",13Aug2019,3
156,"So my family has been looking for a house for a while now since we’re tired of renting. Due to my jobs (2), school, and church I don’t get to see them as often anymore. They plan outings without me, go out to the movies or to eat without me, and family decisions aren’t really family anymore, it’s just between them. 

Overall, I feel like it’s them and me, like it’s not family anymore. Somehow, I’m at fault in all of this for trying to finish school, and since I don’t get any help from my parents for school (and I wouldn’t want them to tbh) I work 2 jobs to supply my needs. I pay insurance, my phone bill, cable, internet, Hulu, Netflix, Prime and bring in groceries every once in a while. Also, all my personal stuff is on me.

Well, they found a house, and they all love it. Except it’s a house that is convenient for all of them except for me. Both my jobs would be 45 minutes away making them 1 hour and a half commute, school is 25 minutes away, and church is 35 minutes away (it’s a very active church, I go there Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday). So it’s like I just can’t live with them. I’ve talked to my mom about it, and how I can’t make that commute because I’d be spending twice as much on gas, and I’d spend long periods of time on the road, but it seems that despite all of it she’s still willing to go through wit it. 

I can’t stop them from buying their dream home because I don’t want to, because one day I’ll move out and I don’t want them to regret getting something they don’t want. A simple solution would be finding jobs that are closer to the house, but I can’t, and I just don’t think any other job would be as flexible as the ones I already have that are willing to work with and my family, school, church and other job schedule (trust me I’ve tried).

I just don’t want to leave them, at least not yet, I wasn’t part of my plan, I love them very dearly, but at this point I can’t find an option, and it seems that leaving them wouldn’t hurt them as much as it would hurt me, because even though I told them I might move out they’re still going through with it. I’m in a very tight spot and Idk what to do :(",13Aug2019,2
157,(NSFW) Everyone in this story is of age. A couple nights ago my husbands cousin wanted to hangout and since I didn’t have work the next day I decided we could have a sleepover.  When she came over the topic of LSD came up and we decided to take some. As the night went on I could tell she was getting turned on and she kept on bringing the topic of sex. My husband was upstairs and she began saying we should wake him up and ask him if it was ok if she and I had sex. Even though I was also in the mood I didn’t want to have sex with her so I just kept laughing at her question but she became more and more persistent on asking him to the point where she took me upstairs where my husband was asleep and kept telling me to ask him to have a threesome. She also started saying things like “we aren’t first cousins” to justify what she was doing. At this point I told her she was starting to make me have a bad trip and she went downstairs. Since then I can’t stop thinking about it even though I have spoke to my husband about everything she said and was doing and I also ended up blocking her on all social medias and even her phone number but I need advice and getting over this. I don’t know why I can’t stop replaying that disgusting awkward situation. What can I do?,13Aug2019,2
158,"So while on a call with a friend I realized something about myself. Some background: I'm introverted and rarely leave the house unless I need to. Like unless I have school or something I just won't leave the house or my room.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've always known that I'm not spontaneous when it comes to starting plans. Like if it's 3pm and someone's like ""wanna hang out rn"" I'll say no. It's because I wanna have it planned like at least a few days in advance (idk why).

&amp;#x200B;

BUT also: I have an insane amount of trouble committing to things. So for example if I'm invited to a party, I'll say I'm probably gonna go but I might not -- so if I don't show up I'm good.

&amp;#x200B;

So since I don't like committing to things ahead of time and I don't like doing things the-day-of, I basically never do anything.

161,"Not sure if this belongs here. Let me know if not I guess? 

I’m a twenty something dude that has all the potential in the world but I can’t gather myself together enough to harness any of that potential. I’ve always had a hard time taking stuff serious and can easily be seduced by procrastination/distraction. 

My parents both came from farm families and are the first generation to graduate high school in my family, they grew up in wholesome, somewhat harsh conditions. So they took the laid back approach raising my brother and myself. They divorced when I was 4 and really had no expectations for us like needing to go to college or anything other than being a genuine, honest person, being happy, and loving those that matter to me. It was a civil divorce and they were still in it for both of us, but they both had to work full time and custody was set to only see my dad on weekends and once a week for dinner so I grew up with him being for of a cool friend rather than having a father figure. 

They never talked to me like I was a child growing up but they are nice, reasonable people. It’s all made me who I am so really can’t complain. As long as I had good grades in school I was mostly free to do what I wanted when I wanted. They were busy being single parents and that left myself and the internet/video games to raise me and form around the base morals they engrained into me. So I was able to force myself to do good in school for the sake of freedom by day (A’s and B’s for the most part, I think I got a C and a D on a report card one time each) so I could go home and eat junk food and absolutely wreak havoc on people’s lives in Halo 3 by night. 

Starting around sophomore year of high school I started smoking weed and isolating myself from people because the powers that be [insert tragic, depressing, more of my batman origins sob story here; family passings, broken leg, relationship problems blah blah] really dove into the pit of darkness of believing there was no god and if there was he hated me (back when I took god literally and thought he was a dude floating around in the sky). 

Video games were what kept me sane through my darkest times in life because it was the perfect outlet. I never had to take any of my anger or frustrations out on the random people in my actual life when I could have everyone I know like me and just go online to my alter ego and wreck people then tea bag them to the point of sending hate mail. Wasn’t a healthy coping technique turns out because people started walking all over me in real life and treating me like a pushover. 

My mom knew I was going through really hard times but her way of letting me get through it was giving me space (I always argued with her as a teenager, turns out I’m exactly how she was with her mom growing up) and letting me find my own way through, [my dad unfortunately had a really bad motorcycle ouchie when I was 19 leaving him with severe a TBI [lots of other bats flying around this story] .

So I flew off the wagon and couldn’t tolerate when people were fake or partake in any group think of any kind. I lost a lot of “friends” and was either loved or hated depending on what kind of people I was around. I made the decision in my life to always try to “cause no harm, but take no shit”. I never turned to alcohol or did drugs unless you count smoking weed all day everyday. 

Then after 4 years of working 36 hours a week at a sandwich shop and doing lots of goblin leisurely, online and in the real world a switch flipped when my mom and I were arguing one night and she was finally able to pierce through my stubbornness and made me realize there are things in this world that I love and are still worth loving(her being a major one) and just need to figure out how to succeed. 

I decided to cut all ties with the toxic environment I had created for myself and quit my job, got a new one an hour and a half north in the mountains, and start a new life based on peace and love.  I’m currently on my second year up here after that move and have a full time job working nights at a ski resort and have an apartment to my self for the first time in my life. These past two years up here have been amazing but of course comes with its own highs and lows. 

So I have an understanding that life comes with its highs and its lows and you wouldn’t be able to feel one without the other. I realize that I love everything just as much as I hate everything. There are two sides of every coin. I understand there are reason for evil and reasons for love. I believe everything happens for a reason ( God for religious people, the unknown/universe for curious/scientific people). So, I just need some advice on how to take control of my life and get my goals achieved. 

My goals are limitless. I want to do everything. I want to experience everything. I want to be happy, be sad, hated and loved. I just can’t bring myself to settle for only getting a job then raising a family and that is the end of the road. I do want to raise a family one day but I need to experience life first. I need to mold myself into a great father figure for my children rather than never having the chance to grow up myself like my father before me. My goals go beyond material success but that seems to be the part of the puzzle that is holding me back. I always write out all my goals in big bubble charts, break them down into manageable steps, write timelines/deadlines but it seems like I just don’t have the discipline or work ethic to actually achieve any goals. I will start something, do decent at it, then give it up and continue on daydreaming about all the steps and my life in the future. If I even can bring myself to start in the first place. So, I guess how can I bring my dreams into reality? 

The plan I have set for myself now is go to business school during the days and work my job at night still to fund living expenses. I wont be able to attend the college here with instate tuition until I have been a resident for over a year (commuted for the first month then lived off the books with a roommate in a cabin with no paper proof up until this April) and really have no aim or direction in what I could be doing to gain success in the meantime. 

My end goal in life at this point would be to make enough money that I could reasonably go where I wanted when I wanted, go to any fancy restaurant with my whole family and not worry about the bill, and something I remember I always said I would do as a kid was buy my Mom a lake house in the Rocky Mountains. I’m more than willing to go through the highs and lows and work hard but I can’t find motivation that is lasting. I always just end up daydreaming then not acting on these dreams. So enough rambling, hopefully I managed to make sense through this. Thank you if you bared through that with me. I wish you all happiness and good luck in your pursuits!!!

I've kept in good contact, hanged, helped each other out; whenever something bad happened, they'd text me and I was there at least texting them and talking things out with them through boyfriends, girlfriends, and struggles in life.

Left on read, then they'd text me a few days it a week later complaining about not having the guy they want or about a new movie they just saw the trailer for.

165,"I'm going to list off what's been going on with me as fast as I can.

Three weeks ago my right testicle starts to hurt.

I see a doctor at a walk in clinic and get diagnosed with Epididymitis and I was given 10 days worth of antibiotics.

I get an ultrasound the next day and yup I have Epididymitis.

The pain on the right side doesn't start to go away until the 7th day of taking antibiotics. I was then left with an uncomfortable feeling.

On the last day of taking antibiotics I became 98% better, no pain or discomfort.

Two days after being done with the antibiotics the uncomfortable feeling started to come back.

Went back to the walk in clinic and the only thing they did was to say I should schedule an appointment with the urologist.

I make the appointment, but it's for September 9th. (it's August 12th as I write this)

A week goes by and the pain/discomfort starts to get a bit worse.

I go back to the walk in clinic for the 3rd time last Friday and this time they want to test my pee and to get another ultrasound.

They test my pee and everything is fine with it.

I got my ultrasound today and a couple of hours later they call me.

They said that my right testicle is inverted.

They also said that it's not testicular torsion and that I still have a good blood flow.

Their going to send my ultrasound results to the urologist and see if I can see him sooner. If I don't hear from them by this Wednesday I should call them.

I looked up ""inverted testicle"" online and I couldn't find anything.  

So, what do you guys think? How do you think this could be solved?

Can a doctor/urologist de-invert my right testicle manually or will surgery have to happen? Do you think this is Epididymitis related or something separate?

All thoughts and advice is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.",13Aug2019,0

167,"Hey y'all.   


I'm a 21 year old male. Nothing really super lame about me, I kind of am lame by nature which makes this especially difficult. 

I recently had a mutual breakup with my girlfriend of 5 years. I'm now lonelier than ever. 

I'm a musician and more than anything I want to start meeting people in bands and other musicians to play with I just have no idea how to do it. 

My main issues lie in 

1. My personalty
2. My budget
3. Being too afraid to go and talk to people 

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said before, I'm kind of a lame person by nature. All my friends in high school were dorks, I used to be pretty nerdy but I outgrew all that stuff some time ago. I'm really looking to go out and drink and party with people and go to live shows. I never seem to be able to make it work. 

I honestly don't think I'm half bad looking, like I look like I could fit in with cool people. I just don't.

I'm off work these next 3 days so I'm sure I can get out and do stuff. 

My biggest issue is I live 45 minutes from downtown, and in my area that's the only place anything ever happens. So, I need to go out to these places, drink, pay to get into a show and hopefully talk to people and then what? Are they supposed to chill with me after a short, awkward 5 minute conversation?   


  
I don't know.

I've had a bunch of coworkers in the past who were super cool and we honestly get along great and they have all these things I'm looking for and will literally tell me that they will invite me to stuff, but they just never do. And I don't want to bother people and be an overbearing creep so I just kind of let it go. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts?",13Aug2019,1

169,"My father is almost 60 years old. He ran a business and raised 4 children (2 girls and 2 boys) with help of my mother. He was always verbally abusive towards me, my brother and my mother. Occasionally physically abusive too. He is still very disrespectful and abusive towards my mother, although not so much with his children. He rarely speaks to my Elder brother. At this age he is addicted to Facebook and YouTube and always talks about things like how the BJP(Indian political party in power) and its policies are dangerous for this countries and sad and angry whenever they are supported by people on internet or media.

Sometimes he talks about how he can make Billions of Rupees(Indian currency) with just an Idea(All are useless ideas).

He wanted to make a hotel and a restaurant which he always claims that he wants me to run it and I continuously have denied by saying that I don't believe that I am the kind of person that can do this job and I just want to do programming or do something in STEM field. I have been denying to run a hotel from 4-5 years. In our city all the hotel and restaurant businesses are failing and unprofitable but he still believes that there is something that I can do.

Now his first business(Tyre retreading business) is ran by some one, My father gets some amount of money from there and The hotel is also ran by some one, the whole building is on lease.

He even wants me to marry some one's divorced daughter with a 6 years old girl to whom he needs to pay a large amount of money.

I am patient with him now days and he listens to me now but still never tries things like meditation, yoga or reading a book which I tell him to do. He says he doesn't want to put any effort in it, he has no motivation.

Sometimes he blames my mother for things he didn't do or don't want to do. My mother runs a small business too and she has paid almost 50% of our tuition and living expenses, which is always denied by my father and always wants to take all the credit. He has taken a lot of my mother's money and never returned.

I have completed my studies in that time and going to join a big american MNC this January and most probably come back for once in a year.

I want to help my father. I want him to talk to my brother. I want him to be respectful to my mother. I want him to take care of his mental health. I want him to read books or anything that is good for a person in his age.

I’m 19 years old. This September will make it a year since I’ve been out of high school. I spent the last year working on music but after much thought and failure, I don’t see it going anywhere (or at least not anytime soon). I can’t afford to wait around any longer. Money is becoming a major issue. I knew a few months back I was becoming depressed and suffered from a sort of anxiety but I just ignored it. Well, it has gotten worse. 

A few weeks back I decided to shift my focus on acting. Dramatic arts has always been my stronger suit so I thought, why not? Got my headshots taken, signed up for a casting call website, and started submitting. As you probably guessed it, I’ve gotten no response in the past two weeks. I mean, it’s understandable but I can’t have that. Not again. I can’t afford to waste another year of my life in doing something for nothing.

173,"Alright guys, I hope i can make sense out of most of this. So the problem started when I was born. My dad named me A B C, my first, middle and last name, but back in his home country, the mothers last name is the middle and the paternal last name is the last. And that's how I've lived my entire life. This only became a problem when I started to apply for financial aid and filled out paper work for job related things.

 It turns out the name I've been going by doesn't match the name on my birth certificate or my social security. My dad got my last and middle names mixed up so now its A C B. When it came to my job, I had to update my personal information in order for me to continue working there, which wasn't really a problem, but back in high school, I filled out my financial aid documents using my wrong name, and now it's come back to haunt me. Many years have passed since the last time I had to submit documents for my financial aid, and now that I'm going back to school, I'm using my correct name, and they're telling me that the name I currently submitted does not match the social security name I primarily submitted all those years ago.

174,"Hey people of reddit. Sorry for the mobile format, but I needed to type this out here and now. 

To set things up, I’m a 13-15 year old teenager, and I frequent an app called animo. I have a bunch of amazing friends on there, and the one I’m talking about, whom we’ll call Jaren for the sake of this post. 

Ive been friends with Jaren for about 5/6 of a year now, and we have a ongoing rp. I was under the impression he was a 14 year old, and going into highschool this year. Red flags did appear, such as when he started telling me more about himself. 
He had a YouTube channel, which I will not name, but it’s almost to 40 subscribers. He worked for his father, and about half a year into us talking, moved into a house with his friend whom was presumably a year or so older than him. 
Jaren is on the chubbier side, with a beard and scraggly hair, but when I saw his appearance, I didn’t judge and just assumed it was in his genetics. Though he didn’t look like a 14 year old. 
More red flags appeared, containing him not going to highschool this year and me learning that there was no supposed adult living with him. 
Though I have suspected things for awhile, I’m not dumb mind you and I do frequent r/letsnotneet and such and these things were always bothering me in the back of my mind. 

The truth all came crashing down today, when I was in a discord call with Jaren and his friend while Jaren was streaming on his YouTube channel. 
Jaren admitted that he is not in fact 14, but in his 20’s. (born in between 1900 and 1999, he won’t specify) and all the things listed above started to make sense. 

I came here because I need to know what to do. Should I stop being friends with him? 
I don’t want to, he’s a great friend and has supported me through some of my mental issues.
I can see why someone would think that though.

One of my closest (guy) friends has feelings for me, and (I got some solid advice.) he’s clearly shy. 

Soooo, I kinda sorta texted him. To confront him about what he said about him liking me. There are just some things that don’t work out when I text people:

•Things I say might go out of context

•I’m very impatient

•Maybe a little too straightforward 

So the conversation would go like any other conversation, say hey, talk about life, etc. But, since i’m impatient that he hasn’t said anything about this, I say something. 

“Hey, so I have a question. About us.”

I could tell he was taken back, because of how hesitant he was. The rest of the conversation is just way too awkward to type. Long story short, it’s just awkward between us now.

182,"I'm (17) put over the edge. I'm always extremely stressed from my family and it only keeps getting worse. My mental health is deteriorating and I dont trust my family to tell them in order to get help.

We always argue and my parents dont respect boundaries. I tell them stop pressuring me about a certain thing I need to do, and my parents dont. The amount of arguing and snarkiness within my family is unhealthy and takes a big toll on my mental health, worsening my symptoms of anxiety and depression.

And school has started and I have had multiple anxiety attacks in the past few days, been crying, and all around miserable. School makes me feel terrible and stressed with the pressure of keeping up with tests and homework and grades.  Luckily it is my last year of high school but I'm still miserable because it's not over yet. 

And then when I come home, I can't have my own space because my moms intrusive. If I go to my room to try to relax, my mom or someone in my family barge in and are nosy/came to remind me again of everything I need to do. My parents get mad at me if I close the door so I am forced to have it open. I got fed up and locked my door once, and mom noticed pretty quickly when she tried to barge in. She started banging on the door and refused to leave until I opened it. How can I have my own space if this happens!? I just want time to myself. 

And then college-- my parents have been pressuring me daily, multiple times a day to write these admission essays. This has caused an immense amount of anxiety to build over the past month, even though I've told them to stop. My stress headaches went away after school ended in may but began to happen again once they started pressuring me. And I want to go to college, but I'm not sure what for. I have the work ethic and grades to do well but my mental health and motivation are struggling. I think moving out from my parents will fix a lot of my mental health problems and college seems to be the only way out but the problem I face is: my mental health is terrible and I'm extremely stressed so I'm going to struggle.  

I've been a wreck all day because of my parents and school, crying and having a stress headache since 9 this morning. I've had multiple anxiety attacks and dont want to live like this anymore. It only gets worse living with them and I feel like I'd be in a much better place if I could just move out. I dont know where to since I dont have a job but it's pretty miserable as is.

185,"So this is my first post, so please bare with me.

A little back history

I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about a year and half

We are both going through divorces and we both have kids that love each other, we both also suffer from mental health issues, his from military, and mine from trauma 

I have a problem with sex, it feels like I need it pretty frequently. I’ve noticed it help me balance my moods and keeps my mental in check

The issue is that he doesn’t want sex except for maybe once a week. 

I know that there are plenty of people out there who get it less, but I’ve made it point to tell him it’s something that I pretty much require in our relationship.

In my opinion, there are three main focuses in a relationship that help balance everything and help make the relationship work. Emotional/mental support, financial independence, and sexual/physical/intimacy 

We both struggle financially. But I tend to be the one who supports him. I pay for his car insurance, I buy food for him, his home, and his kids while also handing him a pretty decent amount of cash to make sure he can take them out to do stuff.

I give him back rubs, full body massages, and I do pretty much anything sexually that HE wants when HE wants it 

I also do my best to stay up at night with him and soothe him when his PTSD, depression, or anxiety kicks in. 

In other words, I do pretty much everything I can to take care of his needs and wants

Then there’s me. 

I can’t ask him for financial help and that’s not really
Much of an issue for me

When I’m having break downs or spiraling moments I deal with them myself 

When it comes to sex, I get the bare minimum, usually.

I crave touch. I love to be rubbed on. I want him to touch me and rub me way more than he does. It seems as though there’s only two times he will rub on me: when I ask him to, or when I’m already pissed off about not getting that intimacy, then the worst thing he can do at that moment is try to do something because then I feel like I’m making him do it

When he wants sex, I provide the best ways I can. Hand jobs, blow jobs, dirty, passionate, teasing

Whatever suits him at the moment 

When I want sex, USUALLY he just sticks his dick in and goes until he cums, which is all of 5 mins

There’s nothing for me. There’s no intimacy, no foreplay, nothing special for me like oral or fondling. 

I’ve told him over and over again that I need more. Each time he says he will do better and for about a week or two it’ll be better then it’s like “well she’s happy now, now I can go back to doing my thing.” And I absolutely hate it

I hate asking for sex. I feel like I’m begging my man for his dick and I can’t stand that. But if I don’t then I just get it once a week or every other week. Mean while I’m still massaging him and making him feel like a king

He’s 32 and I’m 25. I know that might play a little bit into it being that I’m younger and have a crazy high drive.

But still, I could be dolled up and laying in the bed just trying to get his attention, much like tonight, and he just stares at his phone and shows me videos once in a while. And gets me the most is that tonight is the last night we have together this week because I have to go to work on night shifts and he will be at training. 

I’ve had people tell me to stop doing everything that I do for him. But this is just who I am, so it’s hard for me to stop it.

So instead of having a great night together...here I am. On Reddit. Looking for advice to get my man to notice me more

I’m so depressed right now and I feel like I’m just being stupid

But I’m tired of telling him that I need more.

Like I said before there’s three things I value in a relationship. He can’t provide for me financially, he doesn’t provide for me emotionally. So I feel like the least he could fucking do is provide for me physically.

The most action I got tonight, is me laying in my side of the bed, butt ass naked. Him on his side butt ass naked. And he put his hand on my hip. Twice.",13Aug2019,1

My mom ended up coming into town the same day which was already planned because I'm giving birth to my second child this week.

My grandma is already out of the hospital so realistically my aunt can just go home now but I know she won't. My aunt is the type of person that likes to do stuff around town CONSTANTLY (always has to be doing something) and can never just do it alone. 

So now my mom is staying at her hotel rather than with myself at my house like was planned and I have hardly seen her. Today they are going to tj maxx and Walmart to look for deals for my aunts grandchildren... that's how bad my aunt is about just constantly doing stupid shit around town 24/7. 

I really dont want my aunt at the hospital, so now I have to ask that she and my mother do not come disturb me while I try to labor calmly and wait until AFTER I call them that I am ready for visitors to come to the hospital, which I doubt they will listen to. 

When I had my son people came into the room to visit maybe 10 minutes after birthing him before I could even get dressed.

 And my biggest annoyance of all is that now when I go home my mom isnt going to be able to stay over and help me adjust and help with the baby which was the ENTIRE point of her coming for the week because my aunt will either want to come over (I dont want her too) or drag her around to do things with her around town the entire time and my aunt doesnt even realize how she is intruding. 

I tried to kind of explain my frustration through text to my JNMOM which she has yet to reply to but I doubt I'll have the chance to explain to her how I feel in person because my aunt just cant let us be alone and if I say something, I'll just be the bitxh of family.

I’ve been sad thinking about stuff like missing chances with people and how death and time will prevent a lot of things for me,my lack of talent and definitive plans for a career path in college,lack of friends and how I disagree with people in my area on a lot of real world matters and don’t find the same things fun that they do too so that’s nice as well.

196,"im posting here instead of relationship advice because i feel this is much more general and appropriate for this sub. so i have never been lonely because i have made friends when young who stuck. once i entered freshman, interests diverged., so we are not that close anymore even though we are still in the same friend group. in freshman i was approached by some guys and i had a friend group for a while. now im a rising junior and feel like everybody hates me one or is annoyed by me one way or another. im extremely socially awkward but get much more comfortable when i am close with people. i dont know how to make friends but that has never been a problem until now. i think i was only approached because i was somewhat attractive.. But over the years i did regrettable things that were really shitty of me as a person. not only am i not the most ""feel good"" person to be around, i feel i may also be perceived threatening because our friend group is bonded by a particular interest that dictates our entire lives, and i am the best at it.  please do not get me wrong. I am not bragging. i put in probably 10x everyones efforts. but this still i think makes things worse. i am afraid that all the people i have wronged in the past  inlcuding my friends and more collectively hate me and want to sabotage me one way or another because of these reasons. they only talk to me when they need something. and when i broke my arm and sent a wall of text explaining the situation nobody responded in the group chat except for one barely relevant 1 letter response. ""L"" . i was a very shitty person and i think i have changed my ways. i always am very  conscious of how i treat others and put everyones needs before mine. of course it is too late, its my fault anyway. but now i am at a loss... does anyone have any advice on how to proceed?",13Aug2019,1
197,"So I met this really awesome guy on bumble-Funny, attractive, smart.... you know the rest. We start texting and for the first three days, things were going pretty great. We exchanged selfies, sent each other funny GIFS. I decided to IG stalk him to see if he was legit since the conversation was getting sort of intense...(if you know what i mean) and I find him. On the night of the third day, he fell asleep (which I expected, it was late). I texted him good morning the next day and nothing, two days passed and still nothing. I decided to text him again and he answered saying that he’s bad at replying. We talk again for the night, and same thing happened, he stopped. I texted him in the morning and nothing.  Two days passed, I texted him in the night and once again he apologizes for not replying and that night we talked for a bit but I ended the conversation saying good night and I didn’t reply back to his good night text. The next morning he texted me first, but we only texted twice that day because he lagged so much.  That day I decided to do some IG stalking again and I couldn’t find him on my personal account. I run a community-awareness IG account so I decide to search him through there and I find him.... so I guess he blocked me? At the end of the day, he doesn’t reply. I got ready to go out with some friends and I texted him some selfies, which he replied to a hour later and compliments me and apologizes for not replying.  Later that night, I texted him some updates about my night to which he doesn’t reply to.  A day later (today), I decided to check bumble and he’s not there anymore and so he either unmatched me or blocked me. I’m kind of tempted on texting him but I’m confused.     Help?

203,"Am I in the wrong myself and my wife have asked my sister to look after my kids while we both work. I have three kids 2 in school and one goes to preschool 4 times a week. We pay her some money to look after the three when my wife and I are working. My wife and I currently work on a 11 day on 3 day off roster starting at 430 am till 5pm. When we invited her to do babysitting she asked if she could bring her fiance who she has been dating for a couple of months.

This guy we shall call him terry is 29 I'm 27 and my sister is 19. Both of these two love birds have been staying with us for a couple of months. We only see terry at dinner times or when my sister makes him food. He all but stays hidden in our spare room all day he also refuses to do any house work or contribute in any way around the house while myself and my wife work.His excuse for not doing anything is that he is prone to breaking things and ""it's not his thing"". Which makes both me and my spouse furious as we don't like housework much ourselves. He likes to sit in his room all day moaning hes bored.

 My sister will only make dinners when we are both working and then won't clean any mess she makes in doing so. She will only make an effort about once a week to do any chores or stuff around the house. About every Tuesday when it's time for her benefit to come in. She obviously does it so that she can then ask that I take her to town so she can get smokes.

I have sat down with her on three occasions and asked for both of them to contribute around the house doing chores. And asking them to respect the house we are in. As on one occasion she had burnt a hole in our carpet while trying to light the firey. We also had to talk to her about not using our car to take my children to the bus. It stops about 20 m from our front door we had previously mentioned that on raining days she could do it. Thenn after it rained one day she started doing this every day. I told her then that she didn't need to do that every day as it didn't rain all the time she agreed and then later bitched to my wife. Saying that I was some sort of asshole for saying not to use the car.

 I have also talked to our kids and there have been times when it was raining where they were sent to there room while wife and I were working. Magically my sister has appeared with hickeys all over her neck on this day the kids were sent to there rooms so we assume it was done so they could have sex. So in conclusion I'm just looking for advice as how to proceeded as each time I go to my sister she agrees with me but then bitches to my wife what a wanker I am. To which my wife says nothing as its ""your problem as she's your family"". And when not around them moans about how little they are doing around the house and how they do dumb shit like slam doors and shower together late at night when we both are trying to sleep.",13Aug2019,1

Now here’s where it gets dicey and my naivety shows. Then she told me she was already transferring to another store in order to take college elsewhere as this is a community college she needed the work for (and one I go to as well). Okay, I said you can Venmo or PayPal that’s fine. We both agreed and in two weeks I got her grade from a 41 to a 71. Not the best but still passing and the best I could do with taking classes myself. I did a total of 17 assignments, with 100s on all of them, and was to be paid 170$.

She is now pushing the time to pay me back and back. Saying she’ll pay me next paycheck (she has done this twice now). She has recently moved away to the new college about a half hour away.

Sadly knowing where this is going, how can I suspend her without outing myself? I still have her password for her school portal and access to all of her teachers.  As far as assignments go it’s pretty obvious what she did and what I did (boy this girl is terrible at English). Is it possible for her to get in trouble at another school?",13Aug2019,2

Cast:
X-friend in question
G-friends friend
A-x's gf

So I've been friends with X for a while and I'm kinda unsure how trustworthy or how good of a friend he really is. I live close to the school we go to so we often hang at my house. But another reason seems to be that my house is an ""in between"" for him, between school and A's house. Now I get it, coochie conquest, but it's kinda annoying for him to pop in for a few hours just knowing it's because it's easier than going home, before going to his gf's house. And often when he does come over he rags on G because G is kinda a piece of crap, but not like all that bad. But so a few times I've noticed we had plans to hang out, and he bails last minute for ""family reasons"" and I eventually get wind that he was just hanging with G. I get that people have other friends, but lying just to bail and hang out with someone you talk shit about? Really? 

Ik this is petty stuff, but I've told X some really personal stuff and I'm really unsure if I should trust him as much as I did. What if he's talking shit behind my back all the time? What if he's spreading shit I just tell him? I'm not sure if I should just confront him or ghost him. We've been friends for a long time and this honestly kinda hurt.

I didn’t end up with the grades I wanted because I couldn’t keep up with the material, and I fell for a girl I couldn’t have. I don’t want to get into the details because they aren’t important for me seeking advice. The only reason I’m bringing those things up is because that’s what triggered my anxiety. Almost 6 months later, I’m struggling hard. 

I’ve acquired awful habits that I cannot break and I know aren’t helping my anxiety and depression. I started chain smoking swishers. I started because work was stressful and the buzz helped me clear my head while I went for a drive. But now I can’t stop. Not only is it bad for my health, but I can’t afford to buy them every other day. I only eat fast food once a day. So I’m spending more money and only eating one meal per day. I hardly drink any water. My sleep schedule is out of whack. And I can’t find the energy to go outside on my days off. I’m a wreck. 

I was going to counseling but I can’t afford it anymore because of my other bills on top of stupid spending habits. So now I’m seeking advice from anyone out there willing to slap me in the face and point me in some sort of direction. 

What do I do? How can I break my awful habits? How can I find any motivation or any energy to get into a healthy routine? My body doesn’t feel healthy but my sluggish attitude doesn’t care.

211,"Hi all,

I genuinely am scared to talk about this because I feel that I'll be judged for this, but fuck it. I have moderate Aspergers. Every day, I'm reminded of how I feel inferior to other people around me. I feel (hell I *know*) that I:

* have a lower IQ than the average population
* have no social skills
* have no friends family who likes me only out of pity
* have no chance in life.

When I was a kid, I was in a group therapy that was free and in my elementary school, and I was always getting into trouble for not paying attention and other stuff. At the end of it, I was told that 'this is going to help make sure that you don't end up in prison' (I was there for suicidal ideation and attempts, and not being socially up to par with my peers). Ever since I found out (I didn't know I was autistic until after I left my group therapy), I've tried to fix the way I act, and be a good normal person, but I feel like I'm just dumb. Its a nagging thought in the back of my head that won't go away. Its the jokes people made on my behalf. Its the parent annoyed at their son being overly emotional. Its the fear that if anything in my environment is even slightly off, something terrible will happen. I've made progress in being a more normal person, but I can't get past these things. For the past few years, I've felt like everything bores me, even things I enjoy to do like drawing has a lingering feeling of unworthiness.

However, I do feel like I'm making some progress. For the past 3 months, I have done NoFap, meditation, Duolingo, and exercises, and I'm starting to feel a bit better, but it's not enough. What do I do to help my situation???",13Aug2019,1
212,"So for the last 9 years my mom's been in a relationship with an abusive man who really ruined my life, and honestly broke my spirit. My mom would always tell me to worship him, and got upset at me for crying and being sad, and she enabled him to continue his nonsense for years. She didn't protect me really, and I was her emotional crutch for years. For the past year and a half I moved away from her because he didn't pay the bills, and fled, and I alone got evicted. Being a senior in high school, I moved in with a friend's family, and I kind of dropped everyone. That was wrong of me, it was honestly just my mom and stepdad, but talking to my family just reminded me of the fucked up situation I was in, and the few times I did talk to my mom she would cry and he'll about how much I'm hurting her. 

My sister came into town, and I decided to start trying to fix the relationship at least with her, and it's been great for the most part, I apologized for stopping contact, and we joked and cried a little. My mom then came home, and the pain is still lingering, but my only halt is that she's really sick. She has kidney failure and is on dialysis, and she's become very small, and weaker. She's still messing around with my stepdad, who comes and goes every few months, but nothing has changed. I don't know if I can have a close relationship to her anymore but the guilt has been eating me because she is sick.

215,"alright. let me give you some context. my father was emotionally/verbally abused by his grandfather, who was also abused. it was all learned behavior: they all exhibit narcissistic characteristics. my dad was the eldest of four children and was not able to graduate high school as his home life was not stable enough to allow him to complete his schooling! he had to move out and live with friends.

my mother told me that the only reason i was born was that she wanted me, and my father didn't really seem to care about having children. he's always been very distant to me, especially as i got older. when i was younger i would, of course, approach him because it was my age lol and my dad and i would spend a lot of more time together. he's always away in his office either playing video games/working... he could spend days without seeing me or even interacting with me. i was aware of this but it hit me suddenly that he's always been like that...and that i don't really have a father figure

the emotional absence of my father has caused me so much. i can't interact with men without feeling awkward, so i always just talk to women because i feel more comfortable doing so. i feel like i'm always seeking a father figure even with friends/relationships and it's a shitty fucking feeling. i don't know what to do, and i am looking to go to therapy if you were wondering!

yesterday, my family went out and i decided to stay home for the day, my dad was off of work too. usually, when they are gone we go out to eat together! so we did that - he ordered a large margarita from the restaurant we went to and made it well aware that he was drunk. i drove him home and then he asked if i wanted to drink with him. being that we aren't that close, i figured that this could fix things? i don't know

so we have about four shots at first and sit down to watch a movie, not even five minutes later he asks me if i want to do another shot. i reluctantly say yes, boom, seven shots later. i told him that i couldn't do anymore. i felt like everything was jelly under me - i was stumbling over my own feet and my dad was finding it hilarious when it wasn't!!! i pretended to sleep while he asked me FOR ANOTHER SHOT (after we've had seven, keep in mind) and he ""wakes"" me up. it was the crappiest feeling like i had no control of the situation. i opened my eyes as he went back to his seat, i realized how messed up i was.

i laid there and tried not to cry, and once again he tries to get me to do another one. i told him i was going to blackout AND I KID YOU NOT, he told me ""it was okay to"" i almost crapped myself. i was upset that he could look me in the eye, his daughter that he barely pays any mind to and TELLS ME THAT I NEED ANOTHER ONE. i had to tell him SO many times that i did not want to and removed myself from the situation.

i laid in my room for a good hour until i passed out, i had multiple panic attacks and laid on the floor trying not to hyperventilate. i  just remember being so upset with my dad and wishing that nobody else would ever have to deal with this. call me dramatic, but i was drunk lol. my mom came home and i told her the entire thing, he has a record of this apparently.

i'm more angered at the fact that he could do such a thing to me, i felt like i had no control of anything and was being taken advantage of. im HIS DAUGHTER. i should not have to tell him multiple times that i did not want to do anymore. he kept calling me a loser and that i wasn't ""cool"" - he thought it was funny.... it's now the next day and i still feel equally as crappy. i don't wish this on anyone. please give some advice on how to move past this and heal.",13Aug2019,1

I recently moved into my first apartment, it's perfect. But over the last month I noticed on the shared back staircase that there are cigarette butts and Ash all over the stairs. The building is supposed to be non-smoking and I have slight asthma so when ever my neighbors smoke I cough quite a bit. This was strike one. On a few weeknights when I have work in the morning they have loud sex since their bed is super sqweeky and they have a headboard my lights actually shake and the noise wakes me up. I am not happy when I wake up at 1am and have to wait almost an hour for them to quiet down. That was strike two. Strike three was when the wife or girlfriend was taking the trash out and tore a hole in the bag causing old shredded lettuce to fall all over the main staircase and has refused to clean it up, it's been almost two weeks and it is still all over the hallway.

I contacted the landlord about the smoking and he had a conversation with them two days ago about it, it has seemingly stopped for the time being but now they are playing loud bassy music in the middle of the night or watching movies with the volume all the way up.

222,"So one of my friends who I have known for almost 8 years has had the habit of continuously getting back with her abusive ex. Over the past three years, they have probably broken up and gotten back together at least 10 tens (I wish I was exaggerating). Over this past year, I have been there for her when everyone else left when they got back together again. I had planned on leaving the friendship this past time but the circumstance of living in college together would have made this difficult. They broke up again, and this time I thought it was for sure. There has been restraining orders against him from her through the court and the school. She just let me know that she is dropping both of them and posted on Instagram about the importance of forgiving even the worst people because they deserve to be loved too. Now, while she hasn't told me directly that they are getting back together or friends again, I fear that that is in the works. She knows that I had planned on leaving last time but didn't find out until they had already broken up. Basically, I just want to know if I would be a bad friend if I did leave.

Last time we were getting on great and then out of nowhere she dropped it.

It’s usually in the little things like the way he acts or what he does/doesn’t do and I’m not sure why but I really over think it, I get really anxious about it, and it always hurts my feelings. I kind of overreact to these situations and think things like he secretly doesn’t want to be with me, or he doesn’t like this part about me, or that he doesn’t love me anymore and will leave me (which is one of my biggest fears). 

I fear that because I’m overreacting to these things so often and being so clingy and annoying that he will actually get sick of me and the way I act and leave, so it’s almost like a cycle. A lot of the time I am asking for reassurance from him and I’m just scared he’s going to get sick of me and my bullshit.

I can't give up my dreams, every time i've even tried to find a full time job (which are NOT easy to get these days) i became incredibly depressed existentially for giving up acting. because to pursue acting professionally you need to be constantly training and able to drop everything to attend an audition at the last minute, it just is what it is.

i just want to make peace with my choices. i want to find people LIKE ME, that are also working class pursuing this, that aren't consumed by the shallowness and superficiality of living in this city, or don't come from a trust fund. other people like ME have to exist, right? where are they hiding? i feel like no matter what I do, it's wrong. it feels awful. the lack of money really has fucked my self esteem, i can't even pretend like it hasn't. but i don't even know how to change that. i know i will make money from acting eventually... but WHEN?! it's hard not to second guess every decision i make because of how hard it is to be poor. its like anytime i read about money or people talking about money it just sends me into a spiral of depression becasue i dont have it and i don't know how to MAKE it. its like i have to unplug completely from everything, not even go on the internet, but then what do I do with my BRAIN?! its all just feels so fucked sometimes. i'm just having a bad day.

They don't respect our living space, they leave trash and dishes and stuff everywhere and they act like it's their house. They get an attitude if we ask them about their plans for moving and they guilt us and make us feel like we're bad people for wanting our own space... They keep claiming they will be leaving but they don't do anything to make it happen. They made this crazy plan to make a shipping container house, but my mom works part time and does side jobs and my dad is disabled and doesn't work, so it's not like they have the money to make this happen.

254,"As the title says, I’m having trouble deciding what college to go to. I only have a few days, more specifically, until the 19th. The college I’m going to has two different campus’s. The first one is 1 1/2 hours away, in a large city, and my best friend, along with some other friends, are going to be attending it. The second one is only 20 minutes away and is in a smaller city. The second one being a very small place with &lt;70 people rooming on campus.

My problem lies here:

If I go to the first campus, I will not be close to home and will miss friends who are still in high school (that graduate this year) as well as not being somewhere familiar to me. However, I’ll be starting life as an adult far away from my parents and I’ll exercise my own freedom.

If I go to the second campus, I will have no friends at all that are attending with me. I’ll also live on campus, so I would be a 20 minute drive from all my friends in my hometown as well as my parents. However, I’ll have the opportunity to room by myself and, again, exercise my own freedom.

This has really made my anxiety peak... and I’m not an anxious person at all.

I feel a large amount of dread for going to school at all. I don’t even know I I really want to go to college. It seems like such a big risk to pay since I’ll be (at least) $30,000 in debt when all is said and done.

1 being I have a bag of chips that are specially flavoured. 

They are flavoured to taste like apple and cinnamon. Kind of like an apple pie or apple crumble. 

Would it be a good idea to crumble it down into small ish pieces and make it into a cereal? 

It may be soggy after a while but in my mind I’m thinking it might just taste like an apple cinnamon rice crispies. They’re not crunchy or crispy btw just kind of nice and light, kind of rice crispy textured but just in chip form. 

Second question. 

How do I forgive myself? 

Not for coming up with this monstrous idea of making chips into cereal but just in general. 

I have a hard time forgiving myself about things I’ve done before.

I (18F) met this amazing guy (20M) on tinder last December. We lived in different states but I visited frequently. We hooked up a couple times and got along really well but nothing serious happened because of the distance. We talked every single day though. He became my absolute best friend and knew everything about me. We’d hook up when I was in town. We always used protection. Except for one time, but I was on birth control and thought it would be fine (it wasn’t). A few weeks later I got horribly sick. I don’t have insurance so I just decided to ride it out. One day, I got the worst unbearable cramps and pains of my life. I was worried but thought it was a bad period. Until the next morning when I miscarried. I’ll spare the details but I took a pregnancy test and it was positive. I have never been in so much physical and emotional pain before. I waited a week to tell this guy but when I did he was very kind and made sure I was okay. Then we never spoke of it again. It’s been almost 2 months now and we still talk every day. But he’s a constant reminder of the awful pain I went through alone (by choice, not his fault). I feel like I can’t talk to him about it because I don’t want to bring up such a sensitive topic for both of us. I can’t live with or without him at this point. How do I deal with this? I know many will recommend therapy, but I unfortunately can not afford it. How do I stop taking out the pain of losing my baby on someone who isn’t at fault?

Also my country is has 13% unemployment rates, so basically I’m screwed.

As the days passed the lack of routine, the lack of a daily objective started taking its toll in my head. Why was I waking up ? There is no more waking up early in the morning to go to college, there is no work, why should I get of my bed.

Since I got no job I can’t really go out with my friends without they basically paying for it and I feel like a burden to them. My parents are old and they will not be able to keep working for longer.

268,"I met an old lady this summer while I was working at a summer camp. She seemed pretty nice but she needed a lot of help with her phone and stuff like that. I gave her my phone number and said that I could help her with anything she needed after my job was over. She’s 83 and has a hard time walking for extended periods and bending over to pick things up. 

Friday I went over and helped her rearrange her furniture. I was there for around 3-4 hours and she gave me $30.  Afterwards I tell her that on Monday I’m going to go back home to visit my family (about ~30 min train ride away). She says that she’s free Monday for me to come back. I say that I wanted to go home that day but eventually say that I can come in the afternoon and just go back home later. Now it’s Monday and I come over. She tells me to put away the clothes on her bed but doesn’t give any instructions. I just start folding the clothes and she comes back in and says I’m not doing it right and that I have to find skirts and tops that match and put them together in the closet. There were about 3x as many shirts as skirts so I wasn’t sure what else to do. She comes back into the room and says that clearly I am not good at putting away clothes and have no idea what I’m doing and gets angry that I didn’t hang up some jackets that I didn’t know needed to be hung up. Then she says that I could try doing the dishes. She asks me how I do dishes at home and if I have a maid and I reply with a fairly normal answer (imo) and she just gets really mad at me and tells me that I don’t know what I’m doing. She goes onto say that my mother probably doesn’t trust me to do anything at home, that the only thing I can actually do is computers, and that I’m basically incompetent. I almost start crying and she says that I haven’t done anything. Later she says that she’s hungry and wants to get thai food downtown. She asks if we can go together and I said sure even though I told my boyfriend that we would make dinner together later. As we’re walking to the bus stop she drops her cane and yells at me saying that I’m supposed to be there to help her and that I’m not doing anything even though I help her with it as soon as I can. Eventually we get to the thai place and she orders food and I just order a drink. She says that she can’t give me as much as last time and asks if $15 is okay. I say that it’s fine. After the meal she says that she forgot her card so I offered to pay everything ($18) — I was going to pay for my own drink originally. She accepts the offer and we pay and leave. Then I wait with her outside the restaurant until her friend comes can picks her up. I was with her from 3:30 to about 7:30.

After I leave I walk with my boyfriend back to his apartment to make dinner together and I just start crying.

I really don’t want to go back but I don’t know the best way to deal with this. Or maybe this is just how old people are and I should just put up with it if I want to help. I’m not really sure how to deal with this. My sister says that I should tell her that she treated me poorly and that I don’t want to come back but my boyfriend says that I should just ghost her and not deal with her anymore. I don’t want to be mean and I really do want to be helpful but I don’t think I can deal with this again. Advice?",13Aug2019,2
269,"I would put this in a more accurate sub but I know my friend views the relationship advice sub, and I don't want to make them feel like I'm going behind their back. Apologies for abstract language here but anonymity is extremely important here.

My friend has quite bad trust issues. I'd even go so far as to call them severe. They doesn't trust anyone they get in a relationship with and has a history of terrible breakups. Recently a long term relationship ended with a bad breach of trust. For context, my friend has BPD and lashes out at their partners for things they percieve to be evidence of cheating or unloyalty. These episodes can be outright abusive. After the most recent breakup I suggested they stay out of a relationship and focus on themselves, trying to get past the trauma and issues that made the last relationship so much worse. Inside of a week, they're in a new relationship and have rushed right into sexual stuff despite me knowing they prefer to wait at least 3-4 months before even discussing it.

I don't really know what to say or do because while I know this is a really bad idea given history and my friend's deeply rooted problems, I feel powerless to say anything. If I said that this is a bad idea I know for a fact that they'd flip out and be pissed off at me for ages. They might even cut ties with me. They even question my choice to stay out of a relationship for my own sake, and I've even felt a little judged over it. I don't know what to do. I care about them very much and if this relationship goes sour, it'll deepen the already existing problems. If I say something, I feel at risk of being called judgemental or even lose the friendship entirely. They're in a really rocky place and I don't know how to help. I'm just worried their issues are going to spiral out of control into more self-loathing, distrust, abusive behaviour and loneliness. 

Does anyone know what I can do? Their family is completely nuts and don't like me, so getting help from them is right out, and their closest friends have warped views on relationships, so I'd be going it alone pretty much.",13Aug2019,1
270,"So today at work a customer left a cart at the front of the store so I went to ""quickly"" put outside where it goes. So anyway this one employee told me don't worry about that pack groceries so I did that. She then had the nerve to complain about what I did when I was only an earshot away from her so I could hear her. Not only that she did that to two different employees. This is not only the first something like that has happened with her, for example when I am near the end of my shift I like to finish all the product returns because that shows good teamwork plus, but people with higher authority have also told to finish my returns before I leave cause that is the fair thing to do. Finally, a fellow employee quit and walked out because he put a request for time off weeks before the schedule was realized and he did get it because they lost the request sheet even though she was standing next to him when he filed it out.

272,"Hey guys and gals,

I am just about wrapping up my bachelors in a life sciences degree. I have a 3.91 GPA, lots of research experience and just about every other thing a successful applicant to medical school would want. Unfortunately, my freshmen year, I got in trouble for using a serious drug, and while this does not preclude me from getting into medical school, it makes it highly unlikely, despite every other part of my application being excellent.

I will nonetheless be applying to medical school, and doing everything in my power to maximize my chances to get in, but I am obviously at a crossroads here. I want nothing more in life than to be successful and create an impact in society, I am, for good and bad, unwaveringly goal oriented and committed to my work. However, I do not see a pathway to success with a bachelors in life sciences. Outside of medicine, I do not really care what I do, as long as I can do it well, be successful, be in charge, and obtain financial freedom. 

   I still have one year of school to create a long term plan that would allow me to achieve these goals. Currently, I am thinking of working back towards engineering, or getting work experience in whatever low level biochemistry job I can find, and then trying to work my way up the ladder towards a business/administrator type job (perhaps coupled with the acquisition of an MBA). 

   So, successful redditors, what would you do in my shoes?",13Aug2019,1

276,"I don’t know if this is the right place for this or not. We live in Oklahoma. My gf has a child that is almost 2, and receives child support for him. She receives $300 a month in child support, and her rent is $15. When she got housing assistance she was not receiving child support, but got it months after receiving assistance. She was receiving a utility allowance, but they suddenly took it away because she has “income” which is her child support for getting the child the things she needs. She also receives snap, so food for the child is not an issue, but she still has to buy diapers, wipes, and clothes among other things. She has other bills, and is fixing to start school again. Back to it, the state suddenly stopped giving her a utility allowance because of the child support and is now having to pay her electric bill out of her child support which is where things are becoming a problem, as she is now behind in her utility bill.  My real question here is, why is the state allowed to take away their utility allowance when the “income” she receives is meant for the care of  her child? I’ve been all over the internet and I can’t find anything anywhere that says a utility allowance can be affected by having a child support. Is there a fix to this? Is this really allowed?

280,"My (3 year) older brother is leaving to go to college tomorrow. I’ve never had a particularly amazing or close relationship with him but he’s had a huge impact on my life and I didn’t even realize it until the night before he leaves. We’ve always played video games together, stuck together at events when we didn’t really know anyone, etc..Even recently we’d started to play a game that we played often when we were little and we both know we won’t keep playing with each other because he won’t have the time or money (it’s subscription based). Though I’ve never felt extremely close to him, I’m devastated he’s leaving and it feels like a huge part of my life is going to vanish. If I ever needed anything, he was there. I had questions, he would answer them. Sometimes we would fight, but we’d always be fine in the end. I honestly feel closer to him than to my parents. I’ve never been particularly transparent with any of my family members reddit it really the only place I could think to talk about it. I just cried for the first time in months, or even a year. It’s generally not a thing I do but it just hit me HARD how much I’m going to miss him. We both start school in about half of a week and I’m stressed out from both things. Will we even see each other often?  He will come back and visit for the holidays and over Summer break but that feels like forever from now. Especially after he finishes college I feel like I’ll rarely see him.

282,"I’m at a loss for how to act in this situation. For context, my mom and I have had a pretty normal happy relationship through the years, with maybe the exception of when I was a teenager, behaving as teenagers do. She’s like a really close friend to me, but we have disagreements in philosophy that lead me to not always share my interests/thoughts fully with her (ie. sensitive things like opinions about tattoos/piercings and body modifications)

I know that she’s always hated the look of any tattoos or piercings that go beyond just earlobe piercings. Regardless, I have been one to push her on that. I’m not covered in tattoos and piercings, to be clear - I have two earlobe piercings per ear, one small tattoo on my back (a heart) in a relatively hidden area, and just this Sunday got a medium sized tattoo on my inner upper arm (another easy to hide area) of a bundle of wildflowers. 

Now, in the past if I’ve gotten some kind of body modification like the above, I just wouldn’t tell her and would wait for her to notice and blow up on me. I was pretty young back then (16/18 years old), and should have handled the situation better. This time, I let her know immediately when I got the tattoo done - and I sent her a picture of how it came out. I tried to keep the message light - “hi mom! I just got a tattoo :) please don’t be too upset!” 

Her response? Completely ignored me. Didn’t answer for hours, and left her read receipts on. This is unusual, because she typically responds immediately. I sent another text, unrelated topic - she responded to that one, but with a noticeably cold tone. This behavior goes on for a could days, and today I get a message from her asking if it hurt and how it is healing - finally acknowledging that I got a tattoo, but not sharing any kind of thoughts on the situation. I respond no, that I’m doing quite well and everything is healing up great. She answers “k.” and nothing else - super passive aggressive compared to how she normally speaks to me, and honestly really upsetting. I asked her a few times how she is doing, hoping to give her a chance to share what she’s thinking, and every time it’s something like “fine.” The past few days I’ve just been horribly worried and second guessing, wondering if I’ve made a mistake and worrying that my mom is going to be upset with me and cold shouldering me for months. 

Did I handle this situation correctly in the first place, or should I have brought this up in a different way? I genuinely thought it would be more thoughtful of me to make sure she was one of the first to know, and to not make her feel like I’m hiding things from her. The response has been much colder than I expected, and I just hate feeling like my mom is cold shouldering me - brings me right back to high school. I’ve been trying to respond to her messages cheerfully, politely, and respectfully - but I keep receiving one worded responses. At this point my anxiety spikes just seeing her name pop up with a new message. I’m supposed to drive down (I live an hour away from her) to visit her and my dad this weekend with my fiancé, but at this point I feel like I just need to cancel that plan to avoid this uncomfortable situation - I don’t imagine she even is too excited to see me, and probably only has hurtful things to say.

What do you guys think? I can’t tell if I’m just being a disrespectful daughter, or if this is just something she is going through and needs space away from me. Are there any other techniques or methods I could use to get her to open up to me, or try to normalize the situation?

Thank you for any thoughts.",13Aug2019,1
283,"Probably gonna be kinda long. I’m from Cali (19F) and my mom’s entire family lives in Pennsylvania. Every year we fly out there and visit for a few weeks. This year, we all flew out at different times due to work and stuff. So i’ve been here 2 weeks and my mom and little brothers have only been here a week. 

The first week was fine. it was just my older 
brother and i and we just hung out and it was fine. No issues. It’s important to note that my aunt and i have had issues the past three years in a row due to trivial things. When i was 16 she got me a job working for her vet, working Mon-Fri 6am to 12 pm. One day i wanted to take the day off so i could go to the amusement park with my family and not be so tired afterward had i worked. Well this pissed her off because my aunt got me the job and she said i was being ungrateful and lazy. She could’ve worked and then gone to the park no problem, so i should’ve  been able to too. My mom and the vet i was working for had no issues with me taking the day off but my aunt was pissed at me for the rest of that trip and kept calling me ungrateful and lazy. (not to my face) 

The next year, my family wanted to visit an alpaca farm and feed the alpacas. She got mad and called me a liar because i misheard her and thought she didn’t want to go to the farm, so i told everyone else that she didn’t want to go. Well she flipped out and was saying “i never said i didn’t wanna go she’s a fucking liar”. So yeah, that’s what happened that year 

The next year, tbh i can’t even remember why we fought this time 

Now to this most recent trip. My aunt has been selling CBD oil for the past two months and wanted me and my older brother to get in with her. I won’t get super into but she insisted that we join this company and sell CBD, and she told me that she’d pay for me. I offered to write her a check when i got back home and send it to her, but she refused it. It cost $600 to join and $180 for the CBD products (just fwi the company is an MLM) My brother pays for himself $200 and my aunt didn’t offer to pay for him, only me. Her husband even handed me his credit card to pay for it all. A few days later before the rest of my family showed up, my aunt and i were standing in her dining room where her CBD products are. It’s like thousands of dollars worth of stuff. She hands me two sample things and then shows me the box for both of them, both containing 12 products each. She told me she wanted me to take both boxes home with me and sell them. She kept insisting and kept telling me how much she loved me and would do anything for me, and she really wanted me to take the boxes with me. 

Fast forward a week, and i am now staying at my grandmas house with my mom and one of my little brothers. The first week i was in PA i was at my aunts house, but for my last week i wanted to spend my time at my grandmas and with my mom and brother. This automatically made my aunt jealous and she kept asking me why i wasn’t at her house anymore. I nicely explained that i just wanted to spend time with my grandma (who’s 83 years old and i only see her once a year) Now it’s the day before i leave and my aunts accused me of stealing her CBD products after she “caught” me looking at the boxes trying to remember which ones she wanted me to take. I asked her when she came in the room which ones she wanted me to take,  but she didn’t answer. I told her “it’s ok, i don’t have to take them” because i just figured she changed her mind. She said “oh it’s just that they’ve been disappearing and idk where they’re going”. I asked her if her husband was taking them and she said he wasn’t. I was like, ok that’s weird and left the room because it was clear to me she didn’t want me taking those boxes with me after all. I had a gut feeling she was going to accuse me because as my mom, grandma, brother and i were leaving her house she was sobbing on the phone saying “after everything i’ve done... how could this happen” And stuff like that. I knew it was about me. 

She told her best friend, husband, my two other brothers, my grandma, and my mom that i stole all her things. My mom asked me about it and I explained everything and how she said i could have the boxes but she obviously changed her mind. My aunt is denying that she said that, is saying that she only wanted me to spend $200 on the CBD company and i cost her an extra $400, and that she might want me to pay her back. (i never would’ve joined if i had to pay myself because i don’t really have that money to spend anyway) My mom believes me and i made her check my suitcase anyway just so my aunt didn’t try to plant something in my bag (she didn’t, but tbh i wouldn’t put it past her) 

So now all this drama has ensued, and my aunt has involved everyone like a child instead of just asking me and me telling her i didn’t take her things. I have to talk to her in the car about all this because she’s dropping me off at the airport in a few hours, and luckily my mom is going with us to drop me off and she can witness everything. My aunt has been a bully to my mom ever since they were little so my mom always takes my side in stuff like this. My aunt also has a way of spinning everything to make herself look like the victim so i refuse to be alone with her anymore. Because coincidentally, basically all of this drama occurred because it’s her word against mine and no one witnessed any of our conversations to prove she’s lying. 

At this point i really am just trying to get my point across to her that she’s a liar and immature for spreading lies about me behind my back and telling everyone. I’m not really interested in keeping a relationship with her beyond being civil when i come to visit my grandma. She’s hurt me 4 years in a row now and i’m not dealing with her toxins behavior anymore 

The shitty thing is that it’s only me, my mom, grandma, and youngest brother who realize how shitty she is. Everyone else just accepts her and sweeps everything she does under the rug. She’s always gotten away with everything and no one holds her accountable. 

Is it smart to end the relationship? Should i give her another chance if she apologizes? I really don’t know how to deal with this right now",13Aug2019,2

290,"Title sounds worse than it actually is, I’m not about to snatch a job away hahaha.

I work with a girl who is known for being a bit lazy, she doesn’t really ever do her job, she’s tried marketing, PR, admin, everything. But she always gets put back on just filing etc when they realise she’s not helping at all and actually moreso hindering everyone, as she usually hasn’t done it so someone else has to do it which wastes their time and my work is so fast paced we just don’t have time for that. They don’t fire her as the director knows her mum personally so I think they feel too awkward to. 

I felt bad because I actually really like the girl, she’s super nice, same age as me and I thought maybe she just didn’t understand the roles she was given. So my line manager asked if she could do some social media bits and pieces and really fought for her to be on our team to see if she could change her up, I gave her a very simple job to do that usually takes up half of my day (community management, liking and commenting, sharing posts on Facebook), I was behind so at the time that made sense but now I’m caught up and I literally have nothing to do for half my day. (My line manager doesn’t know this, she thinks I’m busy all the time and even said maybe she should give the girl more of my jobs lmao). I also know she isn’t doing what I asked anyway as the comments aren’t even clicked on, I can see them building up. 

My line manager noticed this too and even mentioned that she might have to put her in my seat so she can watch what she’s doing which annoyed me because I love where I sit as I’m with my team and I can communicate if I need. If I went to her seat I’d be with nobody in social media. She’s just making my job so much more difficult (tbh should have learnt that from the rest of the team who got rid of her hahah).

My question is, would it be wrong of me to ask if I could do those tasks again? The fact she isn’t doing it anyway makes me think I’ll end up being asked again in the future, but I also don’t want to be sitting around doing nothing all day. When we get busy it’s super useful for her to dip in as and when we need as I’m sometimes needed for ads, but not all the time. I just want my job back.

294,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

So my wife has been wanting to go on vacations for a while but money is a little tight and I just started a new dream job which makes it hard for me accommodate time for at least a couple months.

So she asks me if she can go on a trip with her female friend to another country that is close and therefore the ticket is fairly cheap.

 The thing is that in the past (like 3 years ago) she had made a ""friend"" while playing online games and then they started chatting outside the game. This guy also lives in the same country she is planning on going to in the next few weeks. At first I didn't give it much thought but one night I grabbed her phone (we usually use each other phones, I know her password, she knows mine) and noticed the ""friend"" had sent her a quite lovely message responding to an empty chat, which means she had deleted the previous chat.

I get obviously mad at this and confront her the next day and she claims that he always talks like that but she doesn't answer accordingly. She says she's sorry and immediately cuts contact with him... AFAIK.

Now granted, I'm no innocent soul here. When we were just married I had sent a message to my ex (nothing explicit, just asking how she was doing since we had a couple of years without contact) and my wife finds out about it and we had a discussion about it but luckily we work it through.

Also I always leave my Whatsapp connected to the home computer so she can read my messages any time of the day, sometimes without me realizing. She's a SaHM Btw, So once, I connected her Whatsapp to my laptop which I took to work. She realized what I did immediately disconnected and gets mad at me for doing it without telling her. My defense is that my Whatsapp is an open book for her 24/7 and that if she's not hiding anything, why would she mind?

Sorry for the long backstory, I had to lay it down so that you could see this from my perspective.

So as you can see, I think I have trust issues. I sometimes even wonder if our son is mine, since he doesn't look like me that much, if at all. 

When she asked me if she could go I jokingly (and seriously at the same time said) ""sure, are you gonna see your friend from Country? You know what they say, out of sight, out of mind"".
She didn't think much about it but when I asked to see the chat with her girlfriend she got kinda upset and asked me ""you really don't trust me?"" and I reply to her with the back story I just gave you. 

Any advice on what to think or what to do?",13Aug2019,0
295,"okay so for starters I just finished dealing with my baggage from being molested as a child (19) . I’m aware of it and dealt with the emotional and overall pain from it and locked it back down very recently as well as even learning about it of this year. But I believe he should have some justice, some kind of fairness brought back to him. I’ve thought about the court of law but it was ab 15 yrs ago though I believe I could get evidence in form of trauma through the brain and psychological reasoning but I doubt it would be enough to put him away. I’m mostly concerned he may still be doing it but I’m not sure. I just want to bring justice and make sure others are safe(children around since he has grandchildren and tons of kids around) . But if I even was able to (not looking like I’m able to rn ) prosecute him, I’d have to reopen all the emotional + baggage and reseal it, assuming it’d be hard to lock back down. I’m not really sure what to do and I would like some ideas. I would consider myself chaotic good, and I believe in justice, equal rights, karma, etc.  but how much karma could he have gotten especially if he is still doing it and still getting away with it?? I’m pretty good with approaches but I’m not sure how to approach this. If I thought forgetting about it and moving on would be the best choice I would.",13Aug2019,1

My brother has no job, at all. He hasn’t graduated high school and is trying to now. I’ve been living with him for at least 2 months, and has beaten me at least 4 times when nobody was home. Nobody believes me, everyone believes him because he’s older and uses the “im overreacting” excuse. 

Today, he beat me so bad. He was calling my sister (19f) who i don’t live with anymore a fail in life. I told him she graduated high school and has a job and he got mad, started punching me full force in the face, and while he was throwing fists he broke his glasses. This made him get so angry, he pinned me to the wall and beat me, very bad. Multiple times in the face, and stomach, ribs and arms. He then pulled out a knife and threatened to kill me if i didn’t leave.

Im going through a lot already so i honestly told him that he could kill me, and he’d catch a murder case. He threw the knife in the kitchen and started beating me more. I started yelling for help and all the neighbors heard, yet nobody saved me. Both sides of my mouth and head hurts, my parents didn’t think it was bad enough to take me to the hospital but my chest has been hurting for hours like the rest of my body parts. 

My brother got away with it all, he received no punishment . 

I’d also like to point out that he’s on probation for something. I also have video proof of him beating me up from a month ago. I want to show his officer but my mom doesn’t let me because she thinks it’s just a brother fight.

The company has made way too many pivots with how they position the product. As a marketing guy, each pivot means that I have to redo all my work. I'm constantly abandoning projects on and picking up new work. 

Our CEO constantly changes his mind. He keeps adding more work to the list at the last moment. Tis pisses everyone off. Many engineers have quit because of this.

Our marketing team needs an experienced leader. We don't really have one. And of all the leads we generate, sales manages to convert very few of them (almost none). So while the product sounds Awesome, we don't have many users. 

Should I quit this job?

I have an offer from another startup - let's call them company B. They want me to lead marketing. They have 30 customers. Some who have been there for over 1.5 years.

309,"TLDR I was kind of a jerk to a childhood friend because him possibly being interested in me terrified me for some reason, and I'm not sure if it would be strange for me to reach out to him after so much time has passed and what would be the best way for me to do so / if I should apologize for past behavior. 

I (20F) had a childhood friend who I would see every summer growing up whenever my family visited my parents' country of origin. We were really close and would play all the time, he lived in the same apartment building. One day when we were pretty little, it was a long time ago so my memory is kind of vague, but I remember him pulling me into an area of some park and pulling my head onto his shoulder and us just sitting like that. I remember feeling really confused and uncomfortable, especially since I was (and kind of still am) painfully shy around the opposite gender. I remember after a while I got up and practically ran away and then proceeded to avoid him for the rest of the summer. We were maybe around 8 when this happened. But I think that caused a lot of lingering discomfort for me for whatever reason. 

We would still hang out during summers after that but I was still shy and distant and probably pretty cold towards him in general even though he was nothing but nice to me. That kind of continued into teenage years because my shyness/anxiety didn't really go away and every once in a while he would kind of express interest.

A few years ago he found me on social media and reached out and we caught up and it felt really nice but then when I visited again that year I didn't reach out even though I said I would. When we were messaging he said he was really surprised I even responded so clearly me being cold didn't go unnoticed and I'm an asshole for not reaching out to him when I visited. But also I doubt this was as big of a thing for him as it has been for me just because I feel guilty for being so rude. 

Basically I need advice on how to not be so stupid because this has kind of haunted me even though it was so long ago and I was basically a kid. Even in the last few years I feel like I've become more mature. I'm thinking about reaching out to him and seeing him when I visit this year, but I don't know how to go about it because it's been so long and it feels like it would be super out of the blue. And I'm also not sure if I should reference my behavior in the past and maybe apologize??",13Aug2019,1

A few days ago, he told me he's been thinking he would like to change his genitalia and have a vagina instead of a penis, but remain as a male. I asked him a little about it and he thinks he would feel much more comfortable with a vagina and sex would be much more satisfying.

I thought about it, and I find the idea quite arousing actually.

313,"So here is where I am. I have 1 part time job (Job A) which I have done for 5 years, but there are not enough hours to really pay my way. I can't get anymore hours with my job, I've tried. I do like working for them and don't want to leave anytime soon.

I did have 2 jobs, Job A and Job B. Both are about 60% similar in the type of roles but in 100% different industries.

Not too long ago, Job B let me go. I kept this job for 3 years, but I guess looking back at it, I wasn't as interested in the environment and therefore didn't fit in as well with my colleagues. I did help out a lot and found ways to finish tasks quicker than what I was originally shown. I think what lead to my termination though, is that the boss was having his own personal issues and it affected our relationship. It just went into decline. Tension arose etc.

I am now on the lookout for another job. I lie on my CV to say that I work both jobs when I work the one. I get more calls than when I had just the 1 part time job. Also if I included it; I figure that they will want to know why I don't work there anymore. The annoying thing about job hunting is the scrutinising: if I was let go for a reason that was not my fault then they will want a reference. I don't trust the bosses from Job B to provide a good word for me.

Only one employer has asked why I don't include Job B as a reference, to which I answered that ""they don't know I'm leaving"".

325,"Hello!

So I’m currently enrolled in an online summer class for grade 12 English. I’ve finished all the required assignments so far, but I have an issue regarding the final. In Alberta, Canada we have diploma exams for grade 12 courses that basically act as finals. For background information, I take my course through a website, and communicate with my teacher via email. However, after finishing all the required assignments, and handing them in and having them graded, i studied for the diploma exam, and never logged back into the website for a few days as I didn’t need to. When I eventually logged back in, I had gotten an email a few days earlier that a certain date that had already passed that was the last day to write my final exam (NOT THE DIPLOMA EXAM,) and out of confusion that there was a separate final from the diploma, I emailed the teacher back, (keep in mind this was still a few days later after they emailed me). A few days pass again, and still no response. I email him again, and ensure I have sent the emails properly, and to the correct email address. Eventually, I write the diploma exam, both parts A and B (written and reading comprehension) and email my teacher for a fourth time. Still no response after almost 3 weeks. I had no idea there’d be a final exam + the diploma exam, as it was never mentioned throughout the course, and before going into the exams I had a 94% average, and he had given me a 0% on the final I hadn’t known about, bringing it down to a ~70%. Is there any advice I should know? I feel like this couldn’t possibly be my fault, as after emailing the teacher multiple times, asking about the final, I was left with no response. What actions should I take? I’m very nervous as these marks dictate Universities, as these are the marks they look at. On the other hand, my sister had taken the same course, on the same website/format, with the same teacher and never had to take a final+ the diploma, she only had to worry about the diploma exam.

After checking them out a few hours ago I decided I'd go ahead and buy one soon. My issue is that I've never actually driven a manual. I don't know anyone else that knows how to drive one either. My only knowledge on this is from YouTube videos which I find difficult to follow. I get a very small gist of what I'm supposed to do. I understand things like how to start the car and what I'm supposed to do when shifting gears. I don't necessarily understand when I should change gears, how to stop and go efficiently at lights and on hills, how to downshift, and rev match (whatever the heck that even is.

333,"We are both 21, in undergraduate, and we are both working as a student researcher with a professor. We are both doing similar research, and we are doing this for research experience so we can both apply to graduate school.

My PI (principal investigator/ supervisor) and other professors loves him. The other students in the lab seem to like him too. I can’t do much, because he’s good at what hes supposed to do.

The problems with this guy is that he has a fucking god complex. We hold the same level of position, yet he consistently attempts to boss me around. 

I do my experiment my way (the one I was given responsibility) and he does it the opposite way. I’m trying to explain my data in our meeting with our PI, but I can’t get a word in, because he interrupts me and explains it himself. 

Whenever our PI is around in the lab he purposely comes up to me, and with a loud ass voice starts pointing out errors he “thinks” I’m making with my experiments.

In the lab multiple people use the same equipment, and there were several times where these equipment have broken. This piece of shit would make these false claims blaming me for breaking them. He would say with his loud ass voice (when our Pi was present), “oh Ill try to fix this equipment that she broke” or he would wait until I left at the end of the day to tell everyone it the lab that I left the machine/ equipment broken “but he can try to fix it”.  

He also would tell me to do sample prep for his experiments. I never sample prepped for him, but he would often take my sample prep stuff for himself. He would also leave a mess on my lab bench/ side after taking my shit. I’m also convinced he’s tampered with some of my experiments. Sometimes I would come back the next morning and the machine running my experiment overnight would magically “turn off”. This only ever happened to me. Then he would tell me “thats sucks, but don’t worry, I did your experiment too so I can explain it in our meeting” 

He got another guy fired from the lab, because he didn’t like him. I feel terrible for this guy, he was new, and like many undergrads (including myself and others in the lab) we take this opportunity to seriously and we want to learn too. I’m 100 fucking percent sure it was this guy that got this other guy fired. He openly said he talked to our PI about “letting go” the other guy, because he was too “inexperienced” amongst the group. He also said (he was trying to act like it was a joke) verbatim, that “if he didn’t like a person in the lab, that we should isolate them away from the group”. 

You may ask how does the other lab mates feel about this? Well all of the other students are his friends prior to getting the job, and he’s convincing our PI to hire more of his friends. So his friends go along with it, because they benefit from his behaviour. I’m stuck doing the same shit I’ve already learned, while he convinces our Pi to take along only his friends and him to learn more about new instruments. 

This guy is fucked in the head. He makes working in the lab a living hell. The reason I got involved in the lab group was because I was genuinely interested in our PIs research. I thought I would build solid relationships, gain great laboratory experience as well as expand my love for that field of research. Instead this entire fucking lab group makes me hate everything about that field. It even makes me regret choosing my undergrad in-science. Never in my life have I met such a despicable human being and group of people. I thought I had a passion for research in science. Now I don’t fucking think so.

337,"M (20) a girl I was friends with for most of my childhoods mother has just passed after a long battle with cancer. We kind of half dated a few years ago and it ended on bad terms that we have since reconciled. She dates someone else now so I'm not trying to move in on her I have no intention other than to be a friend as I lost my father the same way ten years ago and we had confided in our parents suffering from cancer when we used to talk so I figure she may appreciate someone reaching out who's been through the same thing. I just wanted to get opinions on whether the letter was appropriate and if I should send it. I'm putting my rough draft below of the letter to read thanks to all who read and give advice it is much needed and appreciated!!!

Dear blank,
I was so very sorry to hear of your mother's passing. Words cannot express how sorry I  am for you and your family. My heart truly breaks for you and your family at this difficult time. By the time I had heard about your mother the visitation dates had already passed so I apologize I was unable to pay my respects. Unfortunately, I have been in your shoes before and you and I both share the burden of losing a parent far too young. It's cruel and unfair and is something that isn't supposed to happen in this stage of our lives. Unfortunately it is the hand we have been dealt and we are left to try and make the best of it. As you grieve you should realize you will never forget your mother. Nobody can take away the great times and cherished memories you shared with your mother and all of the little things you did together. Although these memories may hurt now, a time will come where these memories will cause you to smile. A day won't pass that you won't think of your mother but know she will always be with you. I will always consider you a friend and now is no exception. If you ever need a friend that knows what you are going through please don't hesitate to call or text me for anything, even if it is just to lend an ear. I understand things are different now but know I am here for you.

At the time I was very high and I agreed. We headed into the bathroom and took off our clothes and we looked at each other’s bodies. However... she would compare our bodies to each other.

340,"Hi everyone. I'm quite having the dillema and I'm hoping you could help me figure things out.

I just got my Bachelor's degree in Comp Sci earlier this month and I'm not sure whether I should pursue Master's degree, or work.

I am currently working part time since about last year (it's a remote work I could do from my computer) and I'm expected to work full time after graduating, but there's no penalty for quitting early.

My lecturer says that I'm probably going to benefit from pursuing higher education, but I'm still considering the pros and cons, compared to working.

My goal is quite normal: I want to move out and marry with my current GF, which involves either owning a house or getting a rent, I'd have to be able to provide for my family (it's probably just the two of us and a couple of cats/dogs; no human child... hopefully). And I'd like to have enough money to go on overseas vacation, like once a year or so, nothing too fancy.

I'm told that I'll get a better paying job by getting a higher degree, but I'm wondering if this is true, and can't I learn it myself without the formal education? Or are they going to pay you less?

I know that choosing the career path would allow me to hop between workplace, while getting raise.

My current fear of getting higher education is that I won't get a job that pays me enough that me getting the extra education worthwhile. Even with scholarships, it's some extra time in my life of not working, is it worth it?

tl;dr: higher education for higher pay, or work until you got promotions?",13Aug2019,1

She's also very overweight and eats like a fucking dustbin lorry. She brings no money into the house and doesn't pay for her right to stay here.

Two days ago she woke up at 4:20PM and after going to bed that night she hasn't left her bed, not even to eat, despite our repeated attempts to get her out of bed.

We don't think it's depression or anything like that because I have suffered from severe depression and she has mocked me repeatedly for previous suicide attempts, self harm and even for trying to reach out and get help.

We don't even think she knows she's doing anything wrong because she thinks she's better than me, claiming to be an expert chef, guitarist and artist when she hasn't done any of those things since secondary school, and standing on a moral high ground and acting better than me just because I smoke and she doesn't.

I think it’s good to mention that I am a 16 year old male, and my family is middle-class and my dad is self employed with a low salary and very stressed out all the time.
Anyways, when I checked his phone I saw several sights for escorts. There were about 25 sights with phone numbers for escorts that had been visited consistently for the past 4 days and then 3 days about a week ago. I did not go to the extent of checking his full time history because I felt bad for already doing the snooping I had done.
At this point I realized that the sights were for escorts near my area and there were no sights for regular porn in his history so I think it is fair to think that he may be having sex or relations with these other woman.
From here I don’t know what to do. My family is very close and we all spend a lot of time together and I really don’t want to believe that my dad is cheating on my mom but the proof(ish) is right there.
It’s really stressing me out and I had a panic attack a little bit ago about it and I don’t know if I should confront him as he has a short temper.

We are friends with them and get together for drinks, have them over for lunch/ dinner, and have the occasional neighborhood get together. This puts us in an awkward position in the decisions they seem to make.

First thing, they let there dog roam the neighborhood, she's a sweet kind dog that loves to play with our dog but she's constantly sh\*ting in our yard and the worst part is instead of calling her name to come home they just shock the shit out of her until she comes home. Whenever she is out and we open are door she wants to bolt inside our home, half of the time she is muddy/ wet from running around in the swamp. They have also awaken our 10 month old baby because she yelps so loud when they shock her, it gives the wife and I a stomach ache because she is such a sweet dog.

Next up, we have a side yard that runs across the street from them that is a couple of acres. We had a problem with them parking over there and confronted them about it. We gave them are blessing to use it when they needed but naturally, they took advantage. Over the course of 2-3 weeks the gradually started using it all the time and then parked a trailer over there and that is when I had to draw the line. They stopped going over there or so we thought. We were gone over the weekend and they decided they could drive their side by side through are property to the other neighbors to cut up wood and left a trail there and back. If you look on the edge of the property where they drove through you just see a break in the brush. We don't keep the side yard very manicured but I don't understand what makes them think it is okay to just do what they please.

So my parents divorced when I was at a young age and growing up I did understand that they weren’t meant to be and I was fine with that(like it didn’t bother me) but years later I found out they split coz my mom cheated on him for a few years. After I found out my mom cheated on my dad it angered me for a while which made my strongly dislike my mom(more than I already did for etc). But I grew to accept that my mom wasn’t the same person as she was years ago. So me and my mom are fine now. However, whenever my dad talks about his past he always brings up this women he dated for 6 years before my mom. Over the past 2 years he told me about how he grew up loving her and how he purposed to her and how he would write her when he was in the navy. But most importantly how she wrote back to him too and how she felt about him too. He once told me that he had never felt the love from my mother like he did from his girlfriend of 6 years. But they ended up breaking up and she got married and then he met my mom and had kids and blah blah blahhhh. 

what I’m trying to get at is there’s times when I feel like my parents should have never met and my dad should have ended up with the other girl. However this always leaves me in tears wondering if I should be here at all or if this was a mistake by fate. Anyway I look at it l can’t help but feel sad about what could’ve/should’ve happen for my dad.

Previous to finishing my degree I spent a decade working in sales, mostly selling phones, tablets, accessories, and data plans B2C and B2B. I also provided some SaaS-type solutions to business clients. While finishing college this past year I realized that I have a passion for helping SMB owners to establish a web presence that will increase their following both on and offline and in turn also increase their profits. 

The things that I have going for me are as follows: I now have a business degree; I have a passion for learning anything and everything I can about the subject; I was always on the top of the leaderboard in my sales performance; I have at least a minimal understanding of HTML, enough to write a blog post; and I have excellent communication skills.

My barriers to entry into the field are:
1. I don’t have a strong web presence
2. I don’t have any real life practice with the tools that will be required for the job.

Now, I already plan to create a web presence. I plan to become more active on social media by posting engaging content on a regular basis. I also plan to start a portfolio site where I can showcase my blog posts. In addition I will use that site to practice SEO and to develop an email list. I’ll then use the email list for an email campaign to prove that I’m efficient in that as well. I’m also developing plans to establish an online presence for a friend’s business.

What do you guys do for fun?
I enjoy cooking, but cooking for one can be frustrating. I want to work out, but I broke both of my arms pretty badly (permanent damage) and I’m not sure where to start, but I do have a fried who owns a CrossFit gym. The closest hiking trails are 20+ miles from my house. I would love to help to help animals or humans in need- where should I start? I would love to learn a new language. I have lots of local family members who I wish I was closer with. I love high end fashion. I enjoy listening to most genres of music. This hobby needs to be fairly inexpensive. I used to make soap and craft a lot, but I can’t afford the materials right now.

372,"I was super close to this coworker at one point and she became my friend. We hung out and exercised together and generally had fun but she basically was always teasing me and bringing me down. She knew she did this and would comment on it and say she’s sorry but keep dogging me for everything I did, all while praising others and saying they looked cute or was funny. She said I was funny but it was because she would make fun of me. 

So she and I had discussed maybe going to Japan one day. She basically is super cheap and always wants to be with her boyfriend (he has a weird schedule and can’t get many days off) where I am single and want to go all out on vacations. We talked about ideas but it didn’t go further than that. 

My roommate is similar to me and goes all out on vacation and treats it as a once in a lifetime experience. We’re super close and had actually talked about cities we wanted to go to in the past. 

So a great deal comes up for a flight to japan and my roommate tells me at three am and I get a ticket and pass out cause it was three am. The next day my coworker tells me about a deal on flights to japan and I tell her that my roommate and I got tickets and she should come! I warned her we would hike a lot and stay in really nice places (she hates exercise and she is cheap) but she should still come for part or all of the trip. She also is close with my roommate and knew her before she knew me. 

So basically my coworker says no it’s fine. I press her again that she should come and she says no I don’t wanna go. 

She now ignores me every time I see her. I saw her boyfriend at the grocery store and he looks at me and says “what a fucking snake” and walks away. She will hug all the friends in the group except me and won’t even say hello to me. 

She is very emotional and gets upset often at people in her life which makes me happy she decided to not come. But do I really deserve to be treated like this? 
I also am happy she didn’t come because she basically offered up my savings to another friend to help her pay my coworker back. I told her I can’t give her my savings and get involved in a matter that isn’t my fault and that I’m not involved in in any way and that it was shitty for her to offer up my money to pay for a mistake she made without asking me first.",13Aug2019,5

374,"Hi, guys! I'm 19 yo and just finished high school. I always thought that i'll grow and i will be able to have simple steps to do in order to have a simple life. Now i've hit a wall: my parents. 
They supported me since i was little, but when my sister was born, they didn't give me the same amount of attention. I understand them because she was born sick and had it rough. Years passed by and she was getting better, but i started to be left aside. I always tried to be 'mom and dad's good kid' by being the best in class, doing sports, winning prizes over prizes. This gave me back some recognition from them , but it fade away after a while. I felt like they only got used to this and didn't quite care after a while. I confronted them about it and they said that they love us both equaly and i shouldn't make this kind of statements, so i accepted, but nothing changed. 

Now, here comes the newest part of my life: i have known a guy for 4 years now and we've been together for 9 months. I love him a lot and wouldn't  leave him for anything or anyone. In several nights, i wanted to spend the night at his house, but it wasn't for sex or anything. We usually play games together and binge watch series on Netflix, so it would have been much easier to stay at his home. I asked my parents if i could stay and the first time they said no. I accepted without asking, like i was told to do. Then some time passed and it happened again. And so on... Yesterday it was my sister's birthday party and she had her friends come over. 7 girls, my parents and me. One apartment. I tried my shot and asked and they said no. This time i wasn't going to spend the night sleeping on the floor and pushed it. They didn't cease and made me understand tht they thought that maybe i'll remain pregnant or have sex at all. I felt horrible and didn't speak to them and my boyfriend and i discussed. It was half discussion and half argue because he saw my mother's reaction. 

And always make me do the work. This is the worst. If there is something to be done, i do it. My dad sleeps all day and i have to do his house jobs. My sister doesn't do anything and uses the 'i have to study' excuse. I had the hardest exam in someone' s life and they let her study over me. 

Now i feel like i'm in a leash and that's the truth. After 19 damn years, i understood that prizes and being the best doesn't get you anything, but you mean nothing without them; i understood that i'm an experiment and all the mistakes my parents have done with me, they will improve for my sister; i understood that when i will want to move out, they will not let me. I'm afraid that i'll be 50 and living home with my parents. So i'm asking for an advice. What can i do? What would you do? How can i make them undestand that i'm not that bad and i really want to have more liberty, that i feel that they don't care about me?",13Aug2019,2

379,"So basically (as a background story), last year was my final year in highschool and obviously I had to go to college (because of the social pressure). To be honest, at that time I didn't know what I was gonna major in college. I searched, think, and eventually decided, that I was gonna pick Mechatronics/Electrical Engineering as my major. So I enrolled in a university as a undergrad of that major.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm officially a college student, and even though it's only been two days of college, I've been having serious doubts about my major, my college, and what I wanted to do. Most of the time though, I had doubts about my major. Idk why but since I got into college and knowing it firsthand, I feel like this isn't what I wanted to do. This isn't what I wanted to major in. That really got my mind fucked up and I can't stop thinking about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also spoke about this to my parents, and they seem supportive about all the decisions I'm gonna take, and I just told them that I'm gonna do college for a year and I'll see how things turn out, whether I'll continue or I'll stop learning in my major.

381,"Hello! My name doesn't matter. I just want to sum up my life in a passage and finally ask you a question. Because I just don't know what to do. 

I'm almost 20. I live with my family in a relatively comfortable house, my parents and relatives are the best people I could possibly have. In a few weeks I will have my own apartment, not too far, not too close to my home. I'm going join the college to study English literature( it's something I'm interested in and probably the only thing I'm good at). I've been engaged into escapism from a very young age. 80% of my life is just gaming alone in my room. I used to watch anime but I was so engaged and immersed into those worlds that I now feel uncomfortable even thinking about them. It's just because I cared so much about fictional characters... (on a personal level, I used to and still relate anime to a certain person I cared too much about,so much, the intro of Tokyo ghoul s1 just makes me thin of her). I also used to read erotic literature (and wrote a ton of love letters and poems) which further impacted me(harp un-strung for example) . Why? Because I'm a softie. I tend to feel too much, and in unstable periods. I even relate to some characters (Vincent and Johnny from Catherine, Luffy from OP is an example, I don't know why). Spare information, I tried to kill myself a couple times, only to think that it would be a bigger burden to my parents than I already am.

The thing is, I've kicked almost all of my friends out of my life. Why? Well, I've noticed that we have no common interests anymore. I don't find clubbing appealing. I hate the way people my age act and present themselves. I'm just plain negative when some of my closest friends still ask me to give clubs a try. 

I'm a lonely person. I use my escapism to find and fund my basic needs such as affection,love and entertainment . Fake love. Fake affection. Fake entertainment. I used to pursue girls, but denial after denial just made it feel such a weight to my shoulders I couldn't and still cannot bare to hear another excuse on 'why it won't work '. And what causes even more damage is that I thought of them as perfect from every aspect. 

And I hate this. I hate that I have to rely on fake realities, fictions, and characters to get love. I hate myself for finding animated women desirable. I've accidentally found a video called ""The curse of evangelion"" yesterday and watched through it. The Guilt and Shame I felt was immeasurable. 

In some weeks I will be living in my own apartment. Alone. I've cut almost all ties to my friends. I'm single and anti social and escapism feels so so sweet. I'm way more than tempted to just fall into a hole of anime and gaming, not giving a f about the outside world. It feels so good, to be in a world, locked away from anyone and anything that can ruin your day, finding an escape from everything. Any feeling you crave for, being there, even in it's worst and fakest form.

And long last I ask you. What reason do I have to not give in to this fake reality?  To not give up on this miserable world. I'd rather find fake love in a fictional world rather than real denial. Sex? Never had, never cared.

Just please. Help me if you can.

Thank you, and I'm very sorry for the long post and bother.( Sorry for my English, it's not my mother language)",13Aug2019,6
382,So a while ago I had very disturbing one night stand with a guy. He did not listen to me during sex and did very extreme things to me that I did not consent to at all. I did consent to the sex but not all the fucked up things he did. He acted like an animal during the whole thing. After he finally listened to me and stopped I walked away from he's apartment without looking him in the eye. He acted very needy and weird. I then told him message that I'm not interested in having sex with him again and that some of the things he did was way out of line. He then asked me to have sex again 4 times even though I said no every time. He has asked to meet me near my work several times since then. He has been at my work (I work at a bar) 2 times as well. He pretended not to see me the first time and the second he sat alone and randomly stared at me.  He now says that he understands that I don't want to have  sex with him  after  I rejected him very clearly 4 times.  He also sent me a long message explaining that he masturbates to me every day. We only met 1 time before  we had sex and it's creepy to me. He does not seem to understand how uncomfortable he makes me at all. Last night he tried to make me meet him outside of my own apartment.  I said no of course. He then said that he is in love with me. How can I deal with this and am I overreacting ?,13Aug2019,5

So basically the entire problem would just start happening in reverse and I wouldn’t receive any of my mail anymore. I have no idea what to really do or if this line of thought is right.

I expect to get some slag for this, which is fine, because if I'm wrong, I'd like to know. 
I (31f) have been dating my boyfriend (30) for about four months now. He has two dogs. One is older (about 14) and one is younger (4). He lives with his parents (no hate, things happen), but has been looking for a house to purchase for about two years now. 

There's a couple of things bugging me, and sadly, most have to do with his dogs. 

First and foremost, I like dogs. I like his dogs. They're good dogs. 

Here's the thing though: his whole life is revolving around his dogs. 

I see my boyfriend maybe twice a month. He lives about an hour away, so it's already a struggle to spend time with him. The only time he'll come see me is if he has someone (his parents) to watch the dogs. But like, he lives with them. It's getting very frustrating to ask to spend time with him just to hear that he has no one to watch the dogs. I'm not talking about wanting a weekend away. Just an hour or two to see a movie. He doesn't think it's fair to his dogs to leave them alone for ""that long"". 

He just started a great job. A very important job. He's stressing about it because he can't go home for lunch now, and again, that's unfair to his dogs. His mom is home. They're not sitting in kennels, all alone for days on end. Someone is there with him. But he feels they're getting stressed over not seeing *him*.

His housing specifications revolve around the dogs. He wants a ranch, so his dogs will never have to deal with stairs. If he can't find a ranch, a house with a bedroom on the first floor so the dogs can be with him at night, and again, not have to deal with stairs. He needs acres. For his dogs. No close neighbors. For his dogs. Again, he lives with his PARENTS but will put off moving out so he can find the perfect place. For his dogs. 

He's a great guy. Very sweet. Very giving. I get that dogs are a huge responsibility and I'm not going to ask him to stop caring for his animals and it's great that he has such a heart for them. But I also don't think everything should take second place to them. It's not fair to his parents for him to be living with them, despite him making great money, so he has live-in dog sitters. It's not fair to me to never see my boyfriend because he can't leave them alone for any length of time. His younger dog has at least eight more years of life. I don't want to see him pass up fantastic jobs and a dream home, settle for less and never have fun because he has to be there for his dog every hour of the day.

400,"So, I am with this really sweet guy who came from Iraq to Scandinavia when he was 3 yo with his family. Thus, most of the family speaks arabic amongst themselves, and his parents speak arabic to him for all the little everyday convo, even when I am there.

Thing is, he lives at home and they are a very close knit family. Meeting him often means hanging out with his family.

I reckon I can probably spend about £100 a month on food (cheap supermarket near my house) and I'm only buying for me.

Then £100 into my savings every month.

This leave me £152.38 leftover a month.

&amp;#x200B;

Is that acceptable disposable income?

&amp;#x200B;

Another worry is that I recently accidentally missed a payment because I had paid towards my payapl credit, a connection error meant it hadnt gone through but the email notifiyng me went to my spam. As such, they sent me a letter reminding me at which point I payed it straight away.

&amp;#x200B;

I've checked my credit score and t's gone down from good to fair but it's right on the border of fair to good so hoping after the next 80 days till the next score reset, it will go back to good.

  
I'm just a little worried that the agency will reject me caues of my credit score. Or do they only tend to do this when it is really bad? I've read they do this when it is below the 420 mark and mine is around 800 (don't remember the exact number) . Am I likely to be okay? 

I find myself in this situation a lot where I get terrible anxiety before any big decision to the point where it makes me feel ill.",13Aug2019,1
404,I'm a 22 year old virgin who goes to work everyday and is exhausted when coming home. I've been single for almost 3years now and i don't seem to be able to find a partner. The leading cause seems to be that i don't go out much but I'm just to tired. I have been turned down for dates multiple times and have only had one match this entire year in dating sites like tinder. It did not click as she was the most boring person I've ever chatted with.

406,"I am 24, and find myself in love with a woman. Naturally, I am too.

I truly enjoy her time and I express my love alot when it is just the two of us. Because I am still new to dating a female, I feel shy holding her hand and showing public displays of affection and it makes me feel really bad. Not too long ago, she wanted to kiss me and my housemate walked out and I shuffled away and my actions made me feel sick to my stomach. She brushed it off  but I think it hurt her and she is somewhat understanding as dating as a gay couple is not  100% normalized in society. I don't want to entertain the thought that I am ashamed of her.

There is that, and now I have to deal with the existential crisis of being involved with another woman. Am I gay? Isn't this something you were supposed to know in high school or primary school? I have always loved, appreciate and attracted to  a woman's beauty, sensuality and sex appeal, but never considered dating one. Is being gay a lifetime commitment? Is it just going to be her?

411,"So basically my mother whose addiction of choice is PCP is making my life hell right now. I’m not even sure where to start, but just try to follow along.

My mom had me (23m) at a young age (14). From what I’ve known she’s always had reckless, risk-taking, careless, ruthless personality, but for a small period diring child she did care to my emotional needs as much as she could, but as time went on she just lost it.  
In these last 23 years of my life she’s manage to have 2 more kids, my little brothers (12 &amp; 5) and countless abortions due to her sleeping around. She’s been to jail numerous times, for months and years at a time and has put me, my brothers, our family, and others lives in risk while being under the influence multiple times. (Driving while high, leaving little brothers alone as babies, doing drugs with them while pregnant and multiple other painful things) so due to that she lost her custody of them and they are now under foster with my grandma (her mom)..

So as you can see I’ve had a pretty wicked life. Now my issue is as of recently she’s been stealing money from family members and me to get high, using drugs more heavily, smoking it in our house with her drug friends and just  has been overall unstable. Just recently she put Reese’s cups into my grandfather’s car fuel tank because he wouldn’t lend her $20 which caused his car to get totaled. 

Just this morning we got into an argument because she decided to come into the bathroom and smoke PCP while I was in the shower. I told her to please put it out yet she insisted that “she wasn’t bothering me” so in response I smacked it out her hand. In return she per usual snapped on me and told me I’m going to pay for it someway or another, and by that she went in my room, into my wallet and stole my $100 to go buy it. When I noticed what she did I left out the house to go find her and get my money back (which resulted in a scuffle between us) and unfortunately cops were rolling by and seen me on top of her so they decided to handcuff me.... after running my name they seen that I was clean and a good guy and let me go. But what’s so sane is that even after seeing the cops wrestle me to the ground she lied and said she didn’t steal my money, which she’s done.

Honestly I’m just tired. She’s ruined my childhood from her drug addiction, from showing up to parent teacher meetings, birthdays and graduations high. She’s ruined my little brothers from drug addiction from smoking with them giving them behavioral issues . She’s ruined jobs, financial situations and lost houses from it ... and idk... I’m just tired. Unfortunately I have to be in the same house as her until me and my girl get our living situation right which should be by February, but as of now I need something to be done. Every family knows about her problem and gave up on her and could give a shit about me so I have no where to go to. Please help with your most helpful advice",13Aug2019,22
412,"So, I haven’t dated in 5 years but started seeing a guy recently. He’s really cute and I like him and spending time with him. We are in the process of learning more about each other. Both are aiming for a serious relationship which means being exclusive, committing time and energy to each other, etc. Things that come with a relationship. Problem is I think I got too used to be alone and all those things just sound like a prison to me. I want a relationship, I really do. But I’m scared of commitment and I’m scared of not being able to do it. I’m quite a home body, don’t like sharing my problems or really dealing with emotions, I value my personal space and hate when people intrude. I also dislike talking on a phone and spending a lot of time with people (I need to have my alone time to recharge). This guy is like the opposite. He likes going out, wants to talk to me on the phone all the time (likes calling me out of nowhere). I hate when guys pay for me but he kept insisting so I had to give in. I’m also pretty outspoken and don’t like accepting help and he commented on it a few times (not negatively but like “huh. you don’t accepting help”). So my problem is I’m not sure if I am actually ready for a relationship despite wanting it. My last one failed exactly because I wasn’t able to fully commit to it and my partner asked more of me than I could give which made me feel like I was being suffocated.

415,"Okay, I’m a high school student (not in the US!), and I fee so guilty. There is a “nude” picture of one of my classmates that has been around for a while, but it resurfaced back probably because of me.

First, the picture doesn’t show any private parts as I think she was using a very low cut t-shirt and was covering her breast to her bottom using a pillow. I don’t see any phone in the picture, so I think someone might took a picture of it during a Skype call or something. Secondly, I’m pretty sure that she doesn’t think much of me.

Someone told and showed me the picture, and I was shocked, because the picture is simply dumb. Then, in class earlier. I told someone kinda accidentally with a big mouth about it. This person told other people and asked whether they knew about it or no. At first, I didn’t feel very guilty because I thought that many people already knew about it. Now, the person who told the person who told me (I know it’s dumb!) knew that the picture resurfaced back. The first source is quite mad, and it made me feel real bad.

I would say that my class is absolutely messed up. They are absolutely childish for their age, and I loathe most of them. I can’t be serious to most of them, and dealing with them are simply tiring. There are too many individual groups of people, and all they do is GOSSIP. It’s really tiring, and it scares me how they don’t seem to care anything about school. Well, I also like to have fun, but I know how to balance it. That’s what I like to think the difference between them and me. I try to be mature, but they just can’t grow up. I don’t mind people talking about me, but it’s annoying and pathetic.

There’s just a lot of drama like this one, and I usually try to keep my mouth shut. It will usually go away like it never happened.  know gossiping is bad and all, but, I feel really bad for the person in the picture, and I simply feel like shit. What should I do?",13Aug2019,1
416,"Hey everyone, this is gonna be a long post. I apologize if this is the wrong place for this.

So to start off, when I graduated high school my parents had the bright idea of sending me off to medical school in Pakistan (I was born there but raised in Canada). I didn't mind doing medicine, and I was guaranteed admission and could save money, so I complied, thinking it would be an easy shortcut to becoming a doctor. Plus, the medical schools over there aren't that bad in terms of education (I think like a third of US doctors are from Pakistan). Once there, though, I quickly realized I had made a huge mistake. The process for returning to North America is very hard as an international medical graduate (IMG), and I could barely tolerate all the BS associated with studying in Pakistan (religious nuts telling me what to do/think, pollution, a bunch of other stuff too long to get into). I did well in my studies but studying over there made me very depressed.

I also realized that I was nowhere near mature enough to study medicine, and I had many interests (mainly philosophy and history) I wanted to pursue but I couldn't anymore because I was on the path to becoming a doctor. After a few months I told my parents I wanted to come back and study in Canada, but they basically forced/pressured me into staying for another 2 years. I eventually did come back, and now that I'm here I am very lost with what to do with my life.

My true passions lie in philosophy and history, and I've read some introductory books on them/watched videos but I seriously want to pursue these subjects (mainly philosophy) at a proper university. I don't hate medicine either and am open to it as a possible career in the future. The thing is, my parents will no longer support my education and are incredibly mad at me for wanting to leaving medical school in Pakistan. I'm just so lost with what to do now. I could study here and pay my tuition myself and through loans, but what kind of job am I going to get with a degree in philosophy?

Maybe I could double major in something more useful like math or computer science, but I'm not really interested in working a 9-5 office job staring at a computer screen all day. I only say math/CS because I wouldn't mind studying them and I've always been good at math, I'm just not *passionate* about them like I am about the arts.

I want to do something meaningful with my life, something that I can truly say I'm making a difference in the world. It's why I liked medicine in the first place (and I'm still open to it after my bachelors, provided I get admitted here). Maybe become a social studies or math teacher? That sounds like a pretty meaningful job and I have tutored before which I enjoyed. But, again, the job outlook for teachers isn't exactly the best.

What other meaningful jobs are out there for someone with a degree in philosophy/possible double major with math?

My family and extended family all think I'm crazy and stupid for doing this. They all have this expectation of me becoming some big physician or surgeon, and I've been pressured into that role my entire life growing up in an immigrant family in western Canada. I love my parents and they've sacrificed so much for me, but I can't live my life pursuing other peoples dreams. I could just complete my degree in Pakistan and hope to land a residency in the US, and I probably could do that. But that entire time I'll be wishing I had studied other subjects instead, or at the very least done medicine *after* pursuing those interests.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.",13Aug2019,1

419,"You guys I need advice!

To put this into perspective, I live in South Africa and resources are severely limited when it comes to government mental health facilities or places for young people to go.

My brother (24) is unemployed and lives with my mom (58) and even before he became ill he has always just been an entitled asshole. About 2 years ago he was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and spent a few months in a government mental hospital, he manages it on and off with medication, but hates the meds and often secretly does not take it.

He abuses my mom mostly verbally, but on occasion has burnt her with cigarettes and thrown things at her. he spends all her money on the most random uneccesary things. He took her card last week and spent her very last money on clothing for him without her knowledge or permission. We had to help them out with basics for a while. My mom still works 12 hour shifts and when she comes home he won't let her sleep or close her bedroom door or watch television even. He takes her phone when she wants to call for help and has threatened to kill her. She mostly hides out at my other brothers house when she's not working.

I think my mom has almost like a stockholm syndrome and feels responsible for my brother and says she can't kick him out because he has nowhere to go. I know she doesn't tell me half of what goes on because I will have him arrested if I can. We've fought about it before and she defends him.

It reminds me of that Japanese saying that you have three faces, first to the world, second to close friends and family and third you never show to anyone (yourself). It’s so accurate though. I wonder if maybe the one to yourself is the one you also show your partner - your lover.

My father's physical condition is getting worse with years, add this to the fact that he doesn't work anymore and doesn't really do anything too keep his mind busy, you got a depression.  
He sees himself declining both physically and mentally and feel like he's not usefull to anyone.  


He said to my mother, yesterday, during some bedtalk, that his femoral artery hurted him, my mom ofc, urged him to go to the doctor, but he answered (and I quote) : Well, we all have to die of something one day, and no one needs me anyway, once I finish helping my last son to move, I can go freely.  


We've always been here for him, supportive and caring, but the fact that he's not able to do what he could in his youth is killing him mentally, and he already said, many times, that if he starts to lose his mind, will shoot himself in the shower.  
He's seeing therapists and doctors, but that doesn't seems to help.  


So here I am, of course I will try to cheer him up and keep him alive as much as possible, but I don't know if it will be possible for long.

427,"Mom wasn't always like that. She used to be so loving and caring to me and made me feel like the luckiest person on earth to have such a wonderful mother. But everything since last year changed. And I'm typing this at the last streak of sanity that I manage not to break every time I break down.
I have started to suspect my mom for having an affair since last year. She's been giggling at her phone(which I never saw her doing EVER) and she's also more secretive with her phone. When she's typing away at her phone she will angle her screen away from us. It's just so plain obvious that she's hiding something. I wonder if she thinks I'm stupid. I've confronted her once when I found out she lied to us that she's meeting up with her sister but instead I saw her texting to the guy she's seeing about the meeting. When I confronted her she was silent, which again is a DEAD GIVEAWAY, like come on. If she is innocent she would act like one, but she has the nerves to act like nothing happen and left me unanswered. 
Few days later, when she said something to me I snapped at her because I just can't stand the sight of her constantly texting(especially when I know what exactly she is doing), she even reprimanded me for talking disrespectfully, as if she has the right to tell me what to do anymore. When she found me in toilet crying, she told me it was just a friend and nothing more, and I didn't say anything more.
I thought she would end her toxic relationship with that guy but no. Things continue on and the signs are so blatantly obvious. She would always be texting(note that she used to tell me who all her friends are and now she tells me nothing)and going out without telling me. It's so obvious who she's going out with because she always dresses up. My soul is dying inside but I can't do anything. I have no one to talk to as I'm the only child. I dont want to discuss this with my friends because it's too private. I dont want to tell my dad because I dont want this family to fall apart, even thought technically it already did. And all the time I can only hold in my sorrow and pain.
What's worse is that I will be sitting for a big exam this year and I'm already so stressed out. My family support is basically zero and my friends are barely helping. This jumble of negative feelings shaped me into this grumpy and moody person that I myself hate. My mom always reprimanded me for being a useless child and worth nothing even though I'm educated( what I did was just snapping at her or talking disrespectfully like MOST TEENAGERS, it's not like I do drugs). But her words are heavier nowadays like she has always hated me and she wished that I'm gone to college ASAP because she doesn't want to deal with me anymore. It hurts. And I have to bear with her for 4 more months. This is hell. I often think of committing suicide because what's the point of living anymore when even my own mother hates me. But I refrain from doing so because I want to live. I'm not ready to give up on myself. It's not fair giving up my whole life for a woman who has made my life miserable.

But I noticed last week (his first week) he was looking through papers on our secretary's desk which I thought was a bit rude but I assumed maybe she had a leaflet or something on her desk which may have been of interest. So fast forward to today I notice him going through a bunch of papers on one of my colleagues desks which again I thought was rude but I didn't really think it was my place to say so and admittedly I'm not a confrontational person. But I don't know whether to say anything to my boss if it happens again as I think it is inappropriate. Whilst we don't typically have anything crazy important on our desks, mainly client feedback I still think you should ask to go through people's stuff. Do you think I am over reacting or next time should I mention it to the boss?

TLDR: new guy has been looking through papers (client feedback, project information, etc) on peoples desks should I mention it to my boss if he does it again or am I being dramatic?",13Aug2019,6
434,"Hear me out! I love my mum (and dad), she is the best but sometimes she puts her anger on us over silly things.

Firstly, my mum is fat. Morbidly obese. She has tonnes of health issues and complains about wanting to lose weight but never bothers... there is always an excuse. I have started to become like her (it is true, having fat parents does help in being fat yourself) and I lost a tonne of weight, to only gain it back. Each time I try to put something in my mouth, she says nasty things like 'have you seen how fat you are'... 'have you ever heard of the gym'... 'my God, you are huge, how are you going to get married' and just compares me to other girls. I am sick of hearing this sh\*t. She compares me to my cousins that are HOES. I tell her if she wants me to be one then I can and to stop comparing me... things happen at their own pace - I follow our culture, try not to appear bad in her books, restrict my life for their culture and still nothing is ever good.

The best? She LOVES, LOVES TEA.  Her tea isn't simple either - you need to boil the tea for a good 10 mins to reach her desired taste and then wash the saucepan (which is hard because it all burns onto it, if that makes sense).

I literally was about to eat my toast this morning when my mum demanded I made her tea - once I said no, that I am eating and my food will get cold, she starts to swear at me, calling me a slag and hoe etc. She has done this before and it pisses me off to no fucking end. Imagine getting so upset over not having a cup of tea?

I hate my adult self - growing up, we were sheltered and avoided making small talk with strangers or relatives... I can't relate to anyone.  I cannot show affection or emotion as we have never done that at home - have never hugged my dad and my parents have never told us they love us or are proud of us over anything. I failed a test last week to get onto a uni course she and started to make fun of me... she told me not to bother anymore and to become a stay at home mum. WTF? I have become massive. I haven't much friends as my mum and dad hated us going too much (i.e. once a fortnight was considered a lot). I live at home at the age of 23 because I can't find a graduate job so I can't afford it - I have savings but saving that for my degree in medicine in hopefully a few years - and it's not culturally accepted either. We do not move out until marriage.

I think this is more of a venting post but I am sick of being called a slut over tea. Tbh, my mum does all the cleaning, ironing, washing etc and doesn't ask us too - she is amazing - and I help her when I can but I am sick of the abuse over the stupidest things.

441,"My boyfriend of 5 months has a family holiday home in rural Donegal, which is in the North of Ireland and by remote, I mean you can walk for miles in all directions and meet no one. I've been to this house twice with him now and hated every minute both times. The last time we went it was a dirt bike trip with two of his friends. Their girlfriends and one of their babies also came, alongside my dog. When they weren't out on the bikes they were smoking weed or fixing issues with the bikes and the girlfriends were either tending to the baby or content to smoke weed and sit on the couch all day. I brought watercolours and some books which kept me busy but I got bored of them after a few hours. I walked my dog for the majority of the trip to be honest. When my boyfriend did get back from the bikes I felt overly clingy and almost like I didn't know where I stood or what my place was in the house.

So they are planning to go back again in September and to be honest, I really don't want to go. I told him I might not come this time (putting emphasis on the fact I only meant this time) and he was not happy. He keeps suggesting things I can bring that will keep me entertained but that's not the point. I could take my laptop which has plenty of games but then I'll still feel out of place and like I'm stuck in the house waiting for his return like last time. I'm a busy person and I spend a lot of time with my boyfriend. To be honest, I love the idea of a weekend where he went and did his own thing and I did the same. 

Am I wrong for not wanting to go? Is he wrong for not taking my opinion at face value and practically telling me I don't have a reason not to want to come when I bring x, y and z to entertain myself. I'm very head strong so him not accepting that I might choose to stay home is only making me not want to come even more.

Any advice or input would be helpful.

Recently I’ve been going into full blown panic attacks if there’s one in my house. I can’t get closer than like 6 feet away from them and if I can’t call someone to come take care of the roach, I just let it disappear and live in a constant state of anxiety for weeks. It’s starting to really affect my quality of life.

My friends and family don’t understand. They think I’m being crazy and dramatic (which they’re probably right), but they think that I could kill bugs on my own if I really tried. Every time I call my mom in tears when there’s a roach in my kitchen she just laughs and tells me to either stop being dumb and squish it or to have fun when it has babies and I have 100s of them in my house. So I just cry for days.

Any advice? Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I feel like I’m really going insane. Just last month I went on vacation to Mexico by myself.

She would give us pointers, but it was basically up to us how the song turned out. We were given the song a few weeks ago, but told just yesterday that we would have to arrange the music.

It wouldn't be that bad, but I have three days before I have to teach it to the class. I have a group, but there is only one kid in my group with experience composing music, and yesterday the project was just overwhelming him and nothing got done. Now there is two days left.

Once we are done we are going to be performing these arrangements at a festival that literally hundreds of people go to in our town, and I'm absolutely terrified of the outcome.

If our song is bad then I will know, because people always tell us when they dont think the performance was good.

We have absolutely no experience in this other than one child who is so stressed over the project that they cannot come up with anything, and I feel single handedly responsible for the song.

Room A: a dark room with a big bed and balcony

Room B: a bright room with a small bed and a nice atmosphere

We moved in together and she said she would prefer to stay in room B, so I asked if she is ok with the small bed, she just said she would like to have a better mattress. So our landlord bought a new mattress for her and since then she is living in the room B.

In the beginning, I didn’t like room A, but I started liking my room.

But then we got to know that room B is facing the building of prison. So she had her curtains mostly closed.

After living for one and a half months, she suggested that we change our rooms regularly, like every 3 or 6 months, since she doesn’t like her room anymore, and she suffers mentally and physically (because of the small bed). She also suggested that we buy a new bigger bed in her room. She wants to split the price half for the bed which costs 400 euro (that’s the bed she likes – her minimum standard for the bed)

According to her, it is a fair thing to do as friends, that I accept changing rooms regularly and pay half for the bed, to have equal conditions.

(I offered her that I can pay more for staying at room A and she said it is anyway not a lot of money since our monthly rent is cheap, so she doesn’t like that idea much)

(I also looked up the new bed for her and showed her more affordable beds, but she said that buying a good quality bed is worth it to stay for a year, and anyway 200 euro per person is not a lot, and when we change the rooms anyway I will also get to use the bed as well)

Do you think it is really fair thing to change our rooms and pay together for the new bed?

Or should I look for a new apartment for myself?

457,"Basically since I was 3 my parents have been divorced. I don’t remember happy moments of them together just arguing and fighting. In my mind it’s what I’m used so it doesn’t effect me. But it has been a 17 year battle of the same argument over and over again. Child support. My mom constantly is taking my father to court over child support which my dad never pays the full amount for. My dad owes her hundreds and thousands of dollars in child support. This has been an accumulative amount for 17 years. 

I feel like a horrible child because I’m not mad at my dad for him not paying, I’m more-so mad at my mom. I don’t expect anything from my dad, he’s unreliable, immature, and every time I ask for something (which isn’t often) he gives me a hard time. He takes my sister, brother and I out to eat and to the movies all the time but never puts that money towards child support. Anyway, because of the relationship I see between him and my mom, I see men as something to be used. Used for money, sex, or support. I don’t know how a real relationship works because I did not grow up with an example. 

Back to why I’m more-so mad at my mom. I’m mad because she is dependent on this money. Every month for 17 years it has been the same exact thing. “Your father hasn’t paid child support” “your father is a narcissist” “your father owes me hundreds of thousands”. I love my mom with all my heart, she cared for me and supported me for all these years. I honestly could not ask for a better mother. She does what she can to provide and then some. But, I want to see her boss up and not depend on a man every month to pay off her debt/bills/child support. It’s like she sees it as another source of income. Currently she doesn’t have a job so it’s her only source.

It angers me that this has been a repeated pattern for years. 17 years at that. Why has nothing changed? Why keep going in a cycle of emotional distress and anger over someone she knows to be unreliable? With this being said I don’t want to have children, in the case of my husband and I not working out this is something I do not want to go through. I’m saying this because I’ve read that you’re most likely to date people that are like your parents. 

I don’t even think it’s possible for me to have a husband with the way I treat men. It’s either I’m the dominant and aggressive one or I’m being dominated. No in between.

I have talked to her, and have tried to fix the problem. She challenges me whenever she feels she is right and 9/10 times she's wrong. Its not the challenging part that bothers me, it's the in front of people. When you have a problem with how I'm teaching (shes the only one who does ) then tell me afterwords. We should put up a united front. Not a divided one. Before I was promoted we were best friends, now we can't handle being together more than an hour or we are at each other's throats. Most of the time if something like this happened I would talk to them and tell them they have three months to fix it or I'm firing them. The problem is she's the boss's daughter. So i can't. How do you go about getting someone to stop going after your position, and start doing their job. 
I need help on how to handle someone you can't fire. How do I get her to start supporting me, and to stop challenging me on everything. 


Some extra info. Whenever I'm teaching someone she comes over and tries to  teach them while I'm handdleing it. When I tell them some facts she tells them im wrong and says the same thing in a different way. Then afterwords I try to tell her shes wrong, she gets angry and goes complains to her dad. Then I get talked to by the big man a few days later about how I need to handle it nicer. If she was anyone else I would have chewed her up and and spit her out by now and he would be okay with that. She has taken people away when I'm talking to them, and then says she didn't notice. She has done that like seven/ eight times now. And I've talked to her about it, multiple times.",13Aug2019,1
472,"I recently graduated high school and I did have plans to college until I realized that there wasn't a degree I wanted enough to go for. The one thing that I feel passionate over is very difficult to make it in the industry and doesn't pay well, but trying to figure out other careers or paths that I may enjoy and pays well is hard. I've thought about college and careers that don't need a degree, but I feel like I can't find anything that I could be both content with and have a decent salary. 

I've managed to narrow down what I want out of a job into four categories: a decent salary, benefits (insurance, 401k, etc.), job security, and enjoyment (at least to where I'm content and not miserable). I feel the best way to do this would be to work under a company, and I don't know which companies I should look into or how to get involved in them.

This has been something that has me stressed through and through. I feel very depressed and every day I feel like I'm about to have a crisis of some sort. It's negatively impacting my health and I just want to feel like I have a path towards something, but right now I feel like I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere and I don't want to feel like that anymore.",13Aug2019,2
473,"First ever post on reddit.

I am a 27m, I started smoking weed in college casually, but 5 years ago my brother died and I found his body in our apartment. As you can assume it sent me into a spiral of depression and anxiety. I took prescribed depression/anxiety meds for a year and went from a division 1 rugby player in my province to an overweight sentient video game nerd. I stopped taking my medication, returned to an athletic lifestyle but would still get really bad nightmares, so I turned back to pot to inhibit the rem sleep/dream state. Since then I smoked weed daily for a long time now, my mental is finally getting to the point that I am wanting to quit weed. In the last year I tried quitting a few times but sleep was always what brought me back to it. I am in a grief group for counselling and I am finding it incredibly beneficial. 

So this brings me to my problem. I can't sleep more than 3-4 hours a night. I turn off electronics an hour before bed, drink a chamomile tea, warm shower, read my book for an hour and then take magnesium, melatonin and a half dose of a ZMA blend. and still nothing has worked. I just finished night 7 of sleeping for maybe 1 hour at a time and waking up tossing and turning, I go to bed around 930-10pm and dont fall asleep until 12-1am. I want to be the best I can for my wife and our baby, I dont want this to be my crutch anymore because I dont even enjoy it anymore. Thanks for any advice, I just need some help. Nothing is working and its causing my depression and anxiety to resurface.  Any advice? Is this just long term withdrawal and something I need to power through?

TLDR - Stopping pot, cant sleep, I already do the classic melatonin, warm shower, no electronics before bed. Nothing is working and Its causing my depression and anxiety to resurface.",13Aug2019,1

476,"So I went to school full time all spring and summer semesters and could only work part time so I knew I would fall behind on bills. Now I’m graduated and looking for full time work but still only working part time. Due to this I fell behind on my lease payments and they have taken the car back. I live in Chicago so I’ll definitely be bussing it for now.

Any advice on what I can do to bounce back from this or take it in stride? How do I get my clothes and shoes that were in the car? I was leasing so I’m not sure if it hits my credit the same as if I bought the car. My plan is to save my next 2 paychecks and get a beater for the time or a somewhat cheaper car if I do have to finance.

481,"Hi, this is the first time I'm posting something on Reddit so here goes. In August of 2018, I started my Freshman year of college. I had a plan to stick with the Health Science department and fulfill my parents' dream of being a Doctor. To make an extremely long story short, I bit off more than I can chew. I ended up joining the swim team while attempting to juggle both a Chemistry and Biology class. Classes in which I would have done fine if only I had the prior knowledge. (Most of my middle school and High school life was switching schools multiple times, only for them to put me in classes that I didn't excel in or have any knowledge of the course before it. E.x: Entering Calculus without Pre-Calculus)  I do admit that joining the swim team was entirely my fault, Ever since I've been trying to pick up the pace and not fall behind. My question to anyone whose willing to reply is, What would you recommend my next course of action is? I wanted to use my summer to take Bio and Chem 101 classes to get the leg up, but that didn't happen because of my mother.

he then procees to missinform/missconcept/miss use what i said etc, only to come to really weird conclusions

485,"I've been working full-time at a retail job for six months (in which there's been a lot of turn over) making $13/hour. My position was advertised as making a dollar more than part-time at $12, but last month, my state raised it's minimum wage to $12.50. My coworker has been here longer than me, but has worked part-time, though she got bumped up to full-time last month. She was open telling me that she got $13.50 and encourages me to ask head quarters for a raise, so I'm going to call. The issue is that I know most employers strongly discourage talking about wages amongst employees, so I don't want to get my coworker in trouble.

One other thing that might affect it is that I'm leaving the job at the end of September to go back to school, but I'm trying to work as much as possible and save as much as possible before then. My manager says they might not give me the raise due to me leaving, but at the time of pay going up, it would've been two and a half to three months before I leave.

So how do I ask for the raise without getting my coworker in trouble while also getting the pay I think I deserve?

487,"Me and my boyfriend (23M) “Ken” used to do a lot of mdma and coke. We also used to drink all the time, to the point where all the partying ruined my relationships with my family and made me lose every job I was employed in. 
This went on for a long time until I had a bad experience on coke, I had seizures which went on for one day and a half, and the doctors told me I was very lucky. This was like in March this year. 
Ken and I made a pact to stop using drugs and limit the drinking as he also had problems such as anger management and violent outbursts when drunk / high. 
It went okay at first. But he couldn’t keep up with it and started using again. 
The first time he used coke again, I reminded him nicely of the pact and how I felt about it and he said he wouldn’t do it again. Fast forward and he was doing it behind my back and lying about it. This led us to breaking up for one month, and then eventually we got back together in June. I never relapsed and was clean for 5 months. 
During this period of time I never used anything except alcohol and a little hash. But the cravings have been so strong. I cannot stand to listen to people’s drug stories, hear that kind of music, watch movies that show that kind of scene, or be in the same room when things like that are taking place. That is one of the reasons why I do not want a partner who partakes in drug use because it is such a strong strong trigger. Not only that but I believe drugs ruin lives, personalities, finances, and relationships and I cannot stand people who live like that. 
The problem is that’s what I think, not what I feel. What i feel is a strong frustrating temptation to get High. 
Ever since me and Ken got back together, he has used coke around three times. He has been honest about it so I tried not to be too hard on him. 
Every time when I ask him why, he told me he couldn’t stop himself. It’s so triggering and it makes me feel a very difficult kind of way. 
Yesterday he took me to a party. They were drinking beer and taking mdma there. Ken hadn’t taken any mdma, he fell asleep soon after bringing me there because he had drank a lot of beer and didn’t sleep much the night before.
There were only two beers left for me and was not enough for me to get drunk. 
They were snorting mdma right in front of me and I don’t know, something in me just snapped. I started taking lines and getting super high. It was amazing, like this was the feeling I’ve been longing for for such a long time. 
It didn’t last though, because few hours later Ken woke up right as I was snorting a line and saw immediately. 
He was super angry obviously. My mood immediately went intensely depressed and later on he said it’s okay but I feel this tension between us, and I just don’t know where to go from here.

488,"My sister, who has a daughter and has been married for a few years, cheated on her husband, who is a great guy, and she has no remorse for it and is continuing to cheat. The man she's cheating on her husband with is a felon. This came out of nowhere, no one ever thought my sister would turn out to be the kind of person that would do something like this. My Christian family has decided to react to the situation by supporting her husband and her daughter, prioritizing their well-being, but also still showing love to my sister. That means basically not treating her any different other than, if it comes up, letting her know that you believe what she's doing is wrong and encourage her to do what she knows is right.  


That's the thing though, she's knows what's right, and I almost feel like my family treating her normally is, in a way, making her feel more comfortable with her decision. If we disowned her and refused to spend time with her, stopped inviting her to family events, etc... I guess I'm wondering what good that might accomplish? It's hard to see what the right thing is to do in my position. Remember that she has a daughter, so that complicates things.

When I started moving the wind was so intense so I was going slowly but one strong made me lose my balance... Before I could try and balance my bike, I hit an old lady who was pushing her cart (she is a local poor vegetable seller) who was coming in the wrong side of the road(as in going in the opposite direction of me in my lane)... Both of us fell but she fell on her head on the road and there was swelling on the back of her head... she cried and screamed out of pain.. I had also sustained injuries(i am alright now) but I took her to the hospital.. The doctor said there is nothing to worry about and that the pain would vanish in a couple of days and gave her meds.. I paid for the consultation and the meds and called that old lady's daughter and dropped them off at home with the help of a random stranger who was kind enough to help us.. I felt very guilty and sad for the old lady cos she sustained more injuries than me... I exchanged numbers with them cos I wanted to check on the old lady's condition later... I apologized to them so much cos I felt bad... 

Now that lady's daughter is calling me and blaming me and asking me reimburse them for the damage their cart has sustained.. She told me that the pain in unbearable to the old lady and asking me to come and take her to a doctor again... I'm like WTF... I told them whatever I did yesterday was a favor cos she was an old lady and I felt bad... And Infact it was the old lady's fault for coming in the wrong side of the road .... I told them to not take advantage of me just because I'm a nice guy.. Now she is threatening me that she will file a police complaint... I told them please go ahead... I will explain it to the police... 
I felt like crying imagining the pain that she must be going through... 

When I told all this to my parents and friends, they are calling a dumb guy for exchanging numbers and also paying for the consultantion and meds as these local illiterate idiots will only try to take advantage of people who are trying to help them...

494," I have a friend, let's call her Janet. She is engaged to a wonderful man who we will call Henry. Me and Janet have been great friends for a few years, and Henry is perfect for her and a great friend. Recently, we have gained a new mutual friend who we will call Mike. Mike has had a rough past and poor luck with women, but seems to be a good person overall (we are not too terribly close). We all have a shared hobby, and hang out together at least twice a week. Everything was going great until a few months ago, when I started to notice Mike lashing out, at me specifically. I was not sure why, I mean I am on the spectrum so sometimes I make people mad without meaning to but this time, I don't know what I did.

I shrugged it off, Mike has depression issues and a common symptom is anger. I'm a punching bag for a lot of people already, so whatever, it's easier to just deal with than confront him. I notice, however, that his behavior is very, very different towards Janet. I first noticed it one day when Janet mentioned buying some clothes in the group chat. He was extremely interested in every detail, and was showering her with compliments over her choices. Now normally, this is not a red flag, but he has NEVER been like this with anyone. Janet has had zero dating experience outside of Henry and could be called a bit naive.

I noted it, but didn't say anything, after all I had very little proof and only a hunch. I have very good instincts about this sort of thing (people have pulled shit on me in the past) so I watched it carefully. They started hanging out a lot together, seeming to specifically pick days I am with my child so that they do not feel obligated to invite me (we USED to do everything together). This was red flag #2. Red flag number 3 was when they were starting to ignore me in the group chat, but would hold long conversations with each other with no problem. Whatever, I'm used to being ignored.

Enter red flag #5. I stumbled across a Reddit post, without giving too much away, stating that she thinks she has feelings for him (has never happened with anyone besides Henry). She is very faithful, and stated she would not act on it, and I mostly believe her. Problem is, Mike can be very convincing and with his behavior towards me, I think he is starting to push her to shove me out. Now, I should note, Janet has come out recently as trans and while I have not been the best person about it (I try my best, I'm not good with emotions), Mike has apparently been extremely supportive and made Janet feel really good about coming out. Henry has been equally supportive.

Red flag #6: both Janet and Mike have been up late talking frequently, and in private chat (group chat shows when someone is online and on mobile, both are almost always on desktop), which in any other situation is fine, but in this one is concerning. Janet has not been initiating any conversations or hangouts lately (we usually talk a lot) and Mike has been kind of shitty towards me as well.

I'm sure there's a few things I'm missing (distracted now because work), but this should paint an overall picture.

SOME NOTES:

Janet more or less saved my life after a really bad breakup, and I have a massive amount of respect for her, consider her my best friend, and have as much love for someone who isn't related or involved with you as you possibly can. I have abandonment issues due to some serious mental and emotional abuse in the past, so I realize that is coloring my opinions on the matter. I have told NO ONE about this in any capacity, I don't want to destroy any relationships. My relationship with Mike has been very strained lately, and he has been straight up ignoring me in a lot of cases.

Before anyone asks about my feelings towards Janet, don't. I was convinced I had feelings for her when I was at a very low point in my life (she was the only positive thing I had) but I thought about it and realized what it was. I remind her that I love her as an amazing friend, and I'm mostly okay with that never being reciprocated. She helped me through some serious trauma, and she's never gone through something like that, so it makes sense I would feel more appreciative of our relationship.

OP has anxiety, high-functioning spectrum disorder, and past baggage.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to handle this, I don't want to lose all my friends due to some stupid decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: BFF likes not-BFF who is not-fiance. Not-BFF feels same and has been pushing me away and spending a lot of time with BFF. OP has abandonment issues and is probably just reading too much into it. Wat do.",13Aug2019,2

497,"Hi basically I need advice on this situation. There’s a lot of information that I think is important but I understand it’s a lot so if you don’t want to read it all you can skip to the * for the main information.

Also the below isn’t edited because it’s too long to edit right now and my battery is about to die. I’m very sorry, I’ll edit later. Thanks!

I’m 18 years old. There’s this girl my age and we went to the same school. We went out around 4 years ago but we were pretty young and it didn’t really mean much to be honest. One thing that’s is important to know about me is that I’m a people pleaser and I’m not confrontational or blunt at all and sometimes this comes off that I’m fake but I just try to avoid conflict and this ends up with me bottling a lot of my true feelings. So anyways she actually asked me out and I said yes but when we went out I wasn’t sure I entirely liked her. I was really young and naïve and I went along with it because having a girlfriend was ‘cool’. So anyways we went out for like a month before I broke things off. We talked a lot, went places together, but we never had our first kiss. When I broke things off I thought we wouldn’t talk much and we’d just go out separate ways because prior to going out we hadn’t been close friends so why would we be ones now? But I was so wrong. About a week later she told me we should talk more and still be friends and of course I said sure, but I thought we’d just talk occasionally and be friendly to one another. However, I feel like she wanted to be a bit more closer. She’d always text me about her problems with family and everything else. I gave her someone to talk to but after a while I felt like she was saying she was depressed and upset just for my attention. For example one time when I wasn’t getting quite fed up with her and blanking her messages, she would just randomly then text me ‘people say I don’t look as happy as I used to’, which was clearly her trying to get me to reply. I would be lying if I said I didn’t find her annoying. She’d also always invite me places like the movies with other people, and I found this quite irritating because It also felt like her trying to talk to me more. I know this sounds like stupid things to get annoyed at but we were exes and imagine if your ex wouldn’t stop trying to get you in their life. I also felt like she still liked me ( I was right) and I just wanted to be friends and she just overall felt very suffocating and needy. This all lasted for about a year.

It wasn’t all bad though we did have some genuine deep conversations about life and our problems and we shared our advice and experience with each other. At times it did feel like we were just really good friends. But anyways a year later we were having a deep chat and in a moment in stupidity I asked if she still liked me and I proposed we get back together. She said yes and seemed pretty thrilled. However literally the next day I regretted it. I saw her in school and she looked happy, but I knew I couldn’t not say anything. I concluded it was better to tell her it was a mistake than lie to her for a month. I felt pretty bad, and I think she was a little disappointed but she took it well. I really felt like a bad person. However, upon reflection realised that she may be to blame a bit too. That may sound shallow but hear me out. She liked me this entire time but never told me. This pretty much confirmed for me that all those invitations were attempts to get closer even though I said earlier we should just be friends. She like me, knew I thought we should just be friends but didn’t really respect that anyway. That’s how I see it. So after all this you’d think we’d distance ourselves but she continued to text and talk about her problems which sometimes involved me. She claimed that I’ve hurt her a lot and for a long time she made me feel really bad and I apologised multiple times. But if I hurt her so much why did she keep talking to me?! It made me really angry after a while because I felt like she was just using this whole situation to keep me in her life for some reason I have no idea about.

Anyways for the 2 years we had this really weird friendship. I found it toxic because she’d always hold over how I broke up with her twice. But we did still talk about each other’s problems and have deep chats about life. I realise I’m probably painting her out like some monster. She wasn’t. She was also nice a lot of the time and when I had a problem of my own she’d tell me she’s always there and give me support which she did. I even once brought up how I felt that she was constantly making me the bad guy and she actually listened and said she’s sorry and she’d try to stop bring it up. I think she meant it more as a joke. She did have a lot of good traits too. She was kind and caring at times but she had trait I found annoying too. Anyways another year later we were both in bed texting. And I don’t really know how it got where it did but we ended up sending each other images of each other. It was the first time I’d ever did that we were both old enough and it was really fun. The next day I kind of regretted it ( can you see a pattern) but I didn’t say anything. Also at this period, I honestly don’t remember how but we were both talking about how we could be an item after this year of school when exams would be over and we were less busy. Basically I think I (stupidly) put her under the impression that we would be together after this year of school. Now I take full responsibility for this mistake. I shouldn’t have done that and I really don’t remember how it got to that. I think we were talking a lot about our feeling and I kinda lied to please her and said I’d always have some sort of feelings for you and it gradually went from that to we’ll be a couple soon. I wanted to tell her that I was wrong about saying that but that would be the third time I did something like that. So I decided to let her down over time. However, during this period we would keep sending images of each other. I know I’m terrible. She thought we were going to be a couple and I knew we wouldn’t but I still allowed us to send stuff. This went on for s week or so and it was fun, but eventually it stopped and the next few months I said I think we should stay friends after this year is over. She agreed and we stayed friends. It was less of a big deal because I let her down over time. We still talked, but we both found different people. I liked this other girl and she actually went out with this other guy. But we still talked a lot. This period we were pretty stable friends but I found this friendship quite toxic. She was nice when we talked alone but honestly a bit of a bitch in groups. She much ruder in groups. She was also still needy and it it was still annoying. Although there were still some good aspects, I honestly hated her at this point and I wanted to be done with her. So during a deep chat about our history I brought how I thought things were going on a vicious cycle. She kinda agreed and I pushed the idea that maybe we cut each other off. She seemed pretty ok with it and so we went through it.

Long story short it didn’t last. She called me like 2 days later saying she missed me and we ended up talking again. Later we even sent images again, but this time we agreed that there were no strings attached. I also told her that I only see her as a friend for sure now and I’m only attracted physically and she said the same about me (although I’m unsure if I believe her).  However after a few weeks we decided to cut off again, but once again she texts me saying she misses me and says we should talk. This brings us to yesterday. She asked me about my opinions about getting a bj from her and I said I’m tempted but my mind is telling me it’ll regret it and we’re just going in a cycle again. I asked her for opinion on giving me one, and she said she’s ready and wants to. I was hesitant at first but kinda thought with my dick and ended up saying yes. We arranged a day and then sent images again. Also we both acknowledged this was clearly a physical thing and had nothing to do with feelings. There were no strings and it was only pleasure. I also asked if she was sure and asked if she’s not just doing it because she’s in a dark place. She said she’s fine but life is short and she wants to have fun. She said she’s never been happier and is confident in her own skin. 

* So basically I’m not sure if I want to have one by her because:

I hate her

After the summer I plan to never speak to her and properly cut her out. Whenever we agreed to cut off I was fine with it. It was always her who broke the agreement. But now that I’m moving to uni it’ll be much easier to cut her off (it was harder before because we went to the same collage). But anyways if I get the bj then just cut her off I feel like that is a bit douchey. However, we have talked before about how we might and probably should stop talking when we go to separate unis but at this point i don’t know what to believe comes out her mouth.

I’ve told one close friend I hate her and plan to cut her out (they don’t know the full picture though or any of the private stuff or the potential bj). I’d surely be a fool to go through with it after saying I hate her

I feel like the first time should be special and with someone you care for not who you hate? Idk is that stupid?

However, it would be an experience. JUST PLEASE HELP. Give me some good advice please!!

Thank you for putting up with the many mistakes that are probably in this I just blurted everything out. Sorry! But thanks!",13Aug2019,0
499,"My dad (today, 69 years old) got diagnosed with Type II Diabetes a few years back. Since then, he's gained a large amount of weight. He works in a stressful job and doesn't have a lot of time to work out (though I think if he prioritized, he would be able to). He has a serious sweet tooth. Whenever approached on the topic he gets defensive and angry. His father also had diabetes, smoked, ate what he wanted, and died at 85, so he uses that as an excuse to eat whatever and not exercise.
I'm so scared for him. I love him so much and I don't know what I would do if something happened to him. How do I get him to value his life the way I value it?
I just want him to live a much healthier lifestyle. Please help!",13Aug2019,1
500,"My best friend and I love each other. We always will. 
She is around 7 years younger than me. We both have a school aged child. Our friendship has always been about doing fun things with the kids, but always making time for grown up fun too. 

We’ve talked about the kids growing up, our ideas of what we would do. We both enjoyed staying up late and hanging out for hours talking. We took annual trips together when we were “kid free” for a brief time during the summer. 

Sometime recently, she apparently decided she wanted another baby. And now has become pregnant. I love her dearly, but I (as awful as this sounds) am not interested in going through the pregnancy listening to her complain constantly, going through the infant stages and feeling unhelpful if I don’t change a diaper or offer to babysit, and definitely not going through the stage of another screaming toddler having a tantrum. 

I KNOW this all sounds like MY problem. But I don’t know how I can maintain my friendship and still be around these things that I just don’t want to be part of. Is it possible? I know I sound like an asshole- but, honestly, I am just beyond this point in my life. I am beyond toting carseats into stores and stopping everything I’m doing for a feeding. 

Help. Help me figure out how to get past feeling this way.",13Aug2019,0
502,"Sorry for the most generic title ever but there's just so much going on that I don't know how else to put it without it being overwhelming.

For the past 6 or so years of my life, I've noticed a few problems snowball over time, which inevitably caused other issues. the four core issues are self-segregation/loneliness, wasteful spending, self-loathing/doubt, and motivation. 

TL;DRs will be provided in Bold under sections, sections will also be titled in Bold.   


**First off, Self-segregation/loneliness**. This has a lot to do with how poorly I've dealt with heated situations, or the days of being trolled on the internet at an age where I probably shouldn't have been at said places on the internet anyways. I find it excruciatingly difficult to trust other individuals. I get that sensation that everyone is out to get me in some way shape or form, and it's for that reason that I've pretty much shut myself inside of a box, with only two friends. Yes, I'm not kidding, I have two friends, both live nowhere remotely near me. Problem is, having only two people to talk to (outside of household members) becomes excruciatingly painful at times, especially when both are busy (rightfully so) and it's that reason that I want to find more friends. That alone is a problem, it seems like when I do find someone I'll talk to them for like a day and then never pick back up on the conversation. Often times when I'm commissioning someone for art/tangibles, I try to be as excruciatingly nice as possible and engage in an actual conversation throughout the process, but it seems like it doesn't go anywhere either - with regards to those whom are extremely nice and I've built solid relationships (by means of trust, not friendship) with. Ideally I want to find people who share more than one common interest with me (cars, photography, furry \[sorry internet\], etc.) so that conversations don't become stale (one topic only), though I'm also open to new interests as well. While I don't mind having internet friends, I prefer to meet people who are local as I'm tired of sitting in my house from morning to night on the internet (I work from home). 

I'm also excruciatingly shy IRL. I'm shy to the point where I'd rather walk around a store aimlessly like an idiot for an hour trying to find something than ask someone for help. I'm also terrified of going to conventions, and considering the city holds one of the biggest cons for a certain aforementioned interest - I often feel fear just in thinking of it. I don't want it to be that way though as one of my friends say they're tons of fun to attend and I feel like it's a good opportunity to find new people to add to my circle.

**So the first place where I need advice is regarding how I can stop being shy, find new friends, build solid friendships, and forgo my con anxiety so I can network with people whom have a common interest with me (and have a good time, too.)** 

**Second problem, Wasting money (whee!)** I've developed mounds of credit card debt (Over $10k but under $15k) over the years that needs to go. I already have a rock solid plan to reduce my debt (thanks to all of the info on r/personalfinance), but I keep drifting away from adhering to it. The biggest point of failure in my plan is boredom. I experience boredom so often that the majority of my tangible purchases are for amusement or stuff that will keep me occupied for small amounts of time (e.g. model kits, or things pertaining to my other interests). This is an issue that started when I was young, around 14 or so, and progressed into my adulthood and though responsible use of a credit card did last about 6 months past my 18th birthday, I'm now 21 and super PO'd that I can't afford an enthusiast car because of all the stupid purchases I've made, most of which I no longer even have.

One of my friends tends to point out that I'm attracted to material happiness because of my self-segregation. I can kinda see his point, which is why I'm trying to fix all these things in tandem. 

**Second place of advice needed - How to stick to my plan of paying off my debt without robbing myself of a life**

**Third Place - Self-loathing and doubt.** I'm sickeningly harsh on myself. Near everything I make is 100% trash. I have a problem where I continuously compare myself to others. I feel like an abysmal failure in comparison, and it's nobody's fault but my own. I have a hard time seeing the bright side of myself, and I often feel that people tell me the ""nice things"" just to be nice or to make me feel better.  This is also probably negatively affecting my friendships so it's something I'd like to rectify rather fast.

**Third place of advice needed - How to stop comparing myself to others and start appreciating myself &amp; my accomplishments, even if ""they're lackluster"". Learning how to take compliments could be helpful, too.**

**Fourth, and final-not-final problem (because there's never a ""final"" problem in life), is motivation.** When you add up all the aforementioned issues, it's probably no surprise that I'm a depressed sack of it. I have no motivation to do much of anything, even though I really want to go out there and ""do amazing things"" (whatever that's supposed to mean). Sometimes it's at the fault of lack of courage, sometimes at the lack of self-confidence, and sometimes because ""yeaaaa.... nahhhhh"". Regardless, I don't want lack of motivation to stop me anymore. I want the ability to occupy my free time with fun things to do, because with some of my health conditions I have a good chance of dropping over faster than the average person. I'd hate to see it all go to waste on a life full of sadness, loneliness, and missing out on so much.

**So the Fourth place of advice needed - How to find motivation and keep the momentum going.** 

Thanks for reading this novel of hell I've been through for the past 6 years. No blaming others, solely my fault. And, I want to fix it. Reddit, what is your advice for me to get started so I can enjoy life instead of loathe it?",13Aug2019,1
504,"Title pretty much explains it. So I’m extremely close with both my mom and dad. Who are not close lol. My dad is in jail for 75 days for child support and I get married in 40. I’m heartbroken but know these are his choices. Anyways the money to get him out goes straight to my mom. 

He has asked me to pay for him to get out (which is my wedding money)  and have my mom pay me back. I did not feel comfortable asking but I did tell her that he asked. 

My stepdad is the one who is thinking of doing this and my mom is agreeing. 

I feel really mixed about this entire situation. Is this just enabling or is it justified because it IS my wedding day ? So I guess do I let them do that or do I tell them no ?",13Aug2019,1
505,"Backstory: I work very closely with two co-workers, a male - Jake  and female - Ann (not their real names). They are across the hall from me and from the day I started working here I noticed they were unusually close with each other. I got to know them more and chalked it up to them just being really close friends. Ann and Jake are both super flirty, but they're like that with everyone. However, I always had it in the back of my mind that something more was going on between the two of them. They are both married, and I had heard from other co-workers that Jake cheats on his wife; and Ann tells me all the time that her husband is just not a good person, but she ""loves him"" and keeps him around for her child. We work in a **VERY** country part of town. Everyone has a super small-town mentality, everybody knows everybody and no-one divorces anyone unless it's an extreme case.

Yesterday I had to tell them I was leaving early, I usually knock on their doors before entering, but since Ann goes into his room all the time without knocking I figured it was no big deal. When I go in there they are usually watching a show, so I just didn't think anything of it. I entered without knocking (we all have keys to each others doors) and noticed Ann pulling down her skirt and ducking under the table and Jake pulling up his pants really quickly. I was absolutely mortified, and make a joke like ""ohh what am I interrupting"". I apologized profusely for not knocking before coming in, and I KNOW that is my fault. I had to leave the hallway because I thought I was going to throw up, and I needed to take my mind off of what I just saw, so I went and talked to it about some friends. Most people found it hysterical, until I told them they are both married. I understand how cheating works, I understand that some people are just not happy in their marriage but don't want to divorce their partner for their own personal reasons. However, these are my closest co-workers, and now I feel such a rift between both of them. My last day is tomorrow, but I wanted to keep a friendship with Ann, we both like doing similar things and I always thought we would hang out when I left my job. I really don't want to hang out with her anymore, and get a sick feeling in my stomach whenever I need to look at them or talk to them. I try to keep things normal, but I'm so bad at keeping my cool! I understand this is none of my business, but should I at least bring it up to Ann? And if so, how? Or should I just leave it alone since tomorrow is my last day? I really just needed to vent, I had the utmost respect for these two and now it just tainted the way I see them.

TL;DR: Caught my co-workers having sex and now I need to know if I should address it or not. Tomorrow is my last day so I won't really ever have to see them again.",13Aug2019,0
506," My girlfriend is being harassed basically everytime she goes to work by the security of the stablishment. She is a cashier on a local supermarket.  
She accepted his facebook request 2 weeks ago and when she didn't show up to work because of her schedule, he noticed that and sent her a message ""there's no work today?"", red flag, isn't it? I mean, the fucking guy actually noticed she's not there and shit. I feel like my GF is becoming a prey, he even knows when she's about to enter the stablishment through the cameras and goes to the front door greeting her   
The day after that he came close to her and said she looked ""hot"" on some pictures she has. She told him to fuck off in a good manner right away and he went back to his place. She blocked him the minute she got home and told me about it. I could'nt help that much, I only told her to speak to her supervisor and that's that.  
Fast forward some days and he doesn't show up for a week. I was thinking he got fired or something, but that wasn't the case. Guy went on holidays. He came back today and when she was counting up the money to put on the safe and he picked up a coin and threw it to my GFs chest and said that was his safe. The girls who work there with her said ""he's like that to every girl"". How can he be like that and still work there? Maybe they fear him or something? I don't get it.

How can she deal with this situation while not fucking things up? (for e.g, her losing the job, she's only been there for a month).",13Aug2019,1
507,"Howdy r/advice,

I trie to type this once before and it got deleted, so I'll try again--ask questions if details are left out.

The title states the situation. We recently hired a new member of our business team, person A. They are doing fine, but I recently found out that person A, who was recommended directly to our hiring manager by person B, has been dating person B/has been in a consistent romantic relationship for two years and is still dating them now.

We went out on a limb to hire person A, and I know that we wouldn't have hired A without person B's explicit recommendation and them handing our hiring manager person A's resume (they only worked together for two months, so their working relationship is incredibly brief), as their resume wasn't honestly what we were looking for in the position.

I don't have any qualms about person A at this point, because they went through our interview and hiring process fair and square and we still decided to hire them. However, the fact that person B didn't disclose this upon initially recommending them seems extremely unethical to me. Additionally, they are still continuing to hide the fact that they are dating and have not come forward about it to either of their managers. They are both in my group, and person A works directly with my team. 

What do I do about this, if anything?",13Aug2019,3
508,"So I've managed to carve a free evening out of my schedule, after months of trying.

Now I need to figure out how to fix it. I have a few options and reasons for each. But I'm having a hell of a time choosing between them.

Debauchery - I've got a sweet, good looking couple who would be interested in making me a regular in their bed. This seems like it would be incredibly fun, and even if it doesn't work out I could still spend the night hooking up or going to play parties, since it's a common night for those. Super appealing in the moment, but long term it doesn't build towards any of my life goals, it's just momentary pleasure. Really appealing momentary pleasure though.

Marksmanship - I also have been invited to join the local gun club. I could make this my designated range night. I like shooting well enough, but the big appeal to this option is that it seems like my country is building towards a violent civil war, in which case knowing how to operate a firearm effectively could be a really useful skill to have if I'm going to get myself killed fighting against tyranny. And I gotta be honest that's a super attractive option here. If nothing else it's still a good social opportunity.

So those are the two primary options I'm considering, although I do have some others that have been bouncing around.

Spend another night a week working on art projects - been wanting to make an animated video, if I dedicate one evening a week I could probably be done in a year or so, or I could double the amount of time each week working on my sculpture project. Like the debauchery option this is mostly for personal satisfaction and the joy of getting attention and appreciation from others but has no long term weight I can figure.

Get fit - I could make it a gym night and work on my physical appearance and general health. I currently do a half hour of cardio a day but could really so with some upper body weight training.

Gaming and Reading - finally, I could just be a lazy ass and make it a night dedicated to really low stress relaxation. Catch up on some old video games and books I've been meaning to read.

I feel like if I don't make a clear choice soon I'll end up with that last option, and maybe that's not so bad but it's not really where I want to end up right now.",13Aug2019,0
509,"Hi Reddit, I started getting tattoo'd about a year ago now, at first small, kind of nerdy things. But I have just recently gotten my first large piece and it is very nerdy indeed. I thought about it for a long time, and it holds a lot of deep personal meaning, but everyone I have showed it to so far has reacted kind of strangely. This has triggered an overwhelming bout of anxiety for me and I almost want to get it covered immediately, however, it is very large and very dark and it covers nearly the entire top of my thigh. I can keep it covered almost always, but I keep having these overwhelming waves of dread whenever I think about showing it to people and facing another line of questioning. Moreover, I am very VERY nervous as to how this will affect any romantic prospects in the future. It's not ugly, or violent, or offensive in any way, just very obscure and extremely...bold.

510,"So this is going to be a long text. So last year around the beginning of October, I got really drunk one night (really drunk to the point I don’t remember a huge deal) at my university and this girl who I was friends with asked if she could come up to my room and study for her tests. She knew I was drunk because she asked what I was doing first before asking to study. Looking back at it now, I realized she didn’t even come in with her bag or anything to study with whatsoever. Next thing I really remember is me and her having sex but very vaguely. At one point I fell straight off the bed and hit my head on the floor. We then stopped just about after that and I don’t remember much besides getting her out and passing out in my bed. The next morning I woke up and my penis was aching (bad bad) and I looked at it and my skin was cut up so much and it was literally covered in blood. I then felt like shit. This girl has then caused so many problems for me, like told me girlfriend of now that I did a bunch of things and that i really wanted her instead of my gf, made a bunch of females hate me from that point on, and constant shit talking on campus. This happened around a year ago and I never reported it because I was scared it would come back on me and I would get in trouble rather than her and plus I don’t want to literally ruin someone’s life for this. The only issue is that yesterday my gf had to interact with the girl because she’s an RA now too and reported the whole thing. Now I’m terrified and I don’t know what to do.

At one point, one of his friends was adamant we took a beer from him. We did so that he would leave us alone, effectively, as the friend has mental issues. Near the end of my shift, my client was really really encouraging me to drink said beer before I go. After some hesitation I did, which was the mistake I made, as I wasn't keeping the professional boundaries. 

Anyway, I later find out he can actually be very manipulative and has done stuff like this before and then used it against carers later on for his own ends. 

Now obviously I shouldn't have done it and there's no way I would again, bear in mind I was still very new to this job at the time. At the moment we are getting on fine and as far as I know he hasn't complained about me to anyone yet. 

I'm trying to decide what to do in the future should this come up. The way I see it I have two options:

1. Admit to it, own it and gracefully accept getting fired for my mistake, and then possibly struggle getting more work with no reference and that in my history 

Or 2. Deny that this ever happened since its my word against his and he has been known to lie and manipulate and ask to work with someone else if it gets to that point.

1) Money. My main goal right now is to buy a house within the next two years and international travel is really expensive. Even traveling inside of the United States can be expensive. I’m living in an apartment right now and I’m sick of paying someone else to live on their property. I am willing to give up potentially enjoyable experiences traveling to save money.

2) My worldview. With the exception of Canada, I view the places I’ve been to abroad as somewhat corrupt and dark places in many aspects. I enjoyed my trips to Italy and France and they are both beautiful countries with rich histories, but I was always on guard in those places.

Just like everyone else, I hate funerals. But my dislike towards them is also targeted at the format in which they are carried out. I don't like the churches, the body on display, being forced to write a eulogy etc. I wouldn't want that at my funeral at all. If it were up to me we'd be having a meal in a large venue where people can have intimate conversations with each other and mourn peacefully, maybe with a speech or two *if* people are willing to do so.

However, I do get that not everyone thinks this way and would want a more traditional funeral. I also get that no one is expecting anything amazing they just want someone to say a few stories to distract them from the occasion. It's just that I'm not a good public speaker and an even worse writer. Call it selfishness all you like but I mourn differently and just don't really want to do it at all.",13Aug2019,1
523,"A bit of background: throughout highschool, I didn't have a huge group of friends and often found myself on the outskirts of social events. I didn't have much confidence, was very shy, and was never the kind of person people gravitate to. I was also bullied pretty badly. This was something constantly on my mind, something I'd beat myself up over because I kept wondering ""why don't people like you?? What's wrong with you??""

I also have three very close best friends who mean the world to me. I still had insecurities I struggled with but they became easier to deal with because I now knew how to work on them.

Now, after finishing uni, I've met someone who is absolutely amazing: he's incredibly smart, very very cool, and just altogether an amazing person to spend time with. The kind of person that turns heads just by walking down the street. The thing is, he's got a giant group of friends full of awesome girls and guys, basically the kind of friend group everyone dreams of, and a few times he's invited me along for parties. They're always really fun but I can't help but feel intimidated and like I'm reverting back to my insecure, shy, low confidence self even though I really hate it and don't want it to be this way. I feel like I don't have much to offer in the social front since I really don't have events to invite him to in return, and I also am very very far from the life of the party when I do go to parties he invites me to.

I have nothing to offer, I'm worthless, boring, his friends won't like me"" and although I haven't brought these thoughts up to him, I'm worried I might end up self-destroying what could possibly be something great because I'm so insecure. I guess my question ultimately is, how do I stop comparing myself and my social situation to his and is it possible to date someone who is way ""cooler"" without starting to feel like I'm nothing? Would my lack social events to invite him to start bothering him in the future?

525," 

My apologies if this is rambling, this situation is pretty stressful and I don't know how to handle it. I did also post this on another subreddit.

About a month ago, I posted to AITA about dropping out of a service trip. To make a long story short, the woman who runs the service trip program at my school told me that I would be at one location then randomly changed it to a much more dangerous area that I do not feel safe going to. I dropped out of the trip, but I offered to help with all pre-trip stuff since I originally volunteered to lead the trip, and the trip itself isn't until December, so she does have time to find a replacement for me.

The other day, I got an email from her demanding to meet in person as soon as I'm back on campus. It wasn't necessarily *aggressive*, but you could tell in her writing that she was pretty irritated with me. The only reason that I could think of for why she wants to meet so badly is because she is going to try and guilt me into still leading the trip. Honestly, why would she want someone to lead a trip so badly if they tried to drop out? I know for a fact they rejected some people for the position, couldn't she pull someone off that list and ask if they still wanted to lead a trip?

I hate ignoring people, but that's what I've been doing. I still haven't responded to her email because I don't know how to without coming off as a jerk. I feel horrible for dropping the trip in the first place, but I cannot jeopardize my own safety for a trip. If anybody has any advice for handling this situation I would greatly appreciate it.",13Aug2019,1

It’s been 5 years since I left school, and randomly about a month ago he followed me on Instagram. And since then any picture I post that shows my face he’ll like it.

527,"This is strange one.  In my late twenties, I was friend dumped by a friend from high-school.  She had cited that she was expecting a child and wished to raise the child surrounded by people who were religious and also had families.  ( I am an avowed agnostic, who never wanted children.)  

At the time, I was hurt...  I had been a bridesmaid in both of her weddings.  I had seen her through some rough times, even being a roommate for a year after her first marriage fell apart when she was despondent. Then when her life turned around, it was like she had no further need for me

But this was fifteen years ago, and I moved on and have forgiven her any hurt the situation caused me.   We have only been connected by facebook since we""broke up""... In recent years she often liked, or occasionally positively responded to  my posts, and I did the same in return.   When she announced on facebook that she was undergoing chemotherapy to fight breast cancer,  I sent her a DM offering well wishes,  and she sent me a brief and appropriate repose of thanks in return.  I really felt no need for our relationship to be deeper than this.

This week, I learned that another woman, with whom we were both very good friends with in high school, died tragically. I sent a group DM to several highschool friends to let them know of the tragedy, including my ""ex"" friend.  

This is where it gets weird.  She sent me a DM message expressing sorrow for the death and also saying how much she missed me; asking what I have been up to since high-school?  After chatting with her on line while,  it seems like she has zero memory of our relationship/ end of relationship after high-school.  I wonder if memory loss is a side effect to her medical treatment?  

She was bursting to see me, trying to pin me down on date, for me to come over and meet her husband and child  ( Remember  I know her husband, I was a bridesmaid and was living with her when the were courting.)

I am neutral on seeing her again.. Honestly I am fine not seeing her, but also think it might be nice to catch up.  But I am not sure how to navigate this socially.  Should I fill her on?  Go to lunch?  How to I handle this gracefully?",13Aug2019,3

However, my roommate warned my boyfriend that the person that they’re buying from is known to short people. Instead of getting a certain amount they paid for, the guy gives them less weed. 
The transaction, to my knowledge, went well and it was weighed in front of them but unbeknownst to them, the scale the guy brought was broken. We have our own scale at home and weighed it out and my boyfriend got shorted. 
I want to blame my roommate because he was the one who brought it up and convinced my boyfriend to buy them some but I can also see that this was my boyfriend’s choice to buy and he should be held accountable too. Trust me, he is. He doesn’t have he rest of his money back.

538,"Last year I moved from home and took an Academic leave from school so that I could work &amp; help my parents relax a little bit because of how it was hard for them to pay my university fees.
The problem is, I was was subjecting myself to the stress that comes with work, work that I don't like but I have to do so that life can be bearable. I also had not resolved problems that I had with myself. For instance, when I was 11 years old I did something bad that brought alot of shame to my family. I didn't dwell on what I did until I turned 20 years and depression hit me hard when I started recalling what I did.
I have also been regarded as timid, extremely shy, average, an overthinker which is true. I have seen people close to me become disappointed cause its like they have an image of who I am but when they know me they are underwhelmed, extremely underwhelmed. 

I was unable to deal with everything since last year October-November &amp; I started taking alcohol, smoking, I was desperate, I was calling it the ""Numbing myself from myself"" phase. I couldn't go ahead with suicide because I am the first born &amp; I love my small sister, I will break her if I do it, but I had already come up with ways to do it.

When I turned 23 this year (April 10th) I drunk alot to the point of intoxication. 
Tried changing but I couldn't, my work output became horrible &amp; I panicked because some clients started looking for other alternatives cause of my diminishing services.
I didn't have anyone to talk to &amp; I continued with my self-destructive behaviours. 
Until July, when I tried changing, I took magic mushrooms to see if they would help cure my mental health problems, I overdosed (10grams) which isn't recommended for a beginner &amp; things went bad. I messed up alot during my psychedelic trip. Anyway, right now I am really trying to change but its hard. Its like you finally get out of a dark tunnel &amp; the light that guided you out shines bright on what you have to do, but the strength to deal with them is not there. 

Maybe I can get an advice from anyone that will make me see things a little bit different cause I have tried, really tried (I have tried Zen &amp; Buddhism ideologies, Christianity, I live in Kenya &amp; Therapy is expensive tbh, I am afraid I will not be able to sustain the payments before I am able to become well)

Sorry if what I have written isn't orderly or too much, but anyway any advice will be appreciated. Thank you.",13Aug2019,1

540,"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I figured I'd just go ahead and post it here. 

So, I'm(22/F) in Japan, staying in the dormitory of a Japanese language school for a study program. I have two other roommates that come from Spain, and even though we're only here for 3 weeks (1 week left to finish) they've already formed a hateful opinion of me. In front of me, they're polite though. I made quick friends with a guy from Spain, who hangs around my roommates a lot because they all speak Spanish. He says he doesn't like spending a lot of time with them, because they're rude, racist,  self-centered and because they talk shit about me. This was honestly a surprise to me, because the only opinion I formed about my roommates was 'They're nice, I guess.' Nothing more, nothing less. 

I can see if I was acting like a bitch, but I'm nothing but polite to them. The only conversations I've even had with my roommates is just about learning Japanese and just asking if doing something in the room was ok with them, like using the AC or room light.  A couple of years ago, I dealt with anger issues and by now, I would've already cussed them out, picked a fight, or done something extremely petty. Now I don't feel that intense anger, but knowing that my roommates are shit talking me with nothing to go off of but the color of my skin and very brief encounters, is aggravating. 

How would you guys handle this? I know I only have one week left, but I really don't want to stand for that crap.

Iv been with my partner for a year and a few months now but iv been having second thoughts for a little while. Now this guy is head over heals for me so it would be a asshole move to dump him and I feel kinda bad asking myself this question but il list five reasons why im thinking of leaving him.

1) he has zero sense of humour 
2) our life goals dont meet. For example he keeps saying in 6 years we can do this or in 8 years we can do that, but Im ready to settle down now and do these things now, I feel like in 8 years il be too old. Iv expresses these feelings to him and he says stuff will happen sooner but I know it wont.
3) he keeps doing stupid stuff(i know we all do) and getting himself more and more debt for example instead of a normal car he bought a ten year old sports car (for the same price you could get a brand new or almost new relieable car) and all its done is break down and he cant afford to keep it. 
4) brings me to point 4 I am sick of him just expecting things from me like when his car breaks he instantly expects to use my car or when he goes away he just expects me to look after his cats now normally I wouldnt mind, your suppose to help your spouse out but I would at least like to be asked or thanked
5) he shows no gratitude 
6) he never got me anything for my birthday or christmas even though he earns double what I earn and I got him a zip line experience for his birthday which was great fun and got him tones of handy trinkets for his house for christmas. This seriously upset me and I even physically cried for a few days and im not the kind of person to be easily upset.

What taboo subjects are we allowed to enjoy in fiction, and what really constitutes going too far? 

I've been in many online circles over the years, and for the most part I've been a wallflower. I've noticed that the level of acceptance for taboo subjects in series varies, but never makes linear sense to me. The biggest ones I can think of that would immediately get someone negative attention in a fandom is enjoying themes or ships involving incest, minor/adult ships, abuse or sexual assault. 

Without outing myself, I'm a survivor of CSA and domestic abuse. I used to be very against any art involving these themes. It was something that had direct ties to my trauma, and I feel that seeing it definitely felt like traumatizing myself all over again. But as I've gotten older, I've no longer felt myself feeling as quick to snap or condemn people for enjoying fiction with some of these themes. I've seen people who draw and enjoy these things but obviously go on to lead very normal lives without harming anyone.

On the other side of the coin, the person responsible for domestic abuse against me strictly condemned any sort of taboo content at all, yet didn't see anything wrong with assaulting me for years. So I've observed that while abusive people can enjoy content of the very thing they perpetuate, some abusive people have such a separation from reality they will perpetuate in real life but condemn in fiction. 

When is taboo too far? People hate incest, yet Game of Thrones was one of the most popular shows on TV, and the majority of the ships were incestual due to close bloodlines. I never saw anyone rally against GoT as much as I would see people do in small communities online. Is it only okay to call out taboo subjects when it's against a smaller community, but being widely accepted? 

I'm not trying to call either side bad. Obviously fiction does affect reality to an extent-so many people talk about how books or shows kept them surviving while in a dark place, and fiction does have a positive and negative impact we can't ignore. But on another hand I would much rather someone explore dark themes in fiction than take them out on real people in real life, and enjoying taboo themes in fiction does not automatically mean you perpetuate that abuse in real life.

I just thought I was needed on Tues-Weds instead. In my defense, I didn't believe it was my place as a new employee to question it...especially since I'm not a very assertive person to begin with. I sincerely thought I wasn't needed for that day.

So, that Monday rolls around and you guessed it, 15 minutes after my shift was supposed to start I started getting messages asking where I was. So I start panicking and call staffing and try and explain myself. She looks at the schedule and agrees that, yep, I wasn't on the schedule for today. She asks if I'm still coming in and I tell her ""well, no...I didn't realize I had to work today and made plans!!!!"" in the end she hung up on me. Yes, I probably should have just gone in but I was a little under the influence and I know I wouldn't have been able to go in, I probably should have just said that but she had already hung up. It was an honest mistake, but I definitely need some advice on what to say and do when I go in for my scheduled shift tonight.",13Aug2019,1

574,"All my interactions with people lately have left me feeling like crap. It’s starting to get me really down.

I was so isolated in my relationship and basically had no close friends. I’ve been trying to change that since that relationship ended, but it isn’t going very well. 

After I ended a relationship that was physically and emotionally abusive for  several years and cutting ties with my abusive parents / dysfunctional family, I have found myself completely alone. It’s been a little over a year. I have tried to open myself up to new social situations to meet new people. I’ve experienced pretty extreme depression and anxiety due to past trauma, but I don’t let this show. I try to be as friendly as I can be and get to know people and show interest in them. But I find that no one seems to show the same interest in me. They only want to talk about themselves and only engage if I initiate. I’m attractive, well groomed with good hygiene and not socially inept. So it’s not an issue with any of that.

I’ve been living alone for a little over a year and have been volunteering for around 2 years at a sanctuary for animals. This is something I felt very passionate about at the start, but over time my interactions with people have left me feeling kind of terrible every time I go there.

The sanctuary is not close either. It’s a 4 hour drive there and back and I go by myself every time. I go there for all their volunteer days and events. It’s run by a family who I was hoping to become closer with over time, but I sense the feeling was never mutual. It took over a year before I was even invited into their house and that was only a one time thing with other volunteers. I’ve never been invited there to spend time as a friend. 

I’ve also tried to befriend the volunteers (mostly a handful of regulars), but they don’t seem to like people. They’re not even friends with each other. They are obviously there for the animals only. Over time they come and go, too. I try to get to know everyone I meet though. 

I spent a lot of time getting to know the family that runs this place. The owners, their kids, their parents. The adults are all friendly on the surface. By this I mean, they’ll talk to me in a friendly way when I initiate conversation and they hug me hello/goodbye when I go there. But that’s where it ends.

I feel like my presence is only wanted for my donations and volunteer work. Other than that, this family hasn’t even asked me a single question about myself or tried to get to know me at all in 2 YEARS. I have them on Facebook, which only has a couple of photos of my cats and their sanctuary animals, because I don’t share much on it. But even then, I don’t get any likes from any of them on there.

They invited me to their Christmas party last year at their house, along with all the other volunteers. Which I was so happy about because I was spending that Christmas alone. I mentioned this to them, but no one asked me anything about it. They knew I was in a relationship and that we separated. Because they met him once. But they didn’t know him or that he was abusive. They never ask any questions. 

I actually caught and rescued two animals that live at their sanctuary and drove them there, with no help whatsoever from them. I’ve donated money, gift cards, food, items for the animals and brought whatever I could that they needed. I’ve attended all their potlucks and brought food and drinks and cookies and snacks. I’m the only person who makes that long drive out there. I have to rent a car to do it each time too (because I’ve been saving to buy a car of my own). They know this, I’ve told them. Everyone else that volunteers is local. There is nothing closer and I really like being around animals. 

This summer the owner desperately wanted gluten free buns for an event at the last minute and said she would pay anyone for the bread if they could find it because her local shop was out. I bought her a few bags which wasn’t cheap. She didn’t even thank me, or give me any money for them. I was planning on telling her she didn’t have to pay me and could consider it a donation, but she didn’t even try to pay me back for them. I decided to just let it go and not bring it up. 

Recently I noticed she was attending a festival in my city to promote her sanctuary. I don’t think she’s ever been to my city before. It showed up in my feed and I asked her about it. She said she was invited to speak at the event. I sent her a message saying that if she needed any help with anything or just wanted company to let me know, because I‘d  like to attend that festival. She read the message but didn’t even respond. 

She’s ignored my messages before, when I sent her my condolences when some of the animals passed away. I’ve given her cards and everything. But she doesn’t say anything. I don’t know, I just find that rude. I wouldn’t do that.

She used to send me updates about the animals I rescued along with a couple of photos here and there on messenger, during the first month (after I asked her to) but she stopped shortly after and hasn’t at all in a year and a half. 

I get this weird vibe that she doesn’t actually like me, but wants whatever I have to offer that she might need. :(

Her parents are a little more friendly and jokey with me, but even they don’t try to get to know me or ask me questions about me. We just talk about them or the animals when I initiate or approach them if I see them around. If I mentioned anything about me the conversation would just turn into just a monologue. 

I’ve driven back home in tears a few times feeling so sad and lonely after spending a day there. Then I get pissed off and start considering just never going back. Which would only further isolate me. The sad thing is if I disappeared, I am convinced that none of them would even say a damn thing or care much. Is this just what most people are like?

579,"Hi all,

I'm currently a 23 year old female, started my first job out of college about a year ago. Specifically, I started as a BDR (entry-level sales role).

At first, things were great, but some of the louder, more visible, popular guys on the team were not my biggest fan. I became a ""top performer"" but they went around the org saying I was a fraud, a bitch, a loser, that I gamed the system and it wasn't fair. I was told my future manager, who is a fratty, recently promoted BDR, did not want me on his team (the ""outbound"" BDR sales team - I started on inbound). I did move to his team but suffered for months after that hearing that everyone was saying terrible things about me.

I've continued being a top performer since then, and things have definitely gotten better. I also want to note I've gone way out of my way to be helpful to other team members, and those people have expressed gratitude for that. I was promoted to the Account Executive role in July and have been doing very well. But some people at the company still say things to me now like ""you needed a manager who hired off numbers and not perception"" or ""I think some people fucked with you/didn't talk to you the right way"" and it makes me feel like socially, I've been completely destroyed at the company. While I do have some friends and I'm doing well, making extremely good money/career progression for my age, I feel like I was destroyed socially and lies were spread about me that I can't undo. As a side note, I had reported the rumor spreading/shit talking to my managers, but they didn't really do anything.

I love the products and feel like I'm good at my job, but am currently interviewing for other jobs at Google and Facebook. The company I'm at is also rumored to IPO soon so I feel lame about not reaping the benefits of that after everything I've been through. I don't know whether to stay or leave.

581,"So for context:
Rn I(M16) am on a vacation with my family(mother, sister, dad) and I was occasionally looking over my dad's phone whilst he was using it when I noticed a notification along the lines of ""Xx is in the area and wants to meet you""(this was on the lockscreen) .My dad quickly tried tohide it by swiping it away but I had seen it and started having suspicions.
Furthermore a few months ago he went to Thailand for a week with his friend(who happens to be single) which my mom heavily opposed for obvious reasons(she was clearly not ok with him acting there like he was single as well which she thought was possible) but well he went there anyway bc my mom generally tends to give in easily. Back then I as well thought it was fishy but didn't think to much of it.
But this time was seriously different I had seen a notification on his phone seriously suggesting that he had been or was cheating and honestly it's not hard to imagine considering my dad only comes home late at night around 12pm due to working as a taxi driver(we are basically running a small business meaning he controls his work times), he could easily stop working and do other things if he wanted.

Well in conclusion my curiosity was unbearable so I decided to stay awake till everyone slept and snatch his phone(he fortunatrly had no unlockpin for his phone) and search for suspicious things which I did.
Unfortunately I found something. He had this app installed called badoo and he also had a detailed profile about himself and everything but no chats interestingly enough which convinced me that he might have used this app and than deleted the chats but I couldn't be sure, even though I didn't find anything else, the MOST disturbing thing was actually how he used MY Name as his name on the profile which made me want to throw up, he even mentioned how he had children and what not and everything left me so confused. To me it lokked like he was a single/divorced man who had children and was looking for serious relationship(judging from the things he wrote about himself in his profile). 

I actually didn't think he would cheat on my mom but now knowing he might have seriously breaks my heart.
Actually my confusion doesn't end here, bc it was all written in German(the language used in the country we live in obviously) which would make it unlikely that he used it in Thailand. Iam just so confused, why does he have this app, what's up with this creepy profile and what should I do, I just dont know. It just doesn't add up to me.
Honestly rethinking everything rn I srsly think he might have cheated on my mom in Thailand and tried to do it here as well.


Tldr:
My dad might have cheated on my mom in a vacation he had and also in the country we usually live in considering the concerning things he did/I found.
In conclusion I don't know how to proceed from here I consider confronting him alone or not doing anything and being on the watch for other redflags.

And recently we have hit a dip because she had felt like everything we did was boring, and even though she said she loved me, she just wasn't excited to see me. But here is the problem, while this was happening, she decided to get high with her co-workers that is 31. Now he isn't high, she is just really high in his passenger seat while they drive around randomly. 

This makes me anxious to no end. Like I trust her that she is being safe, and she trusts him (the 31 year old), and we finally had a good day again that was fun. But then I asked if she wanted to see me after work, she said ""I just want some time to myself if that's okay"" and I was obviously okay with that. But I was under the assumption, the reason she got high with this guy is because she was really sad about us not having fun. So my dumbass asked why she did get high, and asked if she did it because she was sad, and she said ""no I did it because it was fun, do I need to be sad to have fun"" and it just threw a wrench into things again. 

On the way back to my house I told her I was sorry that I had brought it up, and that we had a good day, and still seemed a little disgruntled about all of it. I told her that I trust her that she will be safe (even though it really doesn't seem like a safe situation to me) and I told her it's just me being anxious. 

So what do I do. I've already told her it makes me really anxious, and whenever she does it I'm always super anxious, and can't even sleep. But she keeps doing it. I thought if we had fixed things between us she just wouldn't do it anymore. But that doesn't seem to be the case.

My brother and son will be pissed off if I just refuse to go. I've considered making up a story about my oldest cat being sick, so we could go home early. I just hate to lie, especially to my kid. Please don't tell me to sack up and tell my brother I can't go. After years of rocky relations, we are finally getting along. I don't want to start a dispute.

604,"A few days ago, I was at my local ComicCon and saw a booth with posters of sheet music and characters from various media sources. I thought they were cool, but I told my friend that I would only get one if the sheet music was the real one from the show. The vendor insisted it was the real music from the show, and naively, I didnt go online and check.

After getting home, I realized that something looked off about it. I plugged in the notes to a music-making website only to get out random gibberish. I feel like an idiot for being scammed, and want to see if I can get an exchange for a correct one (if he has them) or a refund. All I have is the map of the venue and a list of vendors.

Kind of the only friends I have besides a few others. I think the reason I have strong feelings for her is because we share such intimate moments with each other. We get drunk, just her and I. She comes to me for all her problems, even when it’s about her boyfriend (my best friend). We workout together sometimes. We sing and play guitar together. She’s one of those girls that is not only is outstandingly gorgeous on the outside but also ridiculously beautiful on the inside. Ever since I met her I have always had this type of feeling for her. 

I have always been able to control this feeling. I’ve been in a few other relationships so I’m definitely not all about her. But I think Recently it has been really strong. Maybe because they have been having tons of issues (verge on breaking up) and I feel so guilty and disgusted with myself but I can’t help it. Every time I see her. Everytime I’m with her. Just feels like everything is okay. Feels like home. I don’t know what to do because on one hand they love each other so much and they are both my best friends and especially the guy.

607,"I seem to have a hard time keeping a job for long without feeling completely exhausted in a short period of time. The work is either not challenging enough to stay engaged in, I finish tasks too quickly, or i just become exasperated with customer service interaction. I currently work at a front desk for a primary physician/urgent care. It was fine at first and I started taking on organization tasks and some billing help but now I dont want to do any of it. I have a hard time motivating myself get work done.

On top of that I just hate the patients (most of them anyway). Inget yelled at constantly for things I have no control over (i.e. medication refills, insurance authorization denials, doctors not answering them or giving them the answers they want, bills, etc. ) I've been here a little over a year and this job makes me so depressed.

I know I need to leave but I want to find a job that I can get into and not have this quick burnout happen. I have a tendency to jump jobs a lot and I'm tired of jumping so much because it effects pay and doesnt look good on resumes.

I dont have any idea how to find a job that can keep my attention. I have no active ambitions or passions due to depression I'm trying to work through but even when I do get that spark of inspiration it tends to die out quickly or I get ""paralyzed"" or too scared to commit to it.

609,"21F. About a month ago I started talking to my ex (23M) again. We hadn’t spoken or seen each other in a few years since he broke it off, but when we both got out of long term relationships in May somehow things began to rekindle. Now we’re seeing each other a few times a week, going on dates, communicating a lot; all things which didn’t occur often the first time around. 

We split because he felt like I didn’t know who he was, and I will say that talking to him again has revealed an entirely different side to him that he’s admitted he was too ashamed to share with me (“soft/nerdy” things, like reading a lot or liking anime [I’ve always been a big nerd so while I feel positively about all this coming to fruition, it feels strange that none of it ever came up before]). 

He says he “doesn’t plan on hurting me again” and has promised to be as transparent and communicative as possible, but he’s very charming and a great sweet talker, and with his past of being so easily disingenuous it’s hard to know if this is just one big rebound or if he really cares about me and has the same intentions I do.

I keep panicking over the fear of getting as invested as I was the first time we were together just to have my heart broken again. I have my guards up but I’m falling for him quickly. Should I trust all the things he’s been telling me or cut this short before it’s too late?

613,"Yesterday, my boyfriend (27 M) and I (20 F) went to a secret trip in Malibu, California to hang out at the beach. My mom wasn’t aware that I went, I lied and told her that I was going to school for an event. I couldn’t tell her that I’m hanging out with my boyfriend somewhere far mainly because she’s a textbook strict Asian (Filipino) mom and even just dating for me is hard already with her around. I’m an adult and I don’t need to tell her the truth, it’s up to me to disclose or not. Anyways, my boyfriend and I had to climb long stairs and a really slippery, sandy slope. The heat was too much, I was dehydrated, then I fainted and got 911’d in the nearest hospital in Malibu. Note that I’m not from Malibu, I live way further the area (I’m talking an hour drive) so I was freaking out when I got to the hospital and learned that they have the choice to get me admitted or not. Thankfully the doc told me I was good to go after the tests so my bf and I did. However I still needed to tell my mom that something happened health-wise because I have a history of fainting due to my Bigeminy (heart rhythm problem). So my bf met my mom for the first time and we both lied, saying I was at school when I fainted and got 911’d then I called my bf to give me a ride home since I don’t drive. My mom believed it and she was thankful for my bf that he drove me, and I basically got away with it. I can never tell her we went in Malibu. I will be so dead. Then I booked an appointment to my primary doc so that she can refer me to a cardiologist and now my mom is planning to come with me to the appointment, which I absolutely CAN’T because then she’d know the truth when I explain to the doc. I try to convince her that I will be okay, it’s not my first time going to the doc alone, but after knowing that I had a fainting episode again, my mom’s all “no way maybe you’ll faint again, I’ll come with you”. 

Please I need an advice on how to convince her not to go with me to the doc. And also I know it was a bad thing for me to lie but I’d be damned if my mom will always take control of my dating life when I’m already an adult so quit the judgments. Thank you.",13Aug2019,1

621," I go to Montclair State University in New Jersey and students like me who have a parent on the faculty or staff get 40% off tuition. But my parent was just told last week that this program is suspended. This is the message from the union-

""Earlier today, you received an email from HR putting you on notice that if you were anticipating applying for a Tuition Waiver or Reimbursement, you are to submit any applications by the Saturday, August 10 deadline--but that Montclair will cease processing all such applications, as they say the State has suspended these benefits pending the completion and ratification of a successor agreement.

The assertion that this is coming from the State is patently not true. This is something that the **Presidents** are doing simply because they can. Susan Cole is under no obligation to cancel this program during good faith negotiations. She can reinstate it at Montclair and can also encourage the Presidents of the other eight institutions in our sector to do the same. 

The officers of Local 1904 find this outrageous and will do what we can to get the administration to come to its senses. Many of you depend upon the University's support for the continuing education you are pursuing through these programs, and without that support may well delay the completion of your programs and end up with unexpected expenses amounting to financial hardships. The Local has already received a number of email messages expressing these concerns, and hears the justifiable anger that comes with them.""

The president's office is telling us that they have no control over the suspension of the 40% discount on tuition and that it is up to the state and governor but the Union has made it clear that the president's office is lying about lacking the funds for this program.

Is there anything I can do about this other than email the president and her minions complaining about this?",13Aug2019,1
622,"I work in a small, privately owned doctor's office. We have day, evening, and weekend hours, so there are 3 receptionists to cover all of these hours. I am one of them. There are about 7 other doctors who practice there, all but 2 of them are part time. My boss/the business owner is a complete nightmare. Everyone in the office hates him, including the other doctors. He treats everyone like they are incompetent, when it is really him who is. He dumps a stack of tasks on you and if they aren't done in an hour he will come back and lose his shit. It's like he just doesn't understand how time works, and that sometimes 1 task alone will take over an hour to complete!

None of this was an issue before he bought the business 4 years ago. We were always efficient, and barely any tasks slipped through the cracks. The past business owner wasn't even that great, but she was good at communicating what she wants and how she wants it to be prioritized. According to him, we miss half of the tasks he assigns. That's probably because he thinks of tasks, but only actually tells us about a few. Anytime we confront him about it, he yells and says we are the problem. That we just forgot that he told us to do. He won't listen to a word we say! The other doctors to this day still do not have issues with us getting stuff done for them, it is just him.

We (the receptionists) are all on our last straw with him. We don't want to abandon the business, because it has been such a fantastic place to work up until about a year ago. We know he is super stressed right now because the business is going through a very tough financial time. (Our billing manager is well past retirement age, we believe there may be some memory loss starting. On top of that, he started making her manage the office AND do receptionist work, so that he wouldn't have to hire an office manager or another receptionist. Billing is over a year behind, we are not going to get paid for half of the work that has been done. He is running the business to the ground) But him being stressed because of stupid decisions he made is no excuse for the way he treats us.

We have tried forcing him to slow down as he watches us write the tasks as he says them. But then he just accuses us of not writing all of the tasks down! He claims he said something quick in passing that we must've forgotten to write. The other doctors have witnessed it firsthand and commented on it to us. They've tried to speak to him about it too, but he won't listen and continues to blame it all on us being incompetent and/or lazy. Our final idea is to have him write down a list and hand it to us, but his handwriting is beyond difficult to read and he says he just doesn't have time to do it. 

Should we just jump ship now, or is there some sort of communication system that we are just not thinking of?",13Aug2019,1
624,"Hello! I currently work as an assistant manager making 11.25 an hour but in 2 months my yearly check will be here and the higher ups assured me I'll be getting a raise to 12 or higher.

The other  option would be apprenticing and learning the Bench Jeweler trade. I  really like this option as working with my hands would be fantastic.  However the reason I am leaving my job now is that driving is becoming  more and more difficult and I don't want this to end up the same way  with having to leave.

My brother has very stiff motor skills, hyper activity, hallucinations (when meds aren't taken) and behavioral difficulties, especially when it comes to social settings (where he grows extremely loud and hyperactive). Some doctors describe him as being: a child in a man's body. It is not like Aspergers or mild autism cases, his is actually pretty advanced.

He's 22 and started becoming very vocal about his desire to find a woman he wants to kiss, make love to and have children with, etc... when he first told me, I was surprised he even knew these things or wanted them, but then quickly remembered he was still a grown man with biological desires, just like every other man.

Thing is though, I'm not entirely sure he can find a woman that's good for him, or a woman at all, or if he could even have any kids. I tried letting him down easy, by telling him not to focus on women but rather on getting a job and being educated, but he got pretty angry at me. I'm just worried he'll get really sad once he's 30 and still single. 

Am I wrong to think this way? Should I just let him have his fantasies without interfering? Or have more faith in his ability to find a match?

So here's a quick background of what happened.
I got a job at this busy restaurant and worked there for a month everything was fine but then I  broke my foot ( not while working). So naturally I couldn't work for 7 weeks and I'm about to go tomorrow and let them know that I can start next week since I finally got my aircast off.

I'll try and keep this as short as I can.

I'm 25, a timid and cautious guy who spent the majority of my life in my shell. This has changed some recently - I tackled the job interview phobia, took my first interview and actually got my dream job. That alone, plus the responsibilites of the job, have pushed me outside of my comfort zone many times and I'm definitely making progress. It's been a huge step for me.

Onto the 'problem'. A long distance person I've been chatting with online for 2 years is visiting my country. She will be in London and I'll be in Manchester. She wants to meet up for a day....and to be more than friends for a night. Sounds good right? Well, I've never travelled any further than the neighbouring city on my own, and I've never had sex before either.

Natrually, I'm worrying about travelling, finding my way, meeting her, hanging with her and holding conversation. Worrying that I wont be/look like how she imagined (shes seen photos, social media). And obviously worrying about the sex part too - but I dont want to mention I'm a virgin, that would change the situation quite a bit.

I've always been a worrier, but usually things turn out okay. Do you think in this case it could be similar? Or is this too much of a leap outside of my comfort zone.

Well a few text messages later he asks me what I want that I can’t financially afford.. I tell him I want my bills to be paid off so I can become financially stable. I’m a straight up honest person, I don’t like to be played with so I don’t play games with people. 


Well he gives me “his” I’m saying his in like that cause idk if it’s his or not anymore 🤦🏼‍♀️

He gave me “his” bank info account number routing number the name of the bank etc. He told me to pay off my credit card. So 485.15$ later my credit card is paid. 

Well today the card finally had a balance because the payment posted. I told him thank you because why wouldn’t I? Well he says how much can you get out in a cash advance.. I say 500$ because that’s what my app told me. It ended up only being 400$ when I got to the ATM after he told me to pull it out. 


Well I told him I got it said thank you and he said. I need to ask a favor of you now.. he then goes and says “ I need you to go to the nearest western union and send my agent money for software I need” I’m not dumb dumb I just act it.. so now I’m like huh? LMAO how you gonna give me money but make me give it to someone else...


So I’m feeling scammed.. I confront him and he says I don’t need to send all the money and not to worry because the credit card payments will be coming steadily..

So I’m like why don’t you just pay my car payment and I can send the money so I can still have something for myself you know? I don’t wanna be fucked.. because bitch a cash advance interest be big af and I don’t have that kinda money or I wouldn’t be out here looking for some sugar you know? 


Well this man said go ahead pay off your car payment. He’s not being rude or anything but I’ve also NEVER given him anything sexual or spoke sexual to him he’s never even asked for anything like that.... so am I being scammed?!!

649,"Hello everyone,

I finished studying physics 4-5 months ago and have been looking for job opportunities. I found this one amazing company and applied for a job opening. Soon I got a reply that because of the sheer volume of applications they can't consider me for this position any longer.  


Through sheer luck I found out that a distant friend of my parents has already been working in that company for the last 2-3 years. I arranged a meeting and she told me that the company is still looking but for other positions. So I applied again, this time for another position, got invited and interviewed.  


I prepared myself very well. 1 week full on studying like for an exam. I'd say I knew more about the field and the company than the average applicant and my (inside) friend told me that I left overall a good impression. But sadly I **did not get the job** as there are many PhDs also applying for same positions so it is tough. I was very sad.  


Either way the same friend then offered me to do a 2 month internship in said company to kind of get a feel for it and meet the people. I started last monday.   


I love everything, the people, the atmosphere and the field. I want to stay. My friend is currently my supervisor and trying to help me. Today (the friend) talked to **his** boss about me and my future in said company. 

  
The boss said that he can't say anything for sure now, because the **talks** about how many new people will be hired start in september (1 month from now).  
It is 100% that they are going to need new people soon, but how likely it is that **I** will get one of these jobs - no one knows. As soon as the new jobs will be listed on the homepage, hundreds of new applications will roll in and will have to compete yet again.....which I am ready to do, but also afraid.  


My question overall is: How can I maximize my chances to obtain one of the incoming job openings? I will be there 7 more weeks, how should I spend them to ensure a good outcome? I want to extract the best possible advantage out of my internship there. How can I do it?",13Aug2019,1

652,"(this is at a work environment and we all work together) So around the ending of last year, me (M20) and my former manager started dating discreetly. My coworker (F21) (we’ll call her Anne)... who is in the same level and position as me, went out to upper management to try and get us into trouble after we kinda trusted her. She went to all different managers although it did come back to us, we did not get in trouble. Well a couple of weeks after that another coworker from another department confessed to me that she has been or hooked up with Anne’s boyfriend. Me, not wanting to cause any problems kept this a secret as she told me to, and did not tell anyone. Now, a few months later, me and Anne have dropped all of our drama and have been getting close as friends to even trying to go to lunch together everyday and hanging out outside of work. It’s like we’re closer than me and the coworker that confessed that to me. Well now I don’t know what to do about the whole situation on Anne’s boyfriend cheating on her. I feel that if I tell her, it would ruin my other friendships and would just stir up drama again. But I feel that if I don’t tell her and she finds out otherwise, i would be a bad friend and she would be hurt with me.

654,"As the title suggests, I want to drop out of high school. I just really don’t get the point of studying things I don’t care about then a couple semesters later relearning the same exact topic.

This isn’t about not wanting to learn, trust me I do, but I’d rather spend ten hours actually learning something of use to me such as geometry and chemistry at my own pace and putting it into practice without being judged by how much faster my peers can learn it and how much they can cram a few days before a test compared to me.

I do online school too so I don’t even get the social benefits, work gives me that, and I’ve honestly learned a lot more useful things speaking to my coworkers than anything I’ve learned beyond third grade.

I want to do this but I also don’t want to fuck anything up. I don’t plan on being a doctor or chemist or anything, if I dropped out I would actually like to study programming and engineering but I don’t know if you need a high school diploma on record to do these things or just proof of skill.

I’d just much rather spend ten hours a day deep diving into programming, code, geometry, and chemistry without all the “fluff” that they have to mix in to meet arbitrary and outdated schooling standards that punishes students who struggle by blaming them for the lack of school funding instead of providing that funding to those students who clearly need it, and end of the year milestone assessments that mean nothing as far as the student is concerned when they’re class grades are actually far more important.

I just want to actually learn, to take important stuff into my brain and have it provide me practical use in life. Not barf up answers to things that will only be relevant for the school year and be yet another adult laughing about how they forgot everything they learned in high school. 

Should I drop out or should I just grind through with teeth grit for another three years and then go off to study. I guess really what I’m wondering is is if graduating high school really is THAT important?",13Aug2019,2

659,"Okay, so my cousin and I have been hanging out since I was 14. He's 10 years older than me. He was like a father I never had. I hanged out with him everyday and he did everything for me. He also would always protect me. Our relationship was always good until a few months ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing. My cousin has always had problems. Me and him had depression. I've had it for longer than him. That's not the only thing though. He's the kind of person that only cares about himself with me as the exception. He's also the type of person to use money to buy friendships and all that. He's pretty much so damn self centered. Likes to show off and all that. To most that would be annoying but I got used to it and accepted him for who he is. Oh and he also has no manners at all. He's disrespectful to everyone around him. Except for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

First off, my cousin is an alcoholic and drug addict. I've ALWAYS been there for my cousin. Through his depression, his divorce, when he was homeless and I gave him a place to stay, his breakup with another girl he loved dearly, when he was very ill. But he was never really there for me. Yeah we hanged out a lot and he protected me a lot. But whenever I was going through shit like my mom dying, my breakup with the girl I was going to marry, my depression, my suicide attempts and more. He would put me down though. For example when I was going through my break up. I was in a very low point in my life. He would constantly call me a pussy and a bitch for being sad about it. When I attempted suicide he would do the same. But again I put up with him because I know he's mentally ill and I understand how it feels like to go through all of that. He only started acting this way towards me this year. Most likely because he was going through a breakup like me at the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

He also kinda stopped caring about my life. He would put my life at risk a lot. This year only. When we hung out he would get drunk. And force me to go with him somewhere while he's driving drunk. I couldn't tell you how many times he almost killed us for driving drunk. I would try my best to stop him and offer for me to drive instead. But then he would really aggressive with me and say things like ""I don't care if we die"".  He would always try to pick a fight with other people for his own ego. He always tried to prove something that doesn't exist. I also hated the way he treated girls. He would curse them out and hit them. I tried to tell him how's that wrong but again. He wouldn't listen.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what happened the last time I decided to cut him out of my life. We both pretty much started going through a breakup at the exact same time. So we started being there for each other. We were both depressed but again I was depressed WAY longer than him. His depression was still somewhat new to him. So I was better able to control my emotions and thoughts while going through the breakup. Him on the other hand couldn't do that. No big deal. I was still there for him. Like a lot. I pretty much decided to help him more than help myself even though I was depressed. I would literally hang out with him for the next 7 weeks on Friday, Sat and Sun. Non stop. Like legit every single hour of that day. That's how much I cared about him and wanted to be there for him. Didn't matter if I was sick, going through shit, had responsibilities. I still decided to be there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the end of the 7 weeks. We decided we were going to keep on hanging out. Heading into the eight week. And this is when everything started going downhill. On Sunday I told him ahead of time that I'm going to hang out with my brother for a bit for like two hours and then I'll go meet up with him. The reason why I wanted to hangout with my brother is because he's my bro and I love him and he was going to move away soon so I was going to stop seeing him for a long time. So I wanted to hang out with him. My cousin got extremely pissed at this. Like real pissed. When I came back from hanging out with my bro. He saw us and immediately started yelling at us. Calling us bitches, fake and pussies. So we ignored him cuz we didn't want to start shit. I went into my brothers house to hang for a bit. Then he came banging on his door calling us out saying that he wants to fight us. He said the worst things possible to us. My cousin is very damn successful. He's rich. And he was going to get me a job in his company. I was so excited for this because it really was going to turn my life around. I was financially struggling big time to the point where I attempted suicide because of how much debt I was in. I need a miracle to happen and he was going to offer me that miracle. But since he was mad that I hanged out with my brother for 3 hours only. Even though I hanged out with my cousin for the past 7 weeks he pretty much told me all of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Fuck you. You can forget about the job I was going to offer you. I'm not giving it to you anymore. You're 86'd. I don't want you texting me again. Don't ever call me again. Don't ever do anything again. You're a bitch and a pussy. All you do is use me for my money (even though I never asked him to buy me things or asked for money once in my entire damn life). You're a freeloader (again, nothing I did for him to say this. I was never a freeloader). I honestly hope you kill yourself. See if I give a fuck. You're dead to me. You haven't been there for me at all these past few months. Go fuck yourself"" He said this knowing that I'm suicidal and just attempted suicide two weeks before that. He then turned to my brother and said ""I hope you kill yourself. I'm going to kill all of your family and set their houses on fire"" This is when I got pissed and said ""you're a fucking hypocrite"". So he turned to me and punched me in the face. That's when everyone stepped in and stopped what could've been a worse fight. After that he decided to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

Two days later he texted my brother and I saying he's sorry. Except it wasn't really an apology. It was him practically saying ""I'm sorry that happened but tbh it would've never happened if you guys just decided to hang out with me. So its your fault not mine"". He honestly sees nothing he did was wrong. So this is when I decided to cut him out of my life. I didn't text him back or anything. I haven't talked to him since. This was 3 months ago. He tried contacting me 3 times. Usually though text but all he would say is either ""hey"", ""I miss you"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I should forgive him or not. He's an extremely toxic person that never learns from his mistakes even though he's made a LOT. I know he's still the same person he was 3 months ago. I know if I forgive him that there's going to be a chance he'll do it again and even if he didn't he's still a toxic person in general. I just don't know what to do. I want to forgive him because he's my cousin and I love him. But I also don't want to forgive him because I know he's going to be a bad influence in my life. Which I don't want because my life couldn't be any better right now. I really turned my life around. I cured my depression of 10 years. I've never been so happy in life. And I'm scared all of that is going to be taken away from me if I forgive him and start talking to him again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do. Should I forgive and forget? Or just let go? 

&amp;#x200B;

660,"So my mom started working at this antiques restoration store 3 years ago and started with $645 a month. That same year she got a raise and now makes $710 a month. Since then she's adopted the work of her boss's wife which includes:
- basically becoming a personal assistant for her. She's constantly telling my mother to do something (menial things that she could do herself but prefers to have other people do; the other day she phoned her to ask if she could do some decision on a calculator, my mom told her that she has a calculator on her phone but she didn't listen.) And it's getting in the way of her actual work she's getting payed to do

- My mom's running 5 Airbnb rooms for her because ""she's busy and someone has to do it"". 
- Do the boss's wife's work after hours and sometimes have to come back to work to figure things out because the wife is drinking/out doing shopping

- She was supposed to come in every second Saturday to do her actual boss's work but now just comes in to do the wife's work

The worst part, my mom gets payed $10-25 every now and again for this work
She's constantly asked her boss to talk to his wife and tell her to lay off but she doesn't. Now all she asks is another raise, but her boss refuses. She said that ""If she could get Saturdays off she'd appreciate it"" but he still refuses. She's begged and pleaded for months now but he doesn't budge, saying ""she's white so she doesn't need one"". Other times he'd either ignore her or say ""Stop with your foolishness.""
I've been told that the other workers gets a $10 raise a week so they can get a taxi home because they can't drive. My mom's asked for gas money because her boss would often use her car when he can't use his and doesn't pay for gas but he still refuses.
Even though he's expressed time and time again how much he loves working with her and couldn't imagine the business without her, he still refuses to give her one simple raise.
Both me and the rest of my family hates seeing her do work after hours without pay and I feel like the way she's getting treated is more than unfair.

Do you think she deserves a raise?

663,"Kind of a long story here and all of it is relevant.  

We've been renting the smaller side of a duplex property.  On our own accord, we have been using a small storage room, directly adjacent to the master bedroom, as an extra bedroom.  Also adjacent to the master bedroom was a secondary storage room that my dad built after the fact, which we'd been using as an actual storage room and had lots of our belongings inside.   Most of it is our clothes, houseware, and some old electronics.

A city inspector came by and raised some flags, telling us that there needed to be some changes made to the extra  bedroom if we wanted to keep using it as a bedroom, which were that a window had to be installed into the wall facing the outside, and a knee-high concrete step leading into that room had to be removed so that it would just be a regular doorway.  We also needed to provide some kind of plan or blueprint for the secondary storage room as it was not in the original blue print for the property.   


The landlord agreed to make the extra bedroom conform to code, and they sent their son-in-law to do the job.  He cut the window without issue besides leaving behind a big mess.  He came to cut the concrete while we were away and this is where he fucked up royally.  What ended up happening is the concrete dust from the cutting flew everywhere and completely caked white the entire master bedroom and secondary storage, including all of our property inside it at the time, basically making it uninhabitable.  A pro contractor was contacted for the cleanup, came to look at the end result and said it looked like he did not follow any standard room preparation procedure for the job, and we can consider any belongings inside to be destroyed.  

After a talk with the landlord, they agreed to let us move into the bigger side of the duplex for below market value, in addition to one month of rent removed but over a period of one year.    In my opinion, the new place still needs additional renovation having been recently vacated, but they claim to be finished.

668,"A little context, My ex and I were together for nearly 3 years and were engaged to be married this fall. She suffers with diagnosed PTSD from childhood trauma, which has always made relationships difficult for her. I was her longest, and most serious relationship and she mine. She broke up with me in April after moving out of state to live at home again. It was a devastating blow to say the least; but I was understanding at first. She had told me she needed to fix herself and couldn't in a relationship. She made it seem she wanted to only take a break type thing. But slowly seemed less sure of what she wanted. Being heart broke, I stopped communicating with her early June. Fast forward to about a week ago, she starts texting me again. The last time we had texted she had seemed cold and distant from me. Now she is very interested in my life, telling me how proud she is of my accomplishments. She mentioned how much she really missed me, and couldn't wait to see me, etc. Still having feelings for her, I eventually asked her if she was seeing anyone. She replied with: ""yeah Casually, I didn't want to tell you, but I am."" Followed with ""I don't want to hurt you."" Anyone I told her that's fine and I hoped she was well. We've texted a lot this last week, and she always is super friendly towards me, and she still seeks my words of comfort. Anyway last night I had an emotional breakdown, FYI I was possibly going to move near where she lived unexpectedly to help family, but decided against it. Here is the text I sent her, followed by her response:

Me: Hey, so it seems I may not be moving to Vegas after all. Sadly it's probably for the best. Being blunt, I still have feelings for you and love you very much. And It seems you no longer feel that way. So maybe it's better this way? I do miss you a lot, and I hope you know I'm only a sarcastic asshole to you because of that. If you ever come up to Utah and want to visit  let me know. As far as your belongings go, I can either hold on to them, mail them to you, or give them to your brother, whatever works. But I do wish you the best in everything. And I really am sorry it didn't work out between us, I only ever had the best intentions for us in my heart.

Her: Oh why aren't you moving? And I'm sorry that I couldn't be a better girlfriend and I couldn't make it work, and I wish I could do better by you. And I'll see when we're coming up next so I can hopefully come get them and see you.

I know I'm an idiot for loving her still, but I honestly thought I was going to marry her. She still sends me mixed signals, and is overly friendly towards me. How can I word a text to her explaining that I love her, but I can't be her friend? And that if she's going to reach out to me, to only do so if she wants to admit she messed up, and that she wants me as more than a friend? Thank you for reading this insanely long post.

669,"Try to make this short as possible.

I hired my very first escort. Was not virgin! It’s just that I felt like getting laid without going on dates or something and this escort looked like my body type on the ad. So I hired her and I went to her place Saturday. 

And man it was not what I was expecting. I was scared for my life. She told me to park in her park lot, then she locked me in there with the gate. She had a “cousin of hers” with her talking about something. Told me to give her $20 so she give it to him. Guy looked like a gang member or something. This girl was very aggressive and not nice at all. We went to her house and it was a messy hellhole. Dirty dishes and blankets all over the place. Smell dirty. We got to her room. And all she was doing was on her phone talking to potential clients. One guy called angry about something and then started to tell him off real bad. Next thing I know she pulls out a GLOCK out of the mattress and places in some other bed in the room. She tells me to do whatever I want with her, whiles she’s one the phone. 

My plan was to go full hour but a minute in there I knew I just wanted a quick visit. Why didn’t I just leave? Cause I was scared fucking shitless. This girl was aggressive and appeared like she needed the money. Her cousin was out and about the house, not sure for what. She was kind of an asshole to me. Was just all very horrible. Plus the fucking glock. All I did was suck her tits, and also, I fucked her with a condom on missionary. Like I REALLY wanted to get out of there. I had sex with her out of nothing but pure FEAR. My erection was like 60-70%. Not to mention so her pussy didn’t exactly smell good. So that’s all I did titty sucking, missionary, and a bit of light kissing. 

Man and sure enough I get out of her room and there’s this Mr. Clean looking buff motherfucker watching Joe fucking Rogan on TV while smoking weed or something. When she opened the gate I got out of there as quick as possible and I have never been more relieved ever in my life. Never. Again. 

I’ve no doubt she has to have some STD. I’m afraid HIV. Because it seems like this girl is being bang consistently. She was getting LOTS of messages while I was there for like 10 minutes. Whether or not she uses condoms on other clients who knows. Maybe not. 

I DID use a condom by the way. But Jesus I’m terrified anyway. They say HIV is much more contagious when first caught. This girl it seemed just started doing this. She had told me before I sucked her tits “don’t suck too hard cause I just had a baby 4 months ago”. Her first ad was in late May... 

My fear is I banged this girl while just gotten HIV or something. What do you all think? Like I said all I did was titty sucking, light kissing, and missionary WITH condom. As far as I know I don’t think I had any cuts anywhere on my body, or my mouth.

I ask because I have multiple tinder dates lined this week but in case I end up having sex, I didn’t want infect anybody. Thinking about canceling all of them. Till I get test results. Which I won’t be able to do for another 9 days.

I fall for them but surprise surprise, they fall out of love with me. They want someone else or no one. 

I have never been loved back the same way I love them. I always love more.

I have an eating disorder too, I have this rationality that if I get skinny I will find a long lasting boyfriend. No boy wants to put up with my thic body, this long. I did the natural makeup thing, I did the cake face. I wear casual, or I’ll wear something revealing. I’ve done everything but nothing ever makes them want to stay.

If I don’t kiss them on the first date I’m a prude or frigid. So I kiss of course. 

The dates last maybe 4 times before, the guy breaks up with me.

I don’t get it? I feel like I have to turn into a clown and start dishing jokes out, maybe I’m not funny enough? Maybe my personality is drab. I’m clumsy, I make silly mistakes, I’m a little ditsy.

First, my older sister. They are as bitchy as they are brain dead. They think im hopeless but ive seen more common sense from a toaster oven.   


Next are my parents. I respect my dad for making a great living, and we have a really nice home because of him, but fucking shoot me if he is not the most useless motherfucker on earth. The man cant seem to remember anything, its so bad that im honestly surprised he remembers to put on pants everyday. All he ever does is fish and talk about fishing when he is not fucking my cunt of a mother.  
Now my mother is most definitely queen bitch at our house, and where she gets off i have no idea. She doesnt clean, she doesnt grocery shop, and she doesnt cook. We end up ordering pizza more nights then not. Im not sure when it started, but im sure she hates me considering she treats me like a disease most days.  


I have this cousin, and the poor kid is just a mess. He has wet the bed everyday since i could remember. His parents have taken him to several doctors and therapists but nothing has worked, the little bastard just refuses to pee in a toilet past 9 oclock.  


The cream of the crop, though, is my older brother. This asshole is like your stereotypical school bully except this one lives with me. He eats everything in sight, sometimes on purpose just to annoy me. He thinks he is alpha because he had sex once, but the unlucky broad outweighed him. He and my other brother always get to do fun shit and they never include me, and my parents couldnt give a fuck.

681,"Hello, I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this. However, I'm at my wits end with this and I've tried talking to the landlord so my last resort is to mention the laws in my state. I need some advice regarding my situation. My landlord is an older man and when I signed the lease he said he maintains the yard so the renters don't have to. Nowhere in my lease does it say this but I appreciated him not expecting me to do it. Now here's where it goes south, I work 8-5 m-f and I often come home for my hour lunch, or I have vacations or I'm home for whatever reason. He is CONSTANTLY coming into the yard with his ""helpers"" and it's to the point where he is there when I get off work and he's blocking my parking space and the neighbors as well (its a duplex with a narrow driveway leading to the backyard where I park). 

I've asked him to give 24 hour notice in the hopes that having to be accountable for his time would deter him from coming so often. However, he sends a text saying something like ""I'll be out this week sometime"" and then comes for months during the summer. This is NOT accurate notice and his visits are becoming too frequent. I live in Oregon and the law states that while he may enter the premises, he may not do so frequently. It's becoming a serious nuisance and I can't move anywhere else right now because the rent is SLIGHTLY below average in the area and it is very close to my work. But I'm scared that if I bring up the Oregon law he will retaliate and I will be evicted for simply stating that I am allowed to enjoy my rented property without constant interference. I need advice as to how I should proceed with a landlord who is extremely oblivious to his behavior as well as how to get it across to him that I lawfully have a right to enjoy my house without him being outside everyday and without notice.

Anyway, I just graduated in May with a BA in Earth and Human Sciences (a combo of env. sciences and geography basically) with a 2.97 GPA. I'm wondering how my GPA would effect me going into a masters program? I really love academia and want to continue my education, but I'm feeling like this low GPA is going to hold me back from pursuing what I really want. I would like to obtain a Masters in Geography, Ecology, or Urban and Regional Planning, but many masters programs explicitly state they discourage anyone from applying who has below a 3.0 GPA. I'm also a little bit older than your typical undergrad graduate (going to be 28 in a few days). If I'm going to start this I want to start sooner rather than later as I'm not getting any younger and already feel like I'm lagging behind others my age who are pursuing or have a PhD. I'm also in Denver, Colorado if that gives you any insight on other individuals I would be competing against in this area.

This friend is 26 years old and he is stuck. 
He is a great guy but he's life right now is going nowhere and I can sense that depression is right around the corner if not already there. 
He studies but he doesn't really like what he studies and not only that but he is already 8 years into what he is studying and there is no end in sight, at least for the next 3-4 years. 
As for his personal life, he is stuck as well. He is really emotional and when a girl rejects him, he sees it as another failure and gets really disappointed. 
Whenever he thinks of doing something then  he either doesn't do it or gives up really fast because he sees no progress or at least the progress that he wants.
He lives in a village that offers almost nothing except ample free time (around 4000 inhabitants). Unfortunately he is surrounded by people that are not supportive/happy/understanding or just in a position to push him to do something.

I want to know if there is something i can do to help him, because i really try to suggest stuff and listen but it doesn't seem to improve things and on top of that i am going to be leaving the city next week and not see him until Christmas.

684,"I’m a 19 year old female- and I have pretty much no friends. 

I do have a boyfriend and he’s really my only social outlet. I know me depending on him for that isn’t good for our relationship- and I feel like there’s only so much of that a boyfriend can provide and I really need some girlfriends to hang out with. 

I do have one friend that I’ve had since middle school- but we’ve always had a bit of a complicated friendship, and she’s really drifted away from me the past year or so and it’s been occurring to me; without her I don’t have a single friend. And it feels like I don’t even have her anymore.

Not a single person to go hang out with on a Friday night and nobody to vent to for support. 

I never have had much luck throughout my life making friends. A lot of it is due to my shyness. When I was younger (and even now) I never felt like I was able to really get close to any of my school acquaintances because my mom didn’t have transportation and I was embarrassed for friends to see my house because it’s so small and dumpy and my mom never cleaned the house well. 

I do still live at home so that’s still an issue. I know a true friend wouldn’t judge me for that but I don’t want to feel embarrassed like that. 

I don’t have a car or drive so that makes things harder (although I’m trying to learn I just don’t have a car to practice on much) 

I don’t know- it just mostly seems like I don’t know how to go about making friends. 

I do work, so I thought maybe I’d make friends at work but I haven’t been able to find anyone at my job with very much in common with me- or build a close enough friendship to hang out outside of work. 

I go out in public and see all the girls my age with their girlfriends laughing and having fun and I feel so alone. I feel like I’m not good enough to be apart of something like that. 

I just feel so alone sometimes I want to go out and go to the pool and the mall and have fun But I hate always going alone it makes me feel like such a loser. 

I live in a city with not much to to do in it. All the girls I work with- just go out to the clubs and bars to have fun and I’m too young to do that anyways.

692,"Up until now, he's been in prison on child molestation charges (not me, I have some half sisters, never spoken with the one that accused him, the other reached out to me and I wish her happy holidays and such). So it's safe to say that I've never met, spoken, or really had much desire to talk to him. I honestly never thought that he'd be let out.

My mother gave me the entire case file and court documents to read, because she had them printed for me on my 18th birthday and the whole thing was just convoluted and confusing as all hell. I had mixed feelings about the whole thing. Some files suggest that the mother may have coached the little girl to say this about her father, but there was legitimate evidence of sexual abuse but they weren't sure it was him. It made me sick to my stomach to read and it's safe to say that my mother, who i currently live with, hates him and wants him no where near myself or any of our family. She hasn't a clue that I've spoken with one of my sisters, since she for some reason doesn't like them either and threatened to 'cut me off' (which, if I was financially stable would be a dream come true).

Anyways, my father sent me a message basically apologizing for not being tech savvy and then apologizing for any pain he might have caused me. He expressed that he wants a father/child relationship and that he was sorry he couldn't be there. I'm torn between talking to him, because to this day I honestly have no clue if he did any of that stuff, I hope that he was wrongfully convicted. I fear what kind of shit it would start if I DID start speaking with him in regards to my overly dramatic family. I also fear that if I DON'T talk to him now, it'll be too late by the time I'm ready. I don't want to jeopardize my college tuition being paid, since my mother is helping me pay it, and I have no doubt in my mind that she'd kick me to the curb. 

I've considered communicating with him through the sister that I do talk to and just saying like ""Hey I'm sorry that we haven't had a relationship either, but I'm not in a terribly good financial position right now and would like to wait a few years."" if I end up deciding to speak with him.

696,"  

I am not quite sure how to write out this issue, but I feel that looking at the issue directly is a good start. I want to befriend more individuals who have a similar interest to mine. I’m sure that this is a very common issue, so I’ll just go ahead and dive into the details. I apologize if I go on a small rant.

I wasn’t diagnosed with ADD until the second semester of my senior year. Due to my minds lack comprehension of my surroundings I always felt that I was dumbed down. Even though I had a constant need for learning, my mind was my greatest enemy. Either working at a rapid pace, allowing for numerous thoughts to flow through, or just going blank. Much of this changed when I finally started taking my medication. I became thrilled and I still am, but I have another issue altogether. It’s difficult to talk to my family and friends about my interest.

I appreciate my family and friends for what they give me in life, and I would not be the person I am today if not for them. Yet, I want to befriend more people who have similar interest to mine. Once I started college last year and began studying International Law, I have formed a strong need in continuing my search for information. When I am not at school, I often feel that my mind is paused due to my lacking a fulfilling conversation. On a more dire issue, I feel that my family does not take my career choice seriously. My mom is more than supportive and has no problems with my decisions because I am a very strong-willed and stubborn person, so I don’t crack easily. But others in my family seem to not understand what I’m doing. Mainly, there are issues with the school I picked because most of my family supports the school that is a rival to mine. I’m ok with the casual jokes they make about my school, but they tend to disregard my studies. I don’t bring up my minors or certificates because I feel braggy and extremely weird about it, but I have an International Law and Institutions major, a Japanese and Studio Art minor, as well as a Peace Corps Prep Certificate. I have noticed that by doing this it has taken a negative toll; my cousin goes to the school they love, and they are always asking them about their studies. It has led me to think that what I’m studying and the career I intend to pursue is rather useless or at least boring. A week or so ago I conversed with my grandma about what I want to do in the future, I have made it abundantly clear that I want to go to the Peace Corps when I graduate, after that I wasn’t too keen on going to law school so I’ve been thinking about taking the Foreign Service Exam and pursue a diplomatic career. I told her that money wasn’t important to me, I just want to get a job I seriously enjoy because I get bored very easily. She said that it wasn’t a very smart thing to do. I am only 20 and I know it can sound childish but I do not want to get married or have children, I am very adamant on this as I have felt that my life was already put on standby to the point that the anger I repressed has now turned into motivation to always do better and never settle.

I have befriended some in my classes, but I feel that they are uncomfortable discussing topics outside of class. There are even times where they make me uncomfortable because I like to talk about studies and statistics while theirs is more opinion-based. I see other classmates just openly talking about issues I’ve been curious about, but I can’t bring myself to openly walk up and slide into their conversation. Most of my friends and even my roommate has told me that I have a great work ethic, I’m sure it's because of my experience before I was diagnosed, and that I can consistently just buckle down and do homework. It’s weird because I don’t particularly do this on purpose, I just really enjoy doing homework. I even like to purchase texts that my professors recommend because I get beyond excited when learning new things. Instead of going out and partying like some of my friends, I get hyped thawing uncrustables sandwiches while watching documentaries, to where I’ll normally look up more information surrounding the topic so that I can have a good conversation about it.

I am curious about the type of advice I will be given because I’m sure that I am going to have to put on my big kid pants and gradually meet more people within my classes and school. Any advice would be appreciated because I feel like a boring student robot at times.",13Aug2019,1
697,"This might be kind of a long post, sorry.

Where I work, this girl was hired around September of last year. I immediately found her to be the most beautiful woman that I have ever seen in my life and started developing feelings for her. One day, her ""boyfriend"" came in to the store and she introduced me to him very quickly and I thought to myself, ""Well there goes that"", however things started to progress between us. She began flirting more with me and we started texting a lot, like constantly. I told her I had feelings for her and she told me she had feelings for me but she shouldn't because she was engaged. Still, things kept going and eventually, some stuff happened between us. I was trying to spend all of my time at work just to be near her. We hung out a little outside of work, I was taking her to class on the mornings I didn't have to work. She came with me to a very important doctors appointment. It was amazing.

Then one day, she stopped it all. She said she was happy with him and wanted to get married. It literally broke me. It's been just over 5 months since then and I am still not ok. She's getting married in 12 days.

Back in June, I was told that I was going to have to take a position where my father works. It wasn't a choice. I told her that maybe it was a good thing. Maybe I should leave. She didn't want me to. She was so physically upset when I told her about it. So far, I've managed to keep both jobs even though I don't know for how long I'll be able to do this.

When I told her about this other position, she asked me to make her a promise. She asked me that on the nights that she had to work and I wasn't working, that I would meet her at closing and help her do the garbage out front. She was worried that if I took this position at this other job, that we'd never see each other anymore.

Obviously, I'm still hung up on her, very much so. She's...I hate to even say this, she's moved on, I know she has, she has to if she's going through with the wedding.

Last night I sent her a really long text just telling her about my feelings of the whole situation, how I'm not ok, I'm hurt and trying to be better but I still care about her very deeply.

The promise...I know to most people, it sounds pretty dumb, maybe it is, it probably is, but to me, that promise means so much. So very much...We really haven't talked much at all today...She works tonight and I don't.

Do I keep this promise?

I feel like if I don't...that's it. I still have to work with her a handful of times before she leaves for her wedding, so I'll still see her, but the thought of breaking the promise hurts almost as much as knowing that she's going through with her wedding.

If I do keep the promise...it'll still hurt, but it'll give me a few more chances to see her on top the the times that I'll be working with her until she leaves.

I don't like breaking promises. I don't like hurting people...honestly, I don't want to break the promise, but I figured I'd ask.

Any suggestions?",13Aug2019,1
698,"I’ve always had this fantasy where one day I would just take off, leaving every family member and friend, and never returning. I’ve never ever really been “happy” in my life and I think the only chance I have is to attempt to let go over everything that doesn’t necessarily make me sad, but that which does not make me happy. My family is largely narcissistic, and the majority of the family exiled my immediate family about 15 years ago, so I don’t have anything holding me here in that regards (though I would keep in contact with my grandma and father but likely nobody else). As far as friends, Im relatively sure none of them care about me in the way that I have cared about them (I.e. always providing support during tough times and doing favors for a number of them, but never really seeing that care reciprocated). I never really felt like I was a “friend” and more of an object to speak too or to ask favors from. Also the few friends I have where I don’t have this issue are growing further apart as they are leading their lives how they want to which is great. But there’s not too much holding me back.

I’m going to be going to paramedic school in January which is about a two year course, though I would be cool with receiving the education at a different geographical location if it’s cheaper (living in Boston rn). I do have a car that I own, and minor possessions. I don’t have any idea where I would like to live but preferably somewhere wide open with less people. I’ll be a certified EMT in about a week so I think no matter where I go I’ll be able to find decent steady work. 

My questions I have that I would like some advice on:
-am I an asshole for wanting to do this at all, and am I an even larger asshole for starting to think about the logistics?
-what locations have the best cost of living to wage ratio? EMT isn’t an extremely well paying job but I know some areas do have better pay. I’d likely have to take a certification in that state but it’s cheaper than paying to go to school again.
-should I tell anyone or just take off one day? I wouldn’t want anyone to think I killed myself and nobody could find my body but I’m also not super comfortable with anyone knowing where I’m going or why I’m leaving. I definitely won’t want someone to eventually report me missing because that could lead to issues down the road.",13Aug2019,1
699,"My son an I recently took a trip to Mammoth Mountain 🏔 . We took four days off to ride mountain bikes. Mammoth has the best trails, lifts And has won many awards. It’s was a phenomenal Father-Son trip. The views, the food, the cabin we stayed in. Nothing was planned we just knew what we wanted to do. I mean we booked the room in advance an set up my bike rental an things like that. But it was a zero time constraint trip. Much different than the ones mom plans. Always a certain reservation or show to be at. Don’t get me wrong it’s wonderful but I come back more exhausted. My wife is the Queen when it comes to planning our Vacation. Never a down min enjoy our whole time. Anyways back to my point. We had the best time or I had the best time with my son. The adrenaline rush I’m still on is crazy. I recently turned 41 an have been feeling my age. An this trip has sparked a new life in me. It’s so awesome. So I told my son I want to buy a full suspension bike an start going to some closer spots. Making some smaller weekend trips! My son got the biggest grin across his face as I was showing him the new bike I want to have built for my frame. As his bike is custom to his 6’5” frame. Yeah my son is a big boy and only 16. 
        Now to my question. I really want to do this with my son. He is getting older an I no longer am as involved in his life like I was when he was in all the sports an school activities. Just him needing me for little things is slowly disappearing. He’s becoming a man. Maybe I’m having a mid life crisis? Who wants to ride a mountain bike down a 11,000 foot cliff? While dangerously dangling over the edge an staring death in the face an laughing at him? Crazy right? I just want to have this new experience with my son more often but don’t want to rush anything or intrude on something him An his friends usually do together. I don’t want to be that dad. You know? 
          I don’t know if my question even makes sense or if I’m actually asking a question or more for guidance? Any ways. I’m also the product of a broken home An didn’t have to much of a positive male role model to teach me how to be a father. So any help will be taken into consideration an thought out. Thank you all. If you ever get a wild hair An are somewhat agile try it! Downhills Mountain Biking 🚵 is beautiful, exhilarating,  peaceful, an a great way to bond with your kid. If you don’t fall. 😁",13Aug2019,1

707,"Lengthy story of the past 8 months or so coming so be prepared. 

I’ve always had a really strict mother, REALLY strict. She and my stepdad were both in the Marines and they’ve always been hard on me (first born here). They’ve always been super controlling. I didn’t have a phone until sophomore year of highschool, (aunts are the reason for that) but even so they’d always check it. They’ve always gave me no privacy, none whatsoever. Another thing is they have never gave me freedom. They have always had to know what I was doing, when I was doing it, who I was with, and couldn’t be home later than 10. But that’s only when they’d let me go out, which was a rare thing. This continued all the way until I left. I was a sophomore in college and still had to ask to go out and be back by 10. They were also super strict with relationships. I could not have a girlfriend (I snuck it) but this continued always. 

Anyways I wanted to go to a community college, but my mother forced a 4 year which I went to. But that didn’t go well at all, I flunked 2 classes in 2 separate semesters. So my mom was like if you don’t get A’a and B’s next semester she was gonna lock me down (kinda already was but more). I got 2 C’s and she made me switch to a community college,  change my major to her major (no matter how much I hated it) and took away my phone and all my devices.  She took control of my like at 19 years old. 

So I tried to do the decent thing, I told her I was going to move out. She flipped and her and my step dad basically said if you move out then don’t take any of your stuff or we’ll call the police. I got my shit and left in the night. We didn’t talk for weeks but eventually I formed a relationship with my mom again and we’re close. 

So anyways that’s kind of the story but here goes the moving in part. I lived with a friend for awhile in the same city but that didn’t work out and now I live in a city 1 hour away. I have a shitty car so I make the drive sometimes and stay with her but she said I could move back in. I wouldn’t have to work and she’d even get me a new car but she said there has to be some consequences for me leaving as an example to my brother and sister. She said I’d have to isolate myself for a couple of months and focus just on school. To not go out with friends, to focus on school and only school. It sounds great but I love my freedom, I love being able to go out when I want. But my mothers offer sounds like he smart choice. To get my associates, and then I’m free.

714,"I’m (20F) going to a local gaming convention with my younger brother (13M) in a few weeks and we’ve been openly talking about basic con etiquette since it’s his first year going. During the conversation the topic about being left unsupervised came up, which we haven’t talked about prior. My original plan was to have him with me at all times and we would both choose a certain amount of events each. He was puzzled and thought that I’d be leaving him alone in certain places to game and take part. 

I felt the conversation was getting awkward so I asked him to give me reasons why he thinks he should be allowed to hang around alone for some of the day. He stated that our mum and grandma lets him hang around their hometowns alone for a few hours at a time. Then said that he is responsible for someone his age (which is true). He also mentioned that we would both get to do whatever and can meet up or text each other for meals and events we both like. After that he asked for my reasons. I mentioned that there’s a difference between hanging around in towns where people know you and in a city event he’s never been to. Although the con community is 99% filled with awesome people who want to help each other and be friendly, I’m scared of that 1% that could do something to him. There’s also the fact that he’s alone, even if the rules state that anyone 13+ can go alone. I wouldn’t be as scared if there was one other kid his age with him, but he’d be alone unless he made friends there somehow. 

He made some valid points and I believe him. I do tend to be overprotective. I want to make this fun for him (and let him get away with a few little teenage things my parents aren’t pleased with lol), but I’m responsible for him while we’re there. What do you think?",13Aug2019,8

719,"Hey guys, so I'm almost finished my bachelor of science in biology with a minor in psychology and I'm reaching that existential crisis point in my life (for the umpteenth time). I love science and the degree that I chose, but I have no idea what I'm going to end up doing after I graduate because I don't feel overly driven to one career. 

For a bit of background, I'm the only person in my family who has ever gone to university; and I'm also funding school by myself (I mean with a crapload of student debt) because my family is unable to help me in any way. I've been a server year-round for the past 3+ years because it's the only job I think I'm qualified for that pays well enough to afford my bills, groceries, and anything extra. As a result, I have a very time-managed schedule consisting of class, work, studying, and sleep. Any spare time that I have I usually want to spend relaxing because it's always go-go-go for me and I need mental health breaks. 

When I started my degree I thought I wanted to pursue veterinary medicine, and then I had no clue what I wanted, and then I realized how much I love genetics and I switched my focus to becoming a genetic counsellor. Now that the time has come to consider prepping for a Master's application I'm starting to panic. I feel like not only do I have no clue what I want to do with my life, but that I'm also hardly qualified to do *anything*. I know a little bit about a lot - I love anatomy, I love genetics, I love helping people, I generally just love learning/knowing things - but I have no clue which field I actually want to apply myself in. I want to take a year off school to get my shit together, but that means I'll also have to serve full-time. I'm getting really tired of the service industry and it isn't doing anything for my future career. I'm not sure what entry-level jobs are available to a freshly graduated bio student, and I feel like I have next to no connections in the field of science. My peers have all taken the time to network with professors and do honours research projects, and I've only spoken to a handful of profs throughout my degree to help get me on the right track. 

Overall I find myself feeling disadvantaged. I have no confidence in myself within this profession - like if I try to even get a lab assistant job I'll get laughed at because I never did an honours project and I didn't spend my entire degree kissing professors asses - which contributes to my lack of motivation. I know I need to stop playing ""poor me,"" just fake it till I make it, and put myself out there or I'm never going to get anywhere; but finding that drive is really difficult for me when I have no support. 

I only have 2 courses left to finish my degree starting in September (both taught by the same prof, who has taught me before, so hopefully I can try to network with him in the meantime). Going forward, should I try to get an entry level position after I graduate and start weeding out what I do and don't find interesting? I've heard people suggest things like becoming a lab assistant, trying to work as a forensic lab tech, a pharmaceutical sales rep, etc, but I have no clue where to even begin with these. 

For anyone who's a post-grad, or anyone working in the field of science, how did you become so passionate and motivated to pursue your career? How did you get to where you are now? Can you offer any advice about what my next steps should be if I'm not 100% sure what field I want to end up in? All I know is I don't want to be a server forever. Please help!",13Aug2019,1

So over the years that I've been working I find it very hard to be an over achiever. I was never the teacher's pet in school and I've never been a favorite employee. I get my work done don't get me wrong; but I just stop there. Once the task in front of me is complete I consider my job done until the next task comes along. I've always hated this about myself because I'd like to be the first person that comes to my bosses mind when there is an important task that needs to be assigned to someone. But for some reason I can't get myself to find other work to do that isn't directly assigned to me once my direct work is complete. 

For reference: I work an office job as a receptionist/administrative personnel for an auto body shop. It is a small business so I do misc. tasks for my coworkers every day. I do a little bit of everything pretty much. Accounting, estimating, check in/out customers, update customers, sign for packages, check our supply inventory, communicate with the technicians, communicate with insurance companies, etc. the list goes on and on.

But for some reason my superiors make me feel like I hardly do any work. I suppose I do my tasks rather quickly? I'm not sure...I'd just like for them to see me doing some type of work for the entire work day instead of me using my free time as free time.

724,"Just a few minutes ago, my mother told me that I have to decide between staying in the school I am currently in and moving to another school. 

Some back story so I can get sound advice.

I'm 15 years old (about to turn 16) and I go to a prestigious high school in my country. One day, my driver was late to pick me up and the campus had emptied out. I was in the main ground near the basketball court (we have it outdoors here) to pick my bag up because after so long, the driver was finally at the gate. While there, some man grabbed me by my wrist and attempted to take my sweater off. This happened in February. I don't know how I escaped but I did. It was the first time in my life something like that had happened and that too in a school I have been going to since I was old enough to go to school. I was traumatized. I still am. 

I finally broke down and told my mother after three days. The next day, her and my father came to school and talked to the principal and section head. They checked the cameras (which were completely useless as they are not installed inside the school and only outside the gates) They 'promised' to help. 

The school started interrogating my two close friends whom I told this about. And asked questions like 'Is she influenced by movies?' They also asked my parents if I have any mental disorders. I have none. And other things like 'Is she an attention seeker?' The principal went as far as to ask me 'Are you lying?' 

They went as far as to accuse my friend's father whom I said hello to the very first day that day when he came to pick my friend up and they accused my brother as well (he went to college there. The campus has classes going from elementary, middle school, high school and college.) 

They would repeatedly ask me to narrate to them the event's unfolding on that day even though they had a written account. And they also took me to the place it happened and asked me all sorts of bs. In the end, the school did nothing, assumed I had mental issues and said that 'You should be glad nothing else happened.'

Though all this has obviously left me rattled, I still don't want to just walk out of this place. I have gone to this place since forever. I have so many friends here which I've had since fourth grade. I am truly confident here and feel like I actually belong here. And I feel happy when I get to tell the nicknames of certain places in the huge campus to the new comers. I know the secret places and the legend surrounding this school. 

On the other hand, I could really use the fresh start and not think about the bullshit administration of this school and the constant feeling that my teachers and principal hate me or see me as an attention seeker. 

The school my parents are thinking of getting me into is just as good if not better. But, I really don't know if I can make any friends and someone else I asked earlier said something like 'It's hard to adjust to new people and places in your age' so I'm really scared. I'm already so stressed about my academic future because I will be giving my CAIE's next year and I don't think I have the time to adjust to new things now when I should be studying like crazy. 

I have to decide by Friday and on Monday I'll be joining whichever school I will choose.

Please pardon my grammar - English is not my native language. 
 
 
I'm struggling quite a bit with stress and I'm never really able to relax properly. I just had a three-week vacation and without really doing anything for most of it I thought I'd be able to chill and relax for a bit, but I found my self in a constant state of anxiety and worrying.

Now I'm starting to feel my body aching all over, and I'm having a really hard time falling asleep at night despite being very tired, which in turn is making my anxiety even worse. I feel useless, hopeless and in a downward spiral. 
 


Some things I've tried involves being physically active for at least 30 minutes each day, staying out in the sun, lowering caffeine intake and drinking lots of water.
I've even tried mindfullness and breathing techniques, but I'm far too stressed to not be distracted with thoughts appearing, or even getting bored. I keep a journal of my day-to-day overall feelings, but so far (1,5 weeks) it seems like I'm just feeding the anxiety by having my emotions put down on paper. 
 

I've been deprived of sleep for days now, and I see no other option than to be put on wait for a psychologist - which will take several months where I live.
 

I know I should get on that list as it might be some undelying issues that's causing the stress (or at least talk to my doctor), but I'm wishing for some advice on how to manage it in the meantime.

Because I am always at work I've lost almost all general social connection with my family, same with what little friends I have, and when I am off work I don't feel comfortable because I don't even remember what to do with my  self when I'm not at work.
I can't quit my job because I'm half way to retirement basically, I honestly don't feel like I'm smart enough to get a new job, and I support some one close to me with prosthetic leg issues and terminal kidney failure.
I know this kinda sounds like a rant but I need advise on How to get back my life I feel like I've lost all control over, what can I do to re socialize my self when I am aloud to go home, what steps can I take feel like a human again I guess?

Ps sorry if this was a hard read I'm dyslexic and don't take this as a self pitty thing I'm just trying to lay down some context to my situation. :)",13Aug2019,2
731,"This is completely serious. I'm a straight male and I'm being harassed by these websites. 

I keep getting these texts from Jack'd and Grindr telling me that they've created a profile for me with nudes and that they're going to share everything with my other social media accounts, which I don't have any besides Reddit. One of them even texted me MY EXACT address saying they're going to send a dildo and other sex toys to my home. 

What should I do?",13Aug2019,1

733,"So basically, I’ve had this friend for two years, Online. We have always played games together and called etc, along with having random periods of time where we just don’t talk at all. 

Anyways, back in October  I got a new boyfriend and my friend knew that, but still continued to flirt with me. I never gave In to any of his flirting, I knew that’s just how he talked. Around December, my friend’s friend told me that he liked me a lot, but stopped because I had a boyfriend, which is understanding and I respect him for that. That semi “confession” caused a 3 months hiatus between my friend and I, which honestly did suck since I like talking to him. 

We started to talk again around March, which was when things started to go south with my boyfriend. Nothing terrible was happening, I just started to feel uncomfortable with him and just that I don’t like him anymore. 

Skip a little further to end of July. I haven’t talked to my boyfriend since the 4th of July, so at this point we aren’t really dating anymore. Here comes my friend, not knowing at all that me and my boyfriend were going through a weird time. My friend and I just started talking with each other regularly again, same old same old. 

Until he brings up his relationship problems (he got a girlfriend back in December) and he’s basically saying he still likes her but isn’t happy with her since she doesn’t compromise with him at all. Hearing that, I comfort him best I can since it sucks to be going through something like that. 

And then a few days ago, I got a text message from him saying that “this may make things awkward but I have feelings for you”

I responded by saying “thank you, but I don’t know what to say right now.” 

After that, we went back to being normal friends. 

So basically, I don’t know why he told me?? Does he want something to come out of it? Because he thinks I’m still with my boyfriend, and I know he’s still with his girlfriend so I don’t really know what he wants. Was it just to get it off his chest? He wouldn’t cheat on his girlfriend, I know that. 

So if anyone here knows his intent, please tell me because I’m pretty clueless when it comes to boys.

It was normal day, i was going back home from school and i was walking down the street. I see this very weird man with a camera on his neck, he was just leaning onto a pole. I needed to get to the underground and thought nothing of it. As i was opening the door to get underground, this man grabs me by the arm and takes a clear picture of my face. I said in confusion ""What the F*** dude?"" He just stood there silent, i tried to talk to him and ask him to delete the picture but he didn't answer.

745,"Sorry, this is very rambling and possibly hard to follow. 

I (24f) have been asked by my brother (18) to cosign for his student loans. He has a move in date for his dorm 15 days from today, and he is just now getting down to figuring things out. 

I am a nervous wreck over it. He has NO ONE else that can sign for him, and I know this so I don't feel that I can say no. But he was dual enrolled with this college during his senior year of HS, which I found out at the end of the year he had flunked at 14%. 

He has no concept of money, which is proven by the fact that he received 6 months SSI after turning 18, which added up to $4,200 in total, yet the month after his SSI ended he had to sell video games to pay his phone bill.

He owes $16k for classes alone, and also needs to pay for housing, wants to buy a car which means paying insurance. He is trying to take out a loan for $26k! I told him that he is reaching for far more than he needs to, and to only ask for $20k MAX. 

My biggest problem is that I know NOTHING about student loans. He said he is asking for more bc they give you less than what you ask for no matter what, so if he were to ask for 20k there's no way he'll get that. The advice I need is how to counsel him to make better choices and if there is any advice I can funnel to him, other options, etc. It was a Sallie Mae loan that is requiring a co-signer, will all other loans require one as well? Should he apply for more than one? My credit score is around 650, with an annual income of around 26,000, would we even be accepted for a loan of 20k? He has no income. 

I just do not trust him to be responsible, but feel like I have no choice. I would hate for him to not have the ability to go and make a better future based on my choice.",13Aug2019,1

748,"Let me jump straight into it. 

I am a pretty social guy, I love my family and my friends. I am not the type of guy who can sit around all day and do nothing, watching T.V and playing video games. I'll go crazy. I started off my summer like that looking for jobs but I couldn't find anything and started to go crazy myself. So I decided ok, I'll volunteer that way I get out of the house, I thought that would help but it doesn't. I still can't see friends, and I will explain why.

My friends and I, we like to go hangout and have a few beers. We don't get crazy drunk, but we often have to do this at parks and stuff. My parents aren't idiots, I'm 16 and they know when I go to the park I am not playing on the 'playground.' My parents are good, but they are a bit overprotective, especially my mom. We just end up having to do it at parks, and stuff where not many people go to so we don't get caught.  My mom is fine if I drink, she just doesn't want me to drink hard liquor (not a problem), not get shitfaced and she would PREFER if an adult was around and not do it at a park. 

The problem is though, none of us can go to any of our houses. No parents is going to allow their kid to drink while they're home. So I just don't know what to do, she tracks me so I can't lie about where I'm going (wouldn't want to anyways). I can't go out anyways because this whole situation just stresses me out and I can't even have a good time with friends, I just sit there worrying about fucking if my parents are gonna be mad at me for just doing what a teenage does.

My parents know my friends don't smoke, or vape. I do well in school (I get all 80's or 90's) and I am well-rounded. Like I genuinely don't know what to do because I am running out of excuses I can use on my friends for not hanging out and I really want to go out as-well. 

I know when I go to University in two years from now this is going to seem like a joke, that I was worrying about this. But this is still driving me nuts, I just want to go hangout with my friends, even if it's once every couple of weeks.",13Aug2019,1
749,"I'm laying in bed right now with a huge headache. Clenched jaw. Googling like crazy and can't stop thinking.

I grew up in a pretty great environment. Parents are happily married, took care of myself and siblings well. I still live with my parents (very close with them) and we have a great relationship.

School was great for me, as well as university. I was always seen as a top student and got great grades. I've been dating the same guy since 18 and we're both 23 now. Our relationship is stable and he is very respectful and kind.

I now have a decent job as a digital marketer. However, ever since I finished university, I think things went down for me mentally. I always had control over my grades and my success concerning studies. I just always stayed on top of work and studied hard and got great grades. Always got cheered on by family and friends and people always said that they were proud of me and I felt proud of myself...


Ever since I started working I feel like things have mentally gone downhill. It's like I'm trying to keep up with the image of being 'perfect' but I can't. It's not as easy as controlling my grades was. Life isn't easy. I feel like I'm constantly stressing about my future, how much money I'm supposed to earn, who I'm supposed to marry, whether I'm with the right person, am I in the right job, should I study again, should I stick to my job.

I'm trying so hard to control my future and forcing it to go as I plan but I know it's impossible to do That. And it makes me stress I even hate being on my own because then I start overthinking. I prefer being at work like really busy or being around people so that i don't over analyze my life...

I feel like I'm never living in the present moment, I'm always stressing about Something like I'm never really content with where I'm at.

If I'm not stressing about work, then I'm stressing about whether I'm going to stay with my current bf (of 5 years) cause I have a fear of it falling apart at 7 years and wasting time..

And if I'm not stressing about my relationship, I'm stressing about my career. And whether I want to do it for life.

I just keep overthinking why can't I just be content and calm for at least a week of my life. What can I do to stay in the present moment?

How do I stop myself from overthinking or trying to have control over everything that happens in my life?",13Aug2019,3
750," 

My dad is 67 and recently retired. He’s decided to spend his retirement traveling, and recently he’s been in Bogota, Colombia. He just told me that for the past 3 months, he’s been dating a woman he met there.

Here’s the catch: The woman is 23. I am also 23, so he’s dating someone the same age as his daughter. Also, the woman is a refugee from Venezuela, so she has very little money. The woman also speaks no English, and my dad speaks no Spanish, although he is trying to teach himself. My dad also told me that he has given her money to rent an apartment.

Despite all of these red flags, my dad seems to believe that he is in love. He refuses to accept that he is a sugar daddy, or even that the money he is giving her is playing any role in their relationship. He told me that she “melts into my arms whenever I see her” and that she “idolizes me.”

I tried to explain to him the many reasons why I think this relationship is problematic. I’ve told him that there is an enormous imbalance of power in this relationship, because of their different ages, nationalities, and socioeconomic statuses. I’ve told him that if a partner “idolizes” you, that in and of itself is a red flag - a romantic partner should be your equal, not see you as a God. I’ve told him that it might be dangerous for him to gain a reputation in Bogota as a rich generous old man. I’ve told him that it is extremely unlikely that this woman is also motivated only by emotions. 

My dad refuses to consider any of this. In fact, he wants me to come visit him and his girlfriend over Christmas. Before his relationship started, my dad and I had already been planning to go on vacation elsewhere, but now he’s saying that we can’t go anywhere because it’s unlikely that his girlfriend would be able to travel anywhere with a Venezuelan passport. He won’t go on vacation without her, even though they’ve only been dating for 3 months.

I’m hurt by the fact that he seems to value her feelings so much more than mine, but beyond that, I’m truly worried for his safety and I think he’s being taken advantage of. It would be one thing if he would acknowledge, “Yes, I am a sugar daddy, I give her money, she gives me sex, and that is what I want right now.” I would be able to accept that. But the fact that he seems so willfully ignorant of what is going on is very concerning to me.

When you are a kind of guy who is sensitive, quiet, weird, naive, it's not like you just have someone who bullies you: everyone in your life will treat you with a lack of respect or as if something is wrong with you.

After 24 years I still recall memories of things people said to me during childhood, the way they acted towards me and how they made me feel.

I also have never had a romantic relationship despite being good looking, and don't have a stable group of friends but just acquaintances here and there.

I'm being devoured by anger. I'm costantly breaking things, punching the wall and growling. Sometimes when I'm in my car I scream as loud as I can to express my anger.

This world decided that I have problems and I am wrong. Why are you quiet? Why do you walk around? Why are you alone? Why are you sad? Why do you this, why do you like that etc...

I am extremely insecure and I believe that literally everyone is superior to me for whatever reason. They don't have all of these problems, they are not judged. They are ok, they fit in the world, everything they do is right, whereas everything that I do is wrong.

They have competence and information.

I am extremely envious of most people, to the point I say absurd things like ""How dares that woman become that guy's girlfriend, so now he can go around thinking he's better than me?"" Also every success people have makes me burn with hatred.

I seem to hate everyone and am envious of them. A guy who smokes? What an a*****e, thinking he is better than me. And probably women love him because of that. And the same I think of guys who have tattoos, who dress decently, who are ripped, who are tall, who have a girlfriend...basically I find a reason to hate everyone.

My mother won't validate my feelings. Every time I complain to her about my insecurity, she seems to respond angrily.

I want to improve but I often feel submerged by my emotions and I want to destroy everything.

I am alone, thrown in this world where everyone, not having anything better to do, decided that I am not good.

I hate myself and am full of insecurities.

I can't park the car properly? Most people can, therefore I am worthless and they are superior to me.

I never had a relationship? Most people did, therefore I am worthless and they are superior to me.

I apply the same thiking to basically everything. I can't cook this meal, I haven't seen that movie, I haven't been to that place, I don't know the name of that flower, I don't know how to properly pour beer, I don't know how to properly paint a wall...I could go on for days.

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.


This is me if it helps:

764,"I work at a dentist office 
Today my ex came for her visit. It’s been 8 months since the breakup. 

I was in love with her like crazy. And when she broke it off for a month I acted insane trying to get her back till she started rubbing her new dating life in my face. She was dating her guy friend a week after we split. She we t into detail back then about their relationship. While I was wanting her back. 

We were best friends for years and dated for couple of months. It was a bad relationship. She was insecure and a bit controlling with any girl in my life. I was controlling with how she dealt with her ex. They were always around in some form.  And when we fought I would say mean words. It wasn’t a good relationship at all to say the least. 

But today I saw her and we talked about her appointment. We both were very friendly and asked how the other was. And at first I felt nervous but after that I felt relaxed. Like idk how to describe it. But like I didn’t feel like running to her and asking her to talk. I just felt comfy. 

It’s been a couple of hours and I’m starting to miss the relationship. Idk it’s a strange feeling. 

Is this normal?",13Aug2019,1

Does anyone know of any other event planning platforms that could work?!",13Aug2019,1
766,"My dad is 67 and recently retired. He’s decided to spend his retirement traveling, and recently he’s been in Bogota, Colombia. He just told me that for the past 3 months, he’s been dating a woman he met there.

Here’s the catch: The woman is 23. I am also 23, so he’s dating someone the same age as his daughter. Also, the woman is a refugee from Venezuela, so she has very little money. The woman also speaks no English, and my dad speaks no Spanish, although he is trying to teach himself. My dad also told me that he has given her money to rent an apartment.

Despite all of these red flags, my dad seems to believe that he is in love. He refuses to accept that he is a sugar daddy, or even that the money he is giving her is playing any role in their relationship. He told me that she “melts into my arms whenever I see her” and that she “idolizes me.”

I tried to explain to him the many reasons why I think this relationship is problematic. I’ve told him that there is an enormous imbalance of power in this relationship, because of their different ages, nationalities, and socioeconomic statuses. I’ve told him that if a partner “idolizes” you, that in and of itself is a red flag - a romantic partner should be your equal, not see you as a God. I’ve told him that it might be dangerous for him to gain a reputation in Bogota as a rich generous old man. I’ve told him that it is extremely unlikely that this woman is also motivated only by emotions. 

My dad refuses to consider any of this. In fact, he wants me to come visit him and his girlfriend over Christmas. Before his relationship started, my dad and I had already been planning to go on vacation elsewhere, but now he’s saying that we can’t go anywhere because it’s unlikely that his girlfriend would be able to travel anywhere with a Venezuelan passport. He won’t go on vacation without her, even though they’ve only been dating for 3 months.

I’m hurt by the fact that he seems to value her feelings so much more than mine, but beyond that, I’m truly worried for his safety and I think he’s being taken advantage of. It would be one thing if he would acknowledge, “Yes, I am a sugar daddy, I give her money, she gives me sex, and that is what I want right now.” I would be able to accept that. But the fact that he seems so willfully ignorant of what is going on is very concerning to me. 

Am I right to be concerned, or should I step back and let him live his life? And if I should be concerned, what should I do about it?

Also, in case it matters, I want to add that my dad has never done anything like this before. He and my mom divorced when I was 4, and for the past 19 years he had dated casually here and there but only American women his own age. During those 19 years he was also a wonderful, incredible, almost perfect father to me who was never creepy in the slightest, so what he’s doing now is completely unexpected.",13Aug2019,3
767,"Ok,so....I’ve recently made friends with a boy who I won’t name for privacy reasons. And I’m having second thoughts about continuing our friendship. He is insanely clingy,and he has extremely overprotective and controlling parents. His parents read through our texts,one time when he came over to watch fireworks with us,she literally followed us the entire way,and sat with him and my family. I mean,just today I was supposed to go over to his place,but my mom needed up getting sick so I was running late. He legit called me 6 times in a row,left me 8 messages,and two voicemails. And then,I shit you not,his mother starts messaging my mom,who is in horrendous pain and very ill. Saying things like “where are you? Are you almost here? [Friend’s Name] is waiting” We’re both autistic,and at one point we were talking,and he told me that he “used” to have autism a few years back. He said it like his autism is just gone. So it wouldn’t surprise me if his parents think they can cure it. Also,I think he’s been flirting with me. However,I’m a lesbian. And he knows this. Hell,he even knows I have a crush on my other best friend,and yet he continues to flirt with me. It’s like he’s saying “yeah I know that you’re a lesbian but I’m gonna somehow think I still have a chance and continue flirting with you even though you don’t reciprocate” He’s been sheltered his entire life,he’s not allowed to do basically anything unless he gets permission from mommy and daddy. And he’s 17! He’s going to be a junior in high school in 3 weeks! And his best friend isn’t any better. His best friend is an asshole who cancels plans last minute every time without fail. I’m just conflicted and not sure what to do. I know he’s a good person,and I want him to be a good person. But I don’t want to be friends with somebody who’s this clingy",13Aug2019,1
768,"Hey guys!

So I have a bit of an issue... I want to move down out of state, I want to go to a different state to go to a Technical School, during the time I would be at the school I would be living in my Girlfriends house, her mother is more than willing to have me there, infact, she wants me to stay there which is really sweet. I was setting up an entire plan to speak to my dad about moving down but somehow I ended up having to tell him TODAY with barely any prior planning on how I was going to let him know, I was going to plan all this week then tell him this weekend. Nonetheless, shit hit the fan extremely quickly, when I told him he got visibly angry, at least it looked like it which is how I knew this wasnt going to be good. I tried to explain to him that I would save up money to move, including putting some aside for an emergency (break up, etc...) so I could get back to my parent’s home the same day if need be plus some extra in savings for safe keeping. I have been looking at jobs in the area and there are many more opportunities compared to where I live now, I’m still set on moving. My dad told me I wasn’t ready to move out and that I haven’t experienced life yet, my girlfriends mom is being very generous on the cost of staying in their home (paying one bill) and I figured getting used to paying rent like that would be much better than getting an apartment, after I explained to him this he then said “Your just going down there to be with (girlfriend)” which yes, being with her is a major plus on that, but I want to go down there to go to the school of my choosing. He then “compromised” by saying if I had a full time job AND went to school where I currently live we could talk about me moving, that will not fly with me, I want to be out of the house by March at the very latest, is there anything I can do??

769,"Hi

I'm about of college about 15 months, I've been working full time since then. I like my job, it's interesting for the most part, the people are very nice, I get paid decent, I have almost 0 stress. I absolutely don't hate it.

I miss college daily though. College was the best time of my life, I've never had a happier 4 years. I hated school, I had friends, I wasn't bullied, I just didn't enjoy it.

My brother is starting college doing the exact same course as me. I'm jealous of him. I was doing my sums and it's nearly 1800 days since I started college. I just feel like time if going by way to fast, and I'm coming to the realization that I'll never get the enjoyment college brought me.

775,Like my title said I have a passion for video games in particular and I want to end up create characters and design/animate them.

I’ve been  making those videos since I was 10. I started playing games when I was 6. I know lot of people say art degrees are useless too. I just don’t know if I should go for the degree   Or if should I major in something else like computer science since it is a set major that kind of has stable jobs?

778,"A while back, I was living with my brother, and I moved out. I decided that I did not want to leave him high and dry so I got my best friend, at least at that time, to move in with him as he was looking for a place to stay. Long story short, he is almost ALWAYS late. Like to a level of ludicrous irresponsibility. We live in the Alabama, so the cost of living is not insanely high. At the current moment, the bills that he has to cover (for himself and his brother that he just let move in without really consulting my brother) come to $600-$650 on the absolute high end. Before they split the bills evenly down the middle and he was still late. It was atleast $100-200 cheaper for him at that point. And both he and my brother dont think it unfair that he cover 2/3 of the bills in the house, considering that his younger brother either cant or refuses to find a job.

More information, is that he outright owns his own car, has a prepaid cell phone (when its turned on), and only has liability insurance. At $9 an hour, working 40 hours a week, before taxes he would make 720, and im lowballing there. 2 checks like this in the time frame of a month, and he clearly makes more than enough to cover everything, yet he is always late and always making excuses. How would you handle this situation if you were me and my brother?",13Aug2019,1
779,I have a group of friends that I have known for over 15yrs.  I lost touch with many of them for a few years but have reunited with one in particular and we have gotten close again.  She got engaged and didn’t ask me to be part of her bridal party but did ask the other girls in our group which I was ok with considering there was a 3-4 year gap where we lost touch.  I still consider her to be a close friend so I asked her to let me know if I can help with anything for the first few months (helped her make invitations). We met up for dinner one night and she asked me to help prepare the ceremony and reception the day of the wedding.  When I asked what is involved she said that I will be going with two other girls to the ceremony to set up then go straight to the reception to set things up there.  It sounded like a lot of work and couldn’t help but feel crappy about it.  I felt offended that she didn’t feel close enough to ask me to be on her bridal party but felt close enough to ask me to work at her wedding. I said I’m ok with it as long as I have other people and there is someone there that can take charge and tell me what needs to be done and she said yes for sure.  Fast forward 5 months. This girl is hard to get a hold of and bailed twice on our plans.  I don’t even know if I’m still helping so I reach out two days before her wedding thinking I was probably not involved anymore because she didn’t tell me anything.  She messages me back and tells me everyone else is not helping and it’s not that much and quickly goes through some details for the reception. The day of was a gong show. My husband helped me and we were just running around like chickens with our heads cut off.  a crap load of information was thrown at us and she was trying to describe the decor I’ve never seen before on the phone.  Her bridal party was telling me a whole bunch of extra info and I felt like crap.  She didn’t even know who was transporting the decor from the ceremony to reception.  We ended up cramming it into our small car.  I don’t even know if she realizes how upsetting this was.  She hasn’t reached out to me since and I feel completely used.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off.

796,"So, I'm a fairly young person (20) and I've been thinking about where I want to go in life. I had a lot of trouble in school, and only recently graduated high school (last year, when I was nineteen.) My family are all cooks, and are pretty musical and into art and literature and all that. For most of my life I always thought I wanted to be a cook or a writer, but I only recently sat down with myself and thought about what I really liked and realized that neither of those things actually excited me in any way. I love cooking professionally, and I love writing stories, but when I thought about myself I couldn't see myself doing either of those things for a career. And imagining myself doing those things in college and as a career made me sad, not excited. So, thinking further about what I liked, I eventually came to the conclusion that my favorite classes in high school had been a Criminal Justice class and a Forensics class my high school offered. And besides that, I've always wanted to help people and do something to help and protect people, and I came to the conclusion that I wanted to do something in the police force. Right now I'm really excited to try and become a detective, but there are so many things that you can do for the police that I'm not making that my end goal and instead just an option. 

I was really excited about this breakthrough, because for me it felt like I had found a worthy goal and direction to head in. I was equally excited to tell my parents, because I was so certain they would be happy for me and support me because they had always been so happy and supportive of me when I was talking about being a writer or cook, but as soon as I brought it up I was shot down. Some of their concerns were fair, like how its a dangerous job and you have to deal with often the worst of society, but a lot of their other concerns I felt were unfair, such as saying they thought I was to smart for it, how they don't trust police, the many issues that the American police system has, and things like that. I tried to explain to them that I don't want to be a police officer because of some power trip, but because like solving problems and I want to help people, but they wouldn't listen and have continued to shoot down my ideas and thoughts on the matter. I don't know how to describe it, but a lot of their statements feel as if they simply don't want me to be a member of the police force because they don't like the police, and not because of any real concern, and are just hiding this fact (I think more from themselves than from me) behind statements meant to sound like concern for me. 

Anyhow, its been about a year that I've been thinking about this, and I'm getting ready to head off to college. My mother is happy with my choices, but my father and step mother are both still very against my goals and keep trying to steer me back to my original goals of writing or cooking even though I have made it clear that those are not what I want. And while I plan to try and pursue this goal regardless of their opinions, as I want to do this for me not to please them, it still hurts when your family doesn't support your goals and tries to convince you to be someone your not. And I also want to be able to tell them about the things I'm doing, but so far telling them anything related to this has only lead to them putting me down. But the biggest issue is this. I'm planning to do this, regardless of what they say, because I know why I want this and its for me not for them. But still, I worry it will alienate my family and push them away, and I don't want to fight with my family, I want to be friends with them. But right now its feeling like the only options I have are lose my connection with my father and stepmother, or pursue a career that I don't find fulfilling or exciting. 

So what say you reddit? What does the mighty reddit hivemind recommend I do to reconcile my goal with the fact that its pushing family away?  


TL;DR, I have begun pursuing a career as a police officer, with the hopes of becoming a detective, but my family has been very against this for reasons I suspect are more about themselves than me. I want to pursue this career, and believe very strongly in it, but I also dont want to alienate family due to something so petty. What should I do about it?",13Aug2019,1

804,"This is an accout I use fo things that I am too ashamed to post on my real one. Anyway some backstory : 

Ever since I was a little kid my big brother would bully me (physically, mentally and often would break my toys), he would tell my parents I broke them and that he didn't mean to hit me or that we were playing. They would believe him even though I told them otherwise, they would ignore my call for help. We also live in a small town where everyone knows everyone and because my brother is older it was easier for him to influence the other kids against me. They often didn't want to play, talk or do anything with me. He would tell them embarrassing stories about me. He would do the same with my younger relatives. I was basically isolated. I remember one time, I told my parents that I have considered suicide because of my brother (by suicide I mean hoping to whatever god if it exists to kill me and be over with this pain), but they didn't care. Said I'm overreacting and stuff like that. My brother was never beaten or yelled at. This bullying carried on for 7 years everyday, but the isolation stayed with me until 7th grade. I was such a loner, that one of the kids whose mom was friends with mine, told his mom that I ''was hiding in a shell too much''. He was the closest person I had to a friend but he would just use me for my academic skills . Every boy from my grade was friends with my brother, so they would always ditch me for him. Now my brother still breaks my stuff and blames me for it. My ps3 controller after I gave it to him to play with his GF, he also tells me ''your memory is bad, it didn't happen that way'', but I insist, that it happened that way. No one else does, but my uncle. He was very protective of me, because he hated that his daughter and my brother would isolate me from everything they did. He remembers and though he wasn't here often enough to see him bully me, He probably believes it and my mom admits he broke one of my toys 8 or so years ago. My brother still calls me an autistic loner that won't have a girlfriend, while he is a fat neckbeard.

Anyway onto the now. Today I overheard my parents speak, while I was reading in my room. The conversation went something like this :

Dad : I feel sorry for OP's brother. We force him to read but he is such a good person, but he will have it hard in the real world.
Mom: Yeah, he has always been yelled at, because of OP. He doesn't deserve it. 

Now first off. He says he was punished but never more that talked to. He was spanked once by my grandpa when little. He isn't a good person. 

I know my parents love my brother more. They bought him a 3DS, paid 40% of his 2k $ laptop, sent him to see my sister in a different country twice, and give him a bunch of cash everyday for him and his girlfriend. Bought him a dog and fish. 

I on the other hand had to pay 70% of my 1200$ because my mom didn't want to buy me one for 2 summers of me begging her. Paid 700 $ for my phone, travelled only once without them. And have been living on 2$ for breakfast at school. All that money for my electronics is from those 2 dollars a day. Now yes I have gotten christmas gifts. Some good, most bad. Same for my birthday. The first Christmas I remember I got some plastic barely functioning robot, while my brother got something similar to a drone 5 times the price of my gift. 

But this does not matter. I want to know how I can make my parents realise that I have been punished way more by my brother than he is by them.",13Aug2019,2
805,"I need some insight on what to do with my brother. First, some detail. My little brother is a year and half younger than me, I'm 32. He still lives at home with my parents. He's an engineer and makes decent money (I think). He doesn't own a car and instead uses my mom's car.  He still has the same bedroom from when he was a kid which he recently repainted, and for which he purchased new furniture. When people ask me about him I kinda cover for him and say he lives near my parents, as opposed to with my parents. He makes good money as an engineer and I've met the people he works with and they're good people and he seems to be good at his job. Side note about the job, it was my mom who spoke to the owner of the engineering firm and made my brother apply for the job. He's never owned a car or even mentioned buying a car. This is starting to become an issue because he needed to pick up my mom from work because he took the car for the day and he fell asleep and didn't pick her up. When my mom mentioned that he needs his own car he said, ""My parents aren't just going to give me a car."" For as long as we've grown up he's never really had any friends. We go to sporting events a lot (baseball, hockey, etc) and it's our thing. Recently, people I work with have been wanting to go along with me. When someone else comes along he never wants to sit with us when they come along and will make up excuses for not sitting with us. I took someone from work to a baseball game, one person, who is really nice but when I told him I brought someone and had a seat next to us, he didn't come down to sit with us. Another time, when we went to a hockey game last season, he just sat on the end and didn't say a thing to anyone else besides me. Even with me he didn't talk much. Just today, I was getting tickets for opening day hockey and he's being finicky and passive aggressive about me bringing some friends. Even with our uncle he has this same issue. My uncle, who we see regularly and is cool, wanted to go watch baseball with us and when my brother showed up my brother got really curt and passive aggressive again. Lastly, he seems disappointed that I don't have the time or money for vacations like he does. I want to say it's because I have a home, car, and employees to worry about, but I know if I say that he will be hurt by it.

I'm not sure what to do. I'm trying to bring him out of his shell and get him on his own. He seems like a child still. I know my parents think it's weird but they aren't actively doing anything about it.  The only person he actively spends time with are my parents and one aunt. 

Whenever I try bringing up the issue he throws a passive aggressive tantrum and gets super snarky. I need some help on what to do. Has anyone dealt with a situation like this before and how did you address it. Also, I just need a place to kinda of vent because I haven't told anyone this.",13Aug2019,1

I want to clarify she would never hurt my cat, she loves him and caters to him a lot --  but in the past he hasn't gotten along with other animals. I'm willing to try again but she doesn't want to do that, and I don't want to get rid of him and neither does he.

809,"I need help, I don't know what this feeling is and I feel like a jerk when I really think about it, but at the same time, I don't feel like he's in the wrong either. So, every summer my family comes to Washington state to visit my cousins, and there are 5 of them. Each a distant apart. There are 2 females, and 3 males.  Let's call them Younger F ( YF ) and older female ( OF ) mind you older female is very attractive ( no Alabama stuff ) and younger female is just like a dog. Let's call the males Oldest ( OM ) and the second oldest, who is close to OF ( SM ) and the youngest who is my age. ( YM ). So my brother has been using his phone as a way to talk to them. No biggie, he's just talking to them. Then I realize he's trying to juggle everyone at once, in real life and on the phone too. A bit suspicious but extremely normal activity for the 20th century. I always let my brother go through my phone because I trust him so much. Turns out he didn't have SM's phone number so he was contacting a lot of people asking for their phone numbers through my phone, and messaging them like it was me, adds them on his phone and then screenshots a photo. I guess this is a bit off so I changed my phone password. So one day I was sitting on OF's bed, my head on her lap ( again, no Alabama stuff ) when I catch my younger brother staring whenever no-ones looking at OF's tits. Now AGAIN, completely normal for a teenager cause hormones and shit right. He ends up getting her phone number through my phone and spreads a rumor about HIS OLDER BROTHER and she's glancing me these dirty looks now. Great, now OF doesn't like me and treating my younger brother like some demi-god joking around with him. They're having fun while I'm excluded. It doesn't feel so good. And since brother is now the favorite of OF, OM likes my brother and I'm excluded. I feel hurt and betrayed now and even if I talk to them about it, I feel disrespected. My brother is much a bit taller and eats a lot more than me so I am smaller compared to him. I don't want to show emotion but I need a way to talk about it to make them see the truth without making me look like a puny bitch. I have next year but I can do it in 7 days if you guys can help me fast.",13Aug2019,2
810,"I spoke to my therapist about the situation, who agrees that while I’m figuring things out with the mutual friend, I should socialize with my other friends outside mutual gatherings.

The friend I had a fight with is the godmother of the child celebrating their birthday. This friend also is the one that tends to treat me very poorly, and in general is not a very good friend. They don’t know how to be a good friend. Everything is very one-sided. I don’t know if they have ever known how to fully listen or support me.

Recently, I found my own personal power, after most of my life being a wallflower who was too afraid to ever say I was uncomfortable. So, I decided it was good for me to test my friends worth, and finally say I’m uncomfortable with things. After telling this friend I didn’t want them to spam me with Memes and website links they never inquired about for quality conversation, they became so angry they didn’t speak to me for a month. Dramatic, I know. But, it solidifies my thought process of why it is important for me to figure out which friends are really friends to me, not just friends with me because I empower them.

I wanted to visit my other friend the week before the party, and spend time with her and her daughter, giving her her birthday present. Should I tell her what’s going on with our mutual friend, and say that’s the reason I’m not going to the party?

For anyone who says I should go, all of the friends will be seated at one table. I don’t think it’s best for me to go to a gathering where I am forced to socialize with someone I don’t think I should have in my life yet. And, if I go and be cordial to her, I’m pretty sure that would send her mixed signals and make her think I’m not serious when I say I deserve better treatment. Since she is the godmother of the child, that party is her space. And, if she wants to apologize to me, I want to stand my ground in a place where I won’t feel obligated to not make a scene. That’s also why I’m not going to attend the party. Yes, since I know her personality, that’s probably what she would do.",13Aug2019,1

812,"So I posted in here about a month or two saying that my girl doesn’t give me enough time to do my own thing and I got the response that I should time out days where we spend time together and where I get my own time, it worked for a month or so but now I’m back in a ditch. I used to be a hardcore gamer, and ever since we moved out I get maybe an hour a week if that, and most of my friends are online. Today I asked her if it’s ok that I plan a day to like just relax and game all day and she was giving very hesitant responses like “I guess so” and “whenever works I guess” which I know is her saying she’s clearly upset. Now I’m frustrated not because I can’t game but because I work really hard to make our lives good (I sweep the house, mop, go to her family events, do both of our laundry, pay most of the bills, bought all the groceries last pay) and so I explain this to her and she just reads my messages and never gets back to me. Which really bugs me. I get that in a relationship you make sacrifices but video games have always been my way to escape, and losing them almost feels like I’m losing a part of myself. I love my girlfriend, however I feel like this only makes life harder as humans naturally need time to be alone and do their own thing. I don’t thing being in a relationship means we do everything together 24/7. Sorry for the rant I’m just really upset about all this.

814,"My gf and I broke up 9 months ago 

A month before the breakup my parents found out about us and absolutely flipped and made us take a step back in the relationship. I told her about it and she said “I guess we have to” and wasn’t happy. 

For a month we talked everyday and even kissed. 

I told her during this month once about how this girl who once had a crush on me was screenshotting my snap stories. My ex absolutely flipped out. She told me to “block that bitch right now” and just was so mad. She said “nobody hits on my man” and I told her “I’m not your man” I was just pissed. Well I blocked that friend for her. 

A day later she tells me how people think she and this guy are always flirting. She gives me her phone and I see so many snaps between them and texts. I didn’t say anything and gave her phone back. 

2 days after that we get into a fight over an old old issue and I call her a mean word and she dumps me officially. For a week after that I begged and pleaded for her to come back to me. And she would block then unblock me. Till she had enough and rubbed the fact that she is sleeping with that guy people said she used to flirt with a lot.

818,"I have a brother who's just 14 years old. He is pretty much alt-right. He thinks that all Muslims are terrible and that we shouldn't accept immigrant or refugees. Okay, that's a legitimate political opinion to have, but it's more serious than that.

He visits Stormfront (a white supremacist forum) sometimes. I don't know how regularly but he claims to visit it. He constantly talks about politics. I enjoy talking about politics, but almost only about how much he hates immigrant and Muslims. He's also very active on a site called HLTV, which I'm pretty sure is just a Counter-Strike forum, but it is pretty racist from what I can tell and not a great influence.

He also claims to have watched the Christchurch shooting footage many times and like the music, the shooter was playing. He says that if he wouldn't go to hell, (he claims to be Christian which is obviously just something he claims because he wants to be like the others on ""his side."" He's not a Christian and has always been an Atheist) he would commit a terror attack on a Mosque and kill as many Muslims as possible. That's what got me to think that this is more serious than I might think. To even flirt with the thought of committing an act of terror seems like a serious warning-sign.

He also tells me that he's legit a Nazi and he's not even kidding. He is 100% serious about it. He doesn't deny the holocaust but he says that it's just a myth that 6 million jews died. He's also watched a lot of Hitler videos on Youtube and has liked pro-Hitler comments. He also frequently calls me ""libtard"" and a ""member of Antifa"" which is just ridiculous as I personally lean quite a bit towards the right side of the political spectrum myself, but obviously, I'm not as far-right as he is and therefore I'm apparently a libtard.

He is still only 14 but he did have a fairly rough childhood I guess. Our dad has mental issues and would often cause what I could best describe as psychological terror on us and our mother when we were younger. Sometimes he'd get physical, but usually, he would just get an absolute thrill by causing fear and terror in someone else.

My brother once tried to kill himself by swallowing a bunch of pills and had to go to the hospital. Yes, this seems very serious, but he does seem like a very happy person now. Much more than he was back then. He's still a problem child, though and sometimes behaves like an absolute brat in front of our parents. He's caused our mom to cry before by just his words. It does need to be said that he was like this before, but it is a long time since he's acted like this. (about 6 months)

He's also obsessed with Lil Peep which is pretty emo as far as I know. 

So, what do you think I should do? I do not seriously believe that he would ever kill anybody. He's just doesn't seem ""tough"" enough. (tough might be a bad word but I'm not a native English speaker) Should I go as far as to even contact law enforcement here?

826,"It's a really long story, I apologise in advance;
My parents have always been on and off, arguments, getting separated, getting back together, emotional abuse and repeat. They've only had two kids in this relationship, me (18f) and my brother (10) but I've always been the one in the middle of their problems.
My parents are Hispanic and my dad always wanted to return to his country (well now that he felt 'old')

2015 was when my parents had decided to go back to their home country, supposedly only for 6 months, and so we went, the four of us. Back then I was real upset over that decision, because I was going to miss my 8th grade graduation but oh well when we'd return it would be September and I would start high school so I was excited.

Fast forward 6 months and it turns out that my parents don't plan on moving back, I was the most upset. Granted my brother was barely 6 at the time but still. I cried and ranted and argued but nothing was changing their mind, and they weren't planning on sending a 14 year old back by herself, to who?
It was until later that I realized that because of my mom who had gotten really sickly over the last few years and got depressed after losing jobs multiple times (and my dad never helped with anything, we lived off of food stamps).
And their final decision to leave was because they could no longer pay for the apartment.

Not everything was 100% awful over there, I had some nice memories. But then that's where my dad became an alcoholic. He would somehow get loads of money and blow it all off on drinking, everynight he had to drink otherwise he couldn't go to bed anymore. My mom had opened up a corner store and that's what we lived off of, she payed everything and at one point we could even afford wifi (yes, that's how this country is)

Fast forward more time and more fights, police called, court hearings and almost divorce. Ive had it, and I was always in the middle. I was emotionally abused of for the majority of my time there, by both parents. My mom would take out her frustrations on me and insult me and my dad began to hate me because I ""always defended my mother"".
He tried to kick me out of the house 3 times, ignored me on the birthday and I was sleeping on the couch, he even told me to kill myself after I bursted into tears After a suicide attempt.
Many many more things happened that would take me too long to write about, but I was at my limit. 

My best friend, for about a whole year kept telling me to come back, that she was willing to pay for my flight. It took me most of that time to convince my parents to let me go, but when they finally did I thought I was free (17 now), my mom had contacted my aunt to go pick me up after my friend was already going to, I ended up leaving with my friend.
I lived with her for 2 weeks when my aunt and mom had decided that it'd be best to go move in with my aunt, and I had to, I felt dirty for doing that. My friend payed for my trip to live with her and now I move out with an aunt (who didn't want to buy my ticket, she always offered to but always lied in the end).

I live with this aunt for about 8 months, it was well and awful at the same time, she almost kicked me out twice and always wanted me to have her house clean (granted I only swept, took out the trash, and washed the dishes; but I never saw her son, 19, do any of that). She wasn't a typical aunt either, she cleaned houses and wanted me to help and blew up on me when I asked if I could be payed (like the other girls that worked with her) and shoved everything in my face that I basically was a freeloader.
I asked for help to the guidance counselors at the high school (I was backtracked a year for paperwork issues at the hs btw) and the counselor was just patronising and told me ""others have it worse you know"".
After some time I learned how to live with her, say hello to her when she came back go meet her in the kitchen, go back to my room and stay there. That's the only opo me the butt of the joke around anyone in the house.

More time after my mom and brother come back to America and move in with my aunt; mom had many huge fights with my aunt (complicated backstory) and my aunt ended up kicking us out, granted I think my aunt didn't want me to leave, but if I stayed my mom would see me as her enemy instead of a daughter from then on (has happened before)
Now we're staying with my mom's friend, married and two kids she's like a sister to me, but my mom wants to go back  again to the country (she left in the first place because my dad, again, is abusive but now won her heart.. again)
My mom says she's too tired to work anymore (has been working since she was 16, now 40)
Point being my mom wants me to go back to the country with her, after everything. She says (and also my dad) that he's changed and everything is going to be different now.

Now here's where things are complicated for me, they want me to go back, I have about a month, I already dodged the first bullet because my mom already bought my brother and her tickets, she didn't buy mine (reluctantly) because I told her I needed a month to order some things.
My parents don't want me to stay because ""whose going to maintain you? You can't live for free, and you can't be another burden on someone else.
My friends and even my mom told me that I'm 18 now so I make my own decisions, but I'd have no where else to go.
I can't go back to my aunt's house, my best friend's mom isn't the most stable, and where I'm at right now they'd make me pay rent, buy my own xooy and take care of their kids (3 &amp; 10months) and I don't have a job. I never get answered when I apply for jobs, I had one job (the money I have to order the things) but I quit because I was always on a verge of a panic attack, I'm very very anxious so I don't do well on cashier/costumer service jobs, but I can't do any cleaning jobs either of which are abundance of.

Either way I'm trapped, I don't have a job and without one I can't really stay, but I don't want to go back to living through what I went through.
I want to graduate, it took me a lot but I think I finally found myself liking the high school, my dream is to have a normal graduation even if theres no one to celebrate with me. (And this is something I won't be able to do over there, I'd have to finish my last year online)

I applied for the school cause it was my last option, no one else would take me (: . anyway, yesterday was my first day there and i left the school miserable. i hated the kids. today was not as bad, the kids still get on my nerves but i love most of my teachers, my spanish teacher especially. my mom called and i have an opportunity to potentially get into another school that’s more academic (i want to go to an ivey league school or a school of that sort, and was beginning to think that the highschool i attend would not be the best choice as it focuses mostly on the arts). but i’m scared to get accepted. i literally love my teachers and i am not a social person at all, super introverted. i don’t know if i can go to a new school now, where i know 2 people, and start all over again.
i’m just terrified. and what if i don’t like the new school? i’m not going to make my parents move me again, that’s not fair.

I've naturally done this as a child and during my pre teenage and teenage years I would learn I'm a rarity among people in my age group.

For the past seven years my mother has been accusing of:

°Having dyslexia

°Having ADH

°Having ADD

°Having a smaller than average social circle

°Being emotional

°Being socially awkward

°Bullying others

I've politely explained to her hundreds of times that I don't have those disorders, that I am against bullying, and even politely asked her to stop.

I'm a minor. I'm sixteen years old.

837,"im currently finishing up my second day of studying abroad, and i honestly really do like it! my study abroad is a group of 80 americans who all live together and basically act as a cohort. like i said, i like it, but with my anxiety, comes new worries every other day or so lol. i am in just a tiny dilemma. i am not really bonding with my roommate, and i feel like everyone else is getting really close to theirs. so, i have been socializing as much as i can and hanging out with a bunch of different people, but i usually just tag along with roommates, and i feel like sooner, rather than later, i'll feel left out. so far, i've really just been going with the flow cause i told myself many times before arriving that i wouldn't put intense pressure on myself, but here i am. i am getting really worried because i'm not sure if i'm forming bonds. i am talking to so many people and hanging out with different people each few hours. my plan was getting to know as many people just so i can get a little sense of everyone and see who my people are, but am i doing it right? i don't know if i should try to stick to hanging out with just one set of people or if i should just keep going with the flow and tagging along with whoever i find. please help me, i want to do this the best way i can.

TL; DR: i am going into my third day studying abroad and haven't bonded with my roommate while i feel like everyone else has. i have been tagging alone with sets of roommates which makes me scared that sooner, rather than later, i'll start to feel left out. i've also been hanging with a bunch of different groups/ people as well, meaning i haven't really found ""my group"" yet. i am not sure if i should try to be consistent about who i spend my time with or if i should continue going with the flow and getting to know everyone.",13Aug2019,1
838,"I honestly had to make a new profile to post this, but I honestly don't know what to do. My dad has been suspicious lately, and I always catch him messaging on his phone, or hiding his screen when he messages. This used to happen before, and I remember there was a time period were my dad and mom stopped talking, and I thought maybe my dad had been talking to another woman, but things started to pick up again, and I thought things were normal until just recently. I noticed my dad also started to talk less flirty with my mom, or not give her as much affection. and so I started thinking maybe they were fighting again nothing new. this all changed when yesterday my younger sister (16), checked his phone and noticed he actually had an Instagram page, where he followed only men, and was messaging them. my sister thought he was speaking to a woman which is why she had originally checked his phone. but what she came to find was a his page filled with pictures of him shirtless and comments of different men. I discovered this today when I found my sister in tears in my bed. 

What's even more disgusting is when she read through his messages, it shows he has met up with these guys to hook up, and he speaks to them in a very sexual manner. 

idk what to do, and I promised I wouldn't tell anyone, but I just feel so trapped. I don't know how to react, and I just don't want to believe it.

840,"I am a single male with a stable income from a 40hr per week job. Typically when it comes to food I do no budgeting as I only need to closely pay attention to my finances when I'm saving money. This means I'll usually eat out most nights of the week or buy snacks on a whim. And when it comes to home cooking I'll only do it if either A: I'm strapped for cash for the month or B: I've found an interesting recipe. 

On average, I would drive to a burger or burrito place and get a meal and drink for around $8 ~ $20, depending on the place. Maybe I'll dine at a sit-down restaurant and spend $20 ~ $30. As I typically only eat one big meal a day (Usually a dinner or breakfast) I've always been told this is a waste of money.

So I've decided I want to try and see how much I can save up by only eating home cooked meals, as this is a good idea for money. I pick 3 or 4 recipes that share ingredients, have moderate serving sizes, &amp; look tasty, go to my grocery store and pick the cheapest options available (discounted, store brand, BOGOs) (I don't coupon because I don't have the time for it). Then have the bill come out to $100 ~ $180!!! My entire food budget for the full week plus some spent within an hour or two!

As I see it, why is cooking at home considered a cheaper alternative to eating out? When it comes to cooking at home, not only do I have to buy my ingredients, I also have to spend the time doing prep work, cooking, and then clean up. Where as eating out, I pay to have the meal cooked for me and I lose a bit of gasoline for the drive. I can understand and see the vast difference if say I were feeding a family of four, but for myself only I can't understand why cooking at home is considered the cheaper option. If someone could please explain to me not only why it's better, but also what I'm doing wrong when grocery shopping, I'd very much appreciate you.

Tl;Dr: I can't see or equate a financial difference between cooking at home and Dining out when I'm the only one eating. Please tell me why I'm wrong &amp; explain how I can do better.",13Aug2019,2
841,"Okay,

Where do I begin? 

I’ll start by saying, my sister is from another mum and several years older F[36] My dad cheated when he was younger, around 5months into my my parents 40+ year relationship!

Many years down the line and my sister lives in a different county, I spend most summer holidays at hers. Then suddenly it stopped, from age 15 too 27 I hardly see her, I never really questioned it! I just assumed we’d been too busy with life.

Up until recently she came down for my mums 60th birthday, it tore me apart! I realised just how much I missed and loved her and just vowed to see her more and make an effort. So I drove up last weekend and spent the weekend at hers, we have a few drinks and basically she said she stopped coming up because my dad never made the effort and the final straw was and I quote “I came up to see him with my new baby (my nephew) we met in the pub and he was with another woman, I shouted at him and we got in a heated dissuasion where he told me to mind my business”
This sounded so out of character for my dad I’ve never known him to really get angry in public, but I always had my suspicions, he’s never worn a ring etc.

This broke me a little.
 I was angry at him for doing this to my mum, and angry because it’s part of the reason I didn’t see my sister for years.

I’m on the fence of what to do, and didn’t really want to ask questions out of the fear of knowing too much.
It was over 11 years ago.
My mum and dad are still together but it’s playing over and over in my mind, 
The following morning my sister apologised and tried downplaying it saying “I shouldn’t of told you that, and to fair they could of just been friends”
I don’t doubt her judgement and think she wanted to retract her statement.

She’s angry at him because he never made an effort with her.
I just don’t know what to do and it’s all I’ve thought about, I feel sorry for my sister.",13Aug2019,1

849,"# So let’s get down to business. There’s a lot more to this story, but here’s the “short” version.

I (23F) just got engaged to my fiancé (21F). We live together. He is my best friend, my muse, my everything. So what I’m about to tell you is something that has and will hurt me for, more than likely, the rest of my life.

I am Italian/Lebanese, raised Catholic, however I take no preference with religion. He is Pakistani and his entire family is Muslim. The first three months we were dating, I never met his parents which was odd. I was never allowed over their house or anything like that. His parents expectations were high when it came to their 4 kids (he’s the youngest) dating people, especially out of the “community”. His older sister, the oldest of the kids even had an arranged marriage a couple years ago (she’s 29 now) but it went really badly and she got a divorce.

At first, when he told his parents about me, they were absolutely, 100% not cool with it. Over time, I had to basically prove myself to them showing that I come in peace. They finally came around and love me like their own daughter. I call his mom my mom and I really, truly feel the love. And, coming from a divorced family, I felt like I was part of something that I haven’t felt in a really long time. I was even cool with his siblings. I went to school with one of his sisters and we’re the same age so, naturally, we became the best of friends. Ironically, she’s been in a two year relationship with a guy and she’s never told her parents about him..... until this crazy shit happened.

There was a heated argument a couple months ago between my fiancé and his older brother (28). His family called together a “meeting” meaning that I would be excluded, however all 6 of them would talk about any family problems they have been having. His siblings’ argument was that he gets to do whatever he wants and that he’s changed because he moved out.

My fiancé is a good person. We both work full time and he’s in school. The most we’ll do is go to the gym or the beach. We don’t do drugs and we don’t drink, unless it’s a special occasion like his birthday in which, yes, he got extremely inebriated. We posted pictures and videos on social media. The day after, his parents called for another meeting at a pizza shop. This time, his siblings weren’t there. His parents asked about him drinking and mentioned him “doing drugs”. They said that a close source showed them what we posted. They were very upset and crying. My fiancé knew his siblings showed them as they’re the only ones who could have seen our posts. They hashed it out at the pizza shop and they were fine after.

Listen, I’ve had my fun. I’ve done a lot of things that I am not proud of, however, those things made me who I am today. Two years ago, you wouldn’t even recognize that it’s me. With that being said, I feel like I’ve lived a million lives. Yes, I am young, however, I know when someone has a problem and tbh, my fiancé is an angel.

After that meeting, all three of his siblings denounced my fiancé and I. I had no idea what was going on at that point but they stopped answering my texts and calls.

Then, one day, he went back to his parent’s house to pick up some mail. His sister was there, the one who was supposed to be the sister I never had. He confronted her about the situation with his parents and she admitted it. He was heartbroken. He didn’t understand why she would do that to him. So, he told his parents about her boyfriend of two years! The argument got super heated. She kept denying it and he kept on her. She started crying and tried to hit him so he pushed her out of the way. When that happened, she grabbed A KITCHEN KNIFE and held it up against his neck, threatening to kill him. His mom called the cops and she had her boyfriend pick her up before the cops came.

At this point, his parents thought his two other siblings did not know about her boyfriend. When they found out about him, I was there. This was like 6 months before this incident. They swore on the Quran and their dead grandfather that they didn’t know about the boyfriend. After we told his parents, they were so disappointed that said they wouldn’t let the siblings back in the house. His oldest sister is living on campus at a school she goes to, and the one with the boyfriend is obviously living at his house, but his brother is a different story.

About two days later, all three siblings were together. We were at home and they called him. He put the phone on speaker so I could listen in. They said that the brother was living in his car and that my fiancé needed to leave me so the family could get back together. They said that I’m a bad influence on him and that I’m sucking him dry, I’m using him they said. I’m replaying in my mind everything I’ve done since they met me and I’ve only done good... I’m not perfect but when it comes to his family, I obviously wanted them to like me. Not to mention, my fiancé and I are very fair to each other. He was unemployed for 6 months and I supported the both of us. He takes care of me and when I need something, if I’m short on money to pay for bills, he will pay them. He watches out for me and takes care of me when I have seizures (I’m an epileptic). I would say, and he would agree, that we have a happy and healthy relationship. So, me being me, since the phone was on speaker, asked “what did I do????”. That set off an explosion of his siblings all screaming on the phone at the same time, calling me names, telling him they want me dead and that I caused all of these family problems that honestly in my opinion is verrrryyy deep rooted before I came into the picture. As an outsider looking in, most of the family quarrels, at least to me, were utterly ridiculous and nonsensical, but it’s the way they functioned and I accepted it... until now. After the call, we cried in each other’s arms. I felt terrible, not for myself, but for how his siblings were treating him. His family was torn apart in less than a week.

The day after, his parents came over and we all talked about the situation and I kept saying sorry to them. His mom told me that she doesn’t have daughters and that I’m more of a child to her than her own blood. She cried in my arms. My chest hurt. My body was tense. I was in total astonishment. Like wtf do you say to that like yes I’m honored but also I feel so so so bad.

The next day, my fiancé wakes up to about 40 texts from his sister’s boyfriend telling him to watch his back and that he has people on standby waiting to kick his ass and that he needs to watch out for his life. and mine. We went to the police station and filed a report. Unfortunately, where we live, restraining orders are complicated and even after you pay $200, it’s not guaranteed. We settled with a police officer calling him and putting him in his place. No more texts after that.

His parents recognize our love for each other and how much we do for each other. We are always going to family events with them, especially to celebrate Eid or maybe go out to dinner, or go on a day trip. I know I am not the root cause on this issue, however, when all three of his siblings are blaming me, I can’t help but beat myself up for all the hurt that my fiancé and his parents are feeling.

He hasn’t talked to his siblings in months and his parents are the same. There seems to be no compromise to this and I fear that our wedding will be bittersweet because they are not invited- a final decision by my fiancé and honestly I don’t want them there either.

He says he will never forgive them for what they’ve done. I am the negotiator. I’ve always been one to try to fix everyone’s problems or resolve issues and I feel like I’ll never be able to fix this.

TL;DR His siblings blame me for breaking up the family, despite deep rooted family problems before I was in the picture.",13Aug2019,4
850,"Hi everyone. My father died 2 years ago in May. I was not close to him, I barely saw him as I grew older. He passed when I was 19, I’m 21 now. Throughout my years before he passed he would tell me that he loves me that he wants to see me, etc. 

The problem is he was a drunk and couldn’t hold down a job to be able to see us. He would see us drunk and my mother didn’t like it. 

He died from a drug overdose, I found out when my sister called me telling me while I was at work. 

Well, I blame myself everyday saying maybe if I visited him he would be here. He would tell me he loves my sister and I all the time. He would always ask when I would see him and I always held it off. 

When he passed it was shocking. It felt like it wasn’t real. I cry a lot because I feel hurt and resentful of myself that I didn’t talk to him. I feel so guilty about everything. I feel I can’t go through my day without thinking of how he died;  by himself. 


**This might be TMI for people down here, don’t read if you can’t handle details**



He was found in his apartment a week after he died because his dog was barking. I didn’t view his body, but my sister did. She told me his body was so decomposed they could not recognize him. 


I feel heartbroken. The relationship with my boyfriend has changed since then. We have a good relationship but I seem to always be sad.

I’ve never worked as a server before so I’m trying to decide if I should take the job or not. I’ve heard servers make great tips so I’m stuck. On one hand 13/hr is pretty good. But if there is a possibility I will make more as a server I would like to go ahead and give it a try.

860,"Okay so before you judge me based on the title..

I’m (M/21) not an incel who can’t speak to girls or anything like that. Not to sound arrogant but I consider myself pretty attractive, I really like fashion and take good care of myself. I would think the first impression I give is that I’m pretty outgoing and friendly. Which I am, even with girls.. except those I consider attractive. I talk about everything with those I don’t find attractive because I have that ”I dont care” mindset. 

I’ve dealt with social anxiety and I have pretty much beaten it, but it’s still there however when I overanalyze social situations. :(

So whenever I speak to a girl I find attractive, I feel like I have to ”impress” and I don’t know what to talk about. My mind goes in overdrive. I still talk to them of course, but it usually turns into useless small talk and if the girl is shy and doesn’t really contribute to the convo it dies and  becomes awkward silence for a bit. 

I figured, the only way to improve is to face my problem and talk more but I risk messing things up which I don’t want, since this mainly concern my workplace..

Another problem is that, I barely have any female friends, and none I ”hang out” with.
I only hang with guys and the conversations are different, and so is this humour. My only strong side I guess would be witty comments or jokes but it’s not enough. I wanna make them laugh for real, and be a funny person to be around. 

So just basically, I want to get some female friends, and be a funny guy around them like I am with my guy friends. And it’s obviously not so I could hook up with them or anything, I mean whatever happens happens, but I thought maybe I could use another perspective and also I want to make more friends.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

874,"Yes, these go hand in hand so just bare with me.

So every once in awhile i'll do something that in isn't inherently bad in any form of the word. It might be me singing or making jokes or complimenting someone etc. But sometimes, like a few moments afterwards and the person that was there is gone I suddenly go into a mindset where I consider if I was being rude or disrespectful (even if I wasn't which is probably 80% of the time this happens), and I feel a mix of me being embarassed and very guilty.

Then, anytime I do something afterwards that could lead to that memory being reminded I get a weird sort of overwhelming feeling to react, like to yell out ""NO"" or something to that affect. 

The best example of this (and probably the biggest one i'm struggling with right now) is something that happened a few years ago. It was a few days after I made a tumblr account for the first time, and it was spesifically because I wanted to go view some of my favorite ask blogs I found on youtube (I might have been fifteen-ish?). There was this particular Undertale one I liked, so I viewed that a bit. Now, from other ask blogs i've seen I knew people could make funny jokes and responces to spesific characters in the ask blogs, so I knew if I wanted to make a joke it would be cool. Now without getting into detail, once of the characters had a name he gave himself that was, for the most part, particularly edgy. So I wanted to send them "" *insert name here* is so edgy it could cut glass."" with no goofy stuff in it to make it seem real for the ask blog. Now, I still didn't know how tumblr worked and thought that any time you sent an ask to someone it would appear on the page thing untill they replied (spoiler: it doesn't). So I proceeded to send that same exact phrase over five times to the ask blog. I was also unsure what button was to asl and what button was to message, so theres a 50% chance I sent it to the wrong place. So in conclusion: I insulted a characters choice of name six times to possibly the creators of the ask blog that could be viewed in one was as mean.

I uninstalled tumblr a week after. That's how bad I felt and how much my mind tortured me over it, and it still does anytime I see something simmilar. It's been years and the guilt/embarassment situations still happen.

I don't mind making mistakes or anything, so why does this weird reaction still happen? And how do I make it stop affecting me?",13Aug2019,1
875,"First if all I love my parents and I try to help as much as I can but I don't know about this. I'm 21m

We are a family of 6 living in a house with 4 bedrooms. For a while now we've been looking for a house with 5 bedrooms, but no luck. They even want one with a pool. Which makes sense because we live in Arizona. It's also just something they've been wanting now for a while, but they couldn't afford it.

I work with my dad right now, he makes good money for the family, and well me, I'm kind of just starting out my career here. Recently, the company my Dad and I work at got bought out. Because of this, people were either given their retirement money early or they could choose to have it  transferred into their 401k with the new company. My dad chose the former. 

Now that he has the money, he's thinking about either renting and just saving up or using up the money to buy a house. I don't think that's a bad idea. I would tell them I would help them buy a house, I just didn't know about the repercussions of it. (What I meant is help them pay bills. Just to clear it up) They kind of want me to co-sign with them since I have built up decent credit. I also didn't realize, what if I meet someone and decide to move out like a couple years after buying a house? That's one reason and ever since I learned about credit and how it works, I know that my credit will take a big blow cause of this or at least that's what I assume will happen. 

Since I started bringing all this up to my parents, they think I'm just being cheap now. It also just bugs me when I bring up that, what if I meet someone? They just chuckle as if I'm staying with them forever. Not to say that I'm not grateful for what they've done for me. I know some parents make their kids pay rent, which is why I'm  extremely thankful. Also, Would it be weird to not move out until I meet someone, or should I think about moving out someday?

Last night while she was asleep her friend used her phone without her permission to txt me to leave her alone. I tried to reassure her friend that I had no I'll intentions but she was not having it. At one point she said ""why don't you just take the picture and go"", I received no picture but from context it seems like she took a picture of the girl I had been chatting with while she slept and tried to send it to me but it failed due to bad Wi-Fi. She then blocked me on bumble so I have no way to get in touch with the girl I had been chatting to.

885,"YEP.  (Im a male senior in high school, not that it matters)

QUICK backstory, I met this girl on a school trip back in April when I was a junior. She was MAD CUTE! She was pretty nice as well. She showed “interest” in me by approaching me first. We stuck with each other throughout the WHOLE trip, and got pretty close. Our personalities worked off each other great. We exchanged numbers and instagrams. We were on touching level, (arm around her and holding hands type stuff) 

One of the nights she even asked me to SNEAK INTO HER ROOM TO SLEEP WITH HER. We only cuddled the night, but like REALLY intimate  cuddling. (There was only one more night after this and I was unable to sneak over that time)

We continued sticking together until the end of the trip. She MADE SURE I sat next to her on the plane back, and things went great. I was heavily considering starting  a relationship with her, I was really feeling her. (Caught feelings) I thought she was feeling me too, I mean you wouldn’t invite just ANYBODY to sleep with you.

The problem started when we got back. Whenever I’d text her, it took many days for her to reply, as if she was dodging me. She would say she was “busy” but I knew she wasn’t because she’d post and BE ACTIVE on Instagram. She’d read my messages and leave them on read. (I didn’t do anything wrong, and I wasn’t blowing up her phone or anything she just straight up ghosted me for NO reason at all. I was so confused )

The last message I sent her was “if you don’t wanna fw me let me know, just say SOMETHING, ANYTHING” this was the 3rd message over the span of 5 DAYS with no response. I was pretty hurt, not gonna lie, but eventually I moved on


NOW THAT THE BACK STORY IS OUT THE WAY, she is in my class this semester and memories have been coming back to me. We have said NOT A WORD to each other and both act as if we don’t know each other. We just pass each other like strangers. 

As far as the feelings I had, those are NOT coming back any time soon. That’s not what this is about.

BUT,

One side of me wants to AT LEAST say SOMETHING so that it’s not this awkwardness of acting like we don’t know each other. Maybe we’ll be friends, maybe not, but hey AT LEAST I said something 

The other side of me WANTS to keep treating her like a stranger. I mean SHE DID do me wrong. Is it really worth the effort to say something? I mean, if she wanted ANYTHING to do with me she could’ve BEEN texted me or even came up to talk to me.

888,"Throwaway because my friends/family know about my main account.

Let me give you a brief background on my situation - I am currently 19 years old and will be a sophomore in college this year. I came to school on a partial athletic scholarship playing basketball, about half of my tuition is covered on this scholarship. I also have a decent academic scholarship, at the end of the day I'm paying about a third of total tuition.

I played basketball my whole life and come from a huge basketball family... both of my parents and many of my relatives played at the college or pro level. Growing up it wasn't my favorite thing in the world but it was just part of life. I got offers from colleges in high school and it seemed like the obvious choice.

I made it through my freshman year, at times it seemed like hell on earth but I did it. I thought about quitting several times but stuck it through and was extremely proud of myself. However, as my sophomore year is about to begin I'm having SERIOUS doubts about staying on the team for another year. There's several reasons why:

1. I don't love basketball, I like it, but it is not something I'm extremely passionate about. 

2. I didn't play at all my freshman year, I rode the bench and I have a feeling that will be the situation this upcoming season. I come from a small high school and was the best player in the league then, but now that I'm in college I'm way behind physically and talent-wise. I've improved a lot freshman year but still have a ways to go before I will see significant minutes.

3. My grades took a major plunge last semester. I struggled to find time and motivation as basketball was eating up my life.

4. I'm not a huge fan of the partying culture of my school and teammates. I always feel guilty after a night out of drinking.

5. I have no time to work. I will still have a good chunk of debt once I graduate but will have no time to make money until after school.

6. I have been dealing with severe anxiety/depression for the past several years and never take any time to take care of myself. The pressure of basketball only makes things worse. I often tell myself ""If only I wasn't at this school, I'd be okay.""

Despite all these reasons there are also many reasons why I would choose to stick around:

1. MY TEAMMATES! I love them so much, they're some of my best friends in the whole world. Honestly they're the most amazing group of girls I've ever met in my whole life. Leaving the team would mean losing my friendships with them. Sometimes I secretly wish I hated my teammates so I could easily quite basketball and not worry about severing ties with them. But I could never hate them as they are all so amazing.

2. I am absolutely petrified of confronting my parents about leaving. My parents put countless hours and money into my basketball career, I feel as if I would be hurting them and disrespecting them by quitting.

3. I don't want to be a quitter. I don't want to have to explain to friends and family why I quit, I don't want to be ""that person"". I honestly believe I would be very ashamed and feel guilty if I left.

4. Part of me wants to overcome my fears and problems and keep fighting. I know that if I made it through all 4 years of college basketball I would feel amazing.  

5. I don't have a plan if I quit. I would have to transfer schools since its unrealistic for me to stay without my athletic scholarship. But I don't know where I would go to school or what I would do with my life. I don't know a life without basketball - this both excites me and terrifies me. I could finally pursue other things that I've had interest in. I've though about a degree in graphic design or maybe majoring in psychology. I might try to go to art school? Who knows. However I'm also afraid of losing my identity as an athlete as that has been with me almost my entire life.

I apologize for this being long but it has been killing me all summer and I'm desperately looking for answers. If anyone has any insight or experience with this situation I'd greatly appreciate any advice you have.",13Aug2019,1

890,"Please understand that I do not share the viewpoints of the individual I am referring to, and at this time, will not be revealing any identifying information until I can figure out how to report it to the proper people.

My cousin, 24, has been displaying some troubling behaviors over the last year or so. It began with posting generally misogynistic things. This alone was not enough to do anything, or even warrant much of a reaction, but the language he began using in his social media was consistent with Elliot Rodger. It was enough for me to keep it on my radar, but again, not enough to actively warn anyone about. 

In the wake of the El Paso and Dayton shootings, he has become outwardly vocal on a view of his stances, including:

* His views and support of the white nationalist movement (Oddly, he is not 100% ""white"" himself, but passes for white because of his mother, who is white. His biological father is of middle eastern descent)

What's most troubling about this is some of the terminology he has borrowed, including 'the day of the rope.' Originally, I thought he was alluding to suicide, but it seems he is referring to ""The Turner Diaries,"" which is a 1978 work that speaks about white nationalism. There is another book with the same title that also speaks on white nationalism. The coincidences are too much for me to ignore with that one. He has also mentioned starting race wars. 

Nobody *specifically* has been threatened, but I believe this is the potential start of something that could be very dangerous. I am attempting to figure out how I can alert local law enforcement, but my searches do not point me in a specific direction.

891,"Okay, a little background: My boyfriend and I have been dating for over 5 years. We own a home together and both have college degrees. I work full time and he is military on top of working full time. He’s a very self motivated and hard working person. His work ethic far exceeds my own and almost anyone I know.

His brother is going to be 30 years old next month and still lives in their parents’ basement. He barely graduated from high school and he didn’t go to college, which is completely okay, but he never went on to improve himself or gain any skills. He has only ever worked minimum wage, minimum skill jobs such as warehouse stocking. He is very into cosplay and wrestling, which is also completely okay, but he spends all his money and free time on conventions, costumes and toys. He hasn’t had a girlfriend in the entire time I’ve known my boyfriend and he gets mopey about it sometimes. He missed my boyfriend’s birthday dinner because he was waiting around to hear from a girl he recently met online. She said maybe they could hang out that day but never called or texted. That’s the level of desperate he’s on. He also frequently posts passive, self deprecating memes alluding to being depressed and lonely. He definitely needs to see a counselor but I don’t see that ever happening. He made a status recently about being dissatisfied with his job, the pay and the way management treats employees. I very nicely commented that he should look into taking night classes so he can learn a skill and move onto something better. He deleted the whole post! It seems like he’d rather have a pity party than help himself. 

I love their mother and she is a wonderful person, but she enables the brother so much. She is a nurturer and loves having her kids at home but the result is that she’s never pushed him to be get out on his own or do something better than his current situation. Her biggest excuse is that she’s just glad he’s doing the things that make him happy (cosplay, wrestling) and he’s not causing any trouble. At dinner a few weeks ago, their parents were discussing plans for retirement. They’re interested in moving to Florida. His mother “jokingly” said that once they retire and move, if the brother hasn’t left the nest, he’ll just have to come live with us. I awkwardly laughed because I didn’t know what to say. This led to a serious discussion between my boyfriend and myself.  I told him that I’m not okay with taking in his brother. It’s one thing to help someone when they fall on hard times, but it’s another to take them in because...well, for lack of a better term, they’re a bum. My boyfriend has a very strong sense of family, but almost to a fault. He said if his brother needs somewhere to live, then he will move in whether I like it or not. He gets very defensive when his brother’s lack of ambition and motivation is pointed out. Two of our closest friends agree with me and have tried to offer us advice on how to help his brother be more independent so he doesn’t end up living in our basement. My boyfriend was receptive of the advice and knows his brother needs to get his life together, but also seems resolved to just enable his brother forever if all else fails. Maybe it’s because we grew up with different family dynamics, but I find his brother’s behavior unacceptable and I do not want to end up with a live in BIL.

899,"I’ve had my job for about 9 months, and want to change careers. I have been trying to work on a portfolio (which I need) for about 4 months but am not able to gather the motivation after work as I have 12 hour days. My team and manager is in another office interstate, and I don’t have much contact with him. I am thinking of quitting and working on my portfolio for a couple of months, I have the savings for this. Everyone around me, including my parents whom I live with have strong opinions about finding a job before quitting but don’t think I am able to do this and my mental health is deteriorating at this job. Is it really that stupid? 

If I was to quit, my manager goes away for 3 weeks starting next Monday. I have to give a month notice. Is it really bad to do this to my team as he will only have a week to find a replacement. Should I give more notice than required? How do I even go about doing this as I never meet or talk to my manager. Do I request a Skype meeting and tell him then? What do I say? Should I just send an email?

Need some help lol

Tldr; want to make a career change but need to quit to work on portfolio. How do I go about quitting?",13Aug2019,1

I used to get hungry all the time especially before bed but ever since I started working at McDonalds I havent been eating meals at a regurly time (maybe eat a bowl of cereal for breakfast, a small sandwhich on break and no lunch). Then I come home and eat dinner a few hour later but im not even that hungry. Sometimes I just take a few bites of food and dont feel like eating anymore. Im not even full I just dont feel like eating. I dont know what happened to my appetite but its been like this for a few weeks. Anybody relate or know what im experiencing?",13Aug2019,1
901,"Okay, a little background: My boyfriend and I have been dating for over 5 years. We own a home together and both have college degrees. I work full time and he is military on top of working full time. He’s a very self motivated and hard working person. His work ethic far exceeds my own and almost anyone I know.

His brother is going to be 30 years old next month and still lives in their parents’ basement. He barely graduated from high school and he didn’t go to college, which is completely okay, but he never went on to improve himself or gain any skills. He has only ever worked minimum wage, minimum skill jobs such as warehouse stocking. He is very into cosplay and wrestling, which is also completely okay, but he spends all his money and free time on conventions, costumes and toys. He hasn’t had a girlfriend in the entire time I’ve known my boyfriend and he gets mopey about it sometimes. He missed my boyfriend’s birthday dinner because he was waiting around to hear from a girl he recently met online. She said maybe they could hang out that day but never called or texted. That’s the level of desperate he’s on. He also frequently posts passive, self deprecating memes alluding to being depressed and lonely. He definitely needs to see a counselor but I don’t see that ever happening. He made a status recently about being dissatisfied with his job, the pay and the way management treats employees. I very nicely commented that he should look into taking night classes so he can learn a skill and move onto something better. He deleted the whole post! It seems like he’d rather have a pity party than help himself. 

I love their mother and she is a wonderful person, but she enables the brother so much. She is a nurturer and loves having her kids at home but the result is that she’s never pushed him to be get out on his own or do something better than his current situation. Her biggest excuse is that she’s just glad he’s doing the things that make him happy (cosplay, wrestling) and he’s not causing any trouble. At dinner a few weeks ago, their parents were discussing plans for retirement. They’re interested in moving to Florida. His mother “jokingly” said that once they retire and move, if the brother hasn’t left the nest, he’ll just have to come live with us. I awkwardly laughed because I didn’t know what to say. This led to a serious discussion between my boyfriend and myself.  I told him that I’m not okay with taking in his brother. It’s one thing to help someone when they fall on hard times, but it’s another to take them in because...well, for lack of a better term, they’re a bum. My boyfriend has a very strong sense of family, but almost to a fault. He said if his brother needs somewhere to live, then he will move in whether I like it or not. He gets very defensive when his brother’s lack of ambition and motivation is pointed out. Two of our closest friends agree with me and have tried to offer us advice on how to help his brother be more independent so he doesn’t end up living in our basement. My boyfriend was receptive of the advice and knows his brother needs to get his life together, but also seems resolved to just enable his brother forever if all else fails. Maybe it’s because we grew up with different family dynamics, but I find his brother’s behavior unacceptable and I do not want to end up with a live in BIL. 

Anyone else have experience with this?",13Aug2019,1
902,"Two years ago I  bought a vehicle from a dealership that my family did a lot of business with, but my dad had co-signed and done pretty much all of the paper work / negotiating. A year after the purchase of that vehicle, I had been promoted and my dad was bugging me to get him off of the loan. Instead of just refinancing the loan, I decided it was a great idea to buy a brand new car because I could “afford” it. So in April of 2018 I made my first big girl purchase all by myself, a new car. I traded in the car back to the dealership that I had gotten with my dad. At this time I sort of knew what negative equity was- but the salesman told me using rebates he could “get rid” of the negative equity putting me back to 0. I also put $2000 down for this new vehicle. Being naive, and mostly too excited to buy a brand new car I paid no attention to the listing price of the vehicle or the loan amount. I just knew it was around $24k. It took me 3 weeks to sit back and realize I had signed on for a $24,000 loan and had put $2,000 down so essentially was paying $26,000 for a very basic, Chevy Cruze. Upon coming to that realization, I pulled out the paperwork and the interest rate and loan term were greater than I was led to believe- this is completely on me because I should have actually read the paperwork. The salesman was a family friend so I assumed he had my best interest at heart. My fault and my naivety - definitely won’t happen again. 

Anyways, a year and a half later I have been rear ended twice. The first occurring right after I purchased the vehicle, I mean temp tags still on and everything. So not only has the car just generally depreciated, but two accidents later it definitely has. I’ve checked at one dealership to see what they would offer for trade in- It was a generous offer and it still was a whopping $10k less than I owe on the loan. 

I guess my question is, am I totally just screwed with no way of getting out from underneath this? I’m trying to figure out the best way to save some money and time either on this loan or a new car loan. I understand I could pay more each month to reduce the loan length but my monthly payment is already ridiculously high. I can’t fathom paying this amount on a loan for the next 5 years especially when my student loan repayments kick in. Ugh. I made an impulse decision that seems like it’s going to kick my butt for the next 5 years. 

Any advice on how to handle this is appreciated!",13Aug2019,2
903,"So me and my friend have sort of a history of ""he likes me and i like him, but i dont want to ruin our friendship so i won't do anything about it,"".
So last summer i was kind of shocked and a bit sad that he git a girlfriend while away at camp, however he's my friend so as long as hes happy, I'm happy. And well everything seemed nice, his girlfriend seemed a bit off but i just put it down to her being suspicious of his and mines relationship whixh is understandable. However it got to the point where i was aloud to text my friend because she'd get mad, this is when i started to get bothered. They FINALLY broke up around October of last year!! 
And my friend had gotten back to being himself, he even told me he liked me and we were getting closer around Janurary, but then around april he started acting off again.
I found out he was talking to his ex again, ffs. And then just at the start of June they started dating again, i wasn't upset but i was mad because this guy i care about has gone back to the one person that made him so miserable.
She's already put rules in place for him about texting me, she has all of his passwords to everything, and we mostly text on instagram, so while im texting him shell read the text ill send and then add a comment in. 
She got so sick of it, so now i cant text him at all. 
I can't tell if im being unreasonable or if my friend's gf really is a manipulative bitch. I care about him and want the best for him, even if the best isnt me, but i cant talk to him at all, if i try and text him she either tells me to stop or he'll reply with ""k"".
Im at a loss with what to do, i miss the old him and im starting to think I'll never see him again.",13Aug2019,1

She probably feels fat, and always complains about how big her arms are. (Even if they arent.

906,"I am a female who is 16 almost 17, not that it matters.  Every since I turned 14, I’ve been having trouble with myself.  I’ve done different things to cope with my fluctuating mental state.  I’ve been through tons of short lived hobbies, and I’ve adopted and dumped so many different perspectives all of which were mostly positive. 
 But recently, I’ve been feeling sort of pessimistic.  I’m feeling a very real amount of impending doom.  I’m having apocalyptic dreams and I really feel like the world is dying.  

I’ve recently downloaded a news app that updates me on world events, because people have convinced me to stay aware.  I’ve been watching political themed movies, to try and understand what the fuck is going on.  I’ve been watching documentaries about the universe and how it works.  I’ve been trying to stay aware, but the more I know the harder it is to feel alright.  So then, I started watching less horror movies and more comedies, because I’m exposing myself to too much negativity.  This works in the day, but at night when I lay down to sleep, I stare at my wall and think about how I have no control over anything.  

The worst thing is when I’m off on one of my thought tangents, I can’t even take myself seriously because I’m not sure that I’m seeing things correctly.  Who’s to say red is red and not green, do you know what I mean?   I’ve got too many perspectives for one person, I’m all mixed up.  

What can I do about all this?",13Aug2019,3
907,"I posted this in another sub, but I only received one reply and that person admitted they didn’t actually read what I wrote. 😐

I’ll try my luck here. Hopefully someone can read my post.

All my interactions with people lately have left me feeling like total crap. It’s really starting to get me down. I‘m struggling with depression  and starting to form a strong dislike towards people because of so many negative experiences. 

I became really isolated during an abusive relationship that lasted several years. I had no friends other than my abusive partner. I’ve been trying really hard to change that since my relationship ended. I also cut ties with my mentally disordered parents and dysfunctional extended family. I had a horribly abusive upbringing. I have been completely alone for over a year now. I basically live like a hermit and I don’t like it.

I have tried to open myself up to new social situations to meet new people. I’ve experienced pretty extreme depression and anxiety due to past trauma, but I don’t let it show. I try to be friendly, show interest in others and get to know people. I make a point to remember everyone’s names and learn things about them. I’ve read lots of books on psychology and improving myself and my social skills. But the people I have met have shown zero interest in getting to know me. They only seem to want to talk about themselves and even those conversations have to be initiated by me. I’m not weird or socially  inept. I have good hygiene and and take care of my appearance. So it‘s nothing related to that. 

I’ve been volunteering for around 2 years at a sanctuary for animals. This is where I’ve been meeting people. I work as a freelancer from home, so I don’t get to make friends that way. 

The volunteer work was something I felt very passionate about at first, but over time my interactions with people have left me feeling kind of terrible every time I go there.

The sanctuary is not close either. It’s a 4 hour drive there and back and I drive there by myself. There is nothing like that in my area. I’ve been to all their volunteer days and events. It’s run by a family who I was hoping to become closer with over time, but that hasn’t happened. It took over a year before I was even invited into their house and that was only a one time thing with other volunteers. I’ve never been invited there to spend time as a friend. 

I’ve also tried to get to know all of the volunteers (mostly the handful of regulars, since I only see some of them once), but they don’t seem to like people or want to talk much. Some are decades older than me too, so there’s that. None of them are friends with each other. They are obviously there for the animals only. Over time they come and go, too. I try to get to know everyone I meet though. 

I spent a lot of time getting to know the family that runs this place. The owners, their kids, their parents. The adults are all friendly on the surface. By this I mean, they’ll talk to me in a friendly way when I initiate conversation and they hug me hello/goodbye when I go there. But that’s where it ends.

I feel like my presence is only wanted for my donations and volunteer work. Other than that, this family hasn’t even asked me a single question about myself or tried to get to know me at all in 2 YEARS. I have them all on Facebook, which only has a couple of photos of my cats and their sanctuary animals, because I don’t share much on it. But even then, I don’t get any likes or comments from any of them.

They invited me to their Christmas party last year at their house, along with all the other volunteers. Which I was happy about because I was spending that Christmas alone. I mentioned this to them, but no one even asked me anything about that. They knew I was in a relationship and that we separated, because they met my ex once. But they didn’t know him or that he was abusive. They never ask any questions about me ever, they don’t know anything about me. 

I actually caught and rescued two animals that live at their sanctuary and drove them all the way there, with no help whatsoever from them. I wasn’t even invited in for a glass of water or toilet break after the long drive. I had to drive straight back home because it was the middle of winter. 

I’ve donated money, gift cards, food, items for the animals and brought whatever I could that they needed. I’ve attended all their potlucks and brought food and drinks and cookies and snacks. I’m the only person who drives hours to get  there. Everyone else is local. I have to rent a car to do it each time too (because I’ve been saving to buy a car of my own). They know that much because I told them.

This summer the owner desperately wanted gluten free buns for an event at the last minute and said she would pay anyone for the bread if they could find it because her local shop was out. I bought her a few bags which wasn’t cheap. She didn’t even thank me, or give me any money for them. I was planning on telling her she didn’t have to pay me and could consider it a donation, but she didn’t even try to pay me back for them. I decided to just let it go and not bring it up. 

Recently I noticed she was attending a festival in my city to promote her sanctuary. She’s never been to my city before. It showed up in my feed and I asked her about it. She said she was invited to speak at the event in my area. I sent her a message saying that if she needed any help with anything or just wanted company to let me know, because I would totally go. She read the message, but didn’t even respond. 

She’s ignored my messages a couple of times before, when I sent her my condolences when some of the animals passed away. I’ve given her cards and everything. But she didn’t say anything. Not even just ‘thank you’. I don’t know, I just find that rude. I wouldn’t do that.

She was sending me updates about the animals I rescued along with a couple of photos here and there on messenger during the first month (because I asked her to), but she stopped shortly after and hasn’t messaged me about anything at all in a year and a half.

I get this weird vibe that she doesn’t actually like me, but wants whatever I have to offer that she might need. :(

She gets a lot of help. Her whole sanctuary is run on donations and volunteers.

Her parents are a little more friendly and jokey with me, but even they don’t try to get to know me or ask me questions about me. We just talk about them or the animals when I initiate or approach them if I see them around. If I mention anything about me the conversation just turns into an awkward monologue, so I don’t even try anymore.

I’ve driven back home in tears a few times feeling so sad and lonely after spending a day there. Then I get pissed off and consider just never going back. Which would further isolate me. I also feel attached to the animals. The sad thing is if I disappeared, I know that none of them would even say a thing. They don’t really care about me as a person.

Is this just what most people are like? 

Are my expectations too high?

Why is it so hard to make friends? Or meaningful connections? I feel like just avoiding people all together, but that makes me equally as miserable as being around them.

912,"Hey, I just wanna make sure I'm not crazy and being unrealistic about how I feel about this. Here are the facts.

I dated this girl for 7 months it was good but then she decided to break up with me, we were both upset but I didn't have any hard feelings towards her. About 2 months later she started talking to me again and eventually said that she wanted to get back together. I constantly asked her if she was sure she wanted to and she kept saying yes, we hung out a fair bit and I got strong feelings for her again. After we had hung a fair bit and she was ""certain"" she wanted to get back together she pulled the pin on it and told me she couldn't. After I was so close to getter over her she pulled me back to square 1 then fuqced off. So needless to say I want nothing to do with her ever again and I have very hard negative feelings towards her.

SO anyway that's the backstory. My mate and her were friends before he even met me not super close but still good friends. After we meet we became 100% best mates. its been about 2 months since that happened and now he is getting a lot closer to her as a friend like just talking a lot more and hanging out with her a lot outside of school. It might be wrong but I feel like its a bit dog of him to be such good friends with her after what she did to his supposed best mate. Other people I've talked to agree with me but that might be biased because they are my friends and family
