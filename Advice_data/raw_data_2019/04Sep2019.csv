He has a wonderful sense of humor. He's really short but I think it's adorable. One time I tried to say hi and I waved and opened my mouth but all I said was ""uhhhhh."" He probably thinks I'm fucking weird. I don't know how to approach him. I don't know where to start. What do I do",04Sep2019,7
1,"Every day I wake up extra paranoid and I have huge panic attacks all the time. I've developed some kind of psychosis, I'm hallucinating now and the personalities that have traumatized me echo around in my head threatening me and trying to make me capitulate. The police don't believe my story. My mom has 400,000 dollars of my fathers life insurance that she won't give me hardly any of even though I need to go to another town just to stay safe. I want to go to Hollywood and start a career in either porn, music, movies or internet content like youtube and podcasting.

No one wants to donate to me but I really need that money from my mom. I can't be homeless, I'm concerned that a homeless person will try to kill me (it's happened to me before). Every day is difficult and sometimes its hard for me to stop thinking suicidal thoughts. I need to start over with a new group of people.

I don't want to go through this anymore it's too hard. Can someone give me advice? I want to prosecute whoever is really responsible for all this shit and get an out of court settlement or something. I don't want to die poor and alone.",04Sep2019,17
2,"Hi, I'm a F(18) and about 7 months ago I got out of relationship because I did not share the same feelings as my partner.  Things did not end well and we do not talk regularly since I have him blocked on everything except text.  He messages me occasionally because we run into each other randomly ( I respond respectfully, but I do not wish to maintain a relationship) and I am under the impression that he was on good terms with how he felt about me. My friend recently told me that he believes that I have accused him of sexual assault (which I have NOT) and thinks I have said ""other things"" about him which I haven't (she did not specify these things). I do not really wish to talk to him, but I feel like it's a huge deal and it's really bothering me and makes me feel sick.  Our relationship was my first, and at times I did feel slightly taken advantage of because of how naive I was and the fact I was suffering from severe depression, but I never told any of my friends that fact. But apparently, it was one of my friends who told him that I said he sexually assaulted me. I would never say that because I don't believe it to be true. Do I message him? My friend said it was not a big deal but I feel gross about it. Please help.",04Sep2019,1
3,"I’m not the most confident person, and I feel like I’m worried about what people around me think of me.  For example I don’t like waving at people because it makes me self conscious, even to friends.  My other friend for example, doesn’t give two shits and she was just waving to everyone as we were driving.  Another example is that I feel self conscious when running, even though cars are going by fast and even if I’m running in a group for cross country.  I guess subconsciously I’m worried about people staring or drawing attention to myself, how do I get over this?",04Sep2019,4
4,"My roommate and I are signed up for a lease that runs through next year, but we had a falling out and I'm no longer living there as of last week. In looking at our lease, I see that I'll still be liable for the lease-breaking fee by moving out, which is pretty staggering (over 2 grand).

My roommate intends to continue renting the place and paying the full rent (and has the income to do so), so is there any way I can avoid paying this in full? I've wondered about just leaving my name on the lease, but it seems like that would cause issues when trying to rent a new place (which I'm on the hunt for now). Also not sure if he and I are on good enough terms to make that work, but, we'll just have to see on that one.

13,"A little background:

Over the last two years, I saved gift cards worth ~$800+.  I received them through distant family members, as well as compensation prizes from a previous job. I mainly was saving the cards because my girlfriend is interviewing across the country for medical school and I wanted to use them as travel compensation so I can be there for my girlfriend as emotional support.

I kept the gift cards in my nightstand drawer and never moved them. I was very conscious of where I kept them because ~$800+ is a lot of money for us.

My situation now:

This weekend we were delighted to find out my girlfriend received an interview invite at one of her top choices across the country! I excitingly went to pull out the gift cards from my nightstand and was astonished when all were missing except two lower quantity amounts. My girlfriend and I were, of course, frustrated. 

My girlfriend and I live alone.  We are heavily invested in our careers and sadly do not have ANYONE over ever.  The only other people that enter our home are a team of two maids that come weekly. I hate to jump to conclusions, however, there is no one that it possibly could be. 


Naturally, I didn't take pictures or make copies of the cards, so I don't have the numbers associated with each card, therefore I don't have a way to check their usage. I also don't have a video camera near my nightstand drawer. 

I am looking for advice on how to approach the maids regarding the situation when they come on Wednesday.  I have little doubt it wasn't the maids, and I understand that I most likely won't get the money back, but I want to try.

What would you do in my situation?",04Sep2019,1
14,"[Short descriprion of me] 
I have anxiety. 
But I think that I handle it very well and I worked my way up to where I am now. 
I got my drivers license, graduated and proved multiple times to myself that I’m able to do a lot of stuff even tho I have anxiety. I learned to control it and to live with it. I’m doing really good right now. 

[The problem I have now] 
So I decided to do a 3 month trip to Costa Rica which is far away from home (Luxembourg, Europe) to learn some spanish and discover a new culture, see the world outside Luxembourg. 
It’s going to be the biggest challenge I’ve ever done and I’m really proud that I’m doing that. 
But I  know that there are going to be though, challenging situations because I was never so long and so far away from home and I’m sure that it’ll be hard sometimes. 
But I also know from the past that I have enough willpower and motivation to make an effort and cope with difficult situations. 
So all in all I was sure that I was prepared. 
Until now. 

Today I learned that my dog is very close to be put down. My family and I know that he is very ill, actually he is ill since his birth. He has a disease named Protein Losing Entheropathy. 
But today the doctor said that there isn’t much hope for him to live a normal life, that he had to eat one typical food for the rest of his life and nothing (!) else. 
But my dog doesn’t want to eat that food. 
Actually, he has it since a couple of months but he never touches it and we gave him “better” food, our food. 
But apparently, his immune system can’t handle other food without vomiting blood, shaking, not having any power to move,...
He also lost an awful lot of weight. 
So we are asking ourselves what to do. 
It’s either he eats his one food and lives quite “normal” or he keeps avoiding it and starves to death because we can’t give him sth else. 
That would then result in us having to put him down. 
And chances are very high that he won’t eat it, boycott it and won’t get well. 
(And we don’t really know if he even gets better with that food after all. It’s just a theory because it worked back then in spring until we gave him other stuff because he started avoiding it. And we don’t know if it would still work now even if he ate it.)

It’s difficult for me because obviously I’m about to lose my beloved friend who always was waiting for me , with whom I had so much fun and who cheered me up in MY hard times. 
And also I don’t know how to handle the fact that I don’t know what happens after my departure to Costa Rica. I don’t know if I’m going to see him again or if it’s goodbye on Sept. 15. 
And if so, I can’t imagine the situation at the airport holding him one last time and not seing him ever again without crying. 

And this adds a whole new level to my challenging stay in CR. All of a sudden, I’m not sure if I’m able to mentally manage all this burden in CR without being able to talk to friends, to my parents,.. 
I’m a person who reacts very emotional to situations like this and I don’t know how to cope with it, in addition to the fact that I’m on my biggest and hardest adventure ever. (All alone) 

Maybe one of you has experienced similar situations or simply can give me a little advice how to handle this mentally. 
I really don’t want to cancel the trip xD

When I turned around because he said the test was over, he told me all the things I had to do to reschedule my test, but gave me absolutely no advice, and he said it like it was a routine and that he was sick of saying it. When he went out to talk to my father about it, I tried to keep my composure, but couldn't and started to cry, as I have Asperger's so it's extremely difficult for me to control my emotions. When my dad came around to talk to me, I thought he'd say words of encouragement or comfort, instead he cursed at me and told me to stop crying.

The ride home was dead silent.

When I got home I yelled into my pillow and cried for another hour or so, which resulted in my dad cursing at me again and telling me to get over it.

I had dinner with my mom, and she sounded much more sympathetic towards me, though she tried not to mention it at all. However, when she mentioned it on the car ride home, I couldn't hold myself together and let loose all of my bottled emotions, saying things along the lines of ""I let everybody that believed in me down"" and ""I'm a failure"". I brought up the fact that even though I was comfortable driving with my permit before and had successfully parallel parked, I had lost all confidence in myself due to the instructor and my dad's words, and didn't want to drive ever again.

My boyfriend has undeniably been going through a lot lately. His job is a really big question mark right now, he's either going to be accepted as full time or completely laid off and he has no idea which it will be. He's in debt to someone, so it's really stressing him out. He also doesn't really know what he wants to do career wise in the long term. It kind of hinders on whether or not he'll be able to stay in the place he is now, which in and of itself  hinders on getting this full time position. 

His uncertainty and stress with life overall,I guess, has just bled into our relationship. We had a discussion where he basically said that he doesn't know if he wants to be with me right now. He says he loves me, but that he's just so unsure of everything that he can't have a relationship...I guess? 

Except he isn't exactly treating it as a break up, because he'll still tell me he loves me and he calls me everyday to talk like we usually do. He keeps saying that he just needs to get his shit together and he doesn't want to lose me, but he also doesn't want to be dating me?? I don't know what to do with that.

I'm hopelessly in love with him, and so I don't know what to do. Has anyone ever felt like he does? Or been in a situation like this? Because I'm really struggling to see his point. In my mind, if you love someone, nothing can get in between you wanting to be with them. A couple should be a team, and if one of you is really going through it, the other is there to support you.

42,"my ex (referred to as they/them) and i are still friends and they enjoy being around my friends so i gladys invite them to outings. we recently have been growing apart and losing contact weeks at a time. however i met with my friends today and turns out they were going to go and chill with them. they’re making plans without me who is the purpose of them being there. also, turns out they’ve also started to speak with one of my friends which i think is a very mean thing to do, not to the fault of my friend as they don’t know the situation between me and my ex. but as my ex’s fault as it’s a bad thing to do and they know i’ve told them not to talk to my mates. 

i’m stuck in a strange place as seeing him often doesn’t help me recover from the relationship and i don’t want him taking my friends away from me as well as maybe persueing one of them which would help me further. 

i don’t know what to do. why can’t my ex go to their own mates? they have them! why mine?",04Sep2019,1

46,"Hi, this is my first post on reddit so forgive me if i'm a bit of a mess.

To cut to the chase, I require a lot of encouragement. My self esteem is pretty bad, however I definitely don't want just like empty words or an inflated ego, if that makes sense. Like I just need someone to notice that I'm trying, is what I'm getting at, because a lot of the time it feels like no one does.  Another thing I feel I should also note is that words of affirmation is 100% my main love language. I love telling people I love them, giving compliments, writing poems and stories. Every time I send a gift using Amazon, you bet the little gift message portion is filled to the character limit with whatever I could say to make that person feel loved. My actual question boils down to: at what point is needing outside encouragement detrimental/bad/negative? I am working on my self esteem as best I can but it's very difficult to differentiate between what is me not receiving love the way I want to (words of affirmation) or me needing validation from other people when I should be looking for that validation within myself.",04Sep2019,1
47,"So here's my(18M) situation right now. I've been struggling to get a job all summer, before summer, etc. And overtime I just kept on applying, and applying, and applying and eventually. I got a call, for an interview tomorrow, great! Then I get another one for Friday, also cool! Backup plan and what not, then I got another one for saturday. Insane! Except here's where I get mixed up now. This now means I have a chance at all three jobs. So here's my scenario, two of the jobs are dishwasher and one is sales associate. Personally I and my family want the sale associate if I can get it, now here's the issue, let's say I don't get it, ok cool, I have two more offers, now one of the places is apparently fantastic with students and works perfect to my times, the other place is decent to my times, neither are in walking distance by any means, but the one that's fantastic with my times and with students is about double the distance, whereas the other one that's closer is approximately 5 or so minutes away, give or take. So I guess my summed up question, say I don't get the sales associate job, which dishwasher offer should I take?

49,"I'm the last of 4 boys in an upper middle class household, about to graduate high school after this year. Recently, in the 6 months or so, my dad has been up my ass about *everything* no matter how big or small. For example, tonight, there was a function for a small school group to greet people coming into the school. I missed this, as the 1 email sent about it was 5 days ago, buried in over 100 emails since i had not had my phone for a week(I had forgotten it at home and we were away). He found out and flipped out at me, saying I am on cruise control, I'm lazy, and that this shows a lot about how I've changed from who I used to be. After this I wonder how many mistakes im allowed to make per month...1? Another example would be that I, out of a selection process I have 0 control over, was not chosen as a leader for another school group. For years he said it would be great if I got chosen as a leader and fine if not. It was not fine. He resents both me and the choosers, and has made multiple arguments over me being different or not being me because of it. I counter everything he brings up, and it's always followed by ""It isn't just about that"" or a head nod and switch of topic.

I have a gut feeling that my friends might possably be trying to set me up. 3 months ago i stopped engaging in illegal activities with said friends, and moved out of the city with my family to get my life together. My best friend, we will call him G, claimed to be an ex gangbanger (washington boys surenos).
    Deep inside i had a feeling G was lying, most of his friends i met at parties were obvious gangbangers, some of them seemed to dislike me due to my skin color (i'm a white dude) and the fact that im not a wigger, i was always not scared to be myself seemed to throw them off. I have seen this said group of people speak and do acts of violence against other people.
      Now i am leaving the area for good to join the Army. I gave G a heads up that i would be leaving and he wants me to come down to our old neighborhood to kick it after these 3 months. Im having these feelings i have never felt before going to kick it it with him. Its a bad feeling deep inside my gut. Like a month ago i had a dream he was threatening to harm me.

54,"Hi reddit. I'm a 22 y/o lad who went to college for half a semester in the US after high school and ended up dropping out due to a lot of unregulated mental health issues. I'm on a good regiment now and want desperately to return to school, but my student loan debt has gotten pretty bad the last couple years. All 3 are defaulted. I moved from my home state Nebraska to Florida a year ago with the promise from my parents that they would help me try to pay them off so I can go back, but my dad has decided not to help me at all and my mom just sort of gave up and ignores the topic now. Now I have to pay them off completely by myself and my job history looks pretty bad with all the years of mental health fuck ups so literally nobody is hiring me down here. I get interviews occasionally but don't ever seem to impress at them. I'm stuck at my mom's place until I figure something out and it feels really hopeless, it's been almost a year of me literally doing nothing. Just applying for terrible jobs that don't even want me. I guess something I would like some advice on is about going to school in a different country...is it even remotely possible for somebody in my situation? Will I be treated like any other US student applying for foreign colleges out of high school or will they take the loans into account? It makes me feel like a complete loser seeing all my high school friends graduating and progressing their lives while I've been stuck in one place this whole time.

55,"So basically ill just try to summarize my last few years.

1. Went to college for physics and philosphy with low self esteem and mild depression (hadn't really noticed even though one of my close friends suggested I might be depressed)

2. Switched physics over to philosophy. Even though I always loved the philosophy classes I couldn't really tell how much I was enjoying physics and psychology because I hated the college lifestyle. I had very little friends and even ones I had I wasnt super close to any of them.

3. Got super depressed and stopped talking to my old friends. I only had 4 really.... One moved to NY. One thinks I'm lazy because he hates pot smokers, like myself. One told me to my face he hates me for different reasons but primarily because I'm no longer religious (we've been friends since 1st grade and religion was huge to both of us. And my last friend is really the only one who I still talk to but I honestly just feel low when I'm around him because I just feel so inferior. All four graduate at the end of this school year.

4.Dropped from college and had a suicide attempt.

5. Got therapy and went back to my deadbeat pizza job in my hometown. 

And now it's the present and I'm no closer to anything than I was 3 years ago. 

I don't know if I want to do college. Don't really feel like I have a choice but everything I do and everywhere I go I just feel so out of place. Like I  don't being anywhere.

56,"I am the backup for a woman at my job and vice versa. Essentially, when she is not in the office, I cover all her work as well as my own, and she does the same for me when I am not in. The only reason we do this is because we can alternate Fridays off on a shared compressed schedule. 

She was recently offered a new role in the company. I’m super happy for her as it’s a great opportunity but it’s created some issues for me. 

Instead of hiring someone to replace her, upper management has decided that since I have shown I can handle both our workloads, they are just going to shift all her work to me. When I was told this by my reporting manager, I said ok, even though this is a LOT of work to have to do every day, but what is the compensation going to be like?

Nothing, apparently, because “I am doing the work right now anyway”. 

They will be saving at minimum 45K a year by not replacing her. It also seems like I will be losing my every other Friday off because I can’t see how it will work if there is no one to cover for me anymore. 

Everyone I’ve talked to about this thinks it’s unfair and should demand a raise or not do it, but I need some unbiased opinions! Is this as unreasonable as I think it is?

64,"Using a throwaway for obvious reasons even though i don't think anyone i work with browses reddit but you never know.

I work as a construction inspector in an East Coast state. The type of project I am working on is removing bad concrete from parts of a bridge, and placing new concrete in its place. Everything was going smoothly until about a month-month and a half ago. The contractors foreman was walking around the site without his hard hat and vest on, so I tell him to please put them on because he can't be walking around without them on. He then proceeds to call me an MF'er and vulgarly threatened to show his superiority toward me as well as asking the higher ups above us what the policy is. I immediately walked away and told my field boss, who then had a discussion with him in private. Field boss then tells me that he was told that he can't be talking to people like that and that he's supposed to be wearing his hat and vest at all times during work hours. I figure it dies down here, seeing as I didn't feel the need to elevate further, as there had been no other problems prior to this point. Boy was I wrong. This guy continues to harass me, as well as his own laborers. Some of the ways im being harassed include:

* Start time is normally 6:30 am. Some days ill admit i'm late by no more than 5 minutes (which I understand I can't be doing). Sometimes the foreman likes to take measurements of the repair patches, and he's **never** ready to go at 6:30. Usually we don't begin until after 7:00 and he has the audacity to report me to my field boss for being late, holding him up, etc. when he's **not even ready** to measure. He doesn't even measure them himself and sometimes he'll even report me to my field boss **before** 6:30 am.
* Wants me to falsify my paperwork.
* Reports me for sitting in my car and playing on my phone all day when that wasn't the case. That particular day I was in my car when his laborers that were placing new concrete **took their lunch break.** He may even be violating the union rules/laws whatever you call it on the laborers getting lunch break but i don't have definitive evidence on that. As for the phone thing, I was using it to document measurements because he had his guys place new concrete in a different area of the bridge that I had measured that morning. Whether or not this was on purpose I can't prove.
* When I called my supervisors about the harassment (field boss works for a different company), he lied to my field boss' boss who came out to find out what was going on. I know this because one of the laborers got my number from a co-inspector (I'm assuming) and texted me about it, and I was/continue to be scolded by upper management for things that I did **NOT** do.
* This guy also has a history of being fired from jobs for harassing inspectors (according to one of his laborers) but I'm not sure if anyone knows that yet.

I could post more, but that list is long. So yeah, things aren't good at work. And to top it off, I heard through word of mouth that this foreman had been saying racist comments toward one of his laborers. I told him about it, and he filed a complaint against the foreman about it. Well I guess the laborer made the complaint sound like I said it, which he and I know that I didn't, and he knows the foreman harasses me, so he (laborer) said he'll make sure I don't get in trouble. I've repeatedly told my field boss about this foreman harassing me, but he claims he's powerless to make the foreman stop. His boss (the one that came out to talk to the foreman) doesn't understand that I'm being harassed, and continues to believe the foreman. My boss' at my employer are mad at me too for not reporting the racial comments to my field boss. Looking back, I probably should have done that, but he doesn't do anything about the harassment as it is. This whole thing got elevated to HR, the state, etc., and the contractors higher ups want **ME** fired because pretty much all the management positions related to my project really believe that I'm the one misbehaving and causing problems. Its getting to the point where I can barely focus on work and it bothers me outside of work. I'm sure I left some things out so ill post them if i have to. Thanks for all help.",04Sep2019,1

71,"This isn’t a big deal, but it’s big enough to me to be worthy of some inspection. So to start off, I don’t live the most mentally healthy life, I deal with depression often, I am very stressed by school, and I have fair anxiety. Also quickly going to mention I’m a 15 year old American boy in high school. Anyway, last year I started running for my school’s track team and it was not a very supportive or hospitable environment. So near the end of the season I had a really bad race, I it beat hard by a the other racers who were all 2 years older than me, and I beat myself up getting over those hurdles like I finished with welts on my splinted shins and a nice gash on my knee. I remember it being a lot of pain and I remember the sheer amount of energy I used and the feeling of adrenaline when I walked up to the stands where I treated myself and then sat for the rest of the meet.

So flash forward about 8 months to today where something weird happened. In my Latin class I was just sitting my mind wandering, and sometimes I think about my races last year and get a little stress in the pit of my stomach. But today the thought of that one bad race crept into the back of my mind, but it didn’t stop and it kept going until I couldn’t focus on my work and I started sweeting and my flight sense was through the goddamn roof. I snapped out of it when the teacher asked me a question and I struggled through that, but it took nearly 40 minutes for the feeling to subdue after that. So now I’m wondering if that was some symptom of a PTSD flashback of some sorts? Anyways, I don’t need expert opinions but I would like some input. Thanks guys

She has discovered pee stains in her room whether it being the bed corner, blanket, my nephew's pants, etc. At first I believed her until evidence proved otherwise. 

1. My nephew sucks at peeing: considering the fact that he holds in his pee unless somewhat holds his hand, it is possible he has been peeing in the room. (SEEN HIM DO THIS BEFORE)
2. I sat with my dog doing my paper all day yesterday, yet when she comes home she coincidentally finds another stain 2 hours later -- dog is still with me.
3. MOST DAMNING EVIDENCE: in the morning she came in yelling that he peed again, I told her to close her door. She leaves the door closed and I lock my dog in my parent's bathroom -- I hate it but I left him food, water, a weeweepad, and his favorite toys. I come home and she tells me that he just peed in her room again; my dog, however,  is still in the bathroom with a newly wet weeweepad. 

She then blows up and exclaims that if she sees him in her room or another stain, she will ""break his f--ing neck"".

It's like I want to feel content, I want to have friendships, maintain relationships and jobs for longer than two months at a time, but I just can't. 

I really just have exhausted every option I feel like is available to me. I feel completely hopeless.",04Sep2019,2
80,"Sorry this might drag on a little bit, I'll try to be succinct.

I'm 34  years old, married, no kids (or plans to have any.)

Growing up, my father was a hard-working guy.  We immigrated to the US from another country.  He didn't speak any English.  Both he and my mom worked very hard to provide for us.  He eventually completed college and is now a well-paid professional.  My mom is comfortably retired on a pension.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, they divorced when I was around 17-18, my father moving out and leaving my mom and my siblings with the house.  I lived for awhile with my mom until I finished college myself and moved out to get my own place and marry my girlfriend.  During all that time, my father and I had almost zero contact.. the occasional phone call was about it.

&amp;#x200B;

This didn't surprise me or even bother me much.. growing up, he was never very close with us.  He was stressed, often irritable, and seemed to have a total disdain for holidays.. even birthdays.  We rarely spent time together.  I can remember my mom goading him in to taking my brother and I out every weekend at least once just to have quality time.. but that lasted probably only 2-3 outings before he quit giving a shit about it.  He displayed almost no interest in my life--attending not a single one of my cherished school events (band recitals, marching band shows, etc etc.).  He didn't even attend my HS graduation.  It was my mom who was there for all of these things.  She'd make time no matter what.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, our relationship was never great.. and it was actually a relief to me to not have to live with him anymore.  He never spoke a word about it with me or my siblings.. he just up and left one day, only returning to get some of his things and not saying a word.  I had to learn about it through my mom.  Whatever, thought I.  We all sort of agreed it was better.

&amp;#x200B;

I was left to assume he was just fed up with being a family man.  I was born when he was in his early 20's, after all.  Maybe he was never cut out for it.. these sort of things I could understand and live with.  I felt no shame or guilt.  However it turned out to not be the case.  Shortly after he left, he re-married.  If I recall, it was actually within a year or so.  Re-married, and had another kid.

&amp;#x200B;

This was the part that always bothered me.. instead of feeling like I had a father who just didn't want to commit to the family life forever, I was left feeling like part of some failed attempt.  As though he thought, ""I can do better than that.. let me try again.""  So, being a dad is a fine idea.. just not -my- dad.  Got it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never been able to reconcile this feeling.. merely forget it after so many years of separation.

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoy my life tremendously right now, despite the ups-and-downs common to everyone.. my wife is amazing, and my in-laws are the sweetest people.. they call me on my birthday and send me gifts.. it honestly makes me tear up to think about because they are so much more thoughtful and nice to me than someone who is actually my blood.

Here is the problem, though.. my father keeps finding just enough time every year to worm his way back in to my thoughts.. he'll have weeks where for whatever reason he starts calling my phone incessantly.. leaving VM's, texts.. until I answer and  engage him in some insipid conversation about what we're doing.  Then, he'll half-heartedly talk about making plans to get together.. so that he can meet my wife and such.. all the while sounding like he's being held at gunpoint.  It's difficult to sit through without going off.   The last attempt was a few weeks ago.. we made totally non-committal plans to meet (for the first time in .. 10 years or so?), the ball left in his court to get back to me with a day/time.. and big surprise, never heard anything since.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically it seems every time I finally forget about this guy long enough to not be bothered anymore, he pulls this kind of shit and gets me in such a horrible mood all over again, and makes me feel stupid for ever thinking ""Maybe this time will be different.""  I feel dumb for letting myself get fooled so many times.  I suppose I just keep thinking it'd be a good thing.. maybe some good would come of it.. but it never does.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel halfway to reconciliation, in that I once told him exactly how I felt.. that while I was thankful for everything he did for me as a child (raising me \[sort of\] or at the very least providing for me), that my life as a grown man has been entirely without him.  All that'd be left would be for me to start ignoring or blocking the phone calls.. stopping this intrusion.  The permanence of that decision bothers me.. I want to be a better person than him.. but what does a better person do?  I feel like even the fact that I have to ask this makes me bad, somehow.  My instincts tell me to ignore him for good.  

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice.. or shared experiences are welcome.. Thanks for reading.",04Sep2019,1
81,So my girlfriend and I recently tried using Taco Bell mild sauce as lube... long story short that didn’t go well. What types of food would you recommend to spice up our sex life?,04Sep2019,0
82,"so my family has always been ok in the money department. we’re not poor but not we’re rich either. just enough to live comfortably. with that i usually get some nice things. 

however i’m always scared to wear or use some of these nice things when i’m at school, thinking i’d come off as a showoff. airpods for example (im basic i know). i’ve had them since december but i bring wired ones to school and use airpods when i’m at home or anywhere else. bc i feel like people would think i’m belittling them or making them feel less. or i just feel embarrassed in a way? i don’t want people to think i’m showing off. i don’t exactly know how to word it.

goes for anything else too. like shoes i really like, branded clothes, electronic products etc etc etc. even just bringing backpack like a kanken makes me feel odd because everyone has a jansport. 

idk maybe it’s just me or a first world problem thing lol but i hope the point or general idea gets across",04Sep2019,1
83,"This is something that I've thought about for a very long time, and ever since summer ended, I am ready to get out of this house. It's kinda a long rant, but for short, I want to move to my grandparents, but my dad hasn't agreed in the past, so I want a good way to bring it up, that won't make me sound like I'm being an emotional girl who is simply on her ""week"" (yes, he said something similar to this)

(For context-all in the past)
My brother (13), dad, and me used to live at my grandparents ever since I was 13. 3 years ago, my dad met his current girlfriend, and a few months later, we are living with her. I didn't know her at all, and I was highly uncomfortable staying there so suddenly. I take awhile to warm up to people, and I generally don't try to get to know people, unless they come up to me. Early on, she displayed ""nice girl behaivor"" and the tendency to lie about little things. She constantly claimed that my mom was emailing her threats, proven false, and would start fights over small things like blaming me and my brother for leaving out drinks and being wasteful, even though we were never outside our room. There's a lot worse stuff but I don't want to get into it.
My dad constantly complains about her, he's stressed out all the time, yet he won't leave, despite me begging him to. I hate seeing her start fights and screaming, trying to get someone to call the cops, while my dad tries to get away. Once we leave to my grandparents, she begs for us to come back, and we always go back. She plays nice for 2 weeks, and it's another fight all over again. It's been this way for all 3 years (my entire high school experience) I'm tired of it.

(Breaking point)

Early January, after begging my dad for a dog for years, all of a sudden his girlfriend brings home a puppy. Me and my brother love him immediately, but she keeps the dog in her room for the first few days. Eventually, she gets super annoyed that he keeps peeing and pooping inside her room, so he is plopped into our room. He immediately snuggles against us, and she tells us that he's our dog now. We begin potty training him right away, and working on tricks, since we had wanted to make him the best boy ever. Not even a week later, all of a sudden the landlord supposedly says that no dogs are allowed, despite the fact that none of us heard it except for the girlfriend, and that the neighbor has a dog that barks all night.
The dog is then sent to my grandparents, who happily agreed and thankfully live near us. He's been there this entire time. This recent summer my mom allowed us to bring him, and it was a blast. We got to take him for walks and to the dog park. He learned sit, roll over, lie down, shake, and high-five! He only had one accident the entire summer, and we all adore him. Towards the end of summer, my dad tells me we have a house with a big backyard for the dog, but he also hints at us having two more dogs, which makes us even more excited. There was no mention of his girlfriend, so I'm even happier. 
Summer ends, and we get to see the new house, it does indeed have a big yard, a pool, and our own rooms (me and my brother had shared one for an incredibly long time) it seems like a dream. The dogs seem fine with mine, but it's too hot for him outside, so he stays in. Then his girlfriend comes home, immediately complaining that our dog scratched her, even though he didn't, and she made it clear that she didn't want him. Not even 2 hours later, one of the dogs attack my dog. My dog then injures him, since he's slightly bigger than them, and the girlfriend flips out, then my dog is sent back to my grandma's. I never cried so much in one day, I cried so much that I couldn't even produce more tears. It was this that had pushed me to finally move out. I hated leaving him, and even now my grandma says that he mopes and is losing weight, I feel awful, since it wasn't his fault for defending himself. 
I hate this house, and don't care for these two dogs. I hate seeing my dad, and his girlfriend, and I hate having to care for these dogs (I still do, since I like dogs, but I have no plans on taking them with me to college) I don't know why my dad took in these dogs, knowing that I had my own dog that I love and care for. My brother had mentioned that he wanted a puppy, so that we wouldn't have to share our dog, and so that our dog can have company while we were at school, but these two dogs don't like other dogs, yet my dad's girlfriend continually tries to villianize my dog, despite the same thing happening to her own daughter's dogs. 
My grandparents have already given me the okay to stay, and my mom is fine with it, but I've brought up the idea of me moving away to my dad before, and he was super mad, and throwing accusations that my mom was making me feel this way. His girlfriend bought me school clothes one time, and yet my dad used that as an example to be ever nice to her and why she is a good person. I'm tired of his 180s about his damn girlfriend. I have enough to worry about, with school and my own future, I shouldn't be stressed about whether my clothes are being stolen or if there will be a fight today.
So I'm planning on getting a job as an excuse to go to my grandparents, since they can get me to and from work. I'm also planning on going to college near my mom, since she's by the coast and I can bring my dog. So I probably won't see my dad again until I'm done with college completely (I'm going to be a Vet, so that's a good 7-9 years) but I haven't told him yet. He says that if I go to San Diego then he'll just move over there with my brother, but knowing him, he'll also bring his girlfriend. I will absolutely lose it if he does that.
I just need advice on how to present this to my dad in the most effective way. We aren't the closest right now, due to me not liking his girlfriend, but I am done with this whole situation. Losing my dog was the absolute last straw, I don't care about this big house and the pool. My brother has no plans on joining me, but he understands my reasoning. Any money I make will go towards making sure that my dog has the best, healthy life, and to helping my grandparents if they need anything. Also I believe that part of his reasoning for not letting me leave, is due to my eldest brother (18), from a different mom, who died from an accidental overdose 4 years ago. My dad blames himself and is really sad on my deceased brother's birthday, and day of death. He barely came around and lived with his mother for almost my whole childhood, so it didn't really affect me or my younger brother.",04Sep2019,1
84,"Just a little backstory, I was in public school in the 7th grade doing just fine with grades. Had a slight anger problem at home and bullied a little at school. My Mom decides to pull me out of school, like 2 weeks before the year ended. This is where it starts heading downhill. I start ""Homeschooling"" pretty much sitting around doing nothing falling behind the pack. Fast foward about 4 or 5 years. It's currently the start of my ""senior"" year of high school. I'm like 4 years behind the pack, have depression cause no friends, no motivation to even do my school and on top of that starting to have suicidal thoughts. I'm really just here as a cry for help. My life sucks, I don't know how to fix this anymore. My Mom blames me for falling behind but, I was ahead when I was in public school.

85,"Okay few things to get out of the way.


I struggle with suicide and have for 10 years now. I've gotten very close and every year has a big point where I come very close. Basically every December for a lot of reasons.


I dont have any friends or family to speak of. So when I travelled for work my coworker and my boss volunteered to watch my cats. I trust them to not steal anything and to keep them alive. 


Well they cleaned up my apartment and now I. Pretty sure they saw and read an old suicide note of mine I never threw away. 


Ever since I got back everyone has been waaaaay nicer to me. Not that they were rude or mean I got along with my coworkers just fine. But now they almost all go way out of their way to be beyond nice to me. 


From buying me food randomly, praline me on the smallest thing I do right in my job to not criticizing me on s ok mething anyone would get shit for, in a jokeing way of course. 


Another one of my bosses has avoided eye contact with me since I got back. 


I plan on confronting 2 of my coworkers I'm closest with on friday since it's my day back and I want to know the truth. 



Is this a good idea? Is there something else I should do instead?

86,"Hey Reddit, I’ve never really posted on reddit ever but today was a very sad day for me and my girlfriend and I just can’t stop thinking. I just need to vent and hope at least one person has kind words. Her and I moved into an apartment back in April and around May talked about getting a dog. We found a dog we adored on the humane society page right away and talked about getting her for a month because it was such a big decision and didn’t know if we should really do it. 

Fast forward to June and we go meet the dog we wanted, we wanted to get an older one thinking it would be better and a lot easier than getting a brand new puppy. She loved us right away, out of all the dogs she was the only one that played with us, gave us love, and just showed signs that she was the one. We talked about it for another couple weeks and finally went to go get her. When we were walking in we saw a family already with her outside thinking, “damn they’re probably going to get her so this isn’t meant”. We go inside and there she is again in the cage looking at us like there you guys are again let’s go home!! 

We have two cats at home and before we got her we had a lil cat test in the cat room and she seemed to be okay with them showing no signs of aggression. When we got home she instantly attacked them and thought “shit, that’s not a good sign but all it needs is time”. 3 months go by and nothing ever got better. She attacked them multiple times when they tried to warm up to her, and even got one around the neck and had to bring him to the vet because it was bad. No signs of improvement throughout the three months. 

She was the sweetest thing ever besides the whole cat thing. She was super playful, super energetic for her age, and was the goofiest pup. I will never forget her. Today we had to give her back to the humane society. And both my gf and I were bawling our eyes out the whole time. We didn’t know it was going to be so quick but it was. It was too fast. She’s 6 years old and she was in the shelter and humane society for over a year before we got her. And now she’s going back. It feels like a betrayal to her but our cats were here first and we love them so much. They lived on top of the cabinets in the kitchen for three months straight pretty much. It was terrible to see them like that. 

I just can’t stop thinking. I know she can’t comprehend what’s going on but I know how confused she must be. When we went in the exam room to say goodbye she was wagging her tail looking at us so happy “let’s go home now!!!”  She was whining the whole time she was getting checked out sniffing under the door for us. The image of her being so happy when we came in will not get out of my head. I know time will heal but I just need some comforting words. I feel like I put her back where she wasn’t meant to be and she doesn’t understand why. We feel guilty and never felt this amount of guilt and sadness before. We feel terrible. Please help. 

TLDR: Had to give up our newly adopted dog after 3 months of being attached to her because she kept attacking our cats and showed no signs of improvement. Feel super guilty and can’t stop thinking about it. The saddest day we’ve both experienced, need comfort.

(We love you Beth. We are praying for you and hope you get adopted as soon as possible. We hope you don’t feel like this is your life on repeat and hope you remember our love and affection towards you.)",04Sep2019,1
87,"r/LegalAdvice removed my post, so I’m posting here.

Over the last two years, and increasingly over the last six months, her condition has worsened. There’s a grocery list of pretty serious symptoms, everything from complete loss of appetite to fainting erratically. Problem is, her parents are pretty garbage. They’re quite the affluent family, but she’s never seen a cent of their money besides a place to stay (their house is probably $900k). She buys her own food and clothes, and is now saving up for college and a car. Her dad makes all the money, but her mom controls the cashflow and won’t let her or her dad buy anything besides stuff for her.

Her mom has taking to screaming at her every time she tries to bring up something that’s wrong with her with things along the lines of “There’s always something ****ing wrong with you, stop being a dramatic *****.” As such, she hasn’t seen a doctor in 2 years. WebMD thinks she has stage 3 cancer, of course, but I don’t want to believe that.

So how do I go about helping her? If she does anything that could be construed as going against her mom, there would be bloodshed. This leads me to think calling CPS is a bad idea. I’m willing to contact whatever agency I need to keep my friend from dying.",04Sep2019,2
89,"I recently started working at a small company where a significant number of colleagues are acquaintances from college who all studied the same subject I did. Since I’ve started working here, I’ve noticed a lot of petty arguments between them - mostly stemming from their opinions of each other from college (which doesn’t actually hold, they’ve all grown since then) or due to their familiarity with each other they don’t hold back when conveying negative feedback. 

I’ve also noticed that the boss at the company is quite good at making people feel valued - he might only have 5 minutes a week to spend with an employee, but in those 5 minutes he’ll still make them feel important to the company. While that’s great, this has lead to everyone in the company thinking they’re his “favourite“ and get all competitive with each other.

I’d really like to stay out of the drama and politics, they can be quite exhausting. However, with the company being quite small, everyone HAS to talk to each other and work WITH each other. Individually everyone is quite fun and they’re good people, but they don’t communicate well and cannot get work done without starting a million arguments. As someone who lacks social skills, I’m lost with how to get my work done without getting sucked into all the gossip and drama. Help!",04Sep2019,2
91,"Alright, so here's my predicament. I'm a high school freshman as of now. Based on my SAT scores last year, I think I'm on track for a 1600 by junior year. My GPA will probably end up being near perfect, but I'd like to give myself a little leeway. I'm also currently a one-third shareholder in a startup, but I have no idea how that's going to work out. With that out of the way, here's the situation I'm in:

I've fenced for a couple years. I've displayed some talent, and could probably get pretty good if I trained consistently. However, I haven't fenced very intensely for the last year, because I don't really enjoy it. Of course, I've been strongly considering quitting. That being said, my target schools all have fencing teams, so I feel like I should just grit my teeth and extend my training schedule to include most of my week.

92,"So I have this guy at work and we work in a basic medical/biology research lab. We work on instruments called mass spec and we have a personal for maintaining the mass spec. This guy is the one who organizes what to run on mass spec. I have been in this lab for around 3 years. This guy and I were really good friends. Few days back after one of the person left the job I was assigned the a new title as lab co-ordinator. Just is just an unofficial title with no raise. It's just change in responsibilities/more responsibilities but very important. It's like I am the face of the lab and I meet the customers who want to obtain services from the lab. It was initially discussed among the bosses that this guy take the job but all of a sudden the other boss flipped and asked for me. Anyway ever since he is been picking fights trying to give me advice and telling me how to do things which were not necessarily true. I argued with him on certain things I disagreed, all work related. However this guy called me stubborn and that I am not listening to him. I was like okay I don't have time to argue and I left. Again, last Friday I wanted to run samples on the machine he handles and dropped a message on slack that I will be running samples to which I got no answer till 3 in the afternoon. I then try to queue my samples and this guy comes and asks me if I am running samples. He then says we usually run my kind of samples on other machine and I asked why. And her was like this is how we do ask the bosses. I said that is not a good enough reason and he then demands from my why I want to run on his machine (the one he maintains, the machine belongs to the institute). I explained that this machine more sensitive and I want best results for my samples and that previously I ran same/similar samples and I did not get satisfactory results. So I do not remember if I said same of similar but the samples were from the same lab with same set up with different protein of interest. He really picked on this at the end of argument where we circled back to the same point about his machine being better. He called me a liar because I said same before and not similar. He said he has some proof about me from the past that proves that I am a liar. I asked what it is but he said he does not want to get into details. He did apologized few minutes later but I did not say anything to him as I do not know if I cannot accept his apology at this point. I also told him he is very condescending when someone asks him something as he has &gt;8 yrs experience. He always makes sarcastic remark about some one not knowing such trivial thing. I tell this to him and he said I feel it so because I have inferiority complex (I do not know if I have). I feel like he was blackmailing me and is creepy that he is digging in my past.

I tell this to my supervisor and that I was thinking to go to Ombud's office but she seemed defensive about this guy. I really like my supervisor and she is really supportive. However, she does does need this guy to as working on mass spec requires years of training and if this guy leaves it will be hard to find someone to replace him. I also talked to my other labmate who was also as defensive saying this was not a blackmail and that me thinking that may be he stalked me at some point is absurd and that he does not seem to be that kind of a guy. I said I understand his opinion but I felt like blackmailing and that it is hard to describe the tone. I can go to HR but it's going to be a he said she said thing and the fact that my boss and other colleagues do not support me is not going to help me much. I feel really oppressed and really sad that there be no consequences for such behavior. I did not say anything personal to him and that he is behaving like this at workplace is really uncalled for. While I understand I do argue sometimes but it's all work related and questioning as to why they do things certain ways as there are more than one ways to do things.

I really would love to join one, the atmosphere appeals to me, the sisterhood, the philanthropy, everything really draws me in. As a commuter to my university as well I feel like I’d become more involved which is what I want. 

However, on the other hand, I’m not in the best position financially. My family has been having money problems for the past couple of years and even paying my tuition this semester was tough and I had to use aid. I have about $2,000 saved up and I know I could use it to pay for a sorority, but my mom also made the point that I could use that to pay off credit card bills and save for next semester, especially if I want to live on campus. 

I am very conflicted and I don’t know if joining a sorority would be worth the money and potential struggle coming up. I don’t mind taking on debt, my parents don’t help pay for much at all so if I want something it’s all coming from me so I want to get what I want and need. I’ve had to live at home the past 2 years and commute to a junior college as well because my parents wanted to save money, but now that I’m finally at a university, I really wanna get a full experience and I think a sorority would really fulfill that.

On my 18th birthday my friends and I went to a male strip club as  a celebration of me becoming an adult. We were really just there for fun and laughs, like most people there that night - it wasn't anything serious. This one guy pulled me on stage and did a little dance with me, which was all fun - the crowd was hooting and laughing. Afterwards, my friends bought me a lap dance since that's the strip club 'thing'. I was totally fine with it - I thought it would be funny. I requested the guy who pulled me on stage, and he took me into a private (closed off) booth.

It was my understanding that lap-dances were a strictly no touch thing - usually for the safety of the stripper. I just thought he'd do a sexy dance over me for a few minutes, and then it'd be over and I'd go back to my fun night out with my friends. Instead, he lifted up my dress, pushed my underwear aside, and started attempting to penetrate me with his fingers. 

At this point in my life, I had zero sexual experience (other than a clumsy kiss earlier in my teens) So, when he started doing this, I was totally stunned. I just remember his fingers were insistent and forceful and hurt a little bit as he tried to make his way in. I was so stunned that I didn't say anything for what felt like ages (but was probably just like 20 seconds). In a whisper, he instructed me to go outside to his van where he could fuck me properly. When I finally came to my senses I pushed him away. He backed off, and I pretty much immediately ran out of there, grabbed my friends, and cried on the street for a while.

Even though it was such a little thing that happened very quickly, it still makes me quite anxious and tense when I think about it. It was my first real sexual experience, and as a dumb, naive girl I was pretty scared and overwhelmed. But here's the thing - I don't know if he was in the wrong here or if I'm wrong for even being upset? I didn't know what's normal and what's not in strip clubs (I still don't). Is that the regular protocol for lap dances? Are they really just code for 'lets have sex'? If that's the case, then I was sending ALL the signals for him, so is it my fault for sending the wrong message? 

It's alright if you think that that's the case, I'm genuinely looking for answers. (and dw im not like looking to prosecute this guy or anything, i dont even remember his name - i guess all I'm really looking for is a bit of validation for my feelings)

If anyone read all of this, thank you for sticking this out, I appreciate it.

**TLDR:** friends bought me (f) a lap dance at a strip club for my 18th birthday. The stripper (m) fingered me without consent which really freaked me out since i had no sexual experience at the time. The incident still makes me anxious, and im wondering if what he did was wrong, or if i'm the one who fucked up by not knowing lapdance protocol.",04Sep2019,866
104,"I don’t have much to say, just that my parents are always fighting, and they keep threatening to get a divorce. Is this a normal thing parents do? It’s always been like this. Occasionally, we’ll all be laughing and joking in the car, but that moment is quickly ruined by my mom yelling about my dads driving, then them getting into an argument.

106,"So, last night I made the mistake of reading old texts between us. I ended up staying awake the whole night and I briefly opened her Instagram. That was the first time I saw her face after 2 years. My mind was a mess, I don’t even know what I felt.

It is important to point it out some aspects of our friendship:

	—We were 15 when we met. After we got more intimate, I mentioned my depression and so did she. In 2014 she made a suicide attempt and in the following year it was my turn.

	—I was always in love with her and I belive that in some point she felt the same. I was too scared to go any further, but also, I was ok with not having a relationship. Her friendship was the most important thing in my life at the time.

	—I don’t know why I stoppped talking to her. In 2017 she moved out to another city and from there our friendship fade out. We never talked again.

	I’m 21 and not depressed anymore. A lot of things changed, naturally, but I’m afraid to go back to that place that I was 3 or 4 years ago if we start talking again, since she was there with me and I was there with her. But I’m more mature now and I miss her. Maybe we can re-built that friendship with a different and a healthy state of mind now, I don’t know.",04Sep2019,1
107,"Hi there!! So I only lost my virginity a year-ish ago so I’m not that experienced... but every time I’ve had sex,  I haven’t been able to cum. I know that this is not the guys fault, and it’s definitely on my part. I can, however, make myself cum pretty easily using my vibrator or just clit simulation. Whenever I’m actually having sex with a guy though, I can feel my orgasm building but then before it happens it just kind of fades away and disappears. It happens every single time. I’m sure this is probably just a mental thing on my part, but does anyone know why this might be happening? I like having sex regardless if I orgasm or not, but a orgasm would definitely be nice 😅",04Sep2019,1
109,"I’ll keep it brief but for various I need to break up with my girlfriend of 5 years. These reasons include her reluctance to get a job, lying about paying her share of bills, hoarding, and general unwillingness to do anything in life.

Thing is I’m really struggling to pluck up the confidence to end it - and have been for months. I think this is down to a few issues:

1. I’m very, very lonely. I don’t have close friends or family. There’s barely anyone I see during the week, despite my efforts to go out and meet people (being an introvert fucking sucks). My GF, for good or bad, is mostly the only source of human interaction I have.

2. I already have bad depression and I’m worried the additional stress of a break up might send me over the edge or to a place where I can’t recover from. I’m very much worried the emotional stress could send me back years on my path to recovery.

3. Neither of us have anywhere to go to escape each other and cool off. Again, no close family or friends. I own the unit we live in and she has no money to go and rent somewhere else.

4. I’m genuinely worried about her mental health. Obviously she has issues and I don’t want to exacerbate them but I’m worried that breaking it off would cause her to self harm, or maybe even become homeless.

5. I’m worried what she would say to my friends and family. She is an open book on social media and often vents about everything including very personal stuff, blowing things out of proportion. I have never said or done anything that might put me in a compromising position, but I’m really worried about what she might make up or exaggerate. I don’t have any social media accounts so no one would really hear my side if the story, not that I would feel very good about putting my personal life out there.

6. I’m really worried she might break my stuff, some of which means a lot to me. I feel like I can’t predict her behaviour. It’s easy to say to document my belongings and get the law involved if she breaks things, but to what end? She would have no money to replace them.

Honestly the best thing I can think to do is to take a week off work, make a ‘bug out’ kit, send a text to her, and camp out on my car for a while. But this feels like a pretty dumb idea.

I’m just looking for advice on how to go about this.",04Sep2019,2

About 2 years ago I went on a date with a girl and things were going well and we kissed. About a week later my “friends” stoped talking to me and wouldn’t answer any of my texts. I later find out it’s because the girl (we will call her G) has told everyone I tried having sex with her. Last year G went to another school in my area so I don’t have to deal with her anymore

114,"I pooped myself at school. it started off in the school bus in the morning. I had recently been very sick and this was my first day back to school in ten days. I felt fine when I woke up and I had a massive breakfast, as I was very hungry and I never ate a lot during the time that I was sick. My mom said that I should eat lots of vegetables and healthy foods so I wouldn't get so sick again. She served me a plateful of beans, carrots, peas, potatoes, eggs, and a few slices of bacon. While sitting in the bus I felt a dull ache in my stomach, and it made a loud rumble. I thought that it was just gas, but I couldn't release it as I knew that it would cause a stench and everybody would mock me, so I just kept it in and prayed that it would just go away. After stopping to pick up more students, I bent over slightly and farted (luckily it wasn't that loud and I don't think anybody heard it), I started coughing to try and hide the fact that I had just let loose. I thought that I felt better now that I got it out of my system. I arched my back and brought myself forward to get comfortable in my seat, when suddenly I did a massive fart, and I felt like something shot out of my behind and had left through the leg of my shorts . As I looked down the floor around me turned brown and it smelled really bad. I had pooped myself and some of the diarrhea had sprayed on the shoes and trousers of a small boy, as he was sitting right next to me when I had soiled myself, and there was a puddle of runny poop that was slowly running down the bus. My bowels released themselves again while I was farting , brown bubbling liquid surrounded me, and I could see bits of carrots and intact peas floating around, and I even got chunks of it stuck on my schoolbag. It smelled like rotten eggs, and beans, it was awful, I was almost choking due to it's stench. Everybody was laughing at me as I was struggling to escape my pool of runny poop, and the poo covered boy was horrified and started to shake his leg viciously as parts of poop came flying off his clothes into my mouth and eyes as I was trying to exit my seat. All the students ran out of the bus except one who had slid on the pile of diarrhea and fell on top of me as I was trying to escape bringing me back into the river of poop. The bus driver forced his way through students who were leaving the bus and slipped on a pool of diarrhea and face planted on my seat which was covered in crap and children held his head down into the bubbling poop as they tried to force themselves out. Since we were so close to the school entrance a school teacher came out and told me and the other boy covered in crap to remain in the bus until they got wheelchairs through for both of us so we wouldn't get poop all over place. They told us to take all of our clothes off so we wouldn’t make a mess with our poop covered clothes. Me and the other boy both stripped down until we were both completely naked and then they had us put our poop covered clothes in a trash bag and then they took them away. The chairs arrived and I exited the bus and as I was going to sit down I farted again and pooped all over the chair, but they said that they only had two and I had to stay in it. All the other students looked at me as I was getting wheeled into the school naked in a chair covered in poop. The teachers were standing outside their classroom doors as I was being wheeled through the hallway. Eventually we got to the school nurses office where they let me use the shower and gave me a change of clothes to put on. They said they called my parents to come and take me home and told me to sit down and wait until they arrived. Eventually my mom came and took me home. This was 5 days ago and I haven’t been back to school since. I need to make up some important tests but I don’t want to go back to school because I will surely get made fun of by my classmates. The boy who also got covered in poop emailed me saying I humiliated him and ruined his life. He also said he wouldn’t be returning to school ever. The school also contacted me by phone and demanded that I pay them money for a new seat for the bus to replace the one that got covered in my poop.  They also said that I will not be allowed to return unless I am wearing a diaper at all times while at school.",04Sep2019,0
115,"So I work a seasonal job in the summer and go to school during the winter months. Last year was my final year for my marketing program at college, I was successful for the most part but still need to take a math course and an elective in order to get my diploma. I have always struggled really hard with math and need to put in a lot of effort to pass. I can take both of these courses online, but even though they are online courses they still require a fair amount of effort as you need to essentially teach yourself the material (rather than attending class). 

So my original plan was to take these courses during the summer while I worked so I could have my diploma by September. The problem is, since my job is seasonal, we work really long hours Monday-Friday and sometimes Saturday. I'm talking like 10+ hour days most of the time, it's also a labor job so you could imagine I was pretty exhausted at the end of the day. I took the courses and tried to manage it with work, but it was way too difficult for me trying to balance the two, especially with how tired I was after work most days, I also struggle to do well in school and have to try really hard to get pretty average grades. I obviously failed the courses this summer.

I had originally applied to computer programming last year because I wanted to combine my marketing diploma with something else because I felt just having the two year diploma wasn't enough and I wanted to get into video game development, I felt combining the two would have been perfect. But I have now decided that I want to go into a trade, I want to have the security that a trade provides and I don't want to have to struggle to find a job after school. The program starts in January which means I still have about 4 months until I start. My seasonal job lasts until the end of October if I want to keep working until then, so that means if I choose to do that I will still have 2 months where I am doing nothing. But I could also take those two courses that I need for diploma during this time, and they end practically right before my program in January starts. 

This is where i'm having problems though, my parents constantly push me to be busy all of the time and they don't realize how exhausting my job can be. They want me to work while I take the two courses because they think I'm just being lazy and not putting in an effort and that's why I failed the courses while working before. But I know I failed because of how mentally exhausted I was at the end of the day. Even typing this out I feel guilt in saying that because I know they would just tell me I am making excuses. I think the best choice for myself would be to focus on these two courses for the remaining months until school starts, I don't think I will be able to balance work with these courses as there is no option for part-time work at my job. I guess I kind of just want a second opinion on what I should do. My parents constantly make me feel guilty for making a choice that isn't what they want, even if I know what's best for myself.

Today was my first day of school and I want to make the most out of this school. I want to make a good impression/flirt with this pretty girl in my class but I don’t know how to go about it. Relevant info: The first time we interacted was when I asked her for help with my locker but I said “excuse me” and sounded really fucking formal. I didn’t notice how pretty she was until that moment. She helped me out and as she was working on the lock with her back turned to me she says I’m Jessica by the way. I respond with my name. I thank her and that’s it. Fast forward to later in the day I come in a bit late to our class and she gives me that look as a enter and walk to my seat. You know, the kind of ‘I’m tracking you with my eyes’ kind of look. I shyly looked away and did this multiple times as she glanced in my direction. I’m usually a confident, outgoing guy but it was my first day as the new kid and certain kinds of pretty can intimidate me. She also looks real intense if that makes sense. Kind of a serious, intense demeanor and look. Now I’m worried she lost that sort of initial interest because I would prefer to pursue that. Later that day she plainly tells me “let me know if you need anything.” Yup. No interest there. Better yet as dismissal is happening another student I don’t know compares my appearance to this super nerdy kid in front of her. Embarrassing.

124,"Melrose Lane
[ Personal Narrative ]
To start off, in my youth I grew up in Shawnee, Kansas. We didn’t have a lot, but enough
to live a happy comfortable life. We lived in a little white house on the street Melrose Lane​.​ The
street name has always stuck with me because I had some of the most memorable moments
growing up there that I will never forget​. ​

I vividly remember we had a white front door with the
paint chipping around the door handle, which was silver and tarnished in an antique type of way. A normal day would start with my sister and I saying “Mom we’re bored there’s nothing to do (then a sigh)​.​” She always would reply with “then go play outside​.​” And we did as we were told.​ ​Stepping out of the back door on to the porch’s cold pavement. I take a big breath of fresh air. I like to describe the air as smelling sweet. It’s like you could smell the dandelions and fresh cut grass. The air is a little thick and humid but were ready to conquer the day.

When we stepped into the large back yard, we feel the grass between our toes, it’s soft but tickles. The yard is filled with colored weeds that we always picked calling them flowers. There was all sorts like henbit (the purple flower looking weed) yellow dandelions, and the white dandelions. We would blow them in each other’s faces making one of us sneeze. Sometimes we’d make a wish. As we venture through the yard we would seek patches of bright green
 clovers. We’d sit for a while and comb through the clovers hoping to find a four leafed one. After a short amount of time we get restless and seek what activity next awaits us.

Next was always our favorite thing to do. We’d throw on our bathing suits, grab the hose
and screw it into the sprinkler. She would then call for me to turn the water on.​ ​We’d run back
and forth, jump over the sprinkler, and pick it up aiming at each other. I’d always get a face full
of water and the nasty taste of hose water in my mouth.​ ​Our mom would sit on the porch smoke
a cigarette (everybody did in the early 2000s) and watch us play, and have a grimace as she glances at us. We could probably play for an eternity just entertaining ourselves with the hose
and slip n’ slide.

Once we start to get tired, we’d dry off and try to scrape the pieces of grass off our legs.
We’d run inside and it felt freezing because the AC was kicked up pretty high. We’d grab snacks and run back outside to the porch. We always had to go quick so we didn’t track too much water into the house. We’d sit on the back porch wrapped up in our cozy towels on the fold out chairs. We would tear into our snacks we brought out, usually consisting of saltine crackers and Oreos, along with some homemade lemonade. I would eat one after another enjoying the crunchy cream and chocolate snack, and wash it down with some lemonade that was a perfect mixture between sweet and sour. When I look out to the sky it’s a beautiful mixture of colors. They illuminate the sky consisting of yellow and oranges rays shining through the trees that make me squint my eyes real tight.


We’d sit out in the yard with our towels laid out underneath us and look up at the sky, or close our eyes. I could feel the suns setting rays on my cold fair skin, it was a glowing orange warmth. And feel the grass tickling my legs. It was silence for my sister and me, for we would listen to the sounds of the chirping birds, the cricket’s melody, the ringing of the cicadas, the frogs croaking, and the trees bright green leaves rustling as the wind glides between each and every leaf, shaking the branches to seem as if they’re dancing. At that we would call it a day. That’s my memory of the little white house on Melrose Lane, and that it taught me it’s the little things that matter the most.",04Sep2019,2

130,"Throwaway account / new to reddit so I apologize in advance if this is in the wrong sub / format. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I was living a relatively comfortable life this time last year. I was in a casual relationship, living in a beautiful town, and working for a company that paid well and was interesting. It wasn't rainbows and butterflies all the time, but it was close. I was happy, and then ... everything sort of happened all at once. It started with the end of my beautiful and casual relationship. We had a pregnancy scare, and that was the end of that. He left in an explosion of curse words. I never heard from him after that. Around that time, a very close friend of mine made some poor life choices and that terminated our friendship. We went from talking all the time to not speaking at all. Shortly after, I experienced another loss - my home and my neighbor's homes caught fire and burned down. We lost everything then. I moved around a lot. I left my job for something less stressful, but it came with a pay cut. 

In a weird way, I'm not sad about any of it (anymore). It allowed me to be vulnerable and grow. There is something very freeing about having nothing. I felt like the universe was giving me a chance to start over - all signs pointed to a new start. At first, in this healing process, I thought I was doing the right thing by staying here and choosing another job. Now I am feeling incredibly unfulfilled spiritually as this current job does not involve giving back in any way (where my previous jobs have all been in a compassionate industry), and feeling out of place in a state that I have called home my entire life. I find my heart yearning so deeply for something else, but I don't know what that is or where it is. 

I know that I am made for so much more than an office job. I want to make a difference in a way that isn't scheduling appointments. I fantasize about moving out of state and starting over for real, somewhere my soul feels settled... but financially I am not in a place where I can pack up and leave, and mentally, I am terrified about moving somewhere without knowing a single person. I just feel like there is nothing for me here; I've outgrown it. All I know for certain is that I cannot keep living the way I am now. I just don't know where to start or where to go.

She will point out about how she's helped me in the past, how she paid for my hospital stays my therapy sessions, etc. She will say I have no reason to distrust her (if I bring up instances of abuse, she either denies them or completely agrees with them, not seeing how it is abusive). ""I pay the bills here"", ""I'm your mother"", etc.

I'm moving out and going to college soon, but she'll still be only half an hour away. I know I have to take a stand for myself, but then there's the very really possibility of my family turning on me.

Any advice?",04Sep2019,2
132,"So I'm a highschool sophomore right now. I transferred to a new school this year. We had to make the decision for whether we wanted to transfer or not last February, and at that point, I still wanted to transfer to the school I'm currently at, because all my friends from middle school were there, and I thought that I would be happier. But after February, I people started to notice me and talk to me more, and I realized that I actually really liked that school. The new school year just started, and so far I haven't talked to anyone except for when they ask me what the homework is. My old friends pretend I don't exist, and it since it's my sophomore year everyone already has their own groups of friends. When I asked for advice before, people said that I should just stay at the school I'm currently at because if I transfer back it'll look weird to colleges, and that I just need to man up and deal with it. But I hate this school, everyone only cares about themselves or their own friends, the teachers are assholes, and I really want to go back. At least at my old high school, people would talk to me even though I'm a quiet kid, here everyone just tries to ignore me.",04Sep2019,2

135,"Hi r/advice, you can skip down to the bottom if you don't want to read the backstory.

Earlier this year, I went on disability due to some severe depression/anxiety symptoms. These symptoms had been getting gradually worse every day I went to work. I've worked at the same company for over 8 years and have recently come to terms with the fact that I don't want to spend most of my life behind a desk at a financial institution. This isn't a new feeling; I had been living my life with the firm belief that the world was going to end at any moment.

For my entire life, I'd been deeply involved in a doomsday cult. Over the past year however, I've slowly come to the realization that my beliefs were foolish and that much of my life, in my opinion, has been wasted. Leaving this cult was the catalyst for my depression/anxiety, causing me to take an extended leave of absence from work. For members of the cult, work is just a means to get paid so we can attend meetings and donate money. Therefore, my education and my career never mattered to me. I was just going through the motions at work, almost hoping our world would just blink out of existence. 

Now, after a lot of therapy, I'm ready to move forward with my life. I'm taking online courses towards a bachelor's degree and I'm actually excited for my future. I'm not sure exactly what I want to do yet, but I know it isn't in the financial sector. My wife and I will be fine financially if I quit my job as I take care of dogs on the side, but I'm still on my extended leave of absence. Should I just call and quit now or wait until I return to work to give them 2 weeks notice? Thank you for reading, your advice is greatly appreciated! 

Tl;dr: Next week I should be cleared to return to work after being out for over 4 months, but I'm definitely going to quit. Should I call to put my 2 weeks notice in now? Do I show up on my first day back with a resignation letter? Do I just call them and tell them I'm not coming back?",04Sep2019,2

137,"so this was about 3 weeks ago. my ex boyfriend and i had broken up in june, but our relationship was still sort of up in the air as he was saying he wanted to fix things but was never following through with it, and pretty much ignoring all of my attempts at doing so too.

we had gone to the beach with our friends and were going through a funhouse together. he kissed me at one point, i kissed back. 

we were on a sort of balcony hallway into the next part of the funhouse, so it was partially outside. he started to grab my ass, and that’s when i started having regrets. i told him not outside, and he pushed it a little bit before he agreed to go back inside and into a storage closet we found earlier. 

we’re in the storage closet, making out, things get really heated and he wanted me to blow him. i said no, i don’t know how, and he said it was fine, so i’m in the middle of blowing him when i realize i REALLY didn’t want to do that. 

i didn’t say anything though, mainly because my ex is a “sadboy” type who’ll say things like “i’m sorry i’m not good enough” or “i’m sorry i’m such a bad friend” and backhanded apologies and things like that. i really didn’t want to get him on one of those rants and end up having to comfort him, so i continued anyway. 

we were caught by one of our friends, who at the time, thought that was the funniest shit in the world. i remember being glad it happened, because i have no idea how far we would have gone if they didn’t.

later, we went back to one of our friends houses for dinner. we were playing video games and he had his arm around me, and i was uncomfortable, i kind of didn’t want him to touch me but i also didn’t want to make him upset by moving away, so i didn’t say anything.

he then told me he was gonna go outside for a smoke, and asked if i wanted to come with. i said sure, and we were on our way out when he pushed me into my friends’ bathroom in her foyer and started making out with me. i told him no, we can’t fuck in our friends’ bathroom, and he said it was fine, and at that point, i resigned myself to whatever emotional hell i was gonna be put through after the fact, when he would inevitably promise to fix our relationship and talk to me more, and then never follow up (which he didn’t).

this is where it gets a little blurry. it’s getting really heated and he wants to fuck me. i repeatedly told him no, as we didn’t have a condom and after three or so attempts at pushing my answer, he left it alone.

however though, we were grinding and i thought i felt him put it in me anyway, but that was mere seconds before our friend started banging on the door, so i never got a chance to do or say anything. 

i hadn’t let myself think about it too seriously until very recently. i’m embarrassed and ashamed it happened, i really regret it and i wish i said something before it even started, so i just kind of left it as “i said yes, i didn’t get any kind of std or pregnant, it’s fine.” but today was the first time i actually talked about it (i was talking about it to my current boyfriend) and he said he’s pretty sure i was assaulted, but i should talk to one of our friends (she was assaulted by an ex a couple years ago) to get a clearer answer and better help.

and i honestly don’t know, because i didn’t say anything, so how was my ex supposed to have known? i don’t want to make him out to be that kind of person either, since he’s not and it was my fault it happened anyway, so i don’t even want to talk to my friend and ruin any friendships or start new drama over something i did to myself.",04Sep2019,1
138,"Hello guys, I have a lot of ambitions to become a sort of YouTuber doing analysis on games and shows and stuff like that.  I went to school for graphic design, and I've filled up notebooks with analysis and video scripts, and have folders filled of photoshop documents and different stuff I'd like to put in my videos.  However, nothing really stuck, and I find it difficult to really crunch something out.

I was let go today after being in the factory for 30 years.

Thought about driving off a bridge, but I still have a glimmer of hope that something good will come my way. This job is all I had.

I only included my resume that time, and I guess I'm just worried I'll be rejected again.

144,"I work in nightlife in a major city. Leaving my position is not an option, please do not advise.

I've been employed at the same establishment for going on 5 years.

A newer employee has a coke problem, let's call her KAREN. She's lost her day job, she gave several customers herpes.. I know cause they came in \*together\* looking for her. She owes staff members money and was fired from her other nightlife job for stealing. She constantly calls out. She brings in other people who get to fucked up and act insane and get throw out. Problem is, she isn't getting fired at my new job. Karen is cute, peppy, blonde and a huge slut.

I don't engage w Karen much and it wasn't effecting me directly until recently. A long time sober and seasoned bartender left the company, and someone new took the position. This new bartender, let's call her SUE and Karen have become fast friends. Karen and Sue do coke during shifts, ( and they cant handle their shit )  Sue will leave the bar even when we are slammed to do coke. These too have also started hanging out with the 3rd bartender, who has been working at the bar about just as long as me, I'll call her JILL.  So the 3 spend serious amount of time together, but they also party hard as fuck, all the time. Recently, I spoke to Jill (Who i have a challenging, yet long relationship with due to her substance abuse problems)  about the issues regarding karen and sue. Jill cut me off and refused to discuss anything saying she won't engage in any negativity.... because all three of them blacking out 4-6 times a week isn't negativity? And this coke problem of one girl is seeping into the fabric of the establishment and ultimately costing me money isn't negative? We never had these problems in the past, and although Jill and I have had our differences shes mostly been receptive to talk about issues, especially in regards to money.

\*\*\*\*\*This effects me money wise like this : Full bar, 3-4 customers deep - two people who split tips 50/50 do as many transactions as they can, each transaction the patrons tips on, all those tips add up and are split 50/50  with 20% to the bar back end of the night. If one bartender is missing - we are losing transactions, patrons are pissed, service is bad we get no tips, or shitty ones.

I don't drink heavy or do any drugs. I used too. I got over it. A bit of my annoyance may be coming from the fact I feel left out by the group, although I have no desire to party how they do and don't actually like who they choose to be at this time in their lives. I've moved away from that lifestyle. Because of this I don't have a lot of solid friends right now. When you change lifestyles, i'm finding it takes time to meet new people you actually like, and to find new hobbies of interest, So, I'm there with that. Maybe I'm annoyed cause I'm lonely and I see them all having fun together. 

The other side is:

I'm no Virgin Mary but come the fuck on. I'm here to make fucking money.  If the GM knew half of the shit he'd legit DIE. Lay off the fucking heavy drugs while your in my space, FFS. I don't wanna watch this fucking tragedy.  Yea, I work ina club but its for a company that has a pretty strict no drinking rule, it's been low key, proper, mostly respectable levels of fuckery until now! All that other shit feels like an excuse to allow the shit behavior and what I'm dealing with is fucking unacceptable. This cunt could overdose and die while im standing there next to her! And i'm enabling this girl in her self destruction by not saying shit, and now i'm allowing it to effect me enough to ask for advice on fucking reddit. SOMETHING NEEDS TO HAPPEN BEFORE IT GETS WORSE. IM WATCHING A LIVE ACTION SLOW MOTION TRAIN WRECK.

I could go to a manager but ours of two years just got transferred. She told me on her last night not to let them be assholes to me and that i was her fav and she appreciated me. She's a really decent woman and friendly with everyone. My next shift will be someone new. I'm not sure how he will be. I could also go to the GM, who I have a solid relationship with, but I'd be fucking over an entire group of people. We all occasionally do shots, Sue, and Karen are just the ones that take it to far in our staff of 6 - If I call one of them out they will for sure call me out. I don't want to go that way.

What should I do? I have tried enforcing boundaries. I have muted all of them on IG, I don't go out with them, but this is REALLY starting to get to me. Ive never had problems at work, this place has always been my home. It's a very small staff and the problem is escalating and now spreading and now directly effecting the money that i'm making. I know for a fact with winter coming Karens drug use WILL worsen.  Am I being unreasonable, or am I being as asshole?

146,"I just ordered 10 wings and a brownie from Wingstop.

I went in to pick up my order. The staff seemed very... disorganized to say the least. They were on their phones, and engaged in a conversation that seemed more important then helping me when I entered the establishment.

Finally, a younger and obese girl came up to the counter. I told her my name, and paid for my order. She goes “I’m not sure if the brownie is in the bag”. Which was the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard because why the fuck couldn’t she confirm if my brownie was in the bag. But before I could even comprehend the level of stupidity I was dealing with, I realized she also didn’t give me my drink. Feeling parched, I called out for her and said I didn’t recieve my drink.

She gives me the drink, and I leave. I then realize that I didn’t get my brownie. Silly me right? The bitch basically acknowledged the fact that it probably was never in there to begin with. Anyways, at this point I was pissed. I’m working out right now, and I need to hit a certain amount of calories to bulk. That brownie is a lot more than a chocolatey treat to me - being in a caloric surplus is crucial for building muscle. But anyways, I’m getting off topic.

At this point I’m irritated. So I pull back up to the wingstop, grab a brownie right out the little bin, and walk out without saying anything. I know I paid for the brownie. But I didn’t get a receipt to prove it. It’s not like I got chased out of the establishment or anything - I just wanna make sure nobody working there thought I was stealing. Like I mentioned before, the staff member helping me did allude to the brownie not being in the bag, so I am probably just being over paranoid.",04Sep2019,4

148,"This is a throwaway account to protect myself. I am a Veteran and only want to help, not hurt, other fellow Veteras. The actions of this nonprofit are....depressing, to say the least. 

To be completely honest, I am not entirely sure where to start. Basically, I recently worked for a medium-sized Veteran nonprofit that is now set to grow much larger within the next couple of years and, given that the particular concept of this organization is new, it will likely grow even larger quite quickly. This nonprofit is geared mainly toward homeless, or struggling, Veterans and assisting them. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of lying and stealing within the organization by the non-Veteran Executive Director and staff. For example: brand new items get donated which they pick through and grab what they want, they take food, hygiene items, and other various good from the food pantry (despite making 50k+ per year), and donated funds are allocated haphazardly over two main accounts with minimal accounting on the back-end. The Executive Director refused an audit for years (not sure how they managed that with a 501c3 designation) and was finally talked into getting one by the Board of Directors, however, the accountant on the Board informed them of a certain lesser audit (I don't recall the name) that would cost less and not be as in depth. This allowed the Director to slip through the cracks yet again. The entire community has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars in money and goods to help our Veterans and this particular cause. It has been a beautiful effort and amazing to see, but so much of it is being squandered. It makes me absolutely ill.

I kind of accepted that there was nothing I could do, but the whole thing came back to the forefront of my mind when I had found out this evening that the last full-time Veteran staffer (and long-time worker) got fired which left no one else to expose them and their misbehavior.

Side note:  I have several pages of documentation that points out their questionable accounting.",04Sep2019,2

154,"X-post from r/parenting because I want to get advice from parents and non parents. 

I had my first child, a girl, when I was 16. I got pregnant on purpose because I always wanted to be a mom. Well I wasn’t ready for a child and during her life I mistreated her. I physically, mentally, and emotionally abused her. I withheld food. I did this severely for at least 10 years of her life. I know now that I should have had her taken away from me, at the very least. There are times I believe I should have been arrested. I am deeply ashamed of what I’ve done to her. 

She is 24 now. I have three new kids, all very young (7, 4, and 1) with a good man. She doesn’t like my husband, and doesn’t speak to us much. She has told me she was diagnosed with “CPTSD”, which I don’t fully understand. She expressed to me that because of her diagnosis, she would be keeping herself distant until she can “recover”. 

During one of our very small chats, I asked her when her and her husband of 3 years would be expecting a child. She responded back that she was not planning to ever become a mother, and that her husband had gotten a vasectomy. When I asked her why she’s decided this, she told me that the trauma I put her through has turned her off to having kids of her own. She says she is afraid to repeat what I’ve done to her, to her own kids. She says that she thinks she doesn’t have the “mothering gene” (as she calls it) because I never showed her “real mothering love”.

I think my daughter would be an excellent mother, and it breaks my heart that she has chosen to have a life with no kids. I feel she doesn’t know what she’s missing. Her decision has caused yet another rift between us. 

For the sake of attempting to mend my relationship with her, how should I continue? I want grandkids and I want to spend time with grandkids and if I have to wait until my new kids give them to me, I’ll be in my 60s at least. I feel it’s unfair of her to blame me for her choice.",04Sep2019,0

157,"I am a 14 year old girl.  I probably don't have autism, just an introvert. I just wanted to see what people thought. I don't know if I have autism or probably just being a 14 year old, but I have some symptoms that I don't think are normal.  They include:
-I never change my background or location of apps on my phone. Same place, everytime I try to change them something feels off. Same thing with a bunch of other examples. I always sleep with the same blanket, with another blanket on top of that one. These are just two examples. I am not a neat freak, like my locker and room is a complete mess. I also hate changes to schedule. If a practice is changed to an hour early or late, my plans are shattered. I literally feel like I don't know what to do and just not want to go anymore.
-I have trouble with talking with people. Not normal introvert, like I don't know what people are saying to me. They will say a comment or story and I say cool. Sometimes I guess people probably want a little more. I also have problems figuring out what people mean. Like if it's a joke it will take me a while to get the punchline. Or even if it's serious I think its a joke. I also just blurt out random comments all the time that apparently don't have to do with the conversation. (According to my friend)

-I have tantrums. I hate them. I will scream and smack myself while bawling. It's not unconcouble, but there really hard to stop. They get set off by yelling, and other things. When I have one it's because I'd otn know whats going on. My emiontions are like a dump of different types of emiontions.

The day comes and 2 hours before we are supposed to meet up I ask where she wants to eat and I get no reply. Didnt hear from her ever again. Now I started this new job and had to be introduced to her, it was so awkward lol. I just want to know the best way to go about this to stop the awkwardness.

159,"Im kind of struggling. 
I've been having a hard time.
I have very little motivation, 
And I kind of want to die. 
I miss the way things were, 
Or how they used to be. 
Everythings so messed up now. 
I can hardly see. 

It's hard to sleep at night, thoughts of you creep up on me. 
The three of you meant so much, I really wish it were me. 

The pressure I feel is enormous.
It's incredibly hard to be perfect. 
I really dont like me, 
I wish people could see, 
I cant stand the way I am, 
Or how I used to be. 
I've never really loved myself, 
I really wish I could, 
I really wish I were different, 
I really wish I were good. 

I know I'm not the smartest,
I hate myself for that. 
I want to be the best 
But it seems so far fetched. 
I want to get A+'s
And be the perfect student. 
I want to give you bragging rights, 
I want to make you proud. 

What I really want is happiness, 
I want it with all of me. 
I want to smile all the time, 
And be as happy as could be. 
I wish I didnt compare myself
To everyone I know. 
It'd be a lot easier,
If I could just let go. 

I want to stop trying, 
Im so tired.
I know im not enough,
So why should I even bother? 
I wish I didnt care, 
What other people think.
Life would be so much easier, 
If I could just be me.

161,"Saturday evening Aug 31st I leave work just like any other day and head home... Along the way I see a vehicle about 1/4 mile ahead of me swerve towards oncoming traffic then I'm guessing in an attempt to get back in her lane, swerve back too far and drove straight into the ditch... I then witnessed the vehicle flip and roll several times and somehow land on its wheels and drive back onto the road... Once it came to a complete stop I pulled up to it and the driver gets out virtually unscathed screaming wheres my husband over and over again... By now another vehicle from on coming traffic that also witnessed this accident has pulled up and her and I turn on our lights on our phones to start looking for this ladies husband... The other witness found him and the driver runs to the guy and tries to resuscitate her husband as the other witness and I check for a pulse... After actually getting a good look of the guy I knew there was no saving him but still tried to help the woman so she didn't get any more hysterical... Once the police and paramedics arrived, they had us move away and broke the news to the lady that he was gone, she ripped away from the people trying to hold her back with the most soul shivering screams refusing to believe her husband was dead. She even ripped the blanket away after it and been placed upon his body... Once the police got her back up to the road while she was still screaming and crying, she looked me in the eyes and with everything she had and screamed ""Please go save him!"", all I did was stand there knowing there was nothing I could do... Ever since that night I hear her scream everytime I close my eyes, hear one of my kids yell, or even drive past the spot of the accident... How do I make it stop?

162,"Hey there,

I’m on my alt because I don’t want to sound like a jackass because my friends know my normal account. 

I’m going to preface this by saying that I don’t live in a rich family. Sure, we’re not poor, but currently I’m actually confused on how well off my parents are. We live in a small apartment (for reasons other than money), and I suppose you could say I’m spoiled, as I have many things a child would dream of owning. My parents have rather low level jobs, so I’m not sure how they can afford what I’m about to say, which is why I’m making this post.

I just turned 16, which means I can get my drivers license. About a month or two ago, my father rolled into the driveway in a Audi. I’m not going to get into the details of the car, but’s it’s a damn nice one and expensive too. He said he was fixing it for a friend (he knows how to fix cars and stuff), and indeed was fixing it for a while.

He occasionally wanted my help, but I sometimes didn’t help because at the time I was going through some stuff I don’t want to talk about. Basically I didn’t really help him fix the car especially when he needed it most. 

On my 16th birthday, he finally revealed that he in fact bought the car for me to use when I got my license, but didn’t want to give it to me until University as I didn’t want to help him fix it.

Aside from the point, I’m feeling extremely guilty, not because I don’t have the car for now, but because I realized how much he needed my help. I’m not creating this post for this reason though. I know he’s right and respect his decision, but I’m feeling still extremely guilty.

I want to drive to school, and he said I would be able to use it from time to time, but the problem is I don’t want to roll up to school in an Audi and be labeled a brat who gets everything they want. I’m really not like that and don’t want to be portrayed as that in school. I do my best in school, have hobbies and passions. 

How do I shake off this feeling? Of course I want to drive the car (who wouldn’t? It’s a fricking Audi), but I don’t want to be “that kid”.

I feel as if I’ve been raised in a unique family. I’ve been taught to appreciate what I have, and Id like to think I have a mature mindset for someone of my age.

Please don’t take this post as a brag. I’m actually quite worried and don’t know what to do.",04Sep2019,2

She hasn’t been in for a couple weeks, and I’m not sure if she just isn’t coming in or maybe she went off to school, and the reason I saw her as much as I did was because it was the summer.  I’ve wanted to maybe ask her out for a minute now, but I’ve always been too nervous, and worried it’d be weird or uncomfortable for her, and maybe make her not want to come into this place she genuinely enjoys going to.

To begin my interview was in the next town over, in a completely diffrent location, nothing much I figured it's not a big comqpany so not many people in power to interview in my town. The second odd thing was management, my onboarding was done by a manager we are going to call James. James ran me though the normal questions, and basics then told me to come back in a week. (keep in mind the interview was a month before so I've been after this job for quite a while) I come in a week later and it's a diffrent guy who we will call Ashit (fake name) Ashit is my actual manager, really cool guy so I thought from training. He runs me though the training, and seems cool. I need $2,000 by a certain date so i need hours desperately. After training he says text my number and I'll give you some hours. I text his number and get no reply. I wait a week. I call in the store and get a DIFFERENT number... no reply, I come in a week later and get an attitude from James. I come a few hours later to another manager working and get the now 3rd number... NO.REPLY. This is now my 4th week of trying to get hours and still nothing. I come in and finally find my manager and he offers me hours 2 weeks from now, but only working 3 or 4 hours every 3 weeks isnt going to get me the money I need in time. So my question is. Should I hold out longer see how it plays out or start putting my resume out there again.

I have only worked my training shift and nothing else for past 3 weeks (onboarding does not count as a shift and is unpaid)

177,"No specific individuals or companies are named in this story.

TLDR: I completed my contract faithfully and on the last day my past employer learned I was moving to a new academy within 2 km. I had only chosen this place with 2 weeks left on my contract and did not divulge to them I would be remaining in town. They are furious, claiming I ""lied"" to them and are doing everything in their power to tarnish my name and withhold any paperwork I may need to transfer my E2 Visa.

This is some of the most dramatic painful shit I have ever gone through in my life so I thank you for any thoughtful responses to the situation.

Early July \~ Notified past employer of my wish to leave- Reasons being I'd like a new challenge (mid/high school) \~ I had tired of teaching one of the younger classes &amp; the chaos of hundreds of students running around &amp; screaming had burnt me out. I also noted I'd possibly move nearer to Seoul.

Early August \~ I assist in hiring my replacement. Someone I had been close to during my stay in town has become a serious long term partner. My failed job search led me to seeking places nearer to my current city (as my partner lives here). My original motivation in seeking new challenges has changed to being near my partner.

Mid August \~ I find a position in town that is within 2km of my old school. We agree to pursue a working relationship in the future and I do not notify my original employer. Nothing in my contract notes any limits on where an employee may work \*after\* they complete their one year term. I choose to keep my decision private as to not rock the boat. I had figured it was my personal life and work decision, none of which is anyone else's business.

Late August: The last day of my employment, the old school is asking a lot of questions. The owners are questioning other employees and pressing everyone for information about where I will be going. Someone spills I may be relocating nearby (I never told anyone which city, just that I may be in town on occasion to see my friend). This launches a full investigation where the owners are calling nearby schools to see if I would be working there. We meet at the end of the day and I am berated for 45 minutes for ""not telling them the truth."" \~\~ I explained that my motivations had changed and I wished to be nearer my partner and that my future work is none of their business. They did not care and insist that my future job location \*is\* their business, considering it is so close. Nothing in the contract forbid this and I did not apologize because I felt I had done nothing wrong. We parted on very sour terms.

September \~ I begin at the new school where my past school's owners and head teacher interrupt the school's Opening Day operations. They interrogate the new school's owner and inform that they will send a Newsletter to their students' parents that I lied to them... That I hate teaching younger students. The former boss tells my new employer that they should not hire me because I am very strict, rude, and had many complaints. (One week prior this same boss had thanked me for my service, noting I never had any complaints. Some students brought cake, took photos with me and a couple were nearly in tears to see me go.) They also note that they may refuse to grant a letter of release (I don't think I need one) and may take other actions to ruin my transfer &amp; the new school's reputation.

In the aftermath of all this, I feel like a ghost or unwanted person in the town I called home for the past year and country I have called home for nearly five years. I never intended to harm anyone and just wish to be able to live/work near my partner and her family in peace. Sharing this story is a helpful catharsis and now I am just seeking a way to move on, transfer smoothly, and live my life comfortably again. My worst fear is my prior employer will continue to hold a grudge and take every action imaginable to block my transfer or make my life miserable. It's been an agonizing emotional whirlwind. Should I request an apology meeting with the old school? Will all of this pass? I don't know what to do or whom to turn to.",04Sep2019,3

I’ve been working in a masters program online for about 8 months. I took a leave of absence from the program back in March because the shelter was going to be opening up at this time and my wedding was in June so I was feeling swamped with stuff to do. Particularly because I knew opening up was going to have a lot of ups and downs, plus a huge learning curve.

Due to unforeseen circumstances there was a delay with opening and instead we opened about 3 weeks ago. My leave of absence is now ending and I worked 2 extra shifts in the past week and a half. It feels like there’s no time and I’m torn.

She has misplaced her keys numerous times, when I suggest she get a lanyard and hang them up she makes some idiot excuse as to why she hates lanyards. She LOST her first set of apartment keys and even now she still hasn't gotten a new mailbox key so she borrows mine all the time.
She never throws away the junk mail it will sit on the counter until I toss it, she claims she forgets.
She lets her dishes pile up in the sink until she runs out of dishes then she has to wash them 
She leaves food in the fridge until it rots and I throw it away.

She already is not a tidy not cleanly person but recently I had to use her bathroom and was appalled to see that she does not clean the litter box (or her bathroom for that matter).
The kitten is here but the landlord does not know because she was going to get a written form for the kitten as an ESA but has stopped seeing her therapist. There's a large pet fee that has to be payed (I have a cat myself and payed the fee) but she is horrible with her finances and I doubt she would have the money.
And also the kitten is old enough now to be neutered and she hasn't made any decisions a to get that done and I'm afraid he will start peeing to Mark his territory(as many make cats do) and destroy the house.

189,"Hi Reddit,

After getting so many quick responses to my last post and helping me calm down a little bit, I really wanted to ask about something else. I have this best friend, I am going to call her Dara. Dara has been my best friend for pretty much all of high school (i'm a junior now), she has also had a crush on a guy I'm going to call Sam. When she first started liking Sam, she asked Sam's bestfriend 'Sally' to ask him what he thought about her, he said that he wasn't intrested, and Sally proceded to tell Dara that he probably didn't like her because of her weight (she's on the chunkier side). This didn't really stop Dara though, and quite frankly her feelings progressed. We had this thing, where after school everyday we would gossip about what we saw happen between our crushes our guys we thought were cute. Things such as 'I saw Sam look at you today'. 

When sophomore year came, she had a lot of classes with me and Sam. She began kinda ignoring everyone for him, and began coming really close with his best friend Sally who in the past has been really rude to her. Sam also began hitting on one of our other friends I'm going to call Alyssa, Alyssa wasn't intrested as she was talking to someone else and ultimatley he stopped hitting on her. Dara was really hurt by this, but continued to like him. Dara, me, and our other friend would usually sit with Sam's friends, but we began noticing that she ignored us for Sam and Sally. Me and my friend began to distance ourselves from Dara, as it was getting too much to handle. I ended up getting a boyfriend, and hanging out with him a lot or Alyssa. Dara got really upset over thing and said I was ignoring her. She began doing some really mean things like pushing me out of the way when someone came, or would shame me when I didn't get someone a birthday gift even though they never gave me one. Finally summer came and I focused a lot on my relatiosnip, and was ina  really happy stage of my life. My boyfriend was a senior at the time, and graduated and was heading to a college. Me and Dara really didn't hang out over the summer, and I honestly didn't mind. 

When Junior year started I began hanging out with her more, as I thought maybe it was wrong how much I hanged out with my boyfriend and how left out my friends might have felt. But it still goes on, she ignores people for Sam and Sally, and they still talk about her. Sam's also said anyone who likes him is wasting their time, and when I told her she brushed it off. She has barely any classes with Sam this year, and says that she feels like our lunch is the only time she can see him. Which makes sense to me, as I really do want to see my boyfriend on the weekends. But I really don't know, how far she is really gonna go with this whole fantasy. It honestly feels like she's living in her own world, and it's getting too much. What should I do about this? I've talked to her and she puts up a fight, but she's my best friend and I don't want to just stop being friends with her. What should I do??",04Sep2019,1
190,"So my father was pretty garbage growing up, abusing my mom, brother and myself. So one day when I was younger (11 or 12) I decided I didn't want to see him anymore. 
Well my mom died a few months ago , and I was invited to stay with him during the funeral (out of state)  well my wife and I stayed , and actually enjoyed it, it seemed like he had really changed. 
He invites us to move down, and puts us in his phone plan to save money etc. 
Well we do, and everything's fine for a little bit , then we notice he drinks alot still, is super racist, and still basically the same old drunk abusive POS that beat my mom into having a brain tumor, long story short. We are back in our previous state, I'm trying to decide if we should keep the phones that he was leasing for us and sell them(ecoatm) and go back to my previous phone plan. Or send the phones back to him to return to AT&amp;T. It should be noted that he won't sue me because he has several warrants out for his arrest and tries to keep a low profile.",04Sep2019,2
191,"My fiance and i are currently long distance and are about to get married in 2 months. She will be moving from Canada to live with me in Texas. With the introduction of the September 1st laws I wanted to acquire a handgun to keep in my apartment. My SO is anti-gun and does not want anything to do with them. I on the other hand am 7th generation Texan and hunting/shooting was a big part of my childhood taught to me by my grandfather. Every time we try to have a conversation about me wanting to purchase a handgun for home protection she gets extremely upset. I have showed her the handgun, showed her the safe i would buy for it and explained how she would never have to see it or interact with it in any way. I have also explained to her that the only reason i would ever take it out would be to take it to the range with my relatives or friends. My grandfather taught me to treat firearms with immense respect and its something i value greatly. With the recent events in Texas she is more opposed to it as before and says she would feel on edge and uncomfortable in her own home. I do not want that to be the case. We have been through alot together and years of long distance, the last thing i want is for her to feel in constant fear in our house. My current plan is to purchase the handgun and have her take a safety course with me. I would like for her to try and expose her to it and learn with me. If she still feels uncomfortable with it in the house then i see no reason to keep it. Her well being is my primary concern and i feel like having a home defense handgun would give me an extra blanket of protection for her. Of course if it is doing more damage to her mentally then i would give it to my grandfather or father. I dont know, one day I would love to take my children hunting and teach them everything my grandfather and father taught me. I just dont see how this is going to be possible with her fear of firearms. If anyone has been in the same situation i would love to her how it played out. Or if anyone has any advice in general it would be appreciated. I just hope im not being unreasonable so please tell me if i am.",04Sep2019,0
193,"I’m a guy in my mid-thirties. I was diagnosed with ADHD in my late twenties when I went through a cognitive evaluation by an ADHD specialist in my area. After I was diagnosed, I was prescribed Adderall (extended release, 20mg twice per day), and it made a dramatically positive impact on my life. Like, it helped me to feel like I was more in control of my thoughts, and simple jobs stopped taking me three times longer than everyone else. 

Over time, however, I’ve become incredibly anxious and defensive. My anxiety and defensiveness is translating to anger and cruel outbursts in my marriage. Now, I’m not saying that this is because of the Adderall. But I’m not sure to what degree, if any, the Adderall is contributing to these feelings. 

I would like to find a psychologist or counselor who is able to help me sort through some of the feelings I’ve been experiencing. But I’d also like to get—I’m not even sure if I’m using the right terms here—like, an overall psychiatric evaluation? I guess that I’m concerned that the ADHD specialist that diagnosed me was only looking at my symptoms through a very narrow lens, and that maybe I was misdiagnosed, and that what looked like ADHD was actually some kind of anxiety disorder. 

I guess that I just want a more comprehensive evaluation that tests for many different possibilities so that I know what I should be focusing my attention on. But I’m not sure what I should be looking for or how to find it or to whom I should be talking. Should I begin with a psychologist who would then, as part of my therapy, help me find someone who could administer an evaluation and tell me if my current diagnosis and medication are right for me? Or should I start with a psychiatrist, figure out the meds, and then move on to a psychologist from there? 

I just don’t really know where to start and I feel lost. I’m not even sure if I’m asking the right questions, or if I’m making presumptions that I shouldn’t be. Thanks for any advice that you can give me. 

tl;dr: I want to 1) find a long-term therapist who will help me sort out my feelings and modify my behaviors, and 2) get a psychiatric evaluation to see if my diagnosed ADHD is actually an anxiety disorder. Which one of these two things should I do first, and how?",04Sep2019,2
194,"\*I am posting this to multiple subs, please don't get mad I just figured it would be easy to reach a wide audience\*

Let me provide some background before I go into more detail as to what specifically I need help with. I'm a sophomore in college and quite frankly I'm helpless when it comes to talking with girls, and it's something that's been eating away at me for a very long time. When I became a teen I felt like I was ""good"" at talking to girls, before that quickly dissipated away into social awkwardness. I'm able to talk fine with girls when I'm in a mixed group of guys and girls, but that of course is not going to lead me towards something that will give me a good chance at interacting with a girl one on one. Having a girlfriend, or having more intimate interactions with a girl is something I really long for, as it's not something I've been able to experience thus far and I feel is just something that's missing from my life, which is why I've turned to Reddit. 

**Where my problem(s) stem from:** This is oddly specific, but when I got braces from the ages of 11-13, I didn't brush my teeth properly or well at all when I had them, and as a result that yellowed my teeth tremendously, enough so that when I got them off, people wanted to see my smile and what I showed them was a very yellow smile (I remember a girl specifically whispering about it when I got them off). Now that killed my confidence and for years I just didn't smile (unless I was laughing or found something genuinely enjoyable or funny), it was mostly a smirk or a ""soft smile"". Fast forward 5-6 years and I've spent some money and whitened my teeth around a year ago, and I don't mean this in a cocky way but I feel like I have good, white teeth again. Despite this, I still struggle at smiling in a normal social interaction. What I notice from people who are good in social interaction, especially with girls, is that they're able to smile regularly (I'm sure regardless of whether something is being said or happening that would actually cause them to smile) and we all know that a smile in a conversation is very welcoming. I feel like that could be a good point for me to work on, however all my research has shown is how to ""smile well"", but I'm looking for something that is educational on smiling more regularly and easily. Any advice or help on that topic would be awesome, albeit if there isn't any I would understand because it's very specific.

&amp;#x200B;

**I'm bad at small talk:** Unless there is something going on that can be brought up in discussion (class work, social things, etc.) I struggle immensely with small talk, and small talk is important in building a relationship and interaction. While I realize that small talk is dependent on the conversation and the people, if there is any advice as to how to engage in better small talk overall it would be greatly appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Alcohol as a social lubricant is good, but obviously it can't be used all the time:** I would imagine many college students and high school students have similar experienced with alcohol or other substances, which act as a good social lubricant, and I am one of those. Alcohol allows me to be a little more ""free"" and talkative and often I'm willing to say more things (not always a good thing however). Now I'm not asking Reddit how I can be drunk more often, but how can I experience that good social experience that I often feel with alcohol in the ""real world""?

&amp;#x200B;

**Tinder and other apps I use to talk to girls, but I never know how to continue conversations:** Tinder is a very interesting app, I've had my moments with it but I really am trying to stick with it because it is a way to meet girls. Conversations over apps can be tricky and I recognize that, but are there any ways to be better at it beyond ""Hey"" and ""What's up""?

If you managed to read this far I'm greatly appreciative, as just reading it means a lot, and any advice that follows is even better. 

&amp;#x200B;

196,"Hi everyone. I have a possibly odd question. Does a person have the right to discipline a guest's dog in their own home? My cousin and his dog was staying with my husband and me. So he's family. His house is unlivable right now due to renovations. I know he's under a lot of stress due to that and the hurricane. So I said come stay with us and bring the dog. Well the dog was a little rambunctious, humping my leg (I'm a woman) and my husband's leg too. When my husband tried to move the dog over on the couch so he could sit down, I swear I think I saw the briefly go for him. Then the dog was pawing at my arm which left a scratch and all I said was ""No, no hitting/touching"" which I know sounds kind of ridiculous but I was annoyed that my cousin wasn't doing anything to discipline the dog. Well, after that my cousin's demeanor changed and within 2 hours he announced that he was going to a hotel because he thought the dog was stressing us out. This was after he picked the dog up and clutched him to his chest, caressing, overprotecting him and practically making love to the dog! There was a big loud venting about how he's really stressed out, he apologized and left. Was I out of line?",04Sep2019,1
197,I’m a freshman and my goal was to make it through at least this semester before letting my depression take ahold of me. However I’ve only been here for a week and it already feels like I’m drowning. I’m almost 800 miles away from home so I don’t know anybody here. I don’t know how to make friends. I feel alone and just want to stay in my bed and do nothing when I’m not in class or doing homework. My roommate and I do not get along very well. I have nobody. It’s hard for me to get out of bed in the morning. I don’t want to get to the point where I stop going to classes or doing my work. I did that in high school for a while until I got my mental health into check and I don’t want to repeat the cycle. I can’t afford to repeat the cycle. If I quit school I’ll be nothing and I’ll be in a financial hole all for nothing. Can someone please tell me this gets better. How can I meet people? How can I motivate myself? How do I stop myself from sinking?,04Sep2019,1
198,"This has been an ongoing problem for me for a majority of my life. Often times when a friend is going through a hard time, or they're opening up to me about something they're having trouble with, I have a really hard time giving them support of consoling them. My instinctive thought it usually something like, ""Wow that sucks."" However I avoid saving that, because it sounds insincere and dismissive. So usually I try to offer help or tell them what I think would help, but that's not always a good approach either.  


Here's what occurred recently that lead me to make this post. One of my close friends has been caring for her mom with Alzheimer's/ dementia, and her mom recently started entering the late stages of dementia. I've ended up just avoiding talking to her about it, because I'm just at a total loss of what to say. It's just such a shitty situation that can't be helped, and I feel terrible not knowing what to do or say. Since my normal mode of support is ""advice"" I think that's why I'm struggling so hard here. Because there is no advice to give. I feel like I can't even imagine what she's feeling because I was so not close to my own mother and I've never dealt with anything like that, so I just feel way under-qualified to speak about it.   


So...help please? What does reddit call this issue I have? Like general discomfort with certain emotions, and not knowing how to help others with verbal support? I just feel so insincere, because I think about what I say in these situations so much.",04Sep2019,1
199,"I have never been close to my Grandparents (Dad's side). They're very old school and believe children should be seen and not heard. So when I was a kid, I dreaded going over there. I was expected to sit quietly for hours while all the adults talked. Which was very hard for me, but I put up with it. 

When I turned 13, I was finally old enough to hold an intelligent conversation, so they wanted to ""get to know me"". By that point it was too late in my eyes. I was angry! They didn't care about me then, why now? Again, I put up with it. I listened to them lecture me about how ""Your acne would go away if you washed your face!"" and ""You shouldn't drink soda, you'll rot your teeth!"". This went on for years. 

Once I was old enough, I moved out and could use work as an excuse from seeing them. Since then our relationship has been distant, but cordial. When I did see them, I would make small talk, give them hugs and tell them it was good to see them. That's been the status quo forever... until a month ago. 

Every summer and winter, we all get together and have a reunion potluck. This is the first year I've been able to go with my two children. They're both toddlers and very rambunctious. I spent the whole time running after them and trying to make sure they weren't misbehaving. They weren't great, but for two little ones who needed naps and just spent 3 hours in the car... they weren't bad. We left early because they were getting and tired, and I thought everything was fine. 

It wasn't. 

I went to visit my mom later that week she told me what happened after we left. My grandparents started ranted about me. Talking about how misbehaved my kids are, and how my husband and I need to learn to ""control them"". Apparently they talked about it for over a HOUR! My mom and dad defended us, but they just kept going until they left. 

They have no right to judge me, they don't know me at all. They also don't know my children! I don't want them feeling the way I felt growning up. I'm not going to force a 2 and 3 year old to sit down and be quiet for 4 hours while the grown ups talk. They just spent three hours in the car and need a nap, what do you expect? It's not a kid friendly environment, so there's nothing for them to do. Of course they're going to chase each other and play. They're kids!!!

Now I don't know what to do. We're having another reunion in December... I don't want to go! Part of me wants to write them a letter and explain how I feel. Another part of me wants to just cut off all contact with them. Then part of me thinks I should just deal with it. They're old and have health issues, they're probably not going to be around a lot longer. 

What should I do?",04Sep2019,3

201,"I met my best friend in law school. He doesn’t come from the best background (not exactly hood but not well off either). He just got convicted of two violent felonies (neither involved actual bodily harm, only the threat of it). He asked me to represent him in the case but I have no experience in criminal trials so I refused. He fired his public defender at his first appearance. I spoke with his family and we all agreed to chip in a couple thousand dollars for a private defense attorney. 

He wouldn’t take it. He recently went to trial representing himself and, as I expected, he was found guilty. He’s looking at 5+ years in prison. He’s also got six figures of student debt and no job. He will almost certainly lose his license so he’ll have no way to legally pay off that debt.

***I would like to preface this off by saying I don't want to sound holier than thou or Judgey...I am legitimately concerned for my friends.***

# *Background*

So I grew up near a very small midwestern city (around 90k population).  The city itself is not an incredibly safe place....there are robberies, assaults, drug busts (hard stuff not weed) etc.  I've had several friends beat up just walking down the street.  There are lots of homeless people and the city just doesn't really care.

The city is a small college town.  There aren't many work opportunities in the area so everyone that I know ended up just working in restaurants.  Due to a perfect storm of food service culture and being near a ""party college""...many people will just consume alcohol like you wouldn't believe.  It all just feels like such a terribly desperate life.

I moved away to a much larger city.  There's a lot of work here (as opposed to restaurants and factories in my home town).  It wasn't incredibly difficult for me to get a job that paid enough to have a decent standard of living.  I feel like the move helped me break out of a really negative cycle of destitution and hopelessness.  I would like to help my friends do that too.

# *What caused me to ask this question*

I recently went back to visit my hometown.  All of my friends who are still living there were just guzzling alcohol and doing the same thing as when I left.  It's just hard to watch.  I feel like they are spinning their wheels and could be so much happier.  I just want whats best for them because they're my friends and I love them.  Should I just ignore these feelings or should I maybe try to convince them that there is a better life if they move?  I've had 2 friends in that city die from drug over doses....I really don't want to see others die.  I would like to try to help some people out of this really negative situation but I really have no idea what to do.  

Any advice, input, personal stories or suggestions would be great.  I'm really at a loss here.  Thank you.",04Sep2019,1
203,"So, growing up, my mom used to rave about this girl named Leah. How she’s stylish, beautiful, and even used to make comments that she feels jealous of the girl’s mom for having such a nice daughter. Meanwhile, I don’t think my mom has ever said any of those things to me. 

So I grew up with this girl and we are now both 21 years old. Well, by coincidence, I ended up dating a guy that she was in the same study group as her freshman year of college. 

Now, they are attending the same graduate school together, Leah and my boyfriend. So naturally, they are the only two who know each other in the school and have been spending a lot of time studying together. 

Today, they studied together for a long period of time after spending a whole day at classes together. 

I called my boyfriend and Leah answered and said “hey come on by and sit with us while we study” 

I couldn’t help but when I got there to have a pout on my face. I watched them as they interact and I felt so dark on the inside. Like this girl stole my mom’s attention and now she is stealing my boyfriends attention. When we left, I shouted at my boyfriend and accused him of having a crush on her. She is really not prettier than me, but I feel an awful type of way about her.

I am a university student who just started the fall semester. In one of my classes, we will be given quizzes each consecutive week on chapters from previous sessions. The professor also said we could use hard copy and E-versions of our textbook. Tonight was our first quiz, and I noticed that a young woman next to me was on her computer straight up  googling the answers. I watched her for a few minutes and she was skimming google and Quizlet browsing for the specific answers to questions. I wrote cheating in quotes because I am not sure if the professor will consider it to be cheating. My reasoning, though, is that one has to put a little effort into finding info from the textbook. It truly irks me to know she will likely get the same score as me when I have worked hard to study this whole past week. My gut is telling me to report it to my professor.

I do not think she knew that I was interested in her and I do not believe she knew I was gay until two months into her relationship. Since she had a girlfriend I began to back away from the whole scenario in my head but continued being her friend since we shared the same course. 

     It wasn’t until summer (middle of June) came then I began developing feelings again. I believe her girlfriend and her were still dating but she had informed me they had broke up because she began to lose feelings. We started texting everyday sending random picture of each other doing daily tasks. When school started up again (early august) we started hanging out and eating lunch together. Last Friday, we went to a football game and we held hands briefly. 

     There is complications though. Her ex posted a tiktok (silly,right?) about how my crush had moved on too quick. Her ex believed we were dating. She, then, posted another tiktok claiming the same thing that she was moving on too soon. My crush then stated that her ex was actually moving on too soon because she had stated she wanted to go to talk to some girl in her math course. My crush confronted her ex about the whole tiktok thing and told her we weren’t together. Later that same day we were walking together and my friend stated “oh the cutest couple” and my crush quickly shut her down in a rude way. I felt bad but I understood because she had just cleared that with her ex... but it hurt me. Right after we sat down to eat lunch and we made like a sex joke about us and also today we texted and she joked about being my “roblox girlfriend” I am confused...

     My crush claims she is over her ex but I’m starting to believe she is not. Is it too early to persuade anything with her? Do I move on or wait until she feels better? Do I talk to my crush about it? 

     Any help will be appreciated.",04Sep2019,2
212,"I have injured the muscles in both my thighs from my instructor pushing a workout routine too far. I have had difficulty walking for days. I have been in bed, only walking when I absolutely have to (I had to call in sick to work) but I still keep accidentally using the muscle and injuring it further. It has been 5 days since the workout and I’m still in a lot of pain. At rest those muscles keep spasming even though I’ve been putting ice on it and elevating best I can. This is ruining my life!

213,"I’m on the verge of tears rn i’m just really pissed.

I’m a senior female in high school &amp; there’s  a premed club and I filled out the application to become one of the leadership positions and everything and the teacher sponsor got back to me and told me that my application was in the top two and that she spoke to my reference and that my reference gave really good information about me and everything!! 

and that they let the other group leaders (all preppy kids) know and they had to choose between the application of me (sort of preppy) and this other girl (preppy and in their friend group) and they chose the other girl so now it’s all these preppy kids as the leaders

I’m just so mad because they seem to be ruling everything at the school and it’s making me so mad because literally every club is run by preppy kids like where do they come from ??

and at the football games! Who has the microphone in the student section? Oh! it to the preppy kids! Like what the heck it’s just making me so mad and there’s no diversity between the groups so I don’t know

 I don’t know what to do. The club hasn’t started yet or anything because they’re trying to get the leaders before the club starts or whatever but at this point I don’t even wanna join the club anymore because of course they chose the preppy girl like I can already tell it’s going to be based off of favorites and their friend group 

It’s really ironic because in my application, one of the questions were like “what is your goal for this position” or something like that and i said “I’m going to try to make sure that everyone who is in this group feels involved and feels like they all have a part in the group” but honestly I don’t now I can already tell that it’s not gonna work that way now w/ someone else as the position sooo idk what to do",04Sep2019,2

215,"I don’t even know where to start.

I am the oldest out of 4 
With my sis,brother, and stepbrother 

Recently today my parents were cleaning up some of rooms because we are going to have this person inspect our windows and whatever from hail damage for insurance. My stepdad is cleaning up my sisters room because it is a complete mess and finds a shit Ton of alcohol stashed away. My mom is at work when this happens and let’s me know first because work was already getting my mom angry.

Well when my mom came home my stepdad told her what my sister had done basically stealing alcohol,painkillers and other stuff with vitamins (idk why but yeah) and my mom comes from a family where she knows what it can do to you if abuse it. So my sis felt the wrath of her and yelled at her to where I could hear it from the other side of the house and found out she was doing it all summer long.

They get done talking and go to the car and start driving to alcohol anonymous. 

This is were hell breaks loose.

While driving there my sister breaks down and tells my my mom that my stepdad touch her when she was like 12-14 and so my mom is now talking to my stepdad and talked to me about it.

Asking me some questions but basically ended up saying that he might need a place to stay tonight and to watch my half brother who is 7.  Which still makes sense because it’s a lot right now, and I even said that either one of you could be right or wrong. Also saying that she may imagined the whole assault thing bc of my sis and stepdad not having a great relationship.

Now my sis did tell me this the middle of summer about the assault and the drinking (but not that much with the drinking)but I didn’t know how to react and we aren’t really in a finically stable place right now and then.

However my stepdad doesn’t seem like the man to do that. Like never, he never really had a great relationship with my sis but with me and my brother (who is now 13) he did. Even with my mom he has been with us for over 10 years now. 

I know what sexual accusations can do to a mans life but it’s completely different when it’s now apart of your life.

Any advice on what to do or say?

I have no idea who to believe or any idea on what to do next.

218,"So over the past few months I've been dealing with a dealership that has gone out of business due to bankruptcy. 

For a short back story on this dealership, two partners shared the lump sum of revenue after each year 50/50 off record. Apparently one ran off with all of the money, which included the money I paid for the vehicle, at the end of the year and left the other broke. The dealership is now permanently closed. 

I purchased a vehicle from this dealership a few weeks before the incident happened and have been without a title for the car. The auction company that the dealership had financed the car through originally is still holding the title because they have not been paid by the dealership. I have a car loan out with my bank worth about 40% of the car's worth, the rest was paid on card by myself. 

If I were to reach out to said auction company about this issue in obtaining the title, could they repossess my car? If the other partner can't pay off the auction's debt then who gets the bill? My insurance company (also my bank where I got the car loan) advised me to get a lawyer to handle the matter, but what would that solve? What should/shouldn't I do in this situation?",04Sep2019,1

I partied with them a few nights the first week before one of the girls knocked on our door and I answered. She asked me if I could help her with drafting a fantasy football team and to come watch movies later and I of course accepted.

Fast forward to that night when we were all over there drinking and I helping her draft her fantasy team. The night was going very well, so I decided to ask one of her roommates if she was single. She said she was talking to a guy about an hour away and that it wasn’t serious, and that I should go for it and seem like a good fit for her. 

I decided to take a leap and just ask this girl to talk 1 on 1, and I told her how I felt about her. She told me that she wasn’t really looking for anything at the moment since she was iffy with this other guy, but she said “hey you gotta shoot your shot man”. 

I won’t lie, it’s bummed me out pretty hard the past few days, I don’t really know what to do now since I still wanna be friends with her and all of her roommates, should I apologize to her for the way I approached her about telling her the way I felt?

I have a close friend from Kenya who recently finished law school, so I asked my client if they had any job openings for her, and he said he'd be happy to interview her, but that she first had to meet with the HR Manager (who is female and Latina).

I went on vacation for a couple weeks and  while I was gone my friend was called in for an interview. She told me that when she arrived the receptionist called the HR Manager who was in the office right next to her. I've been to this office before so I can confirm the walls are thin. 

Apparently she overheard the HR Manager ask the receptionist ""What does she look like?"" and the receptionist started speaking Spanish. Little did they know my friend is fluent in Spanish and she understood almost everything they said, including when they called her ""Negra tonta"" which basically means dumb negro. The receptionist laughed and told the HR Manager that an interview would be a waste of time. 

The receptionist turned to my friend and said that there was no interview scheduled. My friend pulled up an email showing the confirmation and so the receptionist found someone else from irrelevant department to conduct the interview. My friend didn't say anything to not cause a scene and went through the interview with a lady who although quite nice had no idea why she was interviewing my friend.

Met girl on app, we started talking while she was in a relationship, one thing led to another and we did stuff (not during but as she was planning on breaking up with her ex), she got out of the relationship and wanted to date me (I also wanted to dat her), I left because I was dealing with my own issues and didn’t think it was fair to put more stress on an already stressed out girl, dealt with my issues, came back, we had sex, and maintained a fwb relationship until a week or two ago, she tells me that she only wants an open relationship if we did date, I tell her I can’t do that for her but will still support her, she finds people who will do an open relationship with her, she starts to distance herself from me and barely talks to me for more than 5 minutes or only sends me streaks. 

Why do I feel used? I feel like she only used me for sex and that was all she wanted from me. Anytime we hung out it was only to pleasure her or to fool around. Did I enjoy it, sure, but I did it under the conversation of us dating that we had before. She told me she wanted to date but wanted to wait and now she doesn’t want to because I’m not wanting to see her have sex with another guy.

He said hes ok with that. I thought he was cool and I like his personality but I don't know what to think. I have depression, anxiety and abandonment issues so stuff like this stresses me out. I understand that people really can be busy but then I also think what if I'm just put on the back burner and hes talking to a bunch of other woman to see who bites and I'm just wasting my time. The day I started talking to him he deleted the app I meet him on. I checked and his account was gone. He said he deleted because there weren't any woman with substance.

So option 1:
-Seems like a more straightforward class, but professor is probably crazy lol, she said people on reddit hate her, and she actually was talking about lizard people, and idk what’s wrong with her but she’s weird 

-kind of like your textbook overweight, white, fat,  far left, hyper liberal woman, and it’s annoying but bearable, but the only thing I’m scared is that if I don’t agree with her opinion than she’s going to grade me harsher/worse

- but there’s this really cute girl in that class, and I met her today and she laughed at whatever I said, and we walked to our next class together so I have a walking buddy there (don’t know if she has a boyfriend)

-grading largely rides on 1 midterm that’s 20%, and final is 50%, which I don’t really like



Option 2: 

-professor is just boring and what makes her more annoying, is that she’s unforgivingly unaware how boring and uninteresting she sounds

-unorganized class, and we jump between books and we’re reading two plays right now 

-friends with group of cute girls there, but the one I’m interested in has a boyfriend (i did research lol), but everybody is playful and fun there, and they’re really flirty and fun, and have their social media’s

-they’re walking buddies too, and it’s cooler bc it’s 2 really cute girls and me 

-grading is spread out on two papers 25% each, two essay exams 20% each (but we are given prompt beforehand), and 10% participation

I've been in this class for about two weeks now (four class sessions). I sat next to this cute guy, and we've been talking in class regularly. He even initiated conversation at one point, so I was certain he wanted to at least be friends, or he was cool enough with me to talk.

However, when the professor called for a break and I went into the break room to use the vending machines, he seemed to do a 180. He came in a little bit after me, and I greeted him. He said hello back, and went into his pockets, only to say that he forgot his wallet back in the classroom. I offered to pay for his drink, but he said no. I waited for a bit in the break room, because I wanted to chat with him. 

When he didn't show, I went out onto the balcony and saw him sitting outside on his phone. I don't think he went back to the classroom at all, because the amount of time between me waiting and seeing him outside wouldn't have allowed that to happen.

I went back into class and didn't talk to him at all.

The stuff we talked about in class last time was what I considered just regular small talk. We bonded over our mutual hatred of the professor, I asked how old he was and I talked about my age, I even made some jokes about the shit I got into back in highschool. I made him laugh quite a bit.

241,"Hi all,
My (16, M) biggest problem that makes people not like me is I am annoying. I struggle with social cues enough that it can annoy others around me but not bad enough that it gets me in trouble or makes people outraged with me, people seem to think I am socially awkward and I see no reason not to agree with them. I want to be funny and try too hard to the point where it becomes annoying. I tend to find humor in not so typical things and a joke will be funny for longer for me than it would for other people. I’m still able to make friends with good people who aren’t annoying like I am and aren’t degeneratey, however I feel they may not like me all that much do to me being hard to be around. I don’t know how to practice being likable and it is frustrating because I either try too hard and piss people off or am an emotionless potato, in other words I struggle to find harmony. I want to stop but I can’t figure out how to be likable but not boring at the same time and I find myself being really damn annoying sometimes and I can’t seem to stop myself. Would this be something worth bringing up with my councilor? My fear is that they will misunderstand my social awkwardness with social ineptness and put me in a social skills group with others that struggle with basic social steps that I understand. If you have any ideas of what I can do to work on being funny and tolerable I thank you in advance. Have a good day!",04Sep2019,2

The charge is a check fraud charge and it is a seven month sentence. My daughter she seems to be handling it fine. I told her right away about it and she reacted pretty calmly. I told her mom did the wrong thing and is rightfully serving her punishment. They have a good relationship. The main problem I have is she will see her mom in a jail jumpsuit and see guards and other inmates that could be intimidating.My daughter doesn’t seem Scared but rather enthusiastic and excited but I still am not sure it is a good idea. Seeing someone she knows in jail could “humanize” the place. You want to go remain a place for “bad people” and seeing her mom there will probably take away that effect",04Sep2019,0

250,"To start, sorry for the wall of text and ""chick lit"" level of writing, by the way.

So I graduated college a couple of years ago. I had a bunch of friends that I cared a lot about, people that I've never felt closer to. After high school, I didn't feel very worried or like I was losing my friends. Part of the reason was that one of my good childhood friends and a handful of people I knew locally were attending the same college as me. Still, I lost connection with a number of people as we went our separate ways. Some flew off South, some flew off North, and some didn't even leave our hometown. It didn't bother me, though. I had freedom being away at college myself.

After some time, I drifted apart from the familiar, hometown friends that I then called my college classmates. I wasn't particularly upset or overwhelmed; it wasn't like we weren't going to see each other again. Those friends just found a new group they absorbed into, and so did I. My sophomore year, my housing situation changed. I found myself in a dorm with a whole group of people I'd never met before, with a roommate I had only met the previous year. My classes brought their own stressors, but, still, I didn't have much to worry about otherwise. So time usually melted away doing the dumb college shit you'd expect: getting drunk, getting high, playing video games, going to the library, the dining hall, wherever. Only this time started to be spent with the new group of people I shared a floor with. The people I met on that floor became the highlight of my time spent in college. Years went by with that group, and we continued to stick together. More parties we threw, more intimate moments with each other, more memories made doing dumb shit.

In all that time, I began to come out of my shell a bit. I started opening up to people a little bit more, though not entirely. I was keeping something from everyone, even to this day. I became very close with one friend in particular. He was always in and out of relationships, but eventually he started to settle down with this one girl, and they started getting very serious. Despite it all, we'd spend nights staying up and talking about anything and everything. I saw him, and he saw me. He and I would have, what I felt, was intimate moments. And I feel like he felt that way too. We'd get physical with each other, not in overtly sexual ways, but rubbing each other's backs or play fighting, wrestling. I never felt that way about someone. His presence became intoxicating, and, although I knew how ridiculous it was, I'd go out of my way for him, even when he wouldn't return the favor. He had a girlfriend for christ's sake. I'm not sure what I expected. All I knew was being around him, having his attention felt like I wasn't so alone.

So fast forward to a few years later, and graduation is coming up. Unlike high school graduation, I was dreading it. Suddenly, I need to start making big decisions. Suddenly my major stopped being *just* a major and started becoming means to getting food on the table. Suddenly I was thrust into an industry with zero experience and little to interest in the field. All of that was fine. It was who I'd be with through it all that scared me. The months leading up to ""the big day"" was constant arguments with my friend that I felt so affectionate towards. I was attempting to remain in his life, as a friend, but he all but said he wanted me out of his. I was faced with a choice: move across the country to California with my best friend who I had known for years, or try to continue on in the old college town. I chose to move across the country. Admittedly, I did it in spite of the guy I had fallen for. As I thought about it more and more, I realized it would have been not only a great experience, but maybe a way of dealing with the feelings I had for this guy.

I knew after college graduation, everything would change, and as much as I was dreading it, the promise of opportunity on the horizon made it all better. At the same time, everything felt...worse? I knew I'd be able to find a job; there was no issue there. I was anxious for the entire time building up to the ""big move,"" but once I got out there, I hit the ground running. I found a job within 2 weeks. The work was dull, and the people I worked with were nowhere near interesting, but it paid the bills. Entering the world of 9-5 was tough. I felt time running out on the existential clock, and every day spent driving to work felt like a little tiny loss of myself. I'd wake up without any intimate connection to the people I was living with, go to work where I was at most 20 years younger than the next guy, and I'd go home with a few hours of time left to get high and play some video games.  

I persevered, though. I made it through. And it was in part due to the occasional contact I'd make with the guy I had feelings for. I'd even see him occasionally when I'd fly back. It would usually end with me flying back to California feeling more numb than before. I'd usually start some drama to get a rise out of him. I'd make him upset by purposefully leaving in the dark on plans, then I'd apologize the next day on my flight back. There was always some similar drama.

During my time in California, I decided to work on myself. I ate healthier, I tried getting on an exercise regimen every morning. It was a rollercoaster. There were times when I felt like I was doing it only to make him jealous. There were times I felt so confident, that I'd go on Tinder and actually look for guys to get coffee with. Then there were times when I felt like I was only doing it because there was nothing left to work towards. My first job was a farce, and my group of friends in California was zero, so working towards making my body better felt like a worthy cause. Besides, now that I'm going to get coffee with guys, I need to look better. I wouldn't want to be with me either, looking like I did. Most of the guys I was interested had it so much more together. This was short lived, though. One awkward date was enough. Besides, maybe I was asexual? Maybe I should just wait until I'm in a better place physically and mentally to start looking for something. Days turned into weeks turned into months turned into almost two whole years. Eventually, I decided to move back home.

It was a long time coming, and I knew I wasn't going to last in California. I had spent days at a time, maybe even weeks, without talking. I felt absolutely isolated for the better part of my time spent there. I'd get these spurts of ""inspiration"" where I'd find the freedom in solitude, and I became accustomed to it. I went to movies alone. I went grocery shopping alone. I ate alone. It wasn't to say I lived alone, of course; I had roommates, and I'd chat them up from time to time. But it was hollow. I never felt much of a connection to them. 

So my move back to Boston was exciting. I'd finally be back in my home state. I'd be closer to the friends I had grown so close to all those years ago, back when I wasn't so alone. Only once I got back, everything was different. Everyone was different. *I* was different. My friends I cared for so much were scattered, off with a new group of friends, or getting married. Some of them were starting new jobs at prestigious companies. Many of them were blossoming. I, on the other hand, was a recently unemployed Golden coast transplant who needed to move back in with his parents. The fact that I was unemployed was, honestly, a bummer, but not the end of the world for me. I spent weeks doing mostly nothing, but job prospects were moving along. I received offers after a couple of weeks, same as when I moved out to Cali. But it was again my concern with who I'd be with. Job prospects were somewhat bad, though many were happy for me and saw me as being pretty on par with everyone else in terms of my career. But still, I felt heavy with the weight of everything.

This brings me to the reason I'm writing this at almost 1 am when I have to wake up in 5 hours to drive to work. I took a job close to the college town I so desperately thought I'd need to move back to. The job seems like a pretty good fit, and I think I'd be happy working there. The problem is that the commute from my home is about *an hour and a half each way*. With all of these things weighing me down, how am I supposed to manage this hellish commute? The stress and anxiety is building up faster and faster. The loneliness I felt those years in Cali is feeling more and more isolating. Should I move back to my college town, where I have at least a small-ish social net of 3 or 4 people? (I'll feel like a loser if I did this.) Should I continue to commute because it's more financially beneficial living with my parents? (I'll feel like a loser if I did this.) Should I try to find a place in another, cheaper neighboring town where I can explore my sexuality more, go on some dates with some guys, and have the space for myself to really figure all of this out? (This sounds even more lonely than California, to be honest.) I'm stuck here.",04Sep2019,1
252,"As far as I (20f) remember my dad was an abusive alcoholic for most of my childhood until he messed up big time and got sent to prison were he ""learned his lesson"" and promised he would never drink again but here we are eleven years later...

255,"Context: I’m in college and have school 3 days a week this semester. On Tuesday and Wednesday is a English class and on Thursday I have history. Each class is 3.5 hours long. 

Well last Thursday I asked if I could sit in the spot next to them and we started talking. I walked in a bit late and the seat I sat on the first day last week was taken, and so were most of the other seats so it was a good enough excuse.

My crush said they recognized me from somewhere before, and while talking we realize we have a few things in common and we even spoke about some personal topics. The 4 hours seemed to fly by. 

I’ve noticed that in our other class that takes place 2 days in a row, another person sits 2 seats away from them in a row of 3 seats. 

I think this person could be interested in my crush and the last thing I’d want is for them to get too buddy buddy and for me to lose my chance. Only a few classes have gone by, and tomorrow I’m planning on sitting in the middle, between them, which means I’m ditching my buddy/partner (really nice and friendly at my old seat but can’t really speak English so there’s a bit of a language barrier unfortunately. And I might hurt their feelings.)

I think it’s better to switch now while it’s still early in the semester.

256,"Me and two of my friends, who I’ll call friend A and Friend B, attend a school with a very heavy lgbt population. I’ve always been fine with it, I have family members and other friends that are apart of the lgbt community, and I’ve always seen it as normal. I’m an atheist, and my two best friends are very Christian, when they talk about Christianity, I usually try to avoid the subject to not offend them.

However, recently they’ve started saying some pretty bad stuff. The other day, we saw some graffiti that said “god is gay”. Friend A laughed and said “why would god be gay and say being gay is a sin?”. He said it in a casual tone so I assumed it was a joke at first, but this talk has started to become more common and less joking. 

One time, someone overheard one of them say something homophobic and asked them “do you guys actually think all gays are bad people?”. Friend A responded with “No, but they have committed a serious sin and they need to repent for it”. This was the moment I realized that they weren’t joking.

Friend B seems to have the same opinions as A, but he talks about it less and seems to believe it less then A. The homophobic talk has started to really make me uncomfortable and I want to get them to stop, but I don’t know how.

I could tell them how I feel, and ask them to not talk about it around me, but it still makes me uncomfortable that they hold those beliefs in the first place.

258,"Lately I been trying to achieve great self esteem. I started seeing a good dr and treating a medical issue I had since 17 that cause me to feel depressed/anxious.

I wanted a new life, got a new job, even got a friend out of a toxic place and work in the same retail. That's when social outings started, coworkers started asking to go to a bar and I was not comfortable but really wanted to go out and get out of my shell. 

As a kid I was bullied and even went through horrific episodes of bullying. I'm 21 and I thought it was put behind me until yesterday...

Yesterday, I sat down with my friend and co worker. I was going through stress of school and we all started to talk. Well suddenly this girl told me she wants to tell me something without feeling attacked. 

Her: ""K theres been things bugging me about u, I honestly get annoyed with how u cut ppl off and ramble and it's like u dont switch off, last week u cut ppl off. As a good friend I think u should consider this especially knowing u r gonna be a social worker this has to be stopped and it been bugging me the whole week.""

I'm the type to own up to my wrong doings and I recalled speaking the outing she was speaking. I remember I was asked questions, therefore the reason as to why I spoke. I dont know why I dissociated myself and started to remember shitty things that ppl did to me the past month. I blanked out and she kept going at it and I just felt hot tears run down.

Then she started to pyscholigize my behaviour and do therapy? Then started to rub my back and told me to tell her my problems. I told her to basically to back off and she started talking about God? I'm spiritual but that was just fucked up. Then bring to surface my breakup that recently happened. 

Her: ""are you personalizing it because your bf also said this to you?""

On my way home I told my friend why she didn't stick up for me when she knew I was silent cause I was vulnerable.

She then said ""well cause its true."" I been friends with her for 18 years and that hurt. If anything this friend doesn't know my issues because I been attending to her problems. Each time I wanna speak it goes back to her and I never complained because I knew she needed me. As well defended her when this coworker also called her annoying. 

This coworker then tried to put a bandaid on the wound by saying she wants me to go to her party on friday. I honestly dont know how to recover from this. I feel like I cant be myself and doing this post I cant help but hear her words that I ramble. I feel super awkward and embarrassed that there was an intervention about who I am.

263,"Every year, my high school holds an athletic competition at our beginning of the year party. The competition involves basic indoor athletic events and culminates with a 1 on 1 basketball game between the two finalist.

 Pretty much all the ‘cool’ students partake in this event every year, and I’ve won the past 3 years (freshmen, sophomore, &amp; junior yr). I’m a senior this year so all I needed was one more win to pull off the ‘dynasty’. I would also get additional scholarship money if I won yet again. 

Everything was going great, I had assumed I was well on my way to a fourth straight title to cap off my high school career but then a tall, boney freshmen girl started mowing through all of the other top candidates. She ended up making the championship where she would face off against me. I didn’t think much of it, as I had figured there’s no way this young unknown would beat the experienced senior guy.

I just suppressed everything until I had a really bad breakdown and finally had to go to the hospital and then the psychiatrist. I took a break and I'm much better now.

Two years have passed and during this time I was able to work in a social work field helping the impoverished youth around my community  and I really found a passion for it. 

However, I was just lucky to get that part time job and any ""legit"" job in my country (Philippines) needs you to have a bachelors degree. I don't have enough money for college, being a working student isn't really feasible since any jobs I could get here won't be enough to pay for my school year, and if I save up that's another year that's gone by and I'm just getting older. 

Although my parents are saying they'll pay for it, just thinking about it makes me feel so guilty and awful since I basically wasted thousands and thousands already for my failed education degree. We're lower middle class and they're already paying for my younger sister's schooling and in a year she'll be in college as well. I was supposed to be done already and help out even just a little with her tuition or with the house bills yet here I am. Going back means starting all over which also means 4 years of school. 

The thought of school also fills me a bit with dread since in the back of my mind I still associate school with that time in my life when I was so miserable.

I kinda messed up the past two days with work. 

I just started concreting with my cousin who owns the small company and usually I message him the night before around 4pm if I am working tomorrow and he will usually say this place and time. But the past two days have been a bit of a mess up on my behalf even tho deep down I really don't wanna take the blame even tho it is mainly my fault. 

I did my usual am I working etc, but I didn't get a reply so I assumed I wasn't working yanno? (casual worker) but I get a texted at 5:14am saying I'm working 6:30am and I was asleep at that time and missed 3 calls later on so kinda fucked up there. Sent a text later on saying sorry I missed your calls I was asleep.

Ff to today, there was no text again just 1 call in the morning I didn't pick up cause I was asleep and called him and he asked where I was I said I didn't get a text or what not etc. He asked if I got his text yesterday I said I didn't see it or something pre much me saying I didn't get it (even tho I did) I feel bad considering they were doing the slabs and shit and only 2 people wee there I believe unless he got someone else to go.

Anyways I called him and asked if I'm working tomorrow he said I'll let you know, at this point I have to make up for fucking up the work schedule with the pouring n shit so I'm gonna assume I'm going. This is really bad responsibility on my behalf as a young adult. But only thing I can get out of this is life lessons of being more responsible. Hopefully I don't get fired for this since it's the first time happening. I'm usually a good worker and if he is told I'm working I rock up first one.

Cause I have a few rules im trying to make the language follow, I've narrowed down the alphabet  from 26 to 18 letters without cutting the versatility, the general purpose of the language being spoken is to have the intent of what your saying be the thing that sticks instead of the literal thing you said, for example one person could say just the word ""fire"" and mean that he's gonna make a cooking fire, whereas someone else could say fire and mean there's a fire on the east of town, that kind of thing, for context this is an ancient language im trying to make for dnd to be able to make it more authentic for the players",04Sep2019,3

274,"It’s difficult to wrap up in a cohesive paragraph, but my relationship with my mother has always been really rocky. She is a textbook manipulator/guilt tripper and I always manage to leave her house crying or feeling bad about myself. 

Somehow she’s created this narrative that I was an awful child. She loves getting every opportunity she can to blame me for everything and discuss how awful I was to her or how horrible I was to raise. Now, I am bias to myself, but I was a normal kid. I had the typical teenage mood swings, but I never hung out with the wrong crowd. I didn’t do drugs. I didn’t go to parties. The most I did was sneak out to hang out with the senior boy that she banned me from seeing. But for some reason she discusses me like I’ve always been the literal devil child. It really has taken a toll on me and my overal view myself. It makes me feel like I’ve always been this heavy burden on her and I’ll never be good enough. I struggle with depression very heavily. 

Without too much back story, she used to hit me and push me into walls, dig her nails into me, etc. when I was younger. She very obviously has/had anger issues and to do these things to me was never excusable (one time it was simply because I spilled a drink on the floor). Recently I brought this abuse up to her, along with the fact that she never has apologized for anything or owned up to any mothering mistakes she’s made, and she proceeded to say that I was an awful kid and I “drove” her to it. AKA it was my fault she practically abused me. 

She’s said a number of things that have been difficult for me to get over. One time she told me that I “don’t know how to love” which is such a depressing thing to tell someone. 

I’m guilt tripped for almost everything and everything is always a backhanded comment. I don’t see her enough, she is my biggest supporter and I don’t “appreciate” all that she’s done for me, and other similar themes. And she may be right, I should be around more perhaps. But it’s hard for me to want to go visit her or speak to her when the conversations almost always turn to negativity, judgment, etc. 

I would also like to support this with the fact that I have three other siblings and they would agree with me on all of these points and know how manipulative and emotionally abusive she can be. I would think that if she has four children saying these things about her, she would be able to stop and think “huh, maybe they’re right. Maybe I do need to work on ____.” But she had the nerve to tell me the other day that I just interpret everything she says wrong. Alas, shifting the blame to me again. 

I’ve tried to have adult conversations with her where I try to lay out our deep rooted issues, and how I’m always blamed for everything but that she is unable to take a look inward at what she could have done better or what she could do differently. She doesn’t seem to have the ability to admit to her faults and instead has to deflect and project on others. I’m getting exhausted with trying to mend things, and we have so many unresolved issues that it’s hard for me to ignore and just hang out with her like everything is fine.

I guess I’m not so much looking for advice as I am wondering if anyone has dealt with similar toxic parental relationships. What did you do to solve them? Can they ever be solved or do you just have to accept that it’s how they are? Is someone a complete asshole for cutting their parent out of their life? Is setting boundaries too much to ask? (i.e. I can only come see you if you agree to work on this and this) 

Any comments would be helpful.",04Sep2019,1

I have credit card debt my parents put me in plus school debt plus a medical bill that my insurance refuses to pay for because of a error by the hospital. I can't live on my own for this reason. My family is falling apart due to my parents fighting and I don't know who's in the right. I try to hear them both out but I can't tell who is making stuff up and who's telling the truth. My mom says my dad goes and gets angry at her and threatens to hurt her. But my dad says he's trying to talk to her and even has vague video evidence that he doesn't hurt her. My mom claims my dad won't let her make her own money but my dad says he's the one pushing her to get a job. It's a mess. My brother wants to fix everything but is taking on to much weight and now is wants to kill himself. I have 2 other siblings that I can't just leave. I really want to leave this house with all my heart but I can't due to debt. I'm working full time in retail till I can put my degree to use in anything. I even have a wonderful girlfriend that is sadly long distance due to collage but we have a ""plan"" to move in together in a year and a half when she's done. But my family is killing my happiness. I consider myself a very strong minded person but I'm afraid they're breaking me. I haven't even cried since I was like 5 or something. Today my mom tried to call the cops and have my dad kicked out of the house and my dad was taking a video of the whole thing. He did nothing wrong but he did push my brother to say he was going to kill himself again. Watching the video was hard and it broke me but he didn't do anything to hurt my mom he just didn't want to go to jail on lies. But I also understand he's a bad parent for putting himself before his child who was saying he wanted to die. I don't know what to do. They've been saying they want a divorce and it's in the process but for unknown reasons (to me at least) never happens. Should I've tried talking to all of them but no one wants to admit who's wrong or lying to me. I don't know who to trust. What should I do? I want to run but I can't. And I can't support myself and I can't just leave this family alone or they will destroy each other. I'll probably lose my brother if I leave too. I also can't work on my portfolio to get a job because of work and their constant fights leave my drained by the time I do get free time.

283,"Ok so this will probably be a long post. Will definitely need the backstory. (Sorry I don’t have any friends but need to know if I’m the asshole) 

So basically, i met this guy in high school. We clicked really well as friends and became really good friends pretty quickly. We had a couple classes together and same lunches, so we were around each other a lot. I could absolutely be my 100% self around him and we told each other literally everything, like he knew me better than my family did and same for him. He was the person i could always talk to for advice during a toxic, mentally and emotionally abusive 2.5 year relationship. (Kinda relevant later)  so basically he was always there for me and vice versa, you get the gist. 
Even though I knew he always genuinely cared for me as a friend, I always knew it was a little more than that. His friends would ask if we were dating yet, or why we weren’t dating yet etc. and he just told them it wasn’t like that and that he looked at me as a sister, as i looked at him as a brother. But again, I just always kinda knew even though I didn’t feel that way. Yet, anyway. So time goes on, we get closer, then I start to have a little bit of feelings for him. I don’t tell him though because I’m just not the kind of person to do that lol (ugh). 
Eventually he gets a girlfriend, we’ll call her Alisa, and I’m genuinely happy for him because he deserved it. I wasn’t so upset because I thought it was just going to be another 1-2 month relationship and it was over with. But time goes on and they’re still together. So because of that, I had distanced myself a little bit because I didn’t want Alisa getting the wrong idea. I respected their relationship 110%. 
Months go by, we don’t talk as much as we used to, and any feelings I had are gone. But he texted me one day to tell me Alisa’s pregnant. I was shocked (we were 16-17 at the time) because this dude was not at all in the position to have a baby. And neither was she. I stayed supportive though but again still kept my distance. We talk even less now after this, maybe once every couple months, and it’s definitely not the same. He texts me again, when the baby is born. Beautiful baby, I was so happy for them!! We talk a little, everything’s all good. Then it goes back to not talking for a couple months. Texts me again, same conversation, except he tells me that him and Alisa are having issues and fighting a lot and are wanting to take a break. Talk him through that, communication dies down again. 
Fast forward to two years later(current). He texts me again one day and we’re talking about how we’ve been and stuff. Tells me things haven’t gotten any better with Alisa, and he had moved out and was living alone with the baby. I was upset for them because I knew they wanted it to work for the baby. Anyway, we end up talking for a longer period of time this time around. And he talked to me like he did when we were first friends, just seemed a little happier. 
Then I’m at work and get a second text from him, but the second message was a whole ass novel. I open it and it’s him pouringg his feelings out to me and telling me he’s always had feelings, but just didn’t want to ruin a great friendship. He told me that he just needed to get  it off his chest. It took me a minute to respond but I just thanked everything he said to me and told him that I did have feelings for him before him and Alisa got together(almost 2 years ago) but I just never wanted to say anything because i am not at all a person that would get in between a relationship, and he said he knew and respected that.  But he was a little upset i never told him because he’s had feelings since we’ve been friends, for about 4 years now. He told me even through dating Alisa, he had feelings. This was something I didn’t know how to respond to considering in that 2.5 year relationship, I was cheated on for 1.5 years of it. Michael knows how I feel about things like that. 
Anyway after he spills his feelings, I tell him I won’t let it affect our friendship, and I didn’t, and continued talking to him as my friend. But he would say things like “I’ve always thought you were the most beautiful woman inside and out, i could go on for days if you’d like” blah blah blah but idk i just wasn’t comfortable with it, so I’d just ignore the messages. He would ask what my feelings were currently and I would just nicely say I didn’t have them anymore. We kept talking but it started to be not as much. It died down over the next week, but i would still send him conversation starter Snapchats every once in a while just to kinda let him know that I’m still here as a friend and still want to be your friend. But he would open them hours later and just not respond, which he has literally never done to me in our whole 4 years of friendship. So I just stopped sending them. 
This is maybe a month and a half later(tonight) and he just popped into my mind. So I checked his Facebook just to see how he was doing. And what I see is that him and Alisa got married about a week after we stopped talking. I don’t know why it really bothered me, but it did. Why not say anything to me so I could congratulate you? Why just cut me off and ignore me after I said we could stay friends and I didn’t act any differently? But mostly, I’m upset FOR Alisa. She has no idea everything he had said to me behind her back, and then he marries her? Just like a week later? Goes back to my previous relationship, he knows how I feel about cheating, and dishonesty and things like that, so that’s why it really rubbed me the wrong way. I just can’t be friends with someone who knows how much it truly affected me when my ex did it, and then to turn around and do it to his at the time fiancé(??) It’s just so weird to me though to not say anything, right?? So I ended up unfriending him on Facebook and Snapchat both. Just need to know now, AITA?

Last week, we had a meeting all together. P &amp; I often like to combine our grade levels as they are all similar in age &amp; it is easier to do. We’ve done at most three activities together in the weeks since school has started. At this meeting, P &amp; I were called out for combining &amp; working together &amp; that we need to split up &amp; be individual classes.

What we are confused about now is the fact that our other two coworkers are ALWAYS doing their activities together. They don’t even have separate plans &amp; go off of each other constantly. 

I feel this is really odd behavior &amp; she is really treating both P &amp; I weirdly. We are lost on how to bring up the fact that we have barely combined grades &amp; why it is different for our other coworkers in the sense that they can do everything together with no issues?

286,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise.

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

Don’t get me wrong I’m super happy for him and glad to get rides from him cause it’s a sick car but it also makes me want a muscle car of my own. Here’s where I need some help. I’ve always loved the look of challengers but I think it would be weird and I don’t think my buddy would appreciate it if I got the exact same car as him. My next option would be a camaro and they’re nice cars too but I don’t quite feel the same about them as I do challengers. I don’t want to get a mustang either cause quite frankly I don’t like them too much. But my concern is that I’m feeling a little envious of my buddy cause of what a sweet car he has and I’m trying to “get equal” with him by getting a muscle car too but at the same time I feel like I actually do want a muscle car (who doesn’t) but I don’t want to buy a camaro if I don’t genuinely like it as much as a challenger but again don’t want to get a challenger too cause I feel like he wouldn’t appreciate that. Sorry for this confusing post I’m really tired but I’d love advice. I just need anything or anyone to tell me something that will get me to think straight.,04Sep2019,1
301,"So my best friend is dating this guy that I’ve known for like 3 years. They really started talking about a year and a half ago but by then we were already close friends. Recently they started dating and like usual, he’s got a lot of toxic personality traits. He has no empathy, he can’t ever acknowledge that he did something wrong, he’s always insulting people, and sometimes is just not fun to be around. The three of us hang out a lot so we get into fights sometimes about the same things. He can’t ever takes these fights seriously. It always ends with him saying he will change and he never does. My best friend says she’s sick of always being in the middle of us fighting but she doesn’t do anything to try and help us except tell him the same things he’s been hearing forever. I’m really sick of it. He treats her badly and he treats everyone else even worse. Maybe it’s because he had a bad childhood, or because he doesn’t realize what he’s doing wrong, or maybe he just doesn’t care. I don’t want to loose either of them as they are my best friends but he doesn’t seem like he’s going to change and she isn’t really trying to help him. I think that if she ignored him until he proved her would change things might help, but I don’t think she would do that. She couldn’t do it before. I don’t want to loose either of them but I can’t go on like this. What should I do?",04Sep2019,1

303,"So just now, I got a call very late at night from 2 of my friends. They called me panicking saying that their third roommate (who is the friend in question), is not letting go of a bag of coke he has and insists he has to finish it. He keeps trying to go to the bathroom where he thinks they’ll leave him alone so he can finish it. I drove over as fast as I could to talk to him. In private, we spoke and I tried to talk to him to ask him what’s wrong (he never acts like this). He denied he had any cocaine on him, and when I asked him what’s wrong he kept saying he’s just really mad that I came over and that he doesn’t want me to see him like this. 

Eventually he opened up a bit. He said he’s incredibly anxious and every time he’s in public he constantly is worried about how he’s walking and what people are thinking about him. He hasn’t gone to class since they started (2 weeks ago), and all he wants to do is never leave his room and just order in food and that’s it. He doesn’t want to see anyone or talk to anyone, not even his friends or family. He also said how he’s not close to his mother. He told her how he was feeling depressed and she drove up unexpectedly and gave him a book to read on anxiety and scheduled an appointment for him to see a counselor. Additionally, he wants to just go home and not come back. He wants to take over his family business that he works for during summers (with his dad) and every time he leaves that job to go back to school he’s just unhappy. 

He’s been using cocaine a lot these past 2 weeks going out every night though. I think his cocaine use is a huge (if not main) reason he’s like this. I practically had to force him to give it to me so I could flush it in the toilet - after 20 minutes of me arguing with him. 

He has an appointment tomorrow with a counselor which I am making sure he’s going to - but he said he did not want to go. 

I believe that he has all these emotions and things bottled up inside him and does not know how to express them or just doesn’t want to. Then, when they all bottle up, and mix in some drugs, you have what happened tonight. But I’m not entirely sure. I just really want to know and learn more on how I could help my friend. What are the next steps I should take as his friend going forward? Thank you guys so much.",04Sep2019,2

305,"So basically a couple months ago i decided to make a snapchat with super explicit content (18+) , i never promoted it  &amp; i decided not to add anyone or add anyone back and leave it as a kind of ""enter if you dare"" (free will) type of account. So i start posting videos and dick pics for about a week or so and started noticing who was adding me and viewing my story. At first it was a couple of girls who i went to high school with and a couple of strippers i knew from working with prior and at first i was nervous but tbh i got a bunch of compliments so that only boosted my ego to do more content so i continued to do so. It started getting weird when people who i didnt expect started &amp; continued viewing it such as my friends cousin who is an old classmate &amp; in a relationship with another friend of mine, another friends cousin who was also a classmate with whos also in a relationship, two of my sisters friends, old coworkers, an old crush of mine thats now married with a kid, about 10 old classmates , a distant cousin who has a bf , and even my sister in law (step brothers wife). Needless to say it spooked me but i had figured that they wouldn't continue to view after they seen basically everything the first time, i also figured i would just have to embrace it when it was brought up next time we seen each other. So i continued to post and they continued to view which now makes me wonder why that is because  majority of them are in relationships with people i know and are even family .the situation never gets mentioned which is alright by me but i just cant find a reason why they would continue to view my content knowing what it is . it becomes problematic to me because i feel like im homewrecking if i tell their significant others and they didnt (out of respect for my  privacy) but it also feels like im homewrecking if i respect their privacy and not tell their significant others. 

Can anyone answer why they would continue to view my content? 
And how should i approach and solve these situations???",04Sep2019,0
306,"Hi everyone. Title says it all, but I'll try and explain my situation the best I can.

I just started my second year in a programming course. However, I'm starting to think that this isnt really what I want to do in life. The problem is, I have NO IDEA what I want. Everything is just a blur right now.

I talked to my mom about the possibility of me dropping out, and she had very obvious mixed emotions... she wants me to be happy, however if I drop out of school, I would no longer get child support from my dad, which would mean my mom cant afford the house shelves in... or something? 

I go to school in a cott far from home. All my friends and family are back home, and I get very lonely sometimes. The only positives in my life right now are my part time job and my girlfriend. 

I expressed the idea of working full time and taking a year off of school to find my passion, but that goes back to the previously mentioned point, my mom would have to move... and I dont want that. She also stated that if that were to happen, she would feel like she would be abandoning me. I'd have to pay all my student loans and all that... time and money all wasted.

I've cried so much the past few days because of these issues. I want to he HAPPY, and it just *sucks* that life revolves around having a job and making lots of money and all that... it just sucks. I want to be happy. I am seriously starting to think that my mental health is taking a decline, and I dont know how to stop it.

I guess the point of this post is to ask... if anyone of you were in a similar situation... what did you do? I need help.",04Sep2019,1

308,"Hello! So, I'll be going to university abroad for the first time! Because of this, I have so many concerns, worries and a heap of anxiety.
My sister and I (we're twins) are the ones who normally take care of my mom. From helping her cook, to giving her medications and putting her to bed. My brother on the other hand has no job and plays on his PS4 almost everyday. Despite being older than me, he still has the nerve to throw tantrums and doesn't even help my mom when she needs it.
I'm scared of leaving my mom alone. Not only does my brother have any sense of responsibility, he doesn't even show her the least bit of respect.
She's old, and she's still working despite having arthritis, cholesterol and various leg problems. She's working to support my sister and I for college.
This is the only reason I'm so hesitant to leave. I wanted to talk about it with my brother, but he tends to make promises that he doesn't keep.
I wanted to know what I should do. I want to be able to support my mom and help her out, and it breaks my heart to see her working at such an old age. She's going to turn 60 soon, and I want to help her and let her know I appreciate her a lot. So, what would your advice be?",04Sep2019,1

310,"I'm 26 (m) and lately have bene having some real issues with things that have happened in my family in the past. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently found out that my father (who passed away last year) raped my sister when she was very young. I'm not sure of the details of the abuse or how long it continued for but I know that it definitely happened. It has also come to light that there was an incident when I was around 12 years old where my sister and father got drunk together and he sexually assaulted her when she was passed out. My nephew (sisters son) witnessed this (he was about 10 years old) and is now in a mental health institution because of drug abuse and a severe mental illness. (I'm not sure if this is related to what he saw or not as he has never spoken to me about it directly) 

I loved my dad, and I still do. His passing really hurt me, he was a good man from what I saw growing up and was always there for me. How could this be true? I just don't understand how the man we loved and looked at as a father could have done this to my sister? (Just for scale of reference the rape of my sister owuld have taken place long before I was born, there is a big age gap between me and me siblings) 

What would you do? I have spoken to my sister who basically confirmed that all of this happened but she refuses to elaborate on what happened to her when she was younger. She has her own mental health issues anyway and I really don't want to pressure her into talking about it incase it pushes her over the edge. 

I know deep down that it is true though, I have very vague memories of my nephew and neices walking to our house when it was dark and knocking our door and my nephew breaking down and telling my mum what he had saw that night. No body ever called the police, which in hindsight they should have. My sister has told me that my mother is also to blame as she knew about the abuse but did nothing to stop it. 

This whole thing has just ripped my world apart and everything I once knew. 

I don't live with my mum anymore as I moved out around 3 years ago and moved quite far away to be with my partner, we have 2 beuatiful children together and overall, I am pretty happy with my life. But I sometimes I just can't seem to escape the fact of how fucked up my family are and what happened. So many questions and nobody to ask. The worst part is that my sister will never have closure on what happened. Even worse than this is that my sister blames my mother entirely for what happened and wont say one bad word about our father who actually commited the offences against her. She has told me that her and my dad spoke about it when he was still alive and they cleared alot of it up. But I have a feeling that he told her that he did it because his and my mothers marriage was sexless at the time. The whole situation is just twisted, sorry for the rant but I needed to vent this somewhere and maybe even some advice and what to do.

312,"So my friend has been on and off with her bf/ex/ friend (it’s complicated rn) for 9 months he was a senior, and she was a freshman. The beginning was very good, she was happy, he was happy, and everything was fine. A little into it he told her that he loved her 1 month in. 

He was caught up cheating with another girl, he denied it, when the girl had proof of it, they stopped talking for some time, but they still got back together. Which is one of the reasons that started their on and off relation.

He was also caught up 2 other times but they were rumors, but I believe one because the girl he cheated with is someone my cousin knew and my cousin knew my friend and her bf were together and the girl he cheated with told my cousin and a couple other people what her and my friends bf did which was sexual, while explaining the story she said his name and his last name, which my cousin knew who already because he and the girl had been friends, and the day that she claimed to have done things they were hanging that same day, but he claims they only hung out. which stopped them, and then they got back together. (He recently told her that they had kissed before they dated but he didn’t think it mattered when she asked him if they have EVER done anything) the other time was a guy who liked my friend spreading a lie that he tried to get with someone’s girl so  that’s how he got a black eye but everyone knew it wasn’t true, they split up again, but got back together

My friend would tell him she doesn’t wanna be with him and he would try to twist what she said and manipulate her into thinking she’s wrong, and doesn’t let her go through with it. This happens often but they always go back. He tells her if she leaves he won’t want to live anymore, and he needs her for him to be happy, he has narcissist traits in my opinion.

She’s confused on what to do, should she stay or leave him? And is their relationship toxic?",04Sep2019,1

Went and became a plumbing apprentice for a company in town and worked for them for 4 months and then went and applied for the Local Plumbing Union.

320,"Hello everyone. I am currently debating on how to deal with a toxic family member. I currently have a year left of commuting to college from my parents' place. I have a sister living with us that is very troublesome. To keep it short and concise, she has a history of choosing trash boyfriends. The family will not approve of them and does not want them around. She has ended up self destructive in the past (drugs, self harm, etc.). She was doing well the past few months due to said boyfriend being locked up. She has gotten a job and has generally avoided any trouble. It seems as though the guy has gotten out of prison. She now seems to be posting about it on social media. I am becoming very anxious about how the next few days are going to be. This guy has even had a history of physical abuse to her. Despite this, she thinks she is living out some love story. My parents have kicked her out in the past due to past boyfriends. How should I approach this?",04Sep2019,1
321,"today was the day in which i really started to express my anger for this topic. i told my mom that i would be ending my class at 2 o’clock. once 2oclock comes around she calls me and says that she’ll be there in an hour. now i get that she does have work and her hours varies per day, but when she has the opportunity to pick me up at the right time, she doesn’t take it, one example was 3 days ago where she was late, not for work purposes ( she was off on that day) but the fact that she went to a salon and colored her hair 20 minutes prior to my class ending. i mean didn’t it occur to her that it’ll take longer than 20mins to color hair ( she’s bleached her hair at least 7 times in her life )? my dad on the other hand can’t be bothered to give up 5 minutes in his time. i would periodically ask my dad if he can pick me up in places that are 5 mins away from my house such as my college . he uses the excuse of working on our house in which he is too busy to pick me up. then the last available driver is my uncle, who often doesn’t really care how late he picks me up. even though i tell him a specific time to pick me up, i would find that he is in the opposite side of the island from me, doing absolutely nothing but to just cruise around and says he’ll be there in 30 mins.

now you guys might be thinking why i couldn’t drive on my own. well i am still a high school student but i also take classes in college.  i’m currently taking drivers ed in hopes i can end this long wait. if all goes well, i wouldn’t have this problem by the end of December. this situation has been happening ever since elementary where i would literally be picked up at 6 o’clock. my uncle was mainly the person who would pick me up and his excuse was he was too busy playing dota 2.

322,"I don't even know if this relationship would work. We're both seventeen, I'm a senior in high school. He graduated a year early, and he is going to Europe in a week for three months (gap year trip). Obviously we don't have any classes together, but we text/Snapchat all the time and we meet up at a book club that's usually once a week.

Anyway, with him leaving for three months, and then soon after that going off to different colleges, should I even bother talking to him? I like him, but I've never been in a relationship. I've definitely had stronger crushes, but he also actually seems into me (maybe, not sure), and we both just like talking to each other. Maybe we'd be better staying friends? Maybe it's just stupid hormones that I should ignore? I have pretty bad anxiety, and he has really bad depression, so I don't even know if a relationship would go well. And especially since we'll be gone from each other in less than a year, it just doesn't seem worth it.

330,"VIP - as you will read in this post, I am against the breeding and buying of animals (adopt don't shop). However, this is not what my question is about, so please don't try to argue about that here.

So I have a friend, Jane. Jane has a boyfriend John. They love cats. Like absolutely adore. However, Jane is incredibly materialistic, and unfortunately views them as an accessory as well. When they got a cat in January, they bought a $1500 breed cat because they're bred to be social. Their plan is to breed her because ""it's good money"". They are not breeders, and have no knowledge of breeding animals, so this is highly irresponsible. They've made it clear they don't care about the cats, they just want the money for a nice vacation. 

This cat they bought, specifically to be social, does not like people. My best guess is because they never properly socialized it because they're almost never home. This cat spends probably 12-14 hours alone everyday. They see no problem with this, because she has an automatic feeder. And because she's not snuggly, they don't interact with her very much. They rarely play with her and don't pet her often. Basically they bought this ""picture perfect cat"" to be snuggly and breed, but now they're neglecting her because she's not cuddly (which is because of them!).

A few other things they do: 

\- they live in a 3rd story apartment, and leave the balcony door and windows open (no screens) when they leave for work.   
\- they went on vacation for two weeks and had someone pop in once a day to feed her  
\- they went on a 4-day trip and left her with the auto-feeder  


So Jane messaged me yesterday saying they've put in an application to adopt another cat from a shelter because ""it will have probably been neglected and more grateful of love"". I am infuriated. I love cats, and I know this cat will be just as neglected. I've tried gently talking to her about, but she just doesn't get it. I'm positive she'll get the cat, won't properly introduce them (new cats have to be separated for 2+ weeks until they adjust, then you very slowly let them meet over another few weeks. I'm 100% positive she'll just put them in the same room and expect them to be best friends), and eventually neglect this cat too if it doesn't fit her criteria. 

I don't know what to do. I value our friendship, and she's not directly abusive, but I definitely don't think she's capable of taking care of one cat, let alone two. I thought about emailing the shelter and telling them not to adopt to her, but if she found out it would ruin our friendship. Thoughts?",04Sep2019,2
331,"I am writing this because I feel as though I have nowhere else to turn. My current support system in my view is good but burned out and not objective. My close friends and family are at this point too worried to offer any actual advice for my situation and mental well being. I have been thinking about a possible trip to get away and also gain some perspective. These family members are all good caring people that want to help and I don't see them enough. I have a great deal of respect for all of these guys but they are still somewhat distant. What I really need/want is someone who cares about me, will listen to what I say (mostly objectively), and who will offer me their opinion and/or relatable experiences. I have known all of these people for most of my life and I am very comfortable talking and staying with all of them. 

The choices are,

1. Uncle (late 50s) who is a pediatrician and his wife who is also a doctor. My reason for somewhat gravitating towards him and his wife is almost purely because of them being doctors and because they are immensely intelligent. Seriously two of the smartest people I have ever met. I have a good rapport with both of them and they may have the best logical advice given their professions and straight up intelligence.
2. Uncle (early 50s) who is a professor in environmental studies and his wife who is a professor in American history. The reasoning for him/them is because they are also extremely smart but I connect with them better. I am referred to a lot by my family as this uncle and we have much in common, maybe not in our lifestyles but especially in our mannerisms and the way we think. I definitely agree with this.
3. My step uncle (late 30s) who is younger and an accountant. He is/was depressed and has attempted before. He is the most removed from me personally but he is the only person in my family with actual experiences like mine. I know that he cares about my situation and he would certainly be the most relatable option as well as being closer to my age in general. In my mind he is more of a wildcard and I do not necessarily know what to expect if I were to ask for advice or his experiences.

332,So I am a uni student and I am very scared of getting in debt and all that jazz. I recently moved to a new place with one of my friends. Here is the situation the tenancy started on the 20th august and i moved in on the 27th and my friend is arriving a month later than I am. So i have been sorting out all the utility stuff and i just want advice on how I can split the bills with him equally and fairly when he gets back. I live in england just in case that was needed. I also want to do it in a safe way just in case things go south and he stops paying for bills for whatever reason. Any advice on this would be appreciated this was probably worded badly so sorry.,04Sep2019,1
333,"I broke up with my ex three months ago, and since then he's publicly harassed me twice. We are NC. I blocked him from my Reddit account (he was the only person who knew my username) as soon as the relationship ended. 

However, on the weekend, he spoke to one of my friends and brought up personal posts that I had made after being sexually assaulted. He sent her a screenshot of the posts that included my username. My friend has now read very personal posts about my relationships, sex life, mental health and experience with sexual assault. I feel extremely violated, and I know that the only way he could have accessed my account is by making a fake account to stalk my posts. 

Is there any way I can block him based on IP address/device? This account means a lot to me, although I know that I'll probably have to delete it regardless now that it's been exposed to my group of friends. I just want to know if there's at least any way I can prevent this from happening in the future and so I can protect my privacy.",04Sep2019,3
334,"So a month ago my mother decided that we would go to Rarotonga for my sister’s birthday in February. The cost of flights and accommodation alone add up to nearly $6000NZD for 4 of us. I know this may not sound like a whole lot but I barely make over minimum wage and I would be covering for my sister who is unable to work consistent hours due to a head injury. 

My oldest sister (who lives in another city) said she would pay for herself, however she doesn’t permanent full time hours to pay her part of the deposit nor does she even have a passport.

We have only to December to pay off the full deposit and I’m concerned that we’ll just be throwing money away to a holiday that we won’t even be able to save enough for or to go on...
We also won’t be able to get a refund if it all falls through as I suspect it will.

In all honesty, I don’t want to go on holiday to a tiny island with my family. There have been other quarrels which I won’t go into detail just in case one of them happens to have a reddit account but there has been a lot manipulation and emotional blackmail and I just need to get out for the sake of my mental health.

336,"Long post 
I'm a teenage girl. I was changing in the room me and my sisters have to stay in for now  My older sister  (18) who we we will call Kitty for now had the door open talking to my baby sister, like wide open, This dude (someone living in the house) accidentally walked in on me because of this. Fortunately i was wearing a sports bra so i wasnt like exposed but I was pretty pissed. I basically gave out to her for leaving the door open and not even apologising. She says its my fault, that I shouldve known the door was open and that she was busy talking to our sister. 

In my mind she couldve easily done two things (she KNOWS I was changing) 1. Bring the toddler inside and close the door OR 2. Leave the room and close the door. So I called her a ""fucking bitch"" thoroughly annoyed at this point cuz wtf??? And she proceeds to jump at me, punching and scratching and pulling my hair, obviously I fight back but shes pretty strong ngl. Im a pretty skinny person without much body strength amd she's not fat but alot bigger (not taller) than I am. So she just continues the attack until my other sister comes in and makes her stop. 

Her justification for all this is that is that I cursed at her which means I deserved the attack?? (FYI I dont curse at her often at all, I barely even curse in front of her cuz she doenst like it) Btw i have like 2 or 3 obvious wounds on my face from the fight. I think she might have ripped out som of my hair because my scalp is also extremely sore.

 Now i have school and i dont want to go in because i dont want people asking me why i have cuts on my face or why my eyes are so red. My sister also went on this rant about how i act like im the only one who has problems or how Im selfish?? I dont talk to her about my problems...? If she was talking about my depression or anxiety which im getting help for (admittedly it isnt working very well) Ive only ever gotten shit for having it and its not like i ever talk to her about it anyway. 

Im already dealing with ny shit so this ruined my day tbh.

I thought we were having a good run for our relationship but now shes just kinda fucked it up (or maybe i have idk)

338,"Hi, I am currently struggling with a big decision. I am currently 3 and a half terms into year 12 and have a conditional offer to study at my first choice university. I need an ATAR of 90 to be accepted, however am starting to doubt I will get that. About half way through the year I started avoiding doing all my schoolwork out of fear that I wouldn’t get the grades required to achieve the ATAR I need. This started off with just three subjects, but now is affecting all 5. I am 15 assignments behind, and still haven’t done my external components for my classes which are worth 30% of my grade. There are only 4 weeks left of this term, and after that I’m supposed to have finished everything and have started exam revision. I’m afraid it’s gotten to a point where if I try to rush everything, I won’t get the grades I want and will not meet the conditions of my university offer. Trying to do all that work in such a small amount of time will also be extremely stressful. 
So, I’m thinking about dropping the first 3 subjects that I struggled with and doing them next year, and completing the other two this year. I feel like this would give me the time I need this year to catch up on those two subjects, and give me a chance to redeem my grades for the other three next year. However, I’m also afraid that I will want to give up again next year if I am only doing the three subjects I’m not that interested in. Also, repeating year 12 is apparently extremely mentally strenuous and even the brightest of students often give up because of the social pressures (embarrassment of repeating a year, not knowing anyone, everyone in your year already at uni, judgement by peers for “failing”).
I have always been a straight A student and am really embarrassed at my performance this year and that I let it get to this point. I’ve asked my friends for their opinions and got mixed results, and now would like to hear from a more unbiased perspective.",04Sep2019,2
339,"so here it goes, when I switched my job 2 and half year ago on my first day I saw her and thought this is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. At first its starting out as a crush, but when i look at her social profile i saw she was recently married. In our culture there's thing called ""arranged marriage"" in which both party's parents and couples meet, they set up meeting few times, got to know better and then decide. I'm kind of person who never make a move on committed or married person not even a flirt. I always thought if i'm gonna marry someone she should be just like her.

but after few months we both placed in same project, so we communicate on regular basis work related or some other general stuff, talking to her made me realize how amazing she was you know the way she talks calmly, mannered, she cooks amazing, she does house chores. She's unique beauty. everything I've been looking for is right in front of my eyes and she's taken. I felt such a regret that I didn't meet her first and over the times I've fallen for her. Although for many months I ignored my feelings for her, after a while whenever she passes by I'm always looking at her but she caught me few times staring at her. and I know she knows about my feelings. she's responded many times. After then whenever we communicate there's this intense eye contacting between us but none of us make a move. I've never been in this type of situation i don't know what to do wherever i go 24/7 I'm seeing her face or remind me of her. I have never felt for any person in this way.

Each one is in a different path and both said I'll probably get a permanent job offer if I prove myself worthy during the internship. So I need to pick wisely because it'll probably be the path of my future 

Software development engineer(Amazon) :
+ I've always liked programming more than anything
+ it's a paid internship
+ it's closer to my house
+ more chances to travel
- I'm afraid promotions in programming reaches a certain level and stops and you're stuck there
-A programmer at Amazon itself told me during the interview that programmers are like really low  in the hierarchy of any company 

Telecommunications engineer (Huawei) :
+ I know multiple people at the company so it's going to be a friendly environment
+ their office has only opened recently in my country so there's not THAT much work
+I got the internship because I went on a Huawei campus with their PR and she's done a lot to get the internship for me so I'm afraid of ruining my relationship with her if I say no now
-it's not paid
- I'm not sure I'll like the field of telecommunications engineering

341,"21 (F) here, i know this may sound like self-pity which is something i do a lot. but this is different, why do people constantly feel the need to treat me like shit once they get what they want from me? what do i do to deserve this kind of treatment? i feel unwanted and undesirable. growing up i was always “the fat girl”. no guy in my 11 years of education liked me until i got my first boyfriend senior year. once i had my first sexual encounter i let that person take advantage of that because I really thought that was going to be my first and only time getting that sort of affection. I had my family always tell me that I would prettier if I lost weight. i have honestly been put on diets for as long as i could remember. that alone took an emotional toll on me. looking in the mirror and seeing pictures of myself always disgusted me. i never felt comfortable with the way i looked. my double chin, my rolls, my big arms. i hate it all. i was so young thinking about how skinny i wanted to be and how i could only look cute in clothes if I was 50 pounds lighter. remember how i was talking about my sexual encounters? well that added up quickly. i’m not desirable to others and i shouldn’t let that affect me but it does. not being talked to at bars and being ignored for my prettier much thinner friends fucking hurts. never being asked to go on a date either without the expectation of us having sex at the end of it is something i have never experienced. i know i shouldn’t rely on tinder either since it’s always just horny guys wanting to fuck. they’re always nice to me at first, and make me think that what they want from me is much more than sex. i end up having sex with them and then getting dropped immediately. it’s sad to say that this has happened on many occasions, with many people. most of which are the same guys who always ignore me until they want to bust a nut. at first having sex with these men made me feel empowered. it wasn’t until i realized that yeah they got what they wanted and i got what i thought i had wanted that i don’t deserve this kind of treatment. i am constantly being used and letting myself being used. i don’t know why i let it. i like to think it’s because i seek validation from others but i don’t know. i also want to blame nativity but that’s not it either because i know what they want from me. I don’t know what this feeling is. i hate it so much. i hate that i feel envious of my friends who constantly get asked out on dates and have guys drool over them. i don’t want to feel envious towards them. i want to feel happy for them but i cannot push myself to do so. what is wrong with me? i don’t remember ever feeling this way.",04Sep2019,1

345,"Hey there.  I feel stupid for asking for advice here, but my current situation is driving me crazy.
So, about a year ago I broke up with my ex gf and I moved back to my parent’s house. It was meant to be for a short period of time, but depression over the breakup (she cheated on me and got pregnant from another guy although we were planning our family) kind of made me “lazy”/ unmotivated to do anything.
I own a company and it used to run well, when I was taking care of it, but when I needed my colleagues to take over because I could not handle everything, they just stepped back, so this resulted in financial struggle.
As I did not want to be the one getting jobs and putting in all of the work while my colleagues just “feast” on the money (we get 1/3 each), I’ve decided to look for a part-time job.
Which I found. Problem here is, that the job requires me to drive 140km each day, but I am more than happy to do so if this means I get some sort of stability back into my life.
Now, I don’t own a car (could never afford one) so I heavily rely on my dad’s car (which is basically never used).
Two weeks ago, my brother came here for practical experience at a prison (he’s studying psychology) and now he also needs the car.
I understand that totally, but I also really need the car to go to my job, since public transportation would take me 2,5h while my brother would only need to take a bus for 30 minutes.
I offered to drive him to the prison each day, which he declined because “he has to wait” after he is finished and he wants to get home fast.
Today, this caused a discussion, because he just took the car (I had put stuff to bring to my workplace in the car) without asking if I need the car.
I have to clarify: I fully understand it’s not “my” car, but is it too much asked from my family to have access to the car for at least the first month so I can organize my own car (leasing or what ever)?
Why is it ok for my brother to take the car but not for me? 
I really feel dumb because everybody here is making me believe that I am the one that’s messing up big times. To me, I am in a difficult situation and - I hate to say so - but I need the support of my family, which I am not getting.
This leads me to risking my new job and would push me back into a worse situation.

It really makes me sad because from what I hear from friends, their families always support them and a situation like this never occurred to them.
I don’t know how to tell my parents that I need them to help me just a little more until I have some money and stability, because apparently, they just don’t want to see that I am struggling really hard and this job means a lot to me.",04Sep2019,1
346,"Hello reddit, I really hope this fits here and if it doesn't please let me know.

I want to study sociology this year and am troubled to decide between two cities I could study it in.

One ""city"" is Jena (Germany), small, very expensive living costs, pretty looking but 2 1/2 hours away from home and my partner/SO. Three of my friends are studying there as well.

One city is Halle, big, less expensive living costs, kind of pretty, much closer to my home and partner/SO (could theoretically pendel for 45min from hometown to Halle). One friend is studying there, too.

Both are good universities, have a nice campus and each is liked by friends.

I made the mistake of only now thinking about a different option (since studying sociology was already plan b) I've asked friends for help and I'm tending towards Halle, even though this wasn't an option until yesterday.


How can I choose/pick the right decision? 
What else can play into deciding on where to go to?

348,"I have recently been through hell.

The man I loved and lived with has anger issues that we have been dealing with since we have been together. He usually loses his temper and slams doors or shouts. That is something I dealt with because I understand he is not perfect as no one is and he has been going to therapy to heal himself from his problems.

When he behaves like this I leave to allow him to cool down so we can talk at a better time. However, a few weeks ago he locked me in the house, took my phone away when I said I was calling the police, and attacked me. I reacted by punching him in the face and breaking his nose. Then I ran to the neighbour's house where she comforted me.

While I was at the neighbour's house, he called the police and told them I attacked him for no reason. They arrived and arrested me for domestic violence - even though I am a woman, he admitted to locking me in the house and I told them I punched him in self-defence.

I was held in the police station in solitary confinement for 48 hours. While I was there I suffered from racism and abuse. I asked to see a doctor 5 times because I felt something was really wrong with me. A few minutes after the multiple rejections I got, I had a seizure for which they had to call an ambulance. I have never had a seizure before but I know something was wrong because I could not feel my hands or feet and I could not breathe properly.

When the police let me go, they put a restraining order on me for two weeks so I could not return to my home.

My boyfriend has since written a statement to the police telling them what really happened. The police have not even contacted me to let me know that they have received a change in his statement.

My boyfriend has also apologised to me, told our friends the truth (he lied to everyone to try and protect himself initially), offered to cover my expenses (I had to stay in a hotel for 2 weeks). I can accept the apology and I can forgive him. However, I feel so incredibly hurt and sad.

The person who I relied on and trusted most completely turned against me and attacked me. I could have gone to prison for 3 years, lost my job, been thrown out of the country (I am an expat). The behaviour of the police was unbelievably racist. My boyfriend in white and I am mixed race. I have heard about and experienced this racism before but never to this extent. I feel so shaken to understand that the people (the police) who should be the last line to protect me would attack me in the way they did.

I feel so depressed and I just want to know how to deal with and recover from the hurt and trauma I now feel. When I see the police in the street I feel afraid and when my boyfriend tries to comfort me I feel total mistrust.

I don't know why I feel this way. I feel jealous about one friend. It is usually when someone talks to her. It started when a friend of hers was a jerk to me.

 I think I feel threatened since this person is my first real friend. I'm not try to make excuse but I might. I just feel selfish more than normal because of this feeling. 

I have so many trust issues. I don't want to claim her as a friend. I don't want her to be forced to deal with my F'ed up head. I don't want her to be bogged down by my bad days. 

She supports me with my depression. In fact she was the only person to treat me well during a rough time. We were strangers. 

She has called me her best friend, but I'm scared to call her this back. I hate that I'm so confusing. 

I let my mind get in the way of everything.

I feel insecure that one day I'm gonna be that kid liked by everyone but loved by none. I'm lonely as hell, sure, but I know true loneliness and fuck that. 

That feeling is one that sticks with you. It's something that you cannot tell is there. You just get used to the feeling. 

It was a feeling of no one cared for me. If I died, then everyone would forget me in a week. It wasn't true since I had family, but they aren't family. 

I don't show that I'm jealous to anyone. I try to control this feeling. It feels so toxic inside because I'm not having an outlet.

I'm up to telling her if need be. I don't want to feel like I'm faking in front of her, more than usual.

Again, how can I control or snuff out my jealousy?

354,"I’ve been struggling with the binge eat, gain weight, then starve and lose it all cycle for years and years. I starve and become too thin and people worry, and then suddenly I spend one night binging and it’s all I do for the next 3 weeks, or months. I don’t understand how no one has noticed this cycle of me being thin and then a little chubby over and over. My eating habits have been severely disordered since I was 14, I am almost 21 now. Looking back and seeing myself now I don’t know how no one has known.  When I was 13 I was put into a residential treatment center for a year which is where my disorder really developed. I don’t think the staff there were fully equipped to know how to deal with this and it just got worse when I left. I heavily abused laxatives from 15-16, was always a little underweight as a teen and the past 2 years have just been an endless cycle of binge then starve. I feel so lost in this, I’ll binge and binge until my stomach literally looks 6 months pregnant and I cannot move. I don’t know how to reach out and let people know this is bigger than it may appear. I’m suffering so much and I know my body is too, constantly going from one extreme to the other. I also deal with Irritable bowel syndrome so when I force my body to take in mass amounts of foods it doesn’t like I become very sick, but that doesn’t stop me. 

I’ve also had two serious boyfriends who also dealt with eating disorders(bulimia) and I can’t imagine that has helped me.  I never feel happy with my body either way.

I have been looking the laws whether this is legal though, Estonian or EU and so far little results. I don't know whether this is a progress or just exploitation or anything...I don't know. 

Meanwhile, my Estonian colleague's salary was raised, so there goes my morale and motivation to do better. I dont know whether to take this as a step ahead or just a shit step as the progress seems less than ideal. Doesn't even feel like a huge improvement. I need to bring around 10-15 clients to make a decent 300 Euros per month...so I feel that I am going round in circles.

358,"Hello Reddit,

I wasn't sure where this would be best placed, but I'm having some issues (mostly sleeping) because of the growing nuisance that is a moldy/mildewy smell in my home. Primarily my bedroom. The smell is coming from one particular corner near an outside wall. I live in an apartment complex, and the smell is also in my roommates room too. It has been so bad that I cannot ignore it, and I believe its causing me to have issues with my nose being plugged, my throat itching, etc. I think it's this because when I'm at work, I'm fine. But after I have been home for several house I start sneezing and feeling hoarse. 

I had my apartment manager come investigate, but he assured me I just had a ""sensitive nose"" and that everything smelled and seemed ""completely normal"" to him. I've never had a particularly ""sensitive nose"" before, and I've certainly never felt like I was smelling something foul when it wasn't there before. Especially so persistently.

It's getting worse over time. I didn't smell much but slight old carpet odor when we first moved in a few months back. 

Is this all rational? Are these symptoms that arise with these types of issues? I feel like I'm going crazy, but other people who have visited my house have also noticed the smell recently and that validated me. But my apartment manager (not the rental agency, just the property manager) has just written it off essentially. 

Please give me some tips or advice. Idk how much longer I can stay in this place with this going on. 

Thank you",04Sep2019,1

I used to crack my neck all the time and I managed to stop luckily, but I just cant do the same for my back. The problem is that Ive cracked it so much, that I think its just messed up forever or something. I have full range of motion, and I have decent posture so thats good I guess. Im not a doctor but I have friends who cant crack their backs and I used to not be able too, but now I can, and its happening more frequently.

361,"So to keep a rather long story short, my mom, 52, honestly in the best condition I've ever seen for someone her age (regularly running marathons, exercising, eats really well) ,was just officially diagnosed with cancer today. I dont have the whole story because I know my parents dont want me and my siblings to worry more than we already are, but it's in her tongue. Besides that, she doesnt have much information right now either. No idea how advanced it is or where its really spread. She'll have to go to another island to see a specialist sometime soon. That's pretty much all she gave me. 

My dad, 56, is on the opposite end. Chronic beer drinker, smoker, terrible diet and exercise regime, but he's the kindest, most hard working person I know. He recently had a Transient Ischemic Attack or a mini stroke not too long ago and has been given medication that he refuses to take because it gives him major headaches that actually put him out of work when he was taking them. He works 7 days a week, 8-12 hour days in construction. He's also the most hard headed person I know and no one can convince him to take his medication. He's slowly drinking and smoking less and eating a LITTLE better but it's still a long ways to go. I work for him so he signs my checks (that is relevant for my question later).

Basically, with our mortgage, hospital bills (both previous and future), utilities, my sister's college tuition costs (out of state), and other costs of living, how can I help them? Neither of them want me to help pay for bills or even pay rent no matter how much I insist. I tried to sneak my dads ER hospital bill to pay for that but he found out and told me not to worry about it. I know the amount of stress both of them are under with work being extremely hectic and our financial situation is...less than ideal. Not broke but not comfortable.

I just want to do something to make their lives a little easier. Anything at all. Theyve supported me in everything (between school, the club I started, hobbies, entering competitions, giving me a livable wage doing a job I love, etc etc) that I do and I know they just want me to live my life without worrying about them. All they want is for me and my siblings to live comfortably and for that I cant thank them enough. My dad put me through college pretty much by himself and I know he doesnt want me to help but I just feel incredibly useless because I cant give them anything back. What can I do to ease their worries? I'm payed fairly generously for someone my age and besides my car, I dont have obligations really so I'm pretty comfortable financially so I could definitely pull more weight that way. If there are parents out there, what would you want your child to do in a situation like this? 

I apologize if this post is kind of all over the place. The news blindsided me today and my thoughts are really unorganized. I'd really appreciate any help anyone can give.",04Sep2019,1
362,"y SO is a teacher and every year he works in a different school - and every damned year I'm terrified he may find another woman and leave me. So far it has never happened, but who knows.

But unfortunately today I don't have much to do at my office (it's a pretty calm workday) and I feel like I'm starting to obsess. I am aware that the world is full of nice, clever and successful women and that he's way out of my league (I consider myself a complete loser). Honestly I often wonder if he's with me out of pity or something like that. And I'm sure he'd have much more in common with another teacher than with me (I work for the Government, in the social security field). I know he could ""upgrade"" to a better woman and I'm scared.

367,"Hello,

More friendly advice from the wider community required. I can't work out if I'm depressed or not, would appreciate some advice of those who have been through depression and come out the other side of it.

My Dad died by suicide almost three years ago (December), and ever since, despite how hard I work I can't catch a break and my resilience is starting to break down.

He died whilst I was in my final year of uni, despite this I still went back and finished my degree, although I took the summer for my dissertation. Because of the no parents situ I ended University unemployed, broke, and living on my friends floor. Over the next two years I worked hard, gained financial stability, crashed two higher courses in Bio and Chemistry and recieved a conditional offer to study medicine at University. However, recently found out that I missed my offer by one mark and despite many emails, the University aren't budging on their stance of letting me in anyway.

I just feel like I can't catch a break. The longer this keeps going on the more I feel like I'm drowning. I'm so close to tears all the time because of how deflated and broken I feel. I do everything I'm supposed to do. I have a job I enjoy, a great group of friends, I go to counselling, exercise and eat right, and I try hard at everything I do. Im an over achiever who keeps failing to achieve anything despite being so close to success. And despite everything I've gone through and overcome, im still being told that its not good enough. Which is incredibly frustrating when I know that 17 year olds with two days shadowing a GP and a private education have just walked into medical school and despite years of experience and commitment, i'm told that i'm not good enough. The University even said I couldn't be considered for deferred entry because it would jeopardise the 'fairness of selection of candidates'. Nothing about the selection of candidates is fair to begin with.

Essentially my counsellor keeps suggesting anti-depressants, but to me depression is a chemical unbalancing of the brain. I watched my Dad and my Sister suffer with depression for a long time and I just can't relate to the way they felt.

Is the world just giving me an incredibly hard time and I just have to keep enduring it in the hope things will get better and an opportunity will come my way eventually, or should I look into anti-depressants, or maybe a new councillor? Sick of always being so close to tears, and getting annoyed when people tell me that all of this is just 'character building', and I just need to keep trying.

1. I have enough character, if anything i'm loosing my character because of the constant need to fake my emotions so people don't know just how much I'm struggling with the disappointment of everything
2. the past two years of juggling a demanding job in the NHS with studying at night school and medical school applications, all the while trying my best to be of some support to my siblings, literally broke me in two, all to miss out by one mark. I have no desire to do that again just to prove I am one mark better than I was last year when I applied.",04Sep2019,1

371,"Last week, I bought a signature type cover (250AUD) for my surface pro 6. Two days later on Monday, while studying with a friend (We will call him Harry), Harry decided that it was a good idea to grab a bottle of sweet black tea, without the cap on, and squeeze it as hard as he can. Result is that the tea was squirted all over my type cover, jacket, phone, pencil case, and the surface pro itself, but most of it got on the type cover. Of course, I panicked and placed the type cover upside down while another friend ran to find paper towels while Harry just sat there and laughed and didn't help clean up the mess. I was angry for a while, especially considering i just got the type cover and I love it, but I eventually forgave Harry. Today (two days later), while at school, I detached the type cover to show another friend of mine a youtube video I made, and Harry grabbed my case which contained the type cover and flinged it towards himself, if that makes sense. Result was that the type cover hit the ground hard on the corner but no physical damage was visible. Of course, at this point I couldn't hold it in any longer and we had a falling out with me recounting previous events where he would carelessly pull on my expensive headset when I didn't hear him, etc. Now he has a birthday party planned in 2 weeks and previously I was invited, but I don't know if I should go anymore since I still can't get over his childish behaviours.

375,"There's a guy that I grew close to on a trip in January 2019.
We cuddled the whole time and also talked about life, neither of us had felt so comfortable with someone in life (emotionally and physically). We even kissed once and it was an amazing feeling. 

I could tell there's a strong connection between us..even our heartbeats synced (I think).
People were envious of us.
Everything was well till another month after the trip.

He had broken up with his girlfriend in October 2018 and felt that he was using me for emotional support.
We barely spoke to each other. Losing a friend like him was awful. I tried talking to him but he was so so so ruuuude and selfish all along.

I even spoke to him about our ""status"". He thought we were good friends and didn't want to take it any further in the future.
I was convinced that he was no longer interested. I avoided messaging him so that I could be in a better mental state. We didn't speak for weeks.

We have started talking again, he still doesn't seem interested but I have a feeling he likes me back because I know his reddit username and he's mentioned that he really likes a girl but is afraid to tell her or take anything further because he's not sure about himself. I know that the girl he likes is me. 

He's started being all sweet with me again when we meet but doesn't text a lot and also ignores me maybe ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

I feel I should talk to him about this one last time and try to save whatever that's left.

I have spoken to 2 of my friends about this and they feel I should save myself some self respect as he's already said ""we were good friends and didn't want to take it any further in the future"".

We're both mentally unstable and I feel we could grow together because of each other.

I've been in a few relationships before and have moved on every time. Ex boyfriend messages me now, I just don't feel the same anymore for him.
So for this guy, I'd like to save whatever is left before we lose all our feelings.

The worst part about all this is that we're related to each other and if all this doesn't work out, we'll still have to meet each other at family events and I don't like that I'll still have these thoughts at the back of my mind with my then husband beside me.

I literally cannot express how toxic and manipulative he is.

Note that our class advisor is really, really religious (and that there is nothing wrong with that) but at the same time really hard-headed.

I am a student from 9th Grade, and we cannot stand him because of many things; he tells stories WHICH aren’t even true to others especially when it is about our batch and how “bad” we are to him. He even tells personal stories from his students to their parents which aren’t even worth mentioning or SHOULDN’T be mentions, like personal problems, relationships, friendships or things that he shouldn’t even give a damn about.

He is also homophobic, he doesn’t accept atheists (me), and he ruins our friendships by picking out a student to ‘defend’ him from any situation which equals to favoritism.

About the religion part, he questioned me why I never do the sign of the cross. 
I said i’m not religious nor do i even believe in God (i’m also not a christian btw) and keep in mind that I am a very open-minded person and that I respect those with different religious beliefs, it’s only when one forces theirs on yours that lets me take matters seriously.

His reason why I should go back to ‘god’ is that people who are atheists are more prone to death🤦‍♀️ or that they are more vulnerable to bad luck. Even giving Marilyn Monroe as an example, a doctor he once knew, or other atheists that have died.
In my mind “what about people who aren’t atheists that have died because it was their time? what about those poor muslims who were shot inside the mosque? death could happen to anyone regardless of their religion.” 
I’ve never pushed my beliefs in anyone, and it makes me lose my respect for those who cannot even understand a person’s point of view, like why bother changing it?

Then a while ago, he reached out an announcement to us about the honor rolls in the classroom, calling names out one by one.
And he had the audacity to say 
“Lord buligi ining bata nga ini bisan wala siya gapakatuo sa Diyos tani mapasalamatan yaman ka.” before calling out my name.

Or  “Lord help this kid even though she doesn’t believe in you, I hope she thanks you.”
When translated in English it doesn’t sound as bad, but it sounds a lot lot more offensive in Hiligaynon.

Sorry, but this is just mental torture.

382,"Throwaway because privacy.

This is kind of a long post.. a little rant mixed with asking some advice because I am stuck and I don't know what to do.

So. Where should I begin?
I, for my entire life, had a single group of friends.

We're in 7: 6 boys and 1 girl (poor her, I don't know how she can stand all of us lol).

They're like a second family to me. I know them since kindergarten. They're my blood and my soul. We've been through everything together: really good times and really bad times... (we were originally 8, one of us sadly passed away 5 years ago and we're still coping with it). 

I laughed with every single one of them and I argued with every single one of them.

We can say that they're irreplaceable.

I turned 18 one year ago and so, as every other teenager of this age does here where I live, I took my car licence. 

I was actually the first of them to get it, which meant I was (obviously haha but with pleasure) their ""Uber driver"" when we would hang out together. I also dropped them off at their respective houses at the end of the day.

A year passes by. 

I'm 19 now and nothing much has changed from a year ago. I discovered that the car is pretty useful lol, another one of us got a licence, we had a lot of fun together, great times, university kicks in etc.

Fast forward this month.

We hang out more because it's summer and I still am the chauffeur, together with my other buddy, and we do our usual house-to-house tour to drop off our friends. The last to drop for me, usually every night, is the girl, let's call her Ellie (as it's her name counterpart in English). I've always seen Ellie as a very close friend,  nothing more. Sure we were really close but like, brother-sister close. I can say she was the ""little sis"" of the group, but she was also the one to set us straight sometimes.

But one day while I was bringing her home.. I don't know, we were laughing and goofing and I just looked in the back mirror and I saw her green eyes and her red hairs together with her smile... And I felt so happy and so strange, like, I actually thought ""wow, I didn't remember having so much fun alone with her"".

Then in the following days I realized she would always come with me when I needed to do things, for example when we wanted to throw a party and I needed to get popcorn and stuff she told me all excited ""Wait I'm coming with you!"" And we went together. 

And I had fun! I genuely enjoyed her company and when she hugged me at the end of the day, for the first time in my life I felt embarrassed near her, but I already hugged her thousands of times in the past...

I knew that something had changed inside of me... the feelings for her... Sometimes when I was home I kinda missed her.

Fast forward this week. We hang out alone, the excuse is that she wants to go shopping. Everyone else is in vacation or has already started working and I didn't have anything to do so why not joining her?

And so I did. We had the time of our lives. We laughed and ate ice cream and I thought this is definitely peak happiness.

She came to the mall by bus so I offered to take her home.

And, in the car, in front of her house, we kissed. 

It felt so natural, like we already knew what we wanted, like I knew what I had to do. I didn't think about it not even for a second.

""So, see you next time""
""Yeah.. goodnight""
""Goodnight to you too""

She smiled, and she went home.

But then it struck me. ""What the fuck am I doing?"" I told myself after she left.

And that's the problem. A possible relationship with her would change everything in our group. I'm scared that this would put a barrier between us and the rest of the group. I love my buddies, they're my life.. but I have also feelings for her...

I think that a possible relationship would make me and my other friends more and more distant (because I would spend more time with her obviously) with time and after all we've been through I don't think that it is right...

I know that we can always hang out together obviously, but it would be so weird.. I don't know... Maybe subconsciously I would treat her ""differently"" in front of my friends. Maybe they would feel less ""considered"" if that makes sense...

Maybe I'm overthinking and making up everything in my head.

I don't know if they would accept it. They are good guys, I know they would say only nice things  to us. And they mean it. But who knows how they really feel on the inside?

I talked to her about this and she told me that I didn't have to worry, that if we have feelings for each other, then they will be supportive and everything will remain like it has always been, that at the end of the day we need to follow our guts, not what others think, and her guts say that she wants me, whatever happens.

Maybe she's right? I don't know.. I feel like I'm stuck, that I don't want to let go the old situation and enter the new one because I am scared of change.

But life is made of choices whether I like it or not. And I hate it.

Am I a coward for being like this? 

I have a memory of when I was 12 and me with my 7 other guys made a classic ""bro pact"". We would never ever get feelings for Ellie and we would help each other out with relationships.

We were kids, I know. I chuckled when I thought about how fast time flies and how things change.

Do you think that she's right?
What about our group?

388,"My wife and I have been fighting ovet this recently.  She found a really nice house. It's historic, quite large, and is a great price. The problem is it is in what I consider a bad neighborhood. It is not quite in the big city, but close by. There are a bunch of small abandoned houses to the left of it, then down the road there is government housing, and on the other side of the street is a building with its roof caved in. 

I grew up in the suburbs, and currently live in an apartment in a nice city. The rent is pretty high, but it's a nice place. There is easy access to every kind of store you want.  My job is only 5 minutes away too.

My wife is super emotional about this house. I've put her in tears because I said I didn't want to go forward with it. She says it's all she's dreamed in a house.  Here are her points:

- It's a historical house. Over 100 years old. It's in great condition.  It used to be a group home, so everything is up to code on it, and it is quite large.

- Sure the neighborhood isn't great, but that shouldn't be an issue. She's lived in bad neighborhoods growing up. She says just mind your business and nobody will mess with you.

- The highway is right down the road so I can get to work. The commute would be 30 minutes instead of 5 minutes though.

- The cost per month is literally half of what we pay now. We could save up so much money to get health insurance, save for retirement, etc.

My counterpoints are as follows.

- I don't like the look of the neighborhood. Especially since she wants to make this our ""forever home.""  Our house would be nice, but the other houses look so trashy. I would not want to take walks outside.

- She wants to have kids soon, which I am okay with. Thinking about that, we need to think about schools. The school district we would move to is literally the 2nd worst school district in the state. She mentions doing private or online school. My objection is that those cost money. So we would be paying the same amount as we would here for our apartment and public school as we would for the new house and private school.

- I am honestly worried about crime. Pulling up a crime map shows this house in a high risk sector.  To be safe, I'd honestly want to install lights and cameras outside. It's not just robberies either. Some dude was shot and killed a few miles down the road this house is on.

- Lastly it's not near anything. I really like that our place is 10 minutes from any kind of food or retail store. There is a Walmart but that's it. If I wanted to do any kind of shopping I woukd have to do it on my day off, and it would take at least an hour round trip, opposed to 20 minutes now.

Anyways, please help me out. Do you think the benefits of living in an inexpensive house in a crap neighborhood outweighs the bad things?",04Sep2019,1

395,"(x-posted, hope thats ok)

My situation is below, but...

**TL;DR:** Senior colleague hired his wife to join my team and she sucks, how do I manage the relationship with her and minimise collateral damage to my own relationship with other colleagues who are friends with her?

...

Details:

I work for a small company with 11 employees, soon to be 16. I like my job and most everyone I work with, bar one member of the senior team I'll call Gavin \[40M\]. Gavin isn't the top of the food chain but he has a lot of clout, as the CEO really likes him and handpicked him to join the company based on their past relationship.

Most of the people at my company have worked with each other before in past roles or know each other personally. Hiring friends is the norm, though I'm one of the few ""outsiders"". This hasn't been an issue at all up until recently, when Gavin hired his wife Donna \[F39\] to work part time at the company and asked her to work on some of my projects without consulting me first. I only found out she was going to share projects with me on the day she started.

Unfortunately, Donna is not experienced nor naturally talented in the work she's been assigned. She's been insecure, needy and anxious from day one, and lacks the basic skills necessary to do her job well. I've tried to help her adjust because I would actually welcome some help with my workload, but she pulls me into meetings for an hour or two every time she's in the office, asking me really basic questions and/or just quietly panicking at me. She also does this with CEO, who she knows personally through Gavin.

I've tried to pull away a little bit by not responding instantly to her Slack messages and not accepting every meeting she's tried to book with me. The result has been that she's started interrupting me in meetings, asking basic but usually inappropriate questions addressed to me. I don't think she's intentionally undermining me because she's always grateful when I 'help' her but I'm finding it hard to stay patient. Gavin, of course, always chimes in to support her in team settings.

I've also tried to build my 1:1 relationship with Donna so there's enough trust to establish boundaries, but unfortunately I can't really find much common ground with her. She's quite negative, complaining loudly that no one at the company has their shit together and I feel like she probably says the same things about me to her husband and the CEO outside the office.

There are very subtle signs that the CEO may be starting to realise hiring her wasn't a great idea - if she wasn't Gavin's wife I think she'd definitely be on her way out, so I think my best strategy here is to wait this out and try to stay calm. However, the CEO booked a 1:1 with me next week and if he asks me about Donna I'm not sure what I'll say. I feel the resentment growing, not just at Gavin and Donna, but also at the CEO for not establishing a fair work environment.

I don't want to ruin my place in the company over this. I'm looking for advice on how to manage the relationship with Donna if things get worse and on what should I say if asked about what I think of her work?",04Sep2019,5
397,"I'm at the lowest point in my life. I've been living in constant peril for God knows how long now, and it's only gotten worse. 

I'm 20. I'm in a branch of the military. I suck it up for my job, so I don't burden anyone else. I've noticed, however, that the stress from my routine, along with my self destructive tendencies have made things worse for myself. I've begun losing the love of my life, I've begun taking less care of my health, and I've been reduced to staying in my room unless I specifically need a reason to go out. (buying soap, food)

At first, I thought I would get over it. Usually, I do.
But lately, it's gotten worse. I began questioning whether I would take sleeping aids because I couldn't sleep, or because I WANTED to sleep. I began thinking about throwing myself off a moving truck just to get a reason to stay in my room more. I've hated the thought of crowds, and I feel so ashamed of myself for the anxiety, especially around my friends.

I just don't know what to do. I'm eating well, going to the gym every day, trying my best at uni but I think I really need more human connection and some decent job prospects. Just at 26 that's not easy to get, and I honestly don't like a lot of the people I meet in my degree like at all.

403,"Well first of all, I'm a closeted gay and I'm starting to like this dude I just met online. We met like 3 months ago. This dude, BTW, don't have any idea that I am gay and we casually talk like men obviously. We often talk alot about different stuff. Anything about his life, dreams, plans in life and stuff. It's not my plan to fall in love with him but I did just recently. 

I've been so obsessed with how I would approach him first. He is a very good man because he always finds the time to respond to me. Just recently, I messaged him on snap telling him how much I missed him and I missed our talks, because he's been so busy with school so I messaged him that. 

He seems cool that I've said it to him, but it feels like maybe he just notice my gayness by admitting how I missed him. ""How come a straight dude miss his buddy?"" And now I'm being paranoid with that. 
Also, before, I desperately asked for his snap and his discord and he seems fine with it.

Now, I want to know his Facebook too but it seems like it's too much and he might think of that too? How the heck would I ask him that? A good approach to ask his Facebook without him realizing I'm obsessed with him?

So this is the real story why I'm here..

I messaged him on Whatsapp yesterday, but I didn't get any reply since today. He didn't even seen that message so it's unread. Should I keep sending him a message? Like memes, a jokes or my life happenings? I don't really know what to do tbh. All I want is to know how he's been doing and that's all. No hidden agendas. Just like how I met him and talked to him before. Bros talks and nothing else. 

Tell me what I should do. 
Would it be awkward to keep sending him messages eventhough I feel like I won't get a reply from him? Should I just let him go or pretend that we're not even close? 

If only I have this funny humour in me that he'll insist to message me first to hear my jokes.

413,"I know this may be a weird question, but this has been bothering me for a long time.

I'm a 21M with depression and self-image issues. I am overweight and I have been balding since 18. I am trying to work with what I got right now, such as dieting and exercise, and also buzz cutting my hair. I would also grow a beard, but it's pretty patchy and gross looking right now so not yet. Anyway, this has helped me with my confidence. Of course I still have days of horrible self loathing where I think I am just horribly ugly, but more and more, I am able to look at myself in the mirror and be pleased with what I see.

I have posted on [r/amiugly](https://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/), and yeah, a lot of people thought I was ugly. I didn't argue with them, but a part of me feels like I just shouldn't listen to them. Is it not more important that I like the way I look?

It seems like the general consensus that it is bad to tell ugly people that they are attractive because it will lead to self delusion and that telling people they are ugly will help them. Ugly people should acknowledge that they are ugly and gain confidence in other areas. What this tells me is that reddit thinks I am deluded for thinking of myself as attractive. Firstly, how am I supposed to be confident and also think I am ugly? I, and most people want to feel good in their own skin. Also, the information I received didn't really seem to help me at all. It just seemed to hurt my self confidence even more. It got so bad that I nearly started an eating disorder. Luckily I snapped out of it soon.

How could people telling me I'm ugly help me? What would I gain out of it? Would tell me who I should go after romantically? Are people forbidden from going after people more attractive than them?

I'm kinda getting off track, but my point is that a part of me thinks I should be happy with how I look and ignore what other people think, but its frustrated when so many people on this site seem to disagree and criticize the idea of ""deluded"" self love.

Idk, considering subreddits like [r/amiugly](https://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/) seem to think I am ugly, am I being delusional for just ignoring what they say and continuing to think I look fine?",04Sep2019,1

I sent 3 emails in total since July with no reply. 2 weeks after sending my first email I contacted the dean and told them I have not received any feedback on my assignment and was wondering why my grade was so low. They said to give it time and after contacting them again a month later they contacted him themselves and a few days later we received a general email (to all the class) with general feedback about our assignment.

The hours are long, I'm doing a lot of work at home, and barely find time to go to the gym or do things for myself (weekends are generally free, although I still do work on the weekends). I won't be making as much as I did last year, and won't be saving as much either. Maybe this lifestyle is standard for some of you, but I've been teaching for 5 years now, and my schedule has never been this busy. Perhaps I'm a bit in shock from the move.  


 I'm away from my family all year, from my 70 year old dad, and from my 4 year old nephew. Sometimes, I catch myself deeply regretting my decision, and wanting to abandon ship. I still see some positive in the experience, but am already feeling stressed out and overwhelmed. Maybe this experience will build resilience and character, perhaps some things I am lacking given my reaction to this sudden move. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways. Have any of you been in a similar situation? What have you done to help you find that work / personal life balance. I feel like the time I spend working is necessary. If I don't spend that time, I am unprepared for class.   


Thanks in advance for the advice!",04Sep2019,1
418,"I don't know if this is the right place to post, but I don't know where else to post it.

I'm seriously struggling right now and I feel like i'm at my breaking point. I just want it to be over.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple weeks back, me and my Ex (24F) broke up. She moved out of our apartment and now i'm alone. I miss her, and my heart is still breaking. The breakup was easy, and we agreed on it. So it has gone as well as I could have hoped.

Now that she's gone, I'm having huge money problems. We were never well off, because I was the only one working. Now I have all of the bills on myself, I can't afford it. I've cut out as many monthly payments as possible and i'm still not earning enough to live. I'm looking for a cheaper place to stay, and i'm eating at my parents house most nights to try and save money.

My work is stressful, I don't work long hours, 0830-1700 5 days a week. But it's hard and a stressful line of work. I think about it even when I'm not in the office. I'm starting to mess up a lot because of the other stresses in my life just now, so i'm terrified i'm going to lose my job. Should I talk to my boss about what's going on in my life just now and see if there is some way he can help/go easier on me for a while?

I've been struggling with Anxiety and Depression for near 10 years, and I've been seeing a local mental health nurse for the last 8 months, my next appointment is 21st October. She's given me techniques to help with the Anxiety, which mostly work. I have also tried SSRIs but none of the ones I tried worked, they only made me worse. So at the moment, i'm on no medication.

The suicidal thoughts have gotten x10 worse over the last week, and the reasons for me not committing suicide before seem to be fading in my mind. I just want it to be over.

I don't know what to do, where to go, I just need help.

I know I know lots of people don’t know what they want to do in highschool, I just have no motivation to do anything. I feel fine with doing nothing and I can’t see a reason for me to go to college to go to work somewhere I’ll inevitably be unhappy with. 

I don’t know where to go in life. As much of a bad idea dropping out or doing nothing seems, I feel equally fine with that as I am continuing school. My older brother dropped out and has also always been unmotivated. I just have no idea what I’ll do with my life, everything seems pointless to me, and I don’t know how to get around that and my lack of motivation. 

I no longer feel enthusiasm for anything, because everything seems so out of reach because I know I’ll never do anything difficult. I’ve always put in minimum effort in school and skipped. I’ve kept a good GPA regardless, but I don’t know what to do with it because even with basic classes I put everything off so much and only keep the GPA to keep family off me. I no longer care about it, and I’m not sure what to do.

I’m in a bit of a rut; he has been quite nice, respectful and honest with me from the get go. Would it be wrong if I kept on dating him? He has left the decision up to me. I have told him about my boundaries and I told him that I have to start from the bottom again with him.

I was threatened that if I can’t stop my meltdowns then my mom will not allow me to go to college. Even with anxiety medication and deep breathing, it doesn’t work once it starts. I had three meltdowns at school already. And it’s only my second week of school. I had three at home. I am tired and stopped “masking” this year. I don’t know if this is autistic burnout.

My mom refuses to let me use what calms me the most, which is my dog, because she wants me to stop relying on him.

I get violent during my more extreme meltdowns (happen when I don’t have my dog) and I throw things, rip my skin, head bang, rock, and can’t speak because of how much I am hyperventilating.

My mom won’t leave me alone during this time and keeps yelling at me to tell her what’s wrong and other stuff.

I am scared I will snap at school but in a more extreme manner. Fidget toys don’t work for me.

The times my parents did give me money was very sporadic and still is so I never know when I will get money from them. We are not rich but we are surviving and are coping however never getting any money to learn money management etc made me lose friends. It sucks because now I’m 15  people almost expect you to have at least £5 weekly which seems like a little for a week but it can be saved up. Never having money also means that I can’t buy things that I want such as new trainers etc. Often times when I do get spending money to go with friends it’s not really useful. Example: going to Five guys or Nandos with £3-£5  is just as awkward so I never end up going.

441,"I have an almost 20 and 21 year old male human half clones (11 months apart) The 21 year old was hired to work in our family business, he seemed keen on working during his last months at school. As soon as we officially hired him, he didn't seem interested. Yet we paid him a full time wage to also be able to do an apprenticeship course to help him. It got worse over time and I wanted to be harder on him. But I couldn't because I kept getting told he would grow out of it. I should have made him McWork somewhere else to get used to it. He actually became worse than the worst i could think he could go. Midday waking up, all night gaming. Just sitting in the office not doing anything at all, expecting to get paid. Even if he cleaned up, it would help me alot. I told him, could he at least generate his own wage with the work sitting in front of him. No..... didn't help, he cracked a shit storm and stamped out. I can't punish them anymore, they are adults now.

The 20 year old has an anxiety issue, can't talk to anyone so there goes the him ever getting a job, he goes to therapy for it and never seen a change in 5+ years. Laziness 99%. I told the therapist to roll all the money we have spent on his 'help' and try to shove it up his ass, bet it won't fit unless he coin inserts it $1 at a time. My younger son is gifted highly in photoshop and artistic, but won't ever do any pictures at someone's request. He can make a handle on a sword look really like it is just in front of his screen. I wanted him to make a book cover for me, a logo for a customer, No.... can't do that, so i have to outsource to another business to do those things, costs more money and looks like... shit.

When i was 17 and 18, i had to work because i had them. A responsibility. The banks won't give a teen a loan if they have kids and self employed, may have well said i was unemployed. I have a business that should make a profit.

So we got the 21 year old a car. (not my idea) While i still drive the crappy 2008 model and do the main work for our business. Other people i know keep saying. Wait, soon, be patient. I have kept my wait, soon, be patient long enough. If we all worked together on things, we would all benefit. Instead i am just working constantly and in addition fixing up the stuff ups. His new car is always parked in my way, so i can't get out of the driveway to go to customers. And he hides the keys so i don't drive it.

I know it sounds tame compared to other problems i have read on here. But i would like to be able to have a 2 week holiday since i haven't had one since 2006. I don't hate them.

450,"I've been friends with Jake for four years now. We were extremely close - best friends - and moved to the same city together after graduating. We told each other everything and saw each other maybe once a week. Then he started to make lots of new friends in his job and I saw him much less. I've made some good friends at my job but they all commute really far and they don't like to be social outside work hours for that reason. I felt I was making a lot of effort with Jake but he never seemed to reciprocate anymore, so I decided to stop messaging Jake to see if he'd message me. We didn't speak for months as a consequence except when he needed something from me, or I got sad and gave in.

Since then, we've been on holiday as part of a big group and I managed to spend some individual time with everyone there except him, and he actually actively avoided being by himself with me. He found out he was given the seat next to me on the plane on the return journey and instantly swapped. When he's drunk he has started making really catty comments with me in front of others, like we were drinking in June and he suddenly decided to announce that he didn't want to do something on my birthday (NYE) because it is a waste of his time and he wants to go to a party with his friends. It was totally unwarranted and everyone was really confused.

When I ask him to do things he kind of turns up his nose and tells me ""It won't be fun without \[his girlfriend\]"", or goes ""Nah not interested"" - we only ever spend time together on his terms now. I came to his birthday party and he was really nice when I gave him his present, but then ignored me for the rest of the night except to mock me in front of his new friends. He sneeringly accused me of not recycling - it was really weird. When I asked him about it the next time I saw him he just laughed and said ""I was drunk.""

I tried to speak with him today and explain all the things he's done that have really hurt my feelings lately, and told him that I missed our one-on-one time and that I was feeling increasingly sidelined. He ignored most of the grievances I had, and when I suggested we have different 'friendship languages' he accused me of putting an ultimatum on our friendship, which I in no way had. He accused me of being ""too intense"" despite the fact that this was the first time I'd aired this issue with him and I was trying to explain my problem really reasonably. He told me that ""people move in different directions and sometimes don't see each other a lot."" I feel like he was ready to move in a different direction but I wasn't, and he moved in a different direction and just left me dangling. He used to be really nice to me, but now he's often flippant and dismissive with me.

I know I need to make new friends and ditch my dependence, but I also feel really sad and I'm struggling to get over it. We used to be insanely close and I don't know what happened.

454,"TL;DR: My best friend has had a horribly traumatic year with family deaths and I decided to not tell her her boyfriend had cheated on her, part of me was genuinely scared she could not handle that on top of everything. I thought I was doing the right thing but she hates me more than anyone because I kept his secret. She doesn't understand I was protecting her.





My (22f) best friend has been my best friend my entire life. Literally since day 1. Our Grandmas worked together, and introduced our Mums while they were pregnant at the same time. I guess that's just some context for how long I've had this girl in my life, to me she's more of a sister than my actual blood sister.
This story could get a little long winded but here goes:


We both met our boyfriends around the same time (our boyfriends are also best friends and live together in a house share)and we moved 200 miles cross-country to live with them (it was a long distance situation before that).

We've been with them for 4 years, lived with them for 2. I found out around January this year that her boyfriend had slept with his close female friend who was part of our social circle. Previously to this, my best friend had never been fully comfortable with their relationship but her boyfriend was always adamant that they were just friends and always had been for like 7-8 years. 

I confronted him about it, of course, and as I have lived with him and he has become a good friend of mine - I believed him that it was a one night thing, the worst mistake of his life and it would never happen again. The two of them remained close but I still believe nothing ever happened again. 

Now, he cheated on my friend during a week where they 'had a break' as their relationship was rocky, to say the least. Im not excusing it here. 

I thought long and hard about telling my best friend when I found out but, at the end of January this year, her Dad died out of the blue. I couldnt bring myself to tell her that when she was already dealing with trauma. 

A couple months later, her cousin died from terminal brain cancer. More trauma for her to deal with. 

During this time, her boyfriend was there for her more than he had ever been and they were working on everything and doing good. I thought they were going to last forever - and I decided I didnt see a point telling her, many months later, about what he did. 


About a month ago, they broke up. I got a message from one of her co workers attacking me for being a bad friend and a bad person for never telling her when I found out. I do not know who told this woman, but you know... the rumour mill and all that, I guess. Who told her isnt important. 

So I convinced her (now ex) boyfriend that it was time to come clean, and he did. About everything, including that I knew and so do some of the other people in our social circle. 

I have always stood by the fact that I never told her for her own protection as I thought she could not handle the burden of the truth on top of everything else that happened this year. She just thinks Im protecting him and out of everyone, she is hating me the most right now. 
I know it's super fresh for her but she will not and does not want to understand why I handled it the way I did and I am scared for the first time since I found out, that I made the wrong decision and I should have told her from the start. 

I do not know how to fix this with her. I've never lived my life without her and I dont want to loose her over this when I believed I was doing the right thing by letting it go.",04Sep2019,1
455,"Hi

I need advice on being more social, generally more likable, and basically how to be more motivated to get out there and meet new people. I really need more friend's. Not to go into too much detail, but this last year I have lost a few close friends which I'm still hurting over, due to a few mistakes i have made. I do still have one very close friend who i live with right now, but let's just say my relationship with my other 3 flatmates/friends is strenuous at best, and toxic at worst. My close friend feels conflicted but for the most part doesn't spend much time with me anymore, and I have/want to move out fairly soon. My close friend helped introduce me to the friends I have now lost, and im not sure how i'm going to cope out on my own. I can see myself moving into a new place and staying reclusive in my room, or just getting by on being polite but not actually trying to develop relationships with any new flatmates. I'm introverted asf and find it difficult to meet new people or socialize in general unless I'm drunk or stoned. I know quite a few people in my city, but i have a full time job and even when i do have spare time, i get so nervous and worked up that i psych myself out of going on tinder dates, or spending time with people i like but don't usually hang out with. My style has always been to just chill with a small but solid group of friends, but since high school we have all split our separate ways, except for the aforementioned ""close friend"" who I currently flat with. My major struggle is having friends to spend my time with when we eventually split ways,which is getting closer and closer by the day. We're still gonna hang out but it wont be every day, and having a lack of human contact is affecting my mental well being. By all means i don't really have a reason to be shy, its just kind of in my nature, anyway any advice on this would be awesome, cheers!",04Sep2019,1

463,"First, I have a lot of trauma I've been working on, and over all I still have a hard time trusting people. It's especially hard to take sarcasm or light-hearted teasing from people I don't know too well. I don't overreact per say but I do freeze a bit and I'm not sure how to react. I can basically become a bit meek.  I also sometimes dissociate and feel like I'm in a bubble due to the trauma however I can do my work just fine. It does however mean I'm sometime a little spacy.

Now, two of my coworkers have this playful quarl with eachother and will, for example, have rubber band battles and tease eachother. It's fine but I'm just too nervous I guess too join in. I just chuckle from a far. 

The male cowork acts really chill but will often make sarcastic comments about how I act. Like how I'm too uptight or need to calm down. Often in response to me freezing.

Recently he made a joke saying, ""Amazing! you actually paid attention *for once!*"" (hahaha, ouch...) I kinda laughed it off but that phrase is a huge sticking point for me especially as it relates to the dissociation. I know it's him being sarcastic, but my mind rejects the humor in it.

Now I have an outstanding balance on my student account and it is preventing me from registering for classes.

468,"So, I'm a 19 yo male from Hungary, currently learning engineering. I already graduated and got awesome scores, so going to university is pretty much guaranteed.
Normally, the safe and general option here is to go to an engineering university, but I don't like it too much to be honest. I like video game programming, and I'm good at it, I'm a better programmer than an engineer. I even made small games alone. My dream job is to work at CD Project Red in Poland, but I'm not sure if that's possible. They need experience on working in similar positions, but thats impossible for me, because Hungary has no similar game development corporation. CD Project Red has a lot of applicable jobs on the website, and generally they all need knowledge in C and a bachelor's degree in computer science, and some years of experience. I need to choose my university subject soon, and I could choose computed science, learn C there, apply maybe show some of the games I made and hope for the best with no previous work experience. So my question is, do I take the safe way, get an engineer degree and work in a relatively high position while I don't like what I'm doing, or take computer science and risk not getting applied for maybe obvious reasons, and continue living my average life with low salary and with a useless degree?

469,"Hi. I'd like some outside opinions on my situation, as I'm getting quite frustrated with myself.

I'm in my early 20s and for the last 5/6 years, my relation with my family is going downhill. I don't live with them (due to university), but I visit almost every weekend. I really love them and they love me back, I'm sure. However, I can't be my real me when I'm with them. I can't give my opinions, I can't ask them questions nor interact in any positive way. All I can do is answer yes/no questions and sometimes a few more words. I can't ask my mum how was her day at work, even if I really want to know. Why? I don't know. It's like something in my brain is blocking me from saying things.

Worst part is that they don't know how to handle this (neither do I), and they can't help me overcoming it. Almost every day I hear a ""He doesn't talk"" from my father, so that puts me in a more uncomfortable position.

It all started with not having much to say and lack of common interests, but it escalated too much. 

I've always been the quiet guy in my group of friends, but I don't have this problem with them. I can have interesting discussions with my friends, I can talk about anything with strangers and I can develop strong relations with new people I get to know. But it's completely different with my family. 

I really love my family, they are great parents and I'm really proud of the education I got from them. They work their asses off for me to be able to go to the university. In return, I'm finishing my 5 year course with good results because I feel like that is the only way I can be a decent son.

My biggest fear is losing them one day without having the chance to connect with them and rebuild our relation. Is there anyone with a similar story? Were you able to overcome this problem?",04Sep2019,1
470,"Hello,

 just got 23, m, European. I attend University, I'm also pretty good at what I do. Yet, I've been suffering from mental issues for my whole life (my father did terrible things to me as a child), but I always worked on myself to assure the best results possible. I got diagnosed with a narcisstic personality disorder about 10 years ago, but I reversed most of the symptoms to a healthy level. I'm not narcisstic anymore, I ALWAYS care about others, pay attention to others and first and foremost, help others (I work as a tutor for instance and I love it), a pretty empathic (for example, developed an insane sense of cringe and am pretty good at giving advice to friends when they need it) and others.

What I couldn't fix though, is my low self esteem. I've been working on it pretty hard, but couldn't find the edge. Often times, I feel like my family pulls me down. My mother has always been my person of choice when it comes to asking for advice. May it just be normal advice or psychological advice like how she stopped comparing herself to others. Nowadays, when I ask her for advice about that kind of stuff, she literally tells me to stop the room and is really disrespectful at that, as she puts her hands on her ears and shouts 'lalala' when I'm telling stuff. She calls me a bastard and tells me to shut the fuck up on a regular basis. Also, when I talk, she usually turns up the volume of the TV, which I find REALLY disrespectful.

I've always been an introvert. I don't have many friends and I never liked going out much. I do my things, go to University, go the gym and have a drink once every 2 months or so, but that's it. My family always made fun of me  and insulted me because of that. They say I'm out of touch with reality and delusional when I do things they don't like. My mother is racist and I obviously don't share that attitude. When I disagree with her, she insults me.

It's not just the things she say to me. If it was a stranger, I probably wouldn't care. It's my mother and my sister, though. It feels like they don't care about me. My mother never knew my friends names - that being said, it's not hard to remember one or two names, while she always knew my sister's friends names. She's on call with my sister literally 2-3 hours a day, but rolls her eyes when I want to tell her something 5 minutes a day. My sister objectively reached less in life than me, yet, my mother is 10 times more proud of her than of me.

Back when I had a therapist, she told me to get rid of my mother as soon as possible, but I ignored her advice. JFYI, I've been looking for a new therapist for a while, but waiting lists are very long, unfortunately.

477,"

 Back when I was 14  in 2017 my family moved to a central European country. I was then put in an immigration school which had a course for the language that was spoken in this country, which is normal procedure there when children of immigrants are concerned.

So I spent 2 years in that school where I did learn the language. I could understand it and speak it to a certain level, as well as write it , but not as well. Anyways, I finished last school year particularly good and because I wanted to study further in order to secure a better job in the future, I went on to get a school spot on the higher technical school with electrotechnic as my specialization. 

However, what happened in the last 2 weeks of school completely change my views. I couldn't understand anything the professors talked about, at all. There were many classes where I just would sit idly because I was scared of being asked anything. Now there are many immigrants in the school, but most are 2nd or 3rd generation of immigrants. I am here for only 2 years, I just cannot speak at that level, it's simply to hard for me. It is like talking to posh people in England 

I spoke with my mother who suggested additional classes to learn the language better, but I have 7+ hours of school a day, and I will have to learn extra hard, to translate stuff, in order to understand it and then learn it in the other language, just so I be able to keep my marks afloat, because they remove underperforming students every month. 

Right now I am even considering just returning to my home country because if they remove me in the middle of a school year, it will be very hard to actually get back into schools. 
So my question is what am I supposed to do in this situation??",04Sep2019,1

479,"So this is a long one but here goes.

I dont get exactly along with my boyfriends older sister (we are 23 and she is 32). She lives with him during the week when shes working in the city, so I see her quite often. She is a fun person to be around and I do enjoy my time that I have around her (sometimes) but she can be very loud and obnoxious and bratty. She and I got into some conflict about 3 months ago and I have been stuggling to get past it. (It involves her being selfish and acting like everything is about her and her 13 year old son and then acting like my feelings didn't matter and that I was in the wrong. \*and then! She spied on my and my boyfriends conversation, which was just a normal converastion btw, and because I stood up and he continued to sit down, she thought it looked abusive? and told his mother about it.)

Anyways back to the point.

I've been trying really hard to get past the conflict and build a relationship with her, which I'm sure anyone can say is a difficult task. I'm acting how I normally would (pretty introverted personality, prefers the company of just my dog and bf and like to binge watch netflix and hulu shows, so camped out in the bedroom). I feel like its going well, she and I talk here and there nothing to crazy, and no conflicts! I would never say I hated her, just had some conflicting personalities and I was working my way to having a good relationship with her.

Labor day weekend,

My bf and I decide to go camping and he gets a 5 paragraph text from his sister saying ""dont marry her"" ""dont need anyone in the family causing drama"" ""marry someone who will let us see your kids"" and we were both like wtf? 

Apperently she took my bf roomate out to lunch and broke him down and got him to spill some beans about me. HOWEVER, it was completely untrue stuff like the main pointer was that I HATED HER and talked crap about her behind her back. See my bf made jokes when I started to get frustrated with her and ask stupid and sarcastic questions like ""man you must haaatte herr."" and stuff along the lines of in which I would always respond to with a big NO I don't. His roomate took it as a literal thing and read to much into it (or so he says) and told her how my bf and I bashed on her job and told her other personal stuff about our other friends too that was just totally uncalled for.

I ended up having to call her and talk to her because she was telling her family all of this stupid drama. I hate straight up confrontation and it stressed me out so much I was shaking and stuttering. 

I finaly got her to calm down and listen to me and explained how I truly felt about her which was that I DIDNT hate her and just felt intimidated and cautious and all I wanted was for her to like me. Everything was fine after that and my bf and I finished our camping trip with our phones OFF.

Later that week, my bf told me about what his mom told him. She said some things along the lines of ""If this is a abusive situation I can help you"" ""you can come to me or your sister if you need help"" and the likes of that. This stresses me out so much because I was trying so hard to have and keep a good relationship with his whole family and now I feel backed into a corner with no way out of the defense zone.  

It seems to me that this will almost always be a problem. All I want to do is stay out of the way and mind my own business but it seems that I cannot even do that... because to them that makes me look sketchy... I dont know what to do. I love my boyfriend and we are both planning on moving foward with the relationship soon but I dont want his family continuously causing drama and straining our relationship...",04Sep2019,1

488,"I got a new roommate about a month ago who, when we met before moving in, told me her dog was well trained. I love dogs and have had them my whole life, but it seems we have different ideas of what well trained means. 

This dog begs intensely. She jumps and scratches up your arms. She licks endlessly. She doesn’t listen to commands unless my roommate is holding a treat over her head. The worst thing though is the whining. If I am not touching this dog every second, and i mean that quite literally, she whines and barks so loudly I can’t concentrate or hear anything besides her. She is crate trained but does the same thing in there so it’s just a matter of whether I want to hear her yell next to me or in another room. She does it for hours. I wish I could keep her out of the crate, I’ve never had a crated dog and it just feels wrong to me, but I’m a student and there’s no way I could do any of my work with her doing that next to me. Even if she is momentarily quiet, the sounds of someone walking behind our unit or up the stairs in the hallway send her into an aggressive frenzy which lasts several minutes and is even louder than the usual. She has snapped at me before so I don’t feel comfortable intervening in those situations but once again, I have schoolwork and we live in an apartment, so noise can be a problem. 

I can’t take it. I’ve tried asking my roommate about it but she’s near perfectly behaved when she’s home so it looks like I’m overreacting. She also encourages this behavior by feeding her food from her plate and petting her and such when she barks. I’ve tried working with her on the commands and stuff, but she doesn’t listen to anyone but my roommate and I don’t feel like I should have to spend dedicated time to training her dog when she already told me it was well trained and it’s not my dog. She’s a good roommate otherwise but I’m starting to dread coming home. Not that I want to, but I can’t ask her to leave or anything, we have separate leases.

I’m super happy because I really need this job and hopefully it goes well for me. 

Now, the issue. I’m returning to university at the very end of this month, basically next month is when real classes begin again for real though. I’m a full time student and I commute everyday, almost an hour and a half one way. So it is a long time. I don’t have my timetable yet and haven’t picked classes, so I really cant give my availability when I’m in college.

I also have another job. It’s completely irregular, casual work. I actually only have 3 more shifts untill February next year, and they’re all next week. So it won’t be an issue. 

On my resume the hiring manager will see that i’m a full time student and hopefully put 2 and 2 together and realised I will be back soon, so that my availability will change? How do I bring this up that my hours will not be as stated on my application come next month? Thanks!",04Sep2019,2
490,"My first pay raise came just over a year ago and it was because I went into a completely different position. Now, this new position has probably tripled the responsibilities from what it originally was when I first took it on. I'm happy with the work I do and enjoy it as a passion. 

However, I'm being grossly underpaid. I would like to ask for a raise but here are some issues:

1. The company is very small and it seems like it's not doing so well. BUT HOWEVER, it's making enough to send $200 directly to the boss' niece every week. Originally she was doing social media stuff but hasn't done it in years and it is currently under my list of responsibilities to do it. I feel like I should at least be getting that payment - if not, I would consider it nepotism, am I wrong?

2. My boss is also the CEO, so it's hard discussing personal finance with him especially since he's hard headed and part of the reason our company isn't doing well is because he doesn't consult with anyone and doesn't keep track of tasks. (I could go into it but I wont). 

The next person to ask is our Controller/Accountant as she is part of the performance review process and also handles our paychecks. 

My responsibilities definitely has grew over the past year and I've taken them on successfully and thoroughly enjoy it and I want them to know that. I also want them to know I feel like I'm being undervalued and at the same time let them know I'm looking to continue to bring value to the company.

So i'm wondering how to handle this complex situation. We're not all friends here, but there's no negative emotions floating around, just dull awkwardness and void of friendships.",04Sep2019,1

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

Dutch is well trained walks without a leash can do tricks w/e he’s extremely well trained.

Well last night I heard Dutch bark and he had left the bedroom I checked on him and my mom was trying to put him in one of those crates (he was having none of it) after she saw me she almost jumped out of her skin before letting him go and putting this crate which I have no idea where she got it in the closet.
Today a guy came and asked if the dog was still for sale (£350 for a full trained pedigree shepherd) so I told him no and shut the door.

Ff till now and she just flipped her shit saying that she needs the money and ‘that it’s just a dog’ my bro would get over it. 

Well I gotta work a shift tomorrow from 12-9

496,"As in the question. I‘ve had this feeling twice now while smoking a joint with my girl on a saturday night. 

In that exact moment I felt like I was going insane. When I’m sober I‘m sure I‘m not(!) 
The feeling faded but it’s still in my stomach days after, for some reason. 
On google I‘ve read about depersonalization. 

I can mention that my girlfriend struggles a little, she has almost no friends and feels alone, and since I’m a really empathic person, I can feel her pain deep inside me. It makes me sad, when I see her next to me while she’s in her thoughts. The result is that I’m also drifting in my thoughts. It feels like I can’t take it any longer. I’ve had some issues with my family when I was 13/14 (divorced parents), but I’m good on my own. I hit the gym, I play video games, I have a job, I have friends. 

Can it be that this feeling somehow comes with what’s going on in our relationship? I mean, we’re happy together, we spend time in the nature, watching shows, we’re cooking amazing meals together but the thing with her being sad.. well I said it before.

501,"Hi Reddit!

I recently found a vacancy for a part-time job at my University which I would like to apply for. It would be the perfect amount of working time, I could really need the money and the content of the job is also pretty much perfect for me. I think I also meet all the requirements, so it's not unlikely that I'd get it if I applied.

The only problem is: One of the employees that I would share the office with seems to dislike my general presence a lot. 

We have never been friends, we know each other because we studied the same thing. One of the things that connect the two of us is that I have dated her husband for 3 to 4 months in 2018 - to be clear, they were (and still are) in an open relationship, she was aware that it happened and was consenting to it. However, when things were starting to get serious between him and I, she asked him to break up with me. I was aware beforehand that they had such a veto-arrangement, so although I was sad when it happened, I accepted it. Him and I ended on good terms and still are very close friends (we were also friends before we started having a thing). Because of my continuous friendship with her husband, and to demonstrate that I am not holding a grudge against anyone, I tried to establish a positive relationship to her as well after the break-up happened, e.g. by initiating conversations. Once I realised that she was not too happy about these efforts, I eventually stopped trying to actively engage with her. To be clear, my efforts were limited to a few friendly texts and brief conversations - I was not following her around or anything like that.

Currently, it seems as if she tries to avoid me at all costs. She doesn't go to events if I attend and even actively walks somewhere else if I happen to be around. (A few days ago my boyfriend - not her husband - saw her running off, when we approached a group of shared acquaintances.) If I had to guess, I'd say that she is hurt or jealous because her husband and I still get along so well and her coping mechanism seems to be that she wants to ""forget"" I exist by minimising the moments in which she is interacting with me. 

Now I am afraid that I would make her incredibly uncomfortable by applying for a job that would require us to share an office and work closely together. Since she is also the wife of one of my best friends, I'd want to avoid upsetting her (but I also still really want that job to be honest). I was even thinking about talking to her before applying, but judging from past efforts of trying to start a conversation, I'm pretty sure she wouldn't want that. I also think she tries to hide from people that she is uncomfortable with me, so I'm worried of making her feel even worse if I show her that I actually noticed that she is.

So, should I apply for a job, which would be perfect for me and my life circumstances, even though I know that it would make my future co-worker (and wife of my best friend who I used to date with her consent) very uncomfortable?",04Sep2019,2

503,"So I’ve had a crush on my closest friend for a while (at least I thought I did), and he has moved away for the year so I only see him every few months and I just learned he recently got a girlfriend. I never did anything to really encourage a relationship between him and I because I never felt it would happen, so our interactions have always been platonic (felt this might be important to mention). 

I expected to be crushed by this discovery but apart from maybe a 2 minute mini cry (reasonable considering it was a nearly two year crush I think) I really feel kind of fine about it. In fact, I’d say I’m happy for him and wish the relationship the best and while I don’t feel great right now it’s because of other stresses not this. I feel if I were to get upset about something is someone else getting more attention from him but I feel I can manage and overcome this pretty readily.

I’ve also noticed that most of the time when I think of him I just think of hanging out and maybe like hugging (I feel a bit silly for writing this) mostly. I’ll admit I don’t have many people in my life and he’s my main source of support, was I just mistaking liking him platonically for romantically (I’m sure I probably did genuinely have a crush at some point at least)? Am I maybe just blocking the hurt off for now? What does all of this sound like to other people?

504,"So last night/yesterday idfk I'll prob save this to post later anyways last night something happened that made me think ""damn.."" 

So I had 24h duty and people often come over here and talk to us to keep us company bc it's so boring etc. And these 2 guys came and they were like ""whyre you so quiet?"" I get this alot but this took a different turn than all the others. Normally people say some shit like ""you need to come out of your shell"" which just pisses me off because I just don't like talking it's not that I have a ""shell"" 

Anyways these 2 guys asked why I was so quiet asked if it was because they were s-6 and I was like nah and I forgot what they asked but I responded with ""nah I'm seriously like this with everyone, ask cpl m"" and one of em said ""well, I don't know why you're not more social, you're pretty attractive, not gonna lie, when I saw you I thought you wouldve been 10x more social"" and I was like ""......."" 

But yeah, looking at me from an outsiders perspective you could guess I'm p social thing is, I'm not. Like those 2 guys said, ""you're barely social enough to fuck around with"" meaning barely social enough to crack jokes with aka not quite an outsider. 

I mean, the one reason I have for not being social considering everything else is my upbringing. Contrary to popular belief, I didn't have the picture perfect upbringing everyone thinks I did. Abused till 18 when I escaped from my parents house while there a hand a fuckton mental shit such as depression social anxiety and selective mutism which I pretty much didn't develop any social skills growing up. 

K I'll stop ranting now but yeah any suggestions? If I'm being honest I'm still recovering from my parents BS.

520,"I have a friend from work who comes over sometimes. This weekend he brought his girlfriend. By the time they got to my house (4 hours late for the work related party we were supposed to go to) they were drunk, high on cocaine, ketamine, and weed. They’re also broke, because they spend all their money on drugs. I had to give my friend $5 so we wouldn’t run out of gas on the way. Not passing judgement, but it’s information I take into account when considering the situation. 

These are the only people I’ve had in my home in weeks. I’m not super social, and there aren’t lots of people coming and going from my house, just them and one of my neighbors who never comes in further than my living room (room closest to the front door). 

After this work party, they asked if I wanted to have them back over for some drinks. I agreed, and after doing more ketamine and cocaine in my house, in front of my girlfriend (a former coke addict), they individually excused themselves to use my upstairs bathroom. I noticed the girl went back out to the car after using my bathroom, before returning. 

Fast forward to two days later, my girlfriend is upset. She went into the bathroom to change her nose ring, and her box of jewelry is missing. It had rings from her grandmother in there, in addition to probably $200 worth of body jewelry accumulated over several years.

The only two people to ever come into that bathroom in the last probably 3 weeks to a month were my friend and his girlfriend. My friend has no piercings. His girlfriend had body piercings all over. I know my friend, while kind of a dope, he’s never struck me as a thief, though I wouldn’t necessarily put it past him given the right circumstances. His girlfriend, however, I do not know and has much more use for the missing piercings. I think his girlfriend stole my girlfriend’s jewelry. 

This is a sensitive situation, since there is an aspect of my job involved. I’m sort-of-semi-indirectly this guy’s “boss”, in that he’s labor and I’m a manager but he doesn’t work on my crew’s but I’m still in a “authority” position over him so I don’t want the work/personal stuff to mix. Also, his girlfriend happens to be black, and I wouldn’t want things to be misconstrued into me accusing her simply because she’s black. I’m accusing her because she has piercings, I don’t know her, and she was one of only two people with access to what went missing. 

I told my girlfriend to tear apart the house and to be 100% certain that there’s no way it could be anywhere else. She swears up and down that it’s been in the bathroom since we moved in, about 6 months. Endless searching of the house has yielded nothing, and my gf is telling me we’re just wasting time because it was certainly stolen. 

I sent an out of context snap to my friend with my girlfriend balling her eyes out, completely distraught about her grandmother’s jewelry from the box, because I was already pretty certain at this point it was stolen, and I wanted him to experience the level of pain my girlfriend was experiencing. He didn’t respond to the snap, which lead me to believe he knows exactly what it’s about, as she was describing to me the box and it’s contents (she didn’t know I was recording). 

What might be the best way to approach this semi-sensitive subject from here? I probably should have even sent the snap, but I was so angry seeing her so upset after I opened up my home to them. I’m just not sure what to do from here.",04Sep2019,1

Part of it is esthetics, and her culture since she's Japanese.I thought my mom has tolerated my belly and nostril because my belly piercing is hidden most of the time, and my nostril because its a simple stud and just hated my septum but she hates all my piercings. When I got those piercings done she wasn't crazy about it but she didn't yell at me, or give me a long lecture she just asked me if I was going to get an infected and where I got it done. The argument started when I wore a croptop to which my mom told me to change since my piercing is exposed and didn't want my piercing to show at college. I ended up changing to a plain t shirt, only to have my mom complain that since I didn't have that many plain t shirts I should save it for when I meet with teachers. Annoyed, I changed my shirt and then my mom got into this argument on how disrespectful I am for getting piercings knowing she doesn't like them. When I tried explaining that she doesn't have to like them but just respect that I'm into those things, she pointed how if her mom told her not to do something she would listen.

For context, these were piercings I brought with my own money, so my mom shouldn't complain that I spent my money on those.

Knowing my mom she will go on some speech about how if you're wrong admit it, but she won't always follow her own advice, and blame me for our relationship problems. I spoke to my dad about it since he's the peace maker and he agreed that while me wearing the croptop was a bad idea and that I should have worn it when they were going to leave, also that my mom shouldn't have overreacted over a piercing I got a month ago and keep rehashing things and being immature.",04Sep2019,1

For context, we're both 16, in the same school and class. I was walking with a friend from another class, and he thinks there's something serious between me and my crush cuz we sit together in class and we're pretty close

So after a group sharing, I walked out of the classroom where the sharing was held and saw her. She was with a bunch of friends, prob about 6-7 of them. I'm 182cm (6 feet 1 I think?) , and she's about 162 cm which should sit around 5 feet  5? So obviously 20 cm of difference in height and I like to poke fun at her about her height. So I walked past her, patted her head, and said ""so tall"". Now I was walking with a friend from a different class and he saw her. And he said "" hey that's your girlfriend right"". There's nothing serious between us but he thinks there is because some people are spreading rumours. I walked off but saw her staring at me while her friends started asking her if she really has a boyfriend i.e. me and patting her head simultaneously. She probably wants to kill me now and I don't want anything to get awkward between us. What can I do?

I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this but I really need a second opinion or just advice, also a first time poster.

I'm 17 yr old, turning 18 in January and I think I just made possibly the biggest mistake of my life.

This school year I started at a new school because I wanted a fresh start from my old school. At my old school I was antisocial and just really awkward in general even tough the people and friends I had there were really nice and my unhappiness there was 100% my own fault. I got so unhappy that 2/3 through last year I decided it would be for the best that I change schools, and I did. (Now a little bit of background info, my old school will only let you join if one of your parents has a job with the European commission)The thing is, I told everyone(at my old school) when asked why I was changing schools that my dad's contract was going to expire and I had to change. This was technically true but it was going to be fairly likely that it would be renewed or he was going to get a similar job within the commission, so it was more of a half truth I told people so I wouldn't have to explain my personal reasoning behind leaving, because like I said everyone at my old school was really nice and me being unhappy was because of my social awkwardness, so I didn't want to tell anyone.

Now I'm going to be honest, I hate my new school. Every second feels like an hour. I greatly underestimated how hard it would be being the new guy again. At my age, if I want to become friends with anyone I have to initiate a convo, which I'm not at all used to doing and is completely out of my comfort zone. But I have been trying with small chats with people whenever I see a chance. But my whole class (my only realistic method of meeting people) is already divided in very clearly defined groups. And i'm having a really hard time establishing contact with anyone and just spend most of my time being silent. The lessons and teachers are all perfectly fine, easier even. But it's the free periods and break times that I loathe the most. Everyone just keeps telling me that ""it'll get easier"" and ""I warned you this would happen"" which the second one, sure I should've listened but it's too late for that now. I hate it here so much i'm considering dropping out of high school the moment I turn 18 and going to trade school or something similar(I had to repeat a year of high school due to illnesses so if do stay in school, I'll be there until I'm 19). Or changing back again to my old school, if in any way possible. I just can't see myself going through this year like this. I've lost almost all of my appetite due to stress and feel down all the time. I try to talk to my friends on discord as much as I can, so I don't feel completely lonely. But I don't really go out anymore, just wake up - school - go home, and repeat. I don't know what to do, dropping out right now really does seem like the best option which I never imagined I would ever say.",04Sep2019,1
529,"This Fall I began classes for nueroscience in my junior year. I really always wanted to go to college, but I just cant pass my math classes. I have tried my best, but this semester doesnt seem like it's going well. 

I didn't want to come back to school. After many previous failures with math, I told the people around me that I just wanted to work. Everyone pressured me into coming back, so I did. I gave the college my tuition out of my pocket, and it doesnt seem like I can get it back if I drop classes now. 

I am under too much pressure though. I keep having mental breakdowns that leave me a mess for multiple hours. I cant concentrate on anything. I feel like this might be in my head, but the stress is making me into a person i dont want to be. 

Do I just accept the money that I spent on tuition as a loss? It's about $2,000 all together, which for me is a very large amount. Is it worth having breakdowns over? I just want to be able to pass my math, but after so many failures of taking the class, it just induces panic to think about it.

Any advice would be appreciated.",04Sep2019,2
530,"I am extremely paranoid about situations especially the ones about me and my safety.
For example if I am walking down the road alone, I prefer crowded areas even though the road is much longer. That may not be a big one but 
I also triple check every lock and window in my house (I live with my parents.)
It got even worse when I heard that a neighbor of ours got his house robbed a few days ago. I couldn't sleep that day, I started leaving almost every light on to give the impression that many people are awake (Usually I am the only one) and I changed my laptop's location so even if they saw it from my window and want to steal it, they won't be able to find it so easily,

531,"My best friend of 16 years has been cheated on her boyfriend about 6 times. He is very loyal and genuinely really loves her. Her and I have gotten into many arguments because of her cheating ways. I tell her not to and she says she does it because she’s insecure and craves the attention. She kept telling me she’s not like that anymore. But she is like that. Her boyfriend and I have gotten close and he’s honestly a really amazing guy who has nothing but love and positivity in his heart. Someone ratted her out to her boyfriend about her cheating- and let me just say, she was in my house sobbing until 4am. Her boyfriend is absolutely devastated.  I feel guilty because he only knows she has cheated once (when I know she’s cheated more than once)- when she’s cheated on him multiple times with different guys. I feel like he has the right to know this but I don’t have the heart to tell him. I love my best friend and I know what she did is wrong but I don’t want to loose her in the long run. On the flip side, her boyfriend is one of my close friends who I really care about and I don’t want him coming back to her (he is the type to give second chances) because he deserves better. What do I do? I don’t want to ruin my friendships. I’m trying to do what is right but I’m struggling on what to do.",04Sep2019,1

Room 1: Single bed, no balcony, no ensuite, shares bathroom with Room 2.

Room 2: double bed, balcony, no ensuite, shares bathroom with Room 1.

Room 3: double bed, no balcony, ensuite bathroom.

Based on these facts alone, how would you personally divide the £1250 between the 3 people? Thank you in advance!!",04Sep2019,1
534,"
For context, we're both 16, in the same school and class. I was walking with a friend from another class, and he thinks there's something serious between me and my crush cuz we sit together in class and we're pretty close

So after a group sharing, I walked out of the classroom where the sharing was held and saw her. She was with a bunch of friends, prob about 6-7 of them. I'm 182cm (6 feet 1 I think?) , and she's about 162 cm which should sit around 5 feet  5? So obviously 20 cm of difference in height and I like to poke fun at her about her height. So I walked past her, patted her head, and said ""so tall"". Now I was walking with a friend from a different class and he saw her. And he said "" hey that's your girlfriend right"". There's nothing serious between us but he thinks there is because some people are spreading rumours. I walked off but saw her staring at me while her friends started asking her if she really has a boyfriend i.e. me and patting her head simultaneously. She probably wants to kill me now and I don't want anything to get awkward between us. What can I do?

Tl;DR walked past my crush, my friend said she was my gf, and her friends bombarded her with questions. I think she's pissed at me and idk what to do",04Sep2019,1

537,"Some bg, my (f24) sibling (nb 23) is not having a great time. They are very depressed and struggling, and our relationship has been a little strained ever since school. We had a pretty screwy childhood and so have been processing a lot of stuff individually and are at different places in our lives right now. That said we’re still pretty close and get along pretty well. 

Recently we had a very heated argument about some childhood stuff. 

They brought up three separate incidents which occurred (I’m guessing based on what they said and on some vague recollection for one instance) when I was around 13-14. They said that 1) I called them a bitch, and lied to my mom so I wouldn’t get in trouble. 2) I hit them and never got in trouble for it and denied that I did it. 3) Claim that I’m the favorite child and have used this fact to abuse and treat them poorly their whole life, and that I’ve never been called out for it. 

Now, I don’t remember that specific incident of calling them a bitch. I would argued that they call me that and way worse nearly every time we argue, and way more than just once when we were sad angry children.  I also don’t specifically remember hitting them, but then again, they have hit me many times, and I don’t recall in detail the time place or reason, again because we were children! 

As for the last, I did recall the conversation we had when my mom had told me some information about my father’s opinions, and I we had a lengthy chat about how screwy our home life was. From my perspective I thought we had had a good talk. This was several years ago, and they haven’t said anything since. 

I said “I don’t know what you’re talking about....” and didn’t finish my sentence before the whole fight devolved into hysterics. Long story short we didn’t finish the argument and I left the next day without saying goodbye. 

My question is, should i be validating something I don’t recall the specifics of? I feel that lying to them and saying I remember and admitting to that specific instance wouldn’t be fair, and i know that i need validation from them on lots of things and i don’t think I’ll get it. but my mom keeps bringing up how I need to be bigger and validate them so they can move on. 
I don’t think that’s my job, but I’m starting to wonder if I should have just told them what they wanted to hear even though it won’t be the truth. 

TLDR my sibling wants me to validate specific childhood traumas which I don’t recall and wants to me admit to these specific occurrences, but I feel that lying to them about remembering isn’t right and I don’t want to validate something I don’t remember. 
Any advice?",04Sep2019,1

I couldn't see what type of bird it was because it was silhouetted against the sun. But this thing had to be at least a bald eagle because that's the only really big bird we have in central Illinois. I'm nowhere near a river so it's probably not a Golden eagle.

540,"In my country, porn twitter accounts are called alter accounts (like alter persona) People here use it for hooking up and videotaping the deed. My boyfriend confessed he has an twitter porn account even after we’re together. But when he showed me his tweets, a lot of it was deleted (google cache takes a while to refresh so I saw deleted tweets) He’s admitted to having posted himself doing solo stuff( google cache suggests differently)

He says he’ll delete the account. I told him I’m okay with giving him freedom to watch porn. But instead he made the account private so i couldn’t see what he’s posting. I asked a friend to send him a follow request and he has only liked tweets of videotaped hookups. 

I feel really bad for wanting to keep an eye on the twitter account instead of telling him to shut it down because I want to immediately if he’s cheating on me. I don’t exactly know how to feel about the situation. I wanna ask for some options I can go for, if you guys could help me",04Sep2019,9
541,"So, I have not been the student with the best grades. I have been on academic probation once, but I have since recovered. Last semester, my financial aid was canceled despite my grades improving significantly. I filed an appeal but was rejected and was not allowed to do anything else regarding it. I was stupid and did not drop my classes.

Now I have an outstanding balance on my student account and it is preventing me from registering for classes. I called the financial aid office and they said the only thing I can do is take out a private loan or pay out of pocket. The issue is, I'm only 20 and have no credit to go off of. I've been trying my best filing an application wherever but I keep getting rejected due to my credit score. What should I do?

I have a serious issue about letting people know about my issues. I don't know why, it's stupid. I don't want my family or anyone knowing that I'm struggling like this nor do I want them to know that I can't attend school. The thing is, I do want to attend school. I care about it so much. I don't think I would or could be anything without school. I know there are alternatives, but I don't want my family finding out.

542,"So after 6 months of dating my girlfriend she started suggesting she was kinda tired of living where she was (a small city about 30 minutes from me) and was looking at other locations. A few weeks go by and she goes to look at an apartment with her friend that is about an hour and 20 minutes from me. She ended up not really liking the apartment and I told her that I felt kinda weird about her moving further away and we basically left it at: ""as we get more serious we need to talk about these things more"". Flash forward another 6 months and on our way back from somewhere she starts telling me some girls in this podcast fan group on facebook that she's a part of posted they needed a new room mate in a large city about an hour and a half away. She's saying she's probably gonna take it since her lease is up soon and she likes the city the new place is in. I was kinda upset and I tell her I thought we were gonna talk about stuff like that and that I had hoped if she wanted to move she would ask me to move with her. She starts saying how I ""never talk about my plans"" etc. which I guess she took as a reason to move without talking to me about it? Thankfully the conversation ended on a positive note with us deciding we would in fact move together and that we would make that decision together. That was a month ago and unfortunately we've made little progress. I sent her some apartment listings a few times and she just said she liked them but not much else. What bothers me more is that a month ago she really didn't seem to care about finding a new job before moving and now suddenly that's a major factor. To make things all the more complicated I'm living at home and my parents got divorced a little over 2 years ago and as part of the conditions my mom needs to put the house on the market within the next 6 months or so. On top of that I've gotten pretty frustrated with my job and really need a change but I don't wanna start something new in this area if I'm (hopefully) relocating relatively soon. Should I be concerned? I'm worried she's deliberately stalling on this. Sometimes it feels like I should just independently applying to jobs in cities I want to move to and if I land one I should just tell her, ""here's where I'm going, it's up to you what you want to do"".",04Sep2019,1

For starters, I have a prescription for medical cannabis. In my state, cannabis is legal medically, but not recreationally. I have torn the laburms in both of my shoulders so it massively helps with pain as well as helped me be able to sleep at night. The issue is that most places I am applying to are government contractors that typically require some type of security clearance to be eligible to work there.

The advice Im hoping to get is:

1. Should I refrain from medicating and stay clean until my new job situation is figured out?
2. Does having a medical prescription essentially disregard failing a test if I were to need to take one for employment?
3. Do government contractors and/or any position requiring security clearance have an absolute no tolerance policy even with a medical prescription?

560,"This is going to be short and probably more vague than it should, I’m on a quick break at work. Sorry in advance. 


So last year my ex husband and i were going thru our divorce. He wasn’t the best partner and wasn’t the emotional supporter i needed. I had post partum depression and couldn’t reach out to him, mostly because he refused to listen and kind of gaslighted my feelings a lot. Unfortunately that led me to having an emotional affair with a mutual coworker of ours (ex and i worked at the same company as this coworker). It was wrong and i feel terrible about it. I did come clean about the emotional affair with my ex husband, we talked about why it happened and he said he’d work on things. 

Well a few weeks later and not much had changed. He was still refusing to hear me out and i continued contact with the coworker. Ex husband and i (mostly i) decided to get a divorce. After we signed our paperwork the coworker and i kissed. We had a workout class together that took place after work, and that’s where we would meet up and hang out. We fooled around a few times (mostly making out, never mutual touching and me never touching anything). It happened a few times, maybe more than 5 but less than 10. We stopped because i felt wrong about it and we haven’t spoke in over a year. He doesn’t go to the class anymore, i have not had any contact with him in months. 

I got a new job, that’s the biggest reason i don’t speak to this man anymore. But my ex husband and him work together. They’re friends i suppose (according to ex).  My ex and i are talking about possible reconciliation, which is another story completely on its own. 

My issue is this, if i tell my ex husband about what happened it will make me feel less guilty, but it will ruin any chance we have at being together PLUS it will make work difficult for him as well. Another part of me feels as tho since our divorce papers were signed there’s no need to tell him because we weren’t together. But they work with each other.. and i just don’t know what to do. 

I’m confused and feeling anxious about this whole situation. Plz don’t shit on me too hard, i know what i did was wrong. And i beat myself up for it everyday.",04Sep2019,1

Plus gf broke up a few days ago ( didn’t live together), so very lonely and not many friends to discuss this with. I ran it through a friend and he said to be frugal in my situation and move to a studio. 

I have a possible job offer this week but maybe not. But even if i get it, I think I would have to sell my furniture and move to a smaller place to save some money.

Car insurance just almost doubled bc of an accident this prior year. So yeah, lots of things have gone bad in a few months. 

I can’t imagine putting furniture in a mini storage, where it will probably cost me $200 month and in a blink of an eye a year passes and I have spent $2K -$2.5K in storage vs just selling the furniture and buying new furniture when i get a bigger place again in a year ;(.

My youngest son told me, ""Daddy, is doing this to put you in line,"" I left an abusive relationship 6 years ago, after being so frightened I called my aunt and begged her to tell me what to do, her response, ""Run!""

I have full legal custody and 50/50 physical custody the law mandates the father have 50/50 access to his children. I have legal custody due to the fact I believe in vaccines, and medical professional opinions - my eldest has been recently diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD inattentive type - and he is telling my son, that I am saying he is defective, diseased and broken - which isn't true!  I want to ensure my son has all the services he needs to succeed in school, I am working closely with the psychologist and his family doctor to give him the best life and future he wants.

Then, he changed he attacked, saying I was in debt -  I have just a student loan of less than 8000 I pay off every month.  He called the cops, and claimed I hit him when that failed, I am a pacifist - I am known to rescue spiders from my home (my roommate will kill them if he sees them) in my hands - because the thought of hurting them would make me cry.  I volunteer with Citizen Advocacy and love to help in my community - but his attacks are getting too much - and he seems to be using the system to continuously harass me.

587,"Recently my mom went to the hospital because she fainted in the bathroom. It was a combination of high blood pressure and diabetes. I was in school when all of this happening. My dad come to school to pick me up and we went straight to the hospital. When we got to the hospital, she was unconscious. She doesn't wake up until two days later. 

When she finally awake, she was angry for no reason at all. She screamed 'I should have strangled that bitch when she left'. At first, i thought she was talking about the nurse who took care of her or my aunt that visited her earlier whom she hated. She was going a bit crazy and said that she wanted to be dead and end the suffering (she's religious BTW if that makes any different). Then i ask the nurse if he gave her any morfin and then he laughed (quite unprofessional  at the situation TBH). He told me he just gave her oxygen. So again, i was wondering why she was very angry. She is a feisty woman but can be very loving and a great mom compared to my friends's moms. 

When she was able to talk, she ask me to come to her. Then she told me why she was having a breakdown. She told me that while i was in school, a woman came to our home and tells her that my dad has a child with her for 6 years. She was shocked and locked herself in the bathroom. Long story short, she fainted and rescued by our neighbors and went to the hospital. 

I don't blame my dad either. He was with another girl when he visited my mom's hometown. He got arranged with her 2 days after he met her ( It was common back in the days). Well i don't know if he was having an affair with the woman he was dating or not. But the point is, i feel for him. 

They lasted 26 years together and have 5 children (i'm the middle child). I'm very confused right now. I think all of my siblings hate my dad now. He is not a great dad, but not so bad either.

But no, all they ever told me was to just focus on my studies and worry about a job later. 

However, due to recent repeated breaches of trust of emotional blackmail, I’ve had enough. I want to become free and my own person. 
The thing is, my parents or anyone else has never taught me about basic need to necessities. How to send payments for bills, how to balance checks, how to take care of accounts, etc. Even when I asked to learn, all they said was to just focus on my studies. I know they wanted me to succeed, but at the same time they made it so that I had to rely upon them.

595,"I started working at this job pretty abruptly in mid-May of this year. I had been looking for jobs for a few days when my best friend suggested I am interviewed at this high-end Italian restaurant close to my house. Two days later I interviewed and was hired on the spot as a busser. Except, that isn't the case. 

I was first put in the kitchen to wash glasses. My manager told me that everyone starts there and I will not spend anymore than two weeks there but I spent my first two months there. The conditions were brutal- 100 degree room, noisy, rude kitchen workers that I couldn't communicate with, standing for 7+ hours. I have a medical condition and I felt lied to tbh. Furthermore, I was promised a starting wage at about a dollar more than minimum wage despite everyone else I've talked to making 2 or 3 dollars more (excluding tips which I didnt receive in the kitchen). Despite that promise, I still only make minimum wage. I take classes, I help raise children, I can't afford this. 

I was moved out of the kitchen to a food running position where I am eligible for 20-40 dollar tip every shift. Food running is equally as brutal. I've sprained my foot doing it. The restaurant is three stories high and there is never a lull. Often times, I am the only one food running so I must burn myself and bend over backwards for this. I wasn't granted any medical compensation for the sprained foot btw.  I come home every night utterly fucking exhausted and sore at around 10 pm, shower, eat and then I must get up at 5 am for class. 

And finally, the staff. They're racist, homophobic and sexist cunts and I must deal with that constantly. I've never been welcomed by more than a few of them. They're cold and uncomfortable to be around. Some of them have made fun of my physical appearance, too. The manager has outright said he doesn't respect women. As a woman, what the fuck is my point in being there?

Before almost every shift, I am an anxious and crying mess. I can't take it anymore. My boyfriend and dad are very adamant that I can't leave this job until I find another. But I vomited yesterday from the stress of just GOING to my job and that is my last straw. I applied to four more places in the last day and already heard back from one for an interview. I want to quit tonight and worry about finding a job after. Or, should I try to be fired? Tbh, I'm a woman so it isn't like that'll be a difficult choice for my manager to make -_-. 

I am very anxious about quitting. I don't know how to and whether to do it in person. My manager and the staff have such a way of making me feel so small and powerless, idk if I could say everything I wanted to say irl. Or, should I just not show up to my shifts this week? Very tempting. I want to just change my contact and never go near there again!

All 3 times I've done nothing. One time I was going to give her a toy she loves to play with and she scratch me. And one time I literally didn't so anything  I was just about to eat when she hissed at me and growled at me. She chased me into my GF room where I had to stay until she came back from work. I didn't come out because if I did and if she attacked me again I would've hurt her. I won't stand back and get attacked and not do anything. However I love my GF and I keep telling her that she needs to do something about this. Not only that but the cat has become extremely needy. She's always by my GF side and never leaving us alone. I told my GF I refuse to live together and have be in this state of fear over the cat and over hurting the cat potentially killing her if she really tries to viciously attack me. I've brought up a ton of ideas to help the cat. However if she continues to act this way she needs to go because I can't live in this state of panic.

599,"I have no idea what to do.

My wife of almost 10 years has grown more and more depressed over the last  7 years, particularly since we've had children.  She tried taking some SSRIs at one point to combat PPD, but didn't like how she felt on them and eventually came off.  Her doctor was just a PCP, so she didn't receive any of the real care/follow-up that she needed.

About twice a year, she has a pretty major meltdown, but we push past it and things get stronger.  But the last year or so has gotten exceptionally worse.  **She refuses to get help.**  I've tried leaving her alone to do it and I've tried assisting her in finding therapy and she still just doesn't want to be ""judged.""  I get it, her core issues stem from childhood and narcissistic parenting.  She's got a classic case - low self-worth drives her every decision.  This has led to eating disorders, borderline alcoholism, and a constant fear of being rejected by others (me included).  I think the real reason she quit her SSRI is a fear of getting fat on them, which is a massive worry of hers.

Our relationship is generally excellent - our love is very strong and we get along really well.  But when we argue, she shuts down as quick as one possibly could and it takes days, sometimes weeks to get her to open back up.  The only way she does is if I really push the issue and give her a lot of hugs, love, and support.

A large issue is that I get no love, no support, and no hugs when she fucks up or when I am sad.  If she gets in a mood where she says a bunch of shitty things, no matter how mildly I confront the situation she shuts down and goes emotionally AWOL.  She can't handle any sort of judgment.  This weekend she was really harsh with me on a lot of things and I told her that she had hurt my feelings.  She literally screamed at the top of her lungs and ran out of the house.  I was so gentle with the conversation...I have no idea what to do.  Her ability to handle every day stressors has all but disappeared.  She's not talking to me right now, still, and can't articulate at all why she feels ""shut down"" or how to fix it.

I understand this is part of he condition, but I am emotionally drained and I have absolutely no one to talk to.  My parents are both gone, I have no siblings that I have any real rapport with for a conversation like this.  

To be fully honest, I am worried about her possibly committing suicide someday.  When she gets super deep, it's hard to pull her back out and the thought of that happening is soul-crushing.  She has promised no self-harm, but there are definitely moments.

It's taking every ounce of mental energy I have to not just run away from the pain.  I know this isn't her fault - she had a very shitty upbringing - but I have become the custodian for mental illnesses and how they affect our life. I have never been personally depressed in my life, outside of a small patch during puberty, but now I am feeling a constant weight that I can't overcome.  It's a huge amount of pressure to **constantly** have to consider every action I take, to make sure it doesn't push her down a negative path.

Please help me figure out what to do.  I really want to keep my family together, but I need her to be her best to survive this world.",04Sep2019,1
601,"I am extremely paranoid about situations especially the ones about me and my safety.
For example if I am walking down the road alone, I prefer crowded areas even though the road is much longer. That may not be a big one but 
I also triple check every lock and window in my house (I live with my parents.)
It got even worse when I heard that a neighbor of ours got his house robbed a few days ago. I couldn't sleep that day, I started leaving almost every light on to give the impression that many people are awake (Usually I am the only one) and I changed my laptop's location so even if they saw it from my window and want to steal it, they won't be able to find it so easily,

611,"Hey. I am currently interning in a consulting firm where we bill hourly, so if I want to get paid for an hour of working I need to bill a specific client or admin. This is all good when I am doing work, and I just bill whoever I did work for. Now my problem is sometimes I do not have enough of a work flow for the full 30 hours a week I am suppose to be working per my contract. I am unsure how to bill my additional hours. 

I feel like if I don’t reach my 30 hours it reflects poorly on me and makes it look like I am not a hard worker. Conversely if I bill a project unnecessarily or bill admin it can upset the finances of the company. I do want to get paid for the full 30 hours each week, but I don’t necessarily need the money. I am preparing to start my masters in a few weeks so having savings into that can really make a difference.

For this specific week the person who is in charge of managing me went out of town for field work and left me with about 3 hours of work for the week. He will probably, eventually, send me some more tasks but yesterday I spent like 5 hours on personal stuff or reddit. I was really bored and just wanted to go home. 

I don’t want to keep billing admin for the rest of the week. I do not want to keep pretending to be hard at work while I’m really just emailing my PI or writing long ass reddit posts. I do not want to keep sitting at my desk feeling like I have to sit here and have literally nothing to do. Here is what I believe my options are.

\-Text my boss and ask if there was anything else he wanted me to work on (I am doing it but, I doubt he will send me anything)

\-Ask other people in the office though they do work that’s completely different than me and I am not sure I will have the expertise. Additionally, there is absolutely no president for this. If they asked me to do something I’d be ecstatic, but I’m not sure how I feel about going around to all the other offices to ask for work. I did this at my previous internship and found it really humiliating and frustrating because it I ended up doing it for like 1-2 hours a day and the tasks I got always sucked (printing reports, binding things, and just generally degrading tasks for someone with a strong educational background to do for 7-6 hours a day).

\-Just go home and take the pay cut. Don’t risk people noticing the fact I’m not really working and call it. 

\- keep sitting at my desk pretending I am working but being totally bored off my ass and having no product to show for it. I am worried all get called out or it just reflects poorly on me when people notice, but it’s what I am currently doing.

618,"Ill try to keep the details short - the drama level is bordering on made for TV movie (animated based on some cliche villain work involved, doesnt matter)

Backstory - About 4 months ago I cut ties with my mother. We were incredibly close - even lived together until I was about 30 - the last several years where she was living in my home instead of the other way around.  She had a serious abusive streak and even in independence I felt like I couldn't succeed without her help - to the point where even in my own home I wasn't the home owner - I was the kid, so even in my own home I had few freedoms and submitted to her demands every time. I haven't spoken to her since before Mothers Day in May (i'm Canadian).   The last time we did speak over text I demanded she bring my SIN card and birth certificate to my grandmother because I didn't want to talk to her but needed my documents.  That's a whole other can of worms because when she did she also brought about $500 worth of liquor and a ""care package"" that I refused.  I actually gave the liquor to my uncle but found out a week later that she took it back when she realized he had received it.  I ignore all texts and messages from her now but keep hearing about really cartoon villainy things she's been doing to others - including even putting herself alone on the deed to my grandmothers house (my grandmother doesnt speak english) when she was supposed to put herself and all of her siblings on it so they could split the assets when she passes.  Sufficed to say - I'm not the only one feeling betrayed.

Anyway - the important part. Her birthday is this weekend. I do not want to talk to her but I also don't want to be the ""bad guy"" (its a complex - I go out of my way to help others even at great expense to myself - hence why she began living in my home until recently).  

My options

1. Do I send her flowers or something to her office so I didn't ""forget"" or wasn't an ""ungrateful child"" and just continue ignoring her texts or
2. Do I keep her cut out. Let the birthday pass - and risk more blowup and confrontation?

Or is there a 3rd option? Either way it feels like it's fighting time and either way both of us are going to be pissed off.  I'm at a loss. What do you folks suggest?",04Sep2019,1

621,"Hey y’all, 

I’m getting pretty frustrated that my boss offers to hire freelancers to lighten my work load because they get paid much much more than me and the other employees. It’s a smalllll company (3-5 employees) but we make a decent amount of money. I’m the operations manager, the highest position at the company just below the owner, and he frequently says I run the show (because I do). But yet I still get paid under $20/hour in a state where the minimum wage is $12/hour. There are some benefits offered: paid vacations, holidays, sick time, and 2 personal days as well as insurance and a 401k. But I still feel like I’m significantly underpaid for the scale the company works at. 

My boss has been hiring freelancers at $30/hour and sometimes even $40/hour, meanwhile I carry the weight of the company doing my job and often the jobs of other vacant positions. I personally feel I’ve gone above and beyond to better the company from an operations standpoint and have often introduced new ways for us to increase profits. 

He has also mentioned multiple times that we are making more money this year then last year and he spends money pretty freely. I can’t help but to be frustrated by the situation. 

In the 8 months I’ve worked here I’ve received $3.50 in raises. But still under $20/hour. 

My question for you all is, is it right for me to be against hiring freelancers that make so much more then I do even if it’s a temporary position? 
What can I do to rectify the situation?
Is it too soon to ask for another raise? Last one was in July. 

At this point I’m tired of feeling unappreciated and underpaid for the amount of work and effort I put in on a daily basis. If he can afford to pay them, why can’t he afford to pay me more.",04Sep2019,1

We were both a little drunk and I though this could be a good moment because I wanted to hear opinion about that from someone close to me for a long time now.

I wanted to tell him that these are my preferences and it doesn't reflect on my opinions and believes about people with traumas, past abuses or anything.

625,"Hey Reddit,

So recently it came out that my sibling of 15 years, named F, is facing some serious issues regarding their mental health. It's been going on for a really long time but we only just discovered this about a year ago. Since then, they've been to a youth counselor, but we're not happy with them so we're currently looking into getting more professional help. Among the issues my sibling's facing there's self-harm, potential depression, potential eating disorder, anxiety, self-hate and more. From the outside they seem fine, but it's really bad. My dad doesn't understand the severity of it all, so my mom is basically ""forced"" to shoulder it all by herself. It's affecting both her and me (17 years) incredibly, I fall apart in school and have to come home and she is tearing at herself and blaming herself for how my sibling's feeling, believing it to be poor parenting on her behalf (not true). 

Besides this, my mom is also taking responsibility for the entire household, cleaning, shopping and cooking. I help with washing clothes and doing the dishwasher when I can, and I assist with making meals, but my siblings don't help, F due to the load of issues they're facing (if we ask them to help and they don't, they'll feel bad and punish themselves by skipping meals/not sleeping/hitting themselves, if they do help it's cause they'd feel bad for letting us down otherwise and then they'll feel forced to say yes even though they perhaps can't), and my youngest sibling (10 years old), named P, is too young to understand responsibility. My dad only helps with meals by making the every odd dinner every second week. He doesn't help with shopping as he's not involved enough in household activities to know what we need. He doesn't help with cleaning or laundry as he doesn't realize help's needed until it's way too late, which my mom never let's happen, because then we'd be living in a pigsty. We can't either ask him to help, because his reply is to ""hire a cleaner"", which doesn't solve the issue as someone still needs to pack everything away before the cleaner arrives, and that someone is my mom. He does however work a lot, my mom's job is very flexible and doesn't pay as much as my dad's, so when they had P  and realized someone needed to cut down on work in order to take care of the children, my mom was the clear choice and ended up staying home much more, which has now led to her being responsible for everything. 

Then there's P. He's ridiculously spoiled, as my mom didn't have enough energy left after my sibling and I to enforce the same rules that we had (and my dad doesn't think it's and issue). So now he plays video games 60% of the time, the rest being used for school, eating and sleeping. He has his own smartphone (since 3 years back) even though I didn't get one until I was 12, a laptop, Nintendo 3Ds, access to Wii, Xbox, SNES and a brand-new Switch, and still complains about everything. He lacks empathy and I'm fairly certain he has anger management issues, as all he ever does is scream, rage and though things, when things don't go the way he wants, or when he dies in Fortnite. He also doesn't care at all about how my mom slaves away to make him happy 24/7, and instead treats her as if she's supposed to cater to him. He's even made the statement several times during his angry rants that ""that's her job"", and I can't step in because he listens to me even less than he listens to her, which is to say incredibly little. He swears way too much for a ten-year-old and has absolutely no consideration for anyone's feelings but his own. 

All this has been going on for some time now, so why am I deciding to write about it now? I just got out of a discussion with my mom where we spoke about all this and I said how the responsibility in our family is hardly split evenly, and she said that marriage is complicated and that you have to pick your battles. Much like F, she pretends everything is fine but I know it's not, and I just don't know what to do. I know she'll break eventually, because she's been doing this for 17 years and now it's getting to the tipping point. So now I'm here, sharing my situation with you guys, hoping that one of you can give a solid piece of advice, or even just to tell me that you've been in the same situation and it get's better. I am so sick of this, and I need help.

637,"So I (F19) have this guy that I’ve been internet friends with on and off for like 6/7 years, I also have a boyfriend who I live with and we have been together for 3 years. In the past the internet friend and I had always been quite flirty with each other but since I’ve been with my boyfriend we haven’t talked much at all. This week we have been snapping back and forth but just catching up and friendly conversations. Last night when I was being intimate with my boyfriend of 3 years the internet friend popped into my mind. 

Should I send this to internet friend ? “ Hey, I was thinking about you last night when I was with my boyfriend. Which scares me. So I should probably stop snapping you bc I don’t wanna mess up what I have w my bf. “ 

Or do I just leave him on opened? I don’t really want to mess up my internet friendship but I also care more about my boyfriend.",04Sep2019,1
638,"I work part-time at a retail store in a mall. I worked a closing shift with a key holder (kind of a manager, but with no perks). About 30 minutes before the store closed, the key holder’s husband came into the store and sat down. I learned he was picking her up as they’re current sharing a car. 

The key holder locked the door to the store and told me to clock out and that I could leave; her husband was still in the store. I offered to wait but she said it was totally fine for me to clock out. 

I’m concerned about what happened after I left - it’s usually bad practice for non-staff to be in a store after it closes while money is being counted/deposits are being made. Do I tell the head manager? I’m afraid I’ll have to quit due to retaliation from other staff for “telling” on this key holder.",04Sep2019,1

641,"For some background im a 20yo male and am currently in college studying computer science. I don't love my major, nor do I hate it. I see the usefulness in programming, technology, and what it can do, but my personal values don't really align with it and its not a passion of mine. I'll never be one of those 24/7 coders who devote their lives to it. I just know it couldn't be me. I know I'm capable of finishing this degree and getting a solid starting wage and eventually good pay into an above-average way of living, at least in terms of monetary value. This is where the problem sets in.

My parents have always raised me and my sister to get good grades, work hard, and make money. They're immigrants and worked hard for us to have the opportunity of a better life while also improving theirs. It's really an inspiration how hard both of them worked. Me being a first-generation college student puts me in, not a unique, but interesting position when it comes to following career/passion or maybe mixing the two. On one hand, I want to have a steady job to provide for my parents and maybe help them pay off certain loans/debts and make their life easier. Nothing better than technology or medicine for that. Which is why I don't think its a coincidence a lot of children of immigrants pursue those fields. On the flip side, I want to pursue what makes me happy and give it my all and find a way to make money out of it. I also want to take time to explore the world and really find out more things im passionate about and just experience new things. I've lived a very one-dimensional life so far and don't know much about my self.

The dilemma is, I feel like I can't pursue those things such as taking time off from college, traveling, trying new things, finding new passions, pursuing current passions, without having the luxury of financial security. My parents can't afford for me to be deadweight financially for what could be years. I don't work while in college to focus on school and it's paying off but the only reason my parents are paying for college is for me to be successful which is heavily correlated with money. And all the money they've invested in me would be a waste if I took time off or even dropped out. I know college isn't for me but I'm sticking it out for them. The experience has been cool, but the lifestyle is not it for me.

The way I see it, I have two options. 

1) Finish my degree, get a 9-5 hopefully related to my field, earn some money to explore passions and have the luxury to do things I can't now. The problem with this is I'll be stuck doing something I don't necessarily find meaningful for 40 hours a week. I know this will sound pretentious or whiny to a lot of you guys but I hope some of you see my point. I have a strong natural drive and ambition to pursue whatever I find meaningful and make success out of it. And find a way to make money off of it. I want to do that with some things now and I want to explore to find what else I have to offer. I fear that I won't have the time or full dedication if im working a full time job, but I WILL have the money to do so. 

2) talk to my parents about this and probably be met with confused looks and told to stay in college. My parents are very supportive and I know at the end of the day they'd let me do whatever I desire, but theres no going around the fact that I would have wasted their money and I would feel like I am letting them down. They always tell me to not worry about money and to focus on school, but I know money is a problem for them and I know me not staying in college is a failed ""investment"" per se. Every parent invests in their kid and I just dont want to let them down.

642,So I(M22) had a crush on this cute girl in high school. Never had the balls to tell her so had sent a long anonymous confession about how I felt when we were 16. She figured out who I was but remained silent until we graduated.She was then trying her luck with one of my friends. Anyways once we graduated she mesgd me saying how she was immature about the whole thing and how we were in similar situations.I said I was the immature one and it ended at that. Fast forward 4 years we have both graduated. Recently I have gone through a depression for a year and its made me realise the only thing in life I ever wanted real bad was for her to love me. Dont know if its still a crush or its something more and if I should talk to her about it after 4 years.Havent spoken to her since that conversation. Need Advice!,04Sep2019,2

She was extremely grateful that we gave her some living basics like towels and tooth brush and a place to stay for a bit. She hasn't stolen from me and based on what I know of recent I don't think she would. But I've heard from someone that a few years ago when they worked together that she would move in with people and steal from them to sell and get back with her boyfriend.

646,"ALRIGHT GUYS! I need your opinion! So like four days ago, a recent friend and her partner split up. They've been dating for two years and whenever we would habg out with them they were always together. There's about 7 to 10 people in this particular friend group. My boyfriend Manny (fake name lol) invited three people over like three nights ago. Two guys and then the female friend, Tabatha (fake name). He gets the grill started, putting pork chops on thw grill and he gets a phone call. Picks it up and says food is on the grill and that food should be done when said person gets there. Anyway he hangs up and he starts naming everyone that's getting food. Four people only; me, him, Tabatha and his uncle. Im shocked so i said what about your two other friends? He says they aren't coming over. Hearing that she was the only person that was going to be there made me quite uncomfortable. Seeing as she just recently became single and i find out she's the only person that came over. 

Anyway she pops up and i decide to go over there to her and say hey! I don't know her as well because I've only seen her like maybe four or five times. Maybe a little more but anyway she was always with her boyfriend. And i love having coupled friends! She tells us she cant stay for long because she has work in the mprning. And he pressures her into drinking beer and telling her she can sleep over. I was like no she said she wants to go home early for work. He wouldn't give up on her drinking so i said ya know what? Lemme drink with yall. He gets a little upset (sometimes i get emotional when drinking so i limit my consumption).

I start to notice he's getting friendly with her! I start to get a little insecure and jealous. My previous ex did cheat on me before. So when i saw him talking to her a lot i got a little scared and started over thinking. We go into the pool and she randomly states... My friend girl has a boyfriend and i feel so bad that her boyfriend is trying to hit on me. I immediately look at her and was like DUDEEEEE I'm not trying to start anything because i wanna be friends but if my boydriend ever flirts wifh you can you let me know? I mean i trust him and everything but you can never be too sure. She said yes! I was telling her that i think i was being too insecure, too crazy and too paranoid and i was like I'm just a little jealous because my boyfriend hasn't really been paying attention to me! And she goes yeah i noticed this too but i think he's just being friendly because i did break up recently. I asked if she was sad and she said she's so happy about the breakup. 

My boyfriend and his uncle gets by to the pool. He jumps in and tells me to go on his back. I was like (in my head) aww he didn't forget about me that's good! So i got on his back and he tells me to become friends with Tabatha and talk to her. So we swim towards her and me, still being very irrational and in my head-- i see that hes getting very closw to her so i just like jumped off of him. In my head i was like OMG what if he made me jump on his back so he can get super close to her? So pretty much the whole time whenever i was further away from Tabatha she would swim towards me and my boyfriend would swim and follow her! 

Towards the end of the night she kept saying she wanted to go home soon. And he pretty much was like no you can't leave yet. You gotta stay yada yada! She finally leaves and i tried to tell him my feelings:  I was being pretty irrational and insecure. I was upset that you didn't barely pay attention to me and i felt you were talkong to Tabatha way more and it got me jealous. 

He looked at me abd was like wow??? You think that low of me that im cheating on you/flirting? I was like not cheating no. But i was just uncomfortable with how you pushed me off you when i tried to sit on your lap and after that happened i was upset. He blew up and was like I treat you like my damn wife. I cook you dinner and im the best boyfriend ever and you're a bitch. You're unpleasant to be around when you drink. Matter of facr you're unpleasant all the time. Even sober. He tells me we are broken up and I have to pack my bag and move out. I said let me do this when i wake up abd he said i want you gone.

He told me that i needed to text her saying shes not welcomed back because it's my fault i ruined a friendship. So i tell her. She asked if she did anytging to ruin it and hopes we get back together and i was like no you did nothing literally. It's all of my doing. Im sorry i was just insecure and paranoid. I was just telling her how i was upswt that he pushed me off of him and then continued to just talk to her after he pushed me off. 

Anywayssss, she said it's fine and not to worry. I told Manny that i messaged her and he wanted me to read the whole text back to him. He was like see youre the asshole. You caused the friendship to get ruined it's not my fault. And i was like yes it's all of my fault. Im sorry. I didnt think you'd blow up I just wanted reassurance and that i was very irrational. He seemed pretty hurt and angry so i was like wow I guess theyve been friends for a while.

Two days ago I told him im sorry again because i have a guilty conscience. He said it was okay but I ruined a great friendship and we can invite her over again but he wasn't goimg to speak to her at all anymore. And he was like we both met her at the same time anyway so it's ok we'll make new friends. Then his uncle came up to me and told me it was a big L. I said yes it's def a big L. It's a big lost i can't believe i wrecked a friendship over my insecurity. He said it's not a lost it's a lie. What you did last night was very wrong of you. I was there the whole time abd my nephew did nothing. He loves you and only you and he wont be flirting with any girls as long as im there with y'all. You forced the girl into an uncomfortable spot and made her think your boyfriend was hitting on her. You knew what you were doing. You tricked her. 

Tldr; newly single friend girl comes over for dinner, i thought my boyfriend was being too friendly so at the end of the night i tried to tell him my feelings; he blows up, broke up with me made me block the friend girl. Am asshole",04Sep2019,2
647,"My sister graduated uni in June/July. She worked ridiculously hard, gained a degree in a difficult subject, and earned a result that the whole family are proud of. I love my sister. I know that probably sounds like a stupid thing to say but it’s true. We get on fantastically well, share the same interests, have the same humour etc etc. I would also mention that my father is a non entity in my life and as such I try hard to be a decent role model for her but it’s fair to say I have not always done a good job of this as I’ve put my family through the ringer a little bit but all is good now.

After graduation my sister said she needed some time to recharge after uni and that she would start job hunting soon. I think that is more than fair and my mum agreed that she deserved a break. However, this little break has turned into a 4 month hibernation from the human race. She will not look for jobs despite my mother urging her to do so, will not sign onto JSA, which to be fair isn’t ideal, but means my mum isn’t getting any money from my sister and is keeping her for nothing, and she rarely interacts with the outside world. I do not want her to be a loser like me and I don’t want her to be unhappy taking a series of shitty jobs that leads to nowhere.

I guess my question to r/advice is how can I inspire her to do something? Do I even have the right to nudge her in the right direction or should I let her choose her own path? What do I do?",04Sep2019,1
649,"I just graduated college August 17th. 
As a celebration I’m going on a tour through Europe from sept 21 to oct 25. 
It didn’t seem logical to get a job for a month. 

People seem astounded that I am not employed when they ask me what I’m doing. I’m hanging out. A lot of my friends have kind of just said ok. 

HOWEVER, my mom bought me an iPad to take on my trip instead of my laptop. I was downloading Sober grid (an app for sober people). I typed in sober and saw the app LoosidApp it said dating. I don’t think I’m ready to date because I’m not sure where I’m going to work when I get back from Europe. Idk where I’m going to end up living after awhile as well. I live in buckingham va. It’s 45 mins from Lynchburg, and Charlottesville, 30 from FarmVille, and about 1hr from Richmond. So I’ll probably end up in the Richmond area or Charlottesville. It’ll be awhile. 

Sooooo I probably shouldn’t have even downloaded the app out of curiousity. I didn’t think I’d see anyone on there. I did a few swipes to see what was on there. I matched with this guy who’s really what I’m looking for. We had a nice chat last night, 

He messaged me at 1 and asked how my day is and what I do for work. I feel like the timing is really wrong. 

You’d think from this I’m like 22 but I’m 28. I went back to college in 2016 after leaving an ex of many years. I kind of switched paths 3 years ago rom marrying a military guy and being his wife that follows him around and has a family to leaving him to take care of myself and do my own thing. 

I’m also court ordered sober because of a dui. I go to court sept 16th and am free from the situation, but I want to remain sober. Which means I’m still on a restricted license. So this guy would have to drive from Richmond to see me! It’s basically 2 weeks until I leave for 35 days so...uhhhh ??? I guess my license will be restored the 17th so that could be our date! Haha

I also know when someone is expressing suicidal gestures (e.g. attempts that gave no intention to actually end a persons life). I’ve noticed lately that someone I know is expressing a lot of gestures. Regularly “attempts” and then seeking attention for it (like messaging their ex to tell them their in hospital in hopes of getting sympathy, telling every person in their life they’ve attempted suicide, needing 

I know these attempts are gestures, but I don’t think they fully understand why they’re acting this way. I can tell it’s because they can’t self-soothe and know these gestures are a quick way of getting attention and sympathy. This thing is it’s become an unhealthy method now. They do this instead of trying to manage their own emotions, they aren’t going to counselling because they don’t think it helps (counselling needs them to change after all), and they can’t seem to be a friend back right now. Like I’ll get daily “I’m going to kill myself” messages but they’ll never be there for me or anyone else in the same capacity (and why would they? They’ve learnt a better way of getting what they want from people). 

I’m worried about cutting them off, but I also don’t know how to get them to help themselves without being quite cold? I don’t want to say what I’ve noticed because that’ll just get them defensive and really they need to work it out themselves.

Any ideas?",04Sep2019,1
652,"My roommate began a long distance relationship with a guy she'd known in childhood earlier this year. In March, she went to visit him. In June he came to visit us and in July, he moved out here and moved in with us. I knew they were together and all, but it was just kind of sprung on me and our other roommate that he was moving here and by the time we were told, everything was already set in motion so it kind of felt like we had no real say in the matter. Roommate's boyfriend doesn't have a job, isn't in school, and really never leaves the apartment. He doesn't do much to interact with us, and when we try, he just shrugs it off. He plays music loud enough at bedtime that I can hear it clearly in my room. If it were ambient music or white noise, it would be fine, but its rap/trap music. My roommate, the girlfriend, is INCREDIBLE, she is going to graduate early with a degree, a minor, and a few certifications. She works two jobs, student teaches, and still makes it a point to talk to us, and visit her family. Boyfriend is just garbage, but for whatever reason, he makes her SO happy. I am so conflicted. I do not like having him here AT ALL, but he moved halfway across the country to be here so it's not like he can just move somewhere else. He only knows us, the two other girls living here and our boyfriends. None of us enjoy this except the roommate he is dating. We feel trapped because he came from so far.

653,"Obviously this is up to me and what I see valuable but I would love to hear some opinions.

Here are the details:

Been at my current job 7 years. I'm 29. Started at the lowest rung now I'm in inside sales. Not only do I do all inside sales jobs functions as everyone else, but I also have about 8 other duties.

I do not see a pay raise nor a promotion in the near future. Shit, I haven't seen a pay raise in the 3 or 4 years I've been in this position. I tAlked to management about this and had a document typed up with everything I've done and taken on. How much money I've saved and how much wasted time has been saved... This triggered them to give not only me, but my full group a cost of living raise. This is all I've seen in the last 3 or 4 years. I was pissed because I specifically went to them about why I am worth more... We're all paid equally but they have one job where I have about eight. Not only that but I HAVE RUN 3 DEPARTMENTS AT ONCE INBETWEEN HIRES. They just keep piling more and more ""projects"" on me, that adds to my full time duties. 

Now that's the bad...here is the good:

I'm salary. I have 3 weeks vacation. Never work overtime. I live 10 minutes from the office. As long I work my 8 a day I can come and go whenever. Get here at 7, no lunch and leave at 3? Cool. Get here at 8, take a lunch and leave at 5? Cool. You get it. If I need to just leave, no problem. Cool people too. 

Here's the big one they hold over your head...it's employee owned. In the 7 years I've been here I own more than $90k in stocks....without putting a penny into it. I also have my 401k which they do not contribute to.

Anyway, sorry for the bit of a rant. This is the first time I've typed all of this into Reddit and not just deleted it afterward. 

Am I just feeling entitled? What would you do in this situation? I've pretty much given up on fighting for a raise. I've plead my case with clear numbers and research...its just not gonna happen.

There's a guild and I feel obligated to help as much as I can as well as my friend playing the game and probably appreciating me playing with him.

so it all started when I met this particular guy(who is 24, and im 19, so we have some sort of age gap but not a big one)abroad studying english over my summer holidays. We unfortunately met my last week, but we spent with each other a lot of time. Then when we both went home, we were texting, not all the time, but every day.

I had never been so much nervous over a guy like that. But when I met him everything was amazing. His roomates and friends were really friendly and so generous. I spent the most amazing weekend there I ever had. But when I came back home, everything felt different. Right now we are not texting as we were. Things just seem a bit weird in my opinion. I have no idea what to do now, because I feel like I have fell in love with this guy. I have already cried like million times, because its the worst feeling I ever had, missing someone so much, not being able to hold them or hug them. But I feel maybe he doesnt feel the same.
Can please someone help me, what would you in my situation? I think I should just ask him, what we should do now, or what are we.

I’ll try my best not to sound shallow, because that is not my intention at all.

Since I am someone who he greatly depends on, he throws all of his negativity (that he hides from everyone else) on me, all of his negative, stressful and sometimes close minded feelings and thoughts.
He can be very narcissistic sometimes, acting and talking in a way as if the entire world revolves around him. Whenever I come to him for advice, he turns the subject to himself and I begin to give the advice. 

As much as I am willing to stand by him and listen to his thoughts, I am beginning to feel very caged in this friendship. every time we talk, my energy significantly lowers. I feel terrible because he depends on me, but I’m so tired of all this negativity.

I wanted to grow my hair out like Jimmy page, one day I woke up late for the bus, ( I still made it,) and she is going to make me shave my head and give my X-Box away. I guess it doesn’t sound that bad but she controls every aspect of my life and is over bearing. I am a teenager and need to have at least a little freedom. But she doesn’t allow that. When I don’t look physically scarred when she screams at me she hits me and screams more. I can’t talk to her because she will just yell. What should I do?",04Sep2019,0
667,"I'm 20 years old and basically fear anyone who are ages 13 years old to about 30 years old. I know why I fear the, it's because I've been bullied in the past by younger people and sometimes older people.

The reason why I ask this is because I do really need to get over this silly fear and learn to talk to people my age, older and younger. 

There's a vacancy at a milkshake shop in my town and I really want to apply for it. But lots of young teenagers go in there, it's really putting me off because what if they laugh at me and take the piss out of me? I'm also very overweight as well, so that's more of a reason to say nasty things about me. 

I think it's mainly groups of young people I'm scared of.

What do I do? Confront my fears and try and get a job working around mainly people who are young or just find a different job that avoids young people?",04Sep2019,2

As the title has suggested, I have been failing and struggling with the modules Mathematics 1 MT105a and Principles of accounting AC1025 both being a freshman module you take during Year 1. Literally passing every other modules aside from these 2, since I am completely garbage at number related stuffs, but excels at essay modules or things that require large amounts of writing or memorization. The problem is, if I fail these 2 again (hope not), I won't be able to modules that has these as a prerequisite as the maximum time you can fail a module is 3. My foundation in maths is really weak and I cannot for the life of me wrap my head around accountancy, also I have to deal with some other bs by the name of Managerial Economics down the road.

681,"First off, if someone i know irl reads this; fuck you , i told you to not check my reddit account

So i never did have a lot of friends or was the popular kid in any way. (Which is fine by me) In the last couple of years i got into internet culture and internet politics. Being a ""memelord"" (god i hate that word) isnt really everybodies cup of tea and again, thats fine by me. So i never really talked with most of the other people in my class. Mostly just with the friends I already knew. But if i would have a conversation with others, i thought that it would work out pretty ok.

The people in my class and parallel classes have a group chat thats basically for hanging out and getting drunk. (Its legal in my country). I got invited and joined once, but left pretty soon cause i did not have time. And i thought ""wow this was nice"" . 

Now come the part that makes me question a lot of things
But last saturday i was again. And this time i felt really disconnected. Everything i talked about was seen as weird and annoying. (Tbh i was at least a little bit loud, but others were worse and more drunk than i was) And after it was over i was kicked out the chat pretty harshly. 

I do not really care that much about the group, since drinking isnt my thing, nor do i find it ""cool"" , but what bothers me is my self image. I always thought that i just didnt talk to the people enough and just had different friend circles, but now i feel like its me thats just weird and stupid.

Am i just really disconnected and should spend less time on fringe internet sites or are the other ones just toxic and i should be glad that i got away",04Sep2019,3

 Both my parents always have massive mood swings. For example one moment he'll be chill, and the next he tells me how he thinks I'm retarded and is a failure. When he gives me a choice and I say what's the point if he will pick it he will tell me ""No, I'm not choosing anything,"" when I go clothes shopping he will say anything I think is comfortable and everything he picks will be like a size too small for me and tell me how I always whining about my shirt being perfect even though it feels like I'm wearing a skin suit.",04Sep2019,1

684,"I'm going to try to make this as short as possible. 

Last weekend I met this girl at an optional school course I was taking. She seemed like a really amazing person, but she's just not my type in the sense that I could see myself in a relationship with her. 

Yesterday she added me on snapchat, and sent me a message saying: ""are you the Lucas from _____? If you are, then I thought you seemed like a really great person, and I'd love to get to know you better."" This is not exactly verbatim, but it's very close.

I was pretty dumbfounded, so I just said something like ""oh thanks, I thought you were too"" (or something), and then had a short conversation with her about random meaningless stuff. After that I haven't spoken to her.

So what am I supposed to do? I literally know nothing about dating. Am I supposed to go on a date with her and then politely turn her down if I don't feel any chemistry, or am I supposed to politely turn her down without going on a date? No one ever taught me anything about dating, so I'm clueless as to what I'm supposed to do, but I just don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.",04Sep2019,1

686,"What are you supposed to do when the person you built a life with just isn’t the person they used to be? My relationship isn’t what it used to be. I am constantly getting irritated at the irresponsible and stupid decisions she constantly makes. For a long time she didn’t have a job and I had to put myself in extreme debt to save us. Debt that I won’t be able to fully pay off for 10+ years if I keep only making the minimum payments because that’s all I can afford and she doesn’t make enough money to help me catch up. 

We only have sex maybe once a month because I’m just not into it. Neither one of us initiate it anymore. She used to all the time but has pretty much expected me to always be dominant and I’m not. I’m definitely more submissive when it comes to things like that so our sex lives just aren’t compatible anymore it seems. 

The thing that kills me the most is ending it and not speaking to her anymore. You can’t be friends with someone that you’ve been in a relationship with for so long because it just doesn’t work. I know how she is as a person, she can be very vindictive and once she cuts someone out of her life, she eventually can put a wall there and not care about them at all. 

I can’t imagine my life without her in it. I just wish that someone we could fix this but it’s been over three years of me waiting for her to grow up and actually care about building a life. 

We both suffer from depression so it makes it even harder. 

She will blow up for no reason and blow stuff out of proportion constantly and take it out on me. 

There’s only so many times you can fight, scream terrible things at each other, and forgive and forget. 

I don’t want to go through the heartbreak of being without her but I know that with the way things have been going, this can’t last forever and be healthy. 

I feel like I’m constantly taking care of her, tip toeing around what she wants, and letting my own mental health be ignored. 

Plus our cat is dying so I’m just really in a bad spot right now. I’m confused and I don’t know what to do or how to find the strength to cut someone out of my life that I love dearly.",04Sep2019,1

Just generally looking out for her and lending an ear while others at work treat her harshly. 

Recently she has handed in her notice to work elsewhere for more money. We've talked about hanging out after shes settled in her new job and outfit plans for the night (she knows im openly bi). I guess its in hopes i can test the water with her.

689,"-Throwaway-

I'm going to try and change some details of this story but keep the main events because I don't want anyone I know to know this is me.

So recently my dad has been blowing about about really miniscule details.

Let's introduce our characters:

Me (20f)
My sister, let's call her Jacinta (23f)
And my brother, let's call him Michael (13m)

My dad hasnt showed any signs of stress in a while, infact things seem to be going quite well for him.
All of a sudden about a week again he had a massive outburst at Jacinta at virtually nothing, her tone was neutral and she didn't say anything bad. I will admit Jacinta can be rude and unempathetic but this time she genuinely was not in the wrong.

Last night I asked Michael to borrow a shared family item and my dad said I shouldn't have, I explained that I was just home for work and only going to use it for 20 mins, my dad blew up and started saying me and Jacinta are rude and ungrateful.

Today Jacinta was asking my dad for advice and again he blew up. Jacinta made sort of a risky joke and he started throwing things and calling her ignorant. This has gone on for about and hour. Jacinta is crying and he is very angry, slamming doors and muttering, it's a horrible environment.

We have tried in the past to ask him what's wrong and how he's feeling but it makes him more mad.

Violence and theft happens in every Chicago neighborhood, even the upscale ones with lots of safety and police. 

I feel that I have taken this in stride but my SO is not handling it well.  It didn’t help that this took place about 20 minutes after my SO returned from a walk with our baby.  

I’ve tried consoling my SO but there is little that I can say.  My SO seems to be resentful that I haven’t taken an action.  

My question is what action can I take?  I can’t tote a gun around with me everywhere we go.  We can’t walk away from our lease because a crime took place.

The boss unsurprisingly and rightfully so sacked me and made a complaint to the police, however he never pressed charges and I have never been arrested/questioned/charged for the theft. I repaid a sum of money to the boss as well. 

After working for different law enforcement agencies for over 10 years I have decided I want to become a Police Officer as I feel it’s the best way I can make a positive impact in my city. Needless to say, my application has been declined due to the aforementioned situation. 

I have been told I can appeal the decision and as part of that I have decided that the only way I have a chance of getting in, is if my old boss would either withdraw the complaint or write a letter of support for my application. 

I intend on calling him and seeing if he would be willing to meet face to face to hear me out. 

This thought fills me with anxiety but I know it’s something I have to do if I stand a chance of becoming a police officer. 

The advice I need is this: What do you think I need to say/do to get him to do what I need?

I’m not a bad person but I know I did a bad thing and this was a dark part of my life, since then I have not done anything like this and have been in positions of high trust and high responsibilities and it has never crossed my mind.

699,"I have 40'000 subscribers on YouTube and I get 50+ new subscribers a day. Recently my channel got demonetized which means I don't make money with it anymore. I would have to delete all my videos (22+ million views) and start making new original ones to enable monetization. That is a lot of work and I'm just kind of done with the YouTube hustle. However, it took me a lot to get where I am today on YouTube.

My passion has always been filmmaking. I have decent experience with it but never had the right equipment.

Now, to the decision I need to make. My friend wants to buy my demonetized YouTube channel for $3000. With that money I could by all my equipment and start filming. I'm planning on doing short ads for local businesses to start making connections and earn a bit money on the side. To me it's a much more fulfilling hobby than doing YouTube.

However, YouTube holds a lot of emotional value. I feel very connected to it and am struggling to sell it for that money. I could also work on the weekends, slowly earn the $3000 and buy the equipment while still having the channel.

I'm also going to college and it starts in 2 weeks. Selling the YouTube channel would speed it up and I wouldn't have to work during weekends, I could focus on filmmaking and college. 

What's also worthy to mention is that my YouTube channel's subscriber base consists of rather right wing people since I've uploaded political ""anti extreme feminism"" compilations. I'm not proud of that, but I managed to make some money with it. It's very likely that people will unsubscribe if they see other content than those compilations.

714,Me and my friend made a video online and people in my class constantly talk me calling me by my channel name and playing my videos in class and harassing me about it and its making me have high anxiety and I don't want to tell on them because it might just increase it.

717,"My bf and I have been together going on three years.

Look he has never been the healthiest eater and he tends to consume all thats in front of him. But in the last 6 months he had put on quite a bit of weight (about 15-20lbs). I think its due to stress and his new job wearing him out too much to work out, though he's not a big go work out type person. Oh and he just quit smoking which I know can be a big factor. 

Really the weight does not bother me, I'll love him no matter what, its that he's unhealthy. Also I can tell the weight is bothering him. 

I try to buy and cook food that healthy, chicken and veggies. (We live together btw) I love to cook so thats no bother, but he'll compulsively buy junk and just eat and eat and eat. Twinkies, oven bake pizzas, ramen, ice cream, wonder bread, beer, etc etc. I have already flat out refused to buy such food, but he will go out and buy them because you know he's an adult. 

I just was wondering if anyone had advice on how to approach the subject with him (we haven't really talked about it). It's hot right now (summer in the south) but in the fall I'm going to try to get him to start walking/hiking with me.

Any advice would be much appreciated. :/",04Sep2019,11
718,"It wasn't so expensive, but I was a bit mad. I became a foster father in February, and I bring my child to the kindergarten since then, until today. Maybe we have to get up a bit earlier to get there. I'm a little sorry because it was my wife's and I forgot to lock it.

These days are a bit difficult for me. It is hard to be a dad. While I was waiting at the police station I heard a conversation. It was a girl talked about, she lost her boyfriend - he just left yesterday and since then he has not given a life signal of himself. She called the hospital, but nothing and her last hope was the police station.

After this conversation I started to think about my problem, and how small is it. I'm not rich, but with the amount of money I have I could by 2-3 similar bike, if I want. Somebody somewhere just bought his last meal with his/her last penny now, and he/she will starve soon. Somebody couldn't grow up, because of some sickness takes his/her life too soon.

After I heard this conversation, my only police officer friend walked in, and gave me contact information, so I didn't have to wait any longer.

From these hard days, this is the happiest because I just realized I have everything in my life (except the bycicle). I totally feel it, that you have to lose something to know, how much do you have.",04Sep2019,1
719,"I’ve worked at this company for about a year and 2 months and something that has always worried me and has recently come up. That is calling in sick. The process is the employee has to find their replacement if sick, which as one can imagine doesn’t work out very well. My personal experience with it is that nobody on the schedule will answer their phones (knowing someone is trying to get them to come in, understandably so) causing more stress on the sick person. Then if a replacement is not found, the sick employee must still come into work despite being sick. As of now I’m facing a potential write up for not coming in, despite the fact I’ve been throwing up all day. Is there anything I can do to combat this? The procedure doesn’t seem right to me and there must be something I can do?",04Sep2019,1

\- 21 years old

\- Trans male 

\- No GED

\- Disabled (I require a rollator to get around)

\- I have schizoid personality disorder (relevant, you'll see why on question #3)

Added those because I think they may be relevant. I have a few questions.

1. How should I dress for an interview? It'll probably be casual dress for the interview. Are jeans allowed? Boots? Polo shirts? I don't have a lot of clothes at all and only own two pairs of shoes (boots and sandals).

2. I'll be doing graveyard shift when I get a job. Any tips for adjusting?

3. How on earth do I answer the most common questions such as ""tell me about yourself"" or ""why should we hire you"" and ""what are your strengths and weaknesses""? I'm boring because of the symptoms I have. Symptoms of schizoid PD are having few interests if any (I have *none*), no social life to speak of, and anhedonia which causes me to not enjoy anything. And I don't know what my strengths and weaknesses are. I have no hobbies and there's nothing interesting about me. And I need a job for money.

722,"Evening all.

I came out of school with poor grades (I'm 21 now), and went into further education. Three quarters of the way through that, I left for my dream job. It's fantastic, except for a few things.

1: I make mistakes that are basic level. I've had the job 21 months now, should know what I'm doing, but I keep making basic mistakes. It's working with animals, so negligence can be a risk to life. I love the birds I work with, but I'm at the point where I'm wondering if I'm a hazard rather than a help.

2: Stress. From day one, I have worried constantly about losing this job. People tell me not to worry, but I can't stop. It's made me much angrier at home, I get grumpy at work and I've been a depressing bastard at work to. It's previously gotten to the point where I've been told by my boss to chin up or disciplinary action- it's a public facing job, so he has a point.

3: I'm also a massive perfectionist. I can't help it. I get angry if my car stalls, because I passed my test and should know what to do. I get angry if I don't get things right at work. 

I'm genuinely at a loss- I don't want to lose this job, but  I don't want to leave. But I also don't want to hurt the animals I work with,or get fired. I'm not sure what I can do- I'm ever so slightly autistic, but it's that mild it barely registered on the spectrum and there's no way it's entirely linked to my problems at work. It might have a small hand, but not the entire deck of cards.

Any ideas?

Thanks.",04Sep2019,1

I’m not really lonely or anything, just miss the feeling of having a steady girl around. 

It’s this cycle where I’ve been in a long period of no romantic interaction, so my standards for who I find attractive drop, but then since those have dropped I get nervous(or something else?) around the girls I *really* want to talk to, and then that hits me in the confidence and we start over again. 

There are a few pretty girls I see regularly, but I have no idea if they find me attractive. I try not to show it outwardly, but I think they sense I’m attracted to them. I’ve been outgoing before and tried to talk to girls like these but it seems like they just shut me down if I’m upfront.

I went to therapy when I was in high school and was diagnosed with BPD and GAD, my guardian wouldn’t pay for medication they insisted I take because they didn’t believe in it.

One of the girls in my group turned out to be in almost all my classes, which was nice at first but then I started to feel really stifled just by being in her presence. She would be by my side every single day and even spam me online. I actually really like her company, and have a good time whenever I go out with her, but the second I'm not with her is when I realize how drained and tired I feel as her friend.

I'm the kind of person that starts to feel drained whenever I'm around people all the time, and I've explained this to her more than once but she didn't seem to get the memo. It got to the point where I feel as though I have to actively avoid and hide in order to have some semblance of peace and quiet. I've tried limiting the actual hangouts but that just made her more annoying (for lack of a better word) online.

746,"Just curious how many people think relationships are fake? Drama fested, controling, manipulative, jealousy, selfish acts towards what we think we desire.  
I look at people in relationships and think not again. Living life for someone else or for me, I will choose me. The things people are capable of to live a fantacy. I do not think it is worth it. 
People think they are madly in love, when it is infatuation. Then when reality comes to play,  and blame it on the person changed. The change came at the beginning to try to impress the person, instead of being who you really are.
Then its easier to stay in the relationship then to leave and make each other misserable. 
I believe people should be who they are all the time. There is a respect of circumstances to control around others, but we should be completely honest within ourselves all the time. Be free to be an individual. We should all have compersion towards each other in everything. Our own self-doubts, low self-esteem, ruins others, we blame others instead of dealing with our own fears within and changing. When was the last time you got hurt feelings and looked within yourself to find the answer of why you got hurt. We allow so many others to control us in so many ways. If I do not like what someone thinks about me, I look within to understand why their words/actions are bother some to me. Then I learn from it and choose how I am going to deal with it. 
I just see people looking to others to make them happy, and this is why I do not believe relationships are real but, fake, a lie people choose to believe that leads to pain within their hearts. I do not want to live like that anymore, refuse to, I want to be who I really  am, be free and let others be who they really are, accept others, without judgement.

Last night we were discussing people who ask others to wash their hands before holding the baby. He seems to think it's rude and unnecessary. I have a lot of family members who smoke cigarettes. So I believe it is okay to ask people to wash their hands due to leftover nicotine on their fingers and hands. Is this something that is wrong to ask my family and friends to do?

Around the end of July she had messaged me, after no contact for a month, Asking for help. I was aggravated but I was there for her. She explained to me that her ex has a tracking app on her phone, and has hit her for most of their relationship. She was only able to tell me this because she was in another state with family, so he couldn’t watch her every move.
A few days go by and she stops replying to me, so I get nervous and call her step mother. Step mother explains to me that she’s in rehab and asks me some questions about her ex. I tell her everything I know and she’s shocked at the information, as anyone would be. 
So fast forward a week or so and my friend calls me from rehab and tells me EVERYTHING thats been going on. She broke up with him the day she went into rehab and he followed the Van that picked her up from her house, to the rehab center and tried to see her immediately. They told him to go away and that visitation wasn’t for patients in detox. She gets out of detox and he shows up AGAIN to see her and she tells them he’s abusive and she doesn’t want to see him, so they tell him if he shows up again he will be arrested. Should be the end of it right? No.
He’s posted about her on his social media accounts saying how he can’t wait for her to get out and how lucky he is to have her, yet they broke up. He’s also posted on Reddit multiple times asking for help with his “druggie gf.”
She’s getting a restraining order and it should go through today, but I’m wondering if there is a way I can get him to stop making up lies about her/posting about her all the time as it makes her extremely uncomfortable and anxious that people are going to think she’s just a druggy who broke up with her boyfriend.

After we finished the program, she messaged me on Facebook asking if she could borrow $20 to buy books for her new course in uni. I was in no position to help her because I had no job, I was a 17 year old about to go into uni myself and I only had about $150 in the bank and I still had to buy my own books too so I said no. 

We didn't talk again until this June when she messaged me again asking to borrow $20. By now I had found a job and I felt guilty about not being able to help her back then so I lent her the money. She told me she would pay me back by the end of the month when she got her paycheck. 

Halfway through the month of July I had to pay bills and that was when I realized she never paid me back. I messaged her again and she apologized, saying she accidentally misspelled my email and that she will send the etransfer by the end of the week.

It's September now, and I am very irritated. I've seen on her profile that she went to Las Vegas and she's been watching movies in ""Luxury Theaters"" and has been having the time of her life. I've messaged her again asking what happened but she's left me on read. 

Honestly, I don't care about the $20 anymore. I'm just really peeved about how she acted as though she was in great need for financial help that she was willing to hit up random acquaintances on Facebook but she was able to go to luxury theaters. How should I deal with her?

751,"About 3 weeks ago, my cat escaped from my home. He ran out the door one evening and someone found him either the same night or following afternoon. Luckily, the cat is chipped so the people who found him were able to contact me with his whereabouts. Upon picking him up from their home, I casually mentioned that I was looking to rehome him due to my new living situation and the couple that had now found him were very enthusiastic about adopting him. He was gone just one night and they had already bought all sorts of necessities and toys for him. They mentioned they had recently had a pet death and expressed that they were already so attached to him. They seemed like good people and were going to treat him well, so I thought okay, perhaps this is a great home for him. I handed over vet records and other ownership documents and the deal was done. This past weekend, they reached out to me to say that it turns out the wife is allergic and are implying that they would like to return the cat. My stance on this is that I rehomed him and that it shouldn’t be my responsibility to take him back in, especially after they were so adamant and enthusiastic about having a new cat. I know it may sound cruel for this practically unwanted cat, but I’m truly in no position to take him back in. It’s why I was looking to rehome him in the first place. I’m also confused why a person in their late 20’s would be totally unaware that they’re allergic to cats and the fact that it took several weeks for her to realize this? I’m not an allergist or healthcare professional, but the whole rhetoric just sounds odd to me. Am I wrong or cruel for feeling this way? What is the most responsible approach I should take to this?

755,Hey dudes! It's been three years of pretty sweet bliss between my partner and I. Like my previous thread mentions I've been working on my jealousy. Now I feel a distance between my boyfriend and I. Nothing detrimental to our relationship but noticeable. I want to do the right thing and let him have space if he needs it. Do you have any advice on how to stay balanced in this situation? Thanks yo.,04Sep2019,1

757,"So I host a Minecraft for me and my friends. When I logged on today the entrance to my garden was blown up by a creeper. How my house was built was that I had no doors, it simply did not fit with the style of my house, and the entrance for the garden would protect me anyways. The gate was no problem, it was just like 6 blocks. But when I went inside to get materials to repair it, a creeper followed me into my house and blew up my ENTIRE storage system, so I needed to be quick. I knew that the items would disappear in five minutes. I thought I got everything but my diamonds, of all things my diamonds was stuck I a place where I could not get to them, and they despawned. So now I have two options. 1. I can prank them so hard that they regret they even knew about the server in the first place, but the rules on the server is so that I can’t grief, kill, or steal from them. So I’m gonna need some suggestions. 2. I can cheat the diamonds back with commands since I am the server host.

What should I do?",04Sep2019,4

762,"To avoid having this become too long, here is a condensed background. I was in an abusive relationship (he is now in prison where he belongs) and am a single mom. I have a degree (BS in Recreation Administration), but I got into this mess during my education and I was not able to develop myself professionally during my college career and now I feel like my degree is no loner relevant. My working background is largely barista/bartender/server with minimal clerical experience. I am currently taking a few classes at the local community college to get an AA in Public Administration/Civil Service while working a couple days a week at a cafe (for income and the free food) and also doing a lot of therapy. I have never really taken a ""break"" since all this happened and this is my way of taking some down time until I feel strong enough to work full time. I worked really hard through my internship to graduate and went right into working two jobs without ever taking time to heal and recover.

I would like to work for the city or the county where I live in public administration and am trying to get my foot in the door by becoming an office assistant. The jobs are competitive and I lack office/clerical experience so my confidence is low. I've never worked in an office but I know I am more than capable. What are some things I should be doing during this time in order to develop my skills and my resume? How do I get employers to take a second look at me without any real experience in that field? Everything is online now days and I feel like I look terrible on paper but in person I know I come across as qualified and capable.

Any advice on how to build myself up would be appreciated. I've come out of some pretty awful shit and I keep hoping it is going to get easier, and it's not. I'm not trying to make a lot of money, but I want a professional career that can pay the bills, give us good benefits and something my child can be proud of me for. My greatest stressor is getting a stable job for us, even though I can't do it right now, I want to know how to do it in a year when I feel healthy again.

After college I stopped talking to all the people who considered me as friends because they were never friend to me for the way they treated me or how I perceived it or it could be just because of my emotional disconnection and for next 2 years I spent all my time alone inside my room I only talk to Mom barely but I started earning in home itself using my online skills and I earned lot of many every month and I bought everything that I always wanted to buy from my childhood in a hope finally it'll make me happy and feel satisfied but no, The more I buy the more empty I felt and I almost lost interest in everything and nothing excites me anymore as the time goes I got depressed and more depressed and I can only see regrets of how I could have take action and made my college and school life beautiful,all the missed opportunity and after lot of struggle I got out of the depression and changed myself a bit better but still I am feeling like I am not enjoying my life or using my opportunity maybe due to my lack in social skills people of my age or way ahead of me and have lot of experience and here is me who have never dated and don't even know(but atleast now I can talk to girl if I am not attracted to her) I am 25 now I don't think its too late to change - but I don't know how😕",04Sep2019,0
765,"for the most part I’m an easy person to get along with. i keep my work life separate from my private life and don’t really get involved with other people and their problems. its not that i avoid confrontation, i just try to prevent it.

i recently stared a new job. the type of job that gives us a base pay and a bit of commission based on how much merchandise we sell.
i quickly learned that instead of trying to compete for commission we make things even by just giving credit evenly. that was nice.

commission in itself isn’t a huge deal though. i make enough money in my normal pay to be content with. but it does bother me when i notice other people being kind of.. greedy with it.

which i observed. we are not hands on with customers. most customers don’t even need help. they just buy what they buy and go.  i had been working with my boss on maintaining the store after our shipment came in. i wasn’t at the counter. (I’m still in training) 

i had been there as long as my boss. a sales ass came in a little later. few hours later i finally go back to checking customers out and realize the ass had been taking credit for everything, racking up her commission. i didn’t catch up, but before i left i kind of took over the reg. and caught myself up a bit. i never complained but; it didn’t bode well with me. and it made me look at this person in a new light. she’s not the only one. 

there’s another person with my job title. we worked one shift together and she had.. nothing really positive to say to me. i rushed around that shift a lot and it seemed all she did was talk. i felt like i had to do their share of the work honestly. i still didn’t complain. every time the store was empty i would sit down for a few minutes. my feet have been killing me , i haven’t even gotten a single paycheck yet and i got some temporary shoes to hold me off thankfully, but they’re still already pretty worn out because they were cheap. ive been told it’s okay to sit down when we are empty. my coworker still complained about me for it. i got a lecture from my boss about how she needed to be able to ‘trust me’ but I also noticed my coworker also went out of her way to give herself an extra few hundred in commissions everyday despite not doing any extra work. so it was ironic she claimed she needed to be able to trust me. i still havent complained.

there are more coworkers but honestly they’re sweethearts. i admire their work ethic. my coworker (the manager) I’ve tried getting to know but she consistently shrugs me off and gives me this vibe she just thinks she’s better than me. she speaks to everyone but me. she’s very condescending, and complains about me.
so far ive just took it but I’m having issues. it’s stressing me out and it makes me not want to go to work. i have a shift all day with them both tomorrow and im really not looking forward to it.  i don’t want to complain about them to my boss but i don’t really know what i should do.
i just want to feel comfortable going to work. but  it’s hard to relax around people who seem so shady.  my boss will always take my coworkers word for it. and I’ve never said much to the contrary of her complains. but at the same time she’s been kind of a bitch.",04Sep2019,1

768,"CONTEXT: This post was originally removed from r/amitheasshole for content about suicidal thoughts. I posted it here to see if I can get some answers about this.

I have been depressed for god knows how long. I've felt that my life has not been worth living and that I should just end it, and this has led me to falling out of friendgroups, starting to slit my wrists, and becoming more useless over time. This reached a catalyst in May or June of this year when my suicidal thoughts had reached an all time high. Knowing this was a problem, I reached out to everyone I could trust, and while they expressed concern for me, they knew that they couldn't help me. I don't blame them for not trying any harder, because they did try hard. They tried to get me to see a professional, but they couldn't help me beyond that. One of the most supportive people in this whole situation is one of my closest friends, lets just call him Brad. Brad was the first person I told about my suicidal thoughts, far before anyone else, and even before it got really bad. But he was just a dumb kid, like the rest of us, and thus couldn't help me physically. Still, I thank him immensely. Brad also has a sister, who I'm gonna Emily. Emily and I have a rocky past, as a result of peer pressure from my friends, I asked her out, to which she totally ghosted me. This happened in about February of this year, and I could say that that was the real start of my depression getting worse. I don't blame her for it, and I can take a rejection, but basically saying that I'm not even worth responding to hurt. nonetheless, Brad and a couple other of my friends told me to go to her if I really wanted to talk to someone about my suicidal thoughts. After trying to make contact with her several times, even getting Brad to confront her, she yet again, ignored me. This hurt me immensely. I couldn't think of anything else all summer vacation. Fast forward to today. Me and Brad were walking home from school, and Emily was tagging along. While we were going our separate ways, I told her to go fuck herself without any context. I'm conflicted about this, on one hand she seriously let me down. I used to have a lot of respect for her, she was smart, funny, and sincere. I lost that respect when she ignored me, because it showed to me that she didn't care if I lived or died, and when someone you respect expresses that it hurts like a motherfucker. On the other hand, I don't know what's going on in her life, maybe she's going through shit of her own, and I just don't know about it. Maybe she isn't ready to talk with another person about it. AITA?",04Sep2019,1
769,"Lately I’ve been feeling completely disconnected from reality.  It feels like nothing is real, and my brain feels all foggy.  I’ve lost a lot of motivation, and even have developed distaste for activities I used to enjoy.  Jokes don’t seem as funny to me anymore; honestly, nothing invokes the same emotional response it used to.   Even when intimate with my girlfriend I find myself completely unaroused no matter what.  
I feel shaky a lot and my blood pressure is a little on the higher side.  My school work used to be a top priority as well, but now I just don’t seem to care about it or the future really.

I’ve never had any sort of problems like this before.  It started about a week ago when one of my closest friends tried to take his life.  I was there in his house just minutes after I got a good bye text from him frantically trying to get into the locked door he was behind.  Even though he ended up stopping and not taking his life, it really shook me up and I don’t seem to be able to return back to normal since.

Now, he's withdrawal rather than reserved, answering in grunts and generally being unresponsive. He seems disinterested in school work, has completely stopped doing art and spends all of his free time on the computer. He's also become lazy, sulking when he has to help around the house (much like our father), and has become quite rude; going as far as to spout racist and homophobic stuff. At first we thought it was hormones, then because he was bullied at school, but he's only getting worse. We come from a loving and supportive family: my parents have always supported our hobbies, passions and any side project us kids come across. They've showered us with love, time and attention. Our mother is one of the kindest people I know, and helped my brother through his GCSEs so much that she was basically doing the exam herself. He's so different now and I'm really worried for him. He seems to think he'll get whatever he wants without the work. My brother and I are constantly butting heads because of how rude he has become.

Personally, I am indifferent, and one of the other three doesn't care too much either but has a preference. The other problem is that my best friend has started to drift apart from those three, which gives her more reason to not want to be with them(and therefore with others).

The 6th friend I haven't mentioned is on vacation and is coming back on Friday. They are unable to reach their phone so we'll decide where we all sit based off of them. If they agree with the three friends, we will all(probably) sit there. If they decide to go with my best friend, they would both sit there.

I am seriously conflicted with what to do. If I go with my best friend and the other one, I won't be able to sit with the others. If I sit with the other three, I won't see the other two for most of the day.

776,"Hey, sorry for how long this is.

When my Sister was around 25 she had a kid with a guy then immediately got into a very long, drawn-out divorce which ended up costing her lots of money and debt in lawyer fees. She'll be making payments on that debt for the foreseeable future.  She works  full time but is making around minimum wage (It's at a day-care where she also takes her son).

None of the above is necessarily her fault but here's the thing that bugs me: During the whole time she was going through this divorce(6 years) she has been living with my parents and has been paying them nothing. More than that she has been mooching off of them to the extreme. Paying no rent, eating their food, driving the best car they have (their other car is constantly breaking down) and effectively taking over half the house including the kitchen as her own area. Oh and for the last few years her new boyfriend is also living there.

Again I could almost look past this if she helped out or was nice to them, but in addition to this behavior she has always been very unpleasant to be around, particularly to my parents. She verbally abuses them, trashes the house, lies, physically threatens them when she's mad and is just all around very stressful to be around. 

My Dad has taken to isolating himself from her and half the house while my mom is essentially an enabler who bows to her every command. They tell me the reason they put up with this is because they ""Can't just kick their daughter out on the street with so much debt and burden."" and they ""can't kick out their grandson"".

My parents both work full time but, again are making minimum wage and are barely getting by. They fortunately own their own home but it is being taken over by my sister. Oh and they also have taken out a few loans to help her pay for some of the divorce stuff.

On the up side, my sister seems to be a good mother.

I'm quite certain that she is about to pop out another kid with her current boyfriend, adding to the hardship my parents are dealing with.

MY QUESTION:

Knowing that my sister has a short temper and will likely never talk to me again(we've never been very close anyways due to her instability) :

Should I tell her to stop treating my parents like crap? Ask her to pay a little rent? Find her own place?

or should I just let my parents deal with the mess they've allowed to happen? Or what, if anything should I do?",04Sep2019,2

781,"I'm female, almost 21, working, not studying or anything like that. When I was younger, I had friends. The kind of friends that never really invited me to stuff because they wanted to, but because I was just there and it would be rude to talk about it all with me when I'm not even invited to for example, a birthday party.

I did have two really, really good friends, but one got bored with me and the other one decided to basically stab me in the back when I was in a really bad place. Everyone else got bored of me in the end, too, basically. Now I chat with strangers online sometimes and I have one real friend, that I meet with once or twice a month, but chat constantly over the phone. I like her, she likes me, she even says I'm her best friend. And don't get me wrong, I'm totally one with not meeting everyday etc.

Anyway, to the point. So I don't have friends. Coworkers, yes, but we're just saying hello to each other and have a polite small talk. I don't have their numbers, I'm not friends with them on Facebook. And I'm fine with that.

I like being mostly by myself, I am not comfortable around other people. Even with my family. I like staying in doors, calmly doing my stuff and sometimes chatting with strangers over the internet when I decide I am too lonely. So. 

So I'm a lone girl. But I also know that's weird and that people don't understand how I can be fine with being alone and not having friends. Not once I was told I was a freak because I'm alone most of the time and don't go out, like at all. 

My friend thinks I do have other friends than her, because I've been making up stories and scenarios and telling them to her. I avoid lying as much as possible, but when she asks what I've been doing recently etc, I'm telling her made up stuff.

I don't want her to think I'm weird or smth. I don't want her to leave me like everyone else I thought was my friend in the past. But lately I've been feeling really bad and guilty whenever we talk and I lie to her. I am torn between telling her the truth or keep faking, too afraid she will be really mad at me for lying and then leaving. What should I do?

We talk a bit more as she gets back, lots of laughing and we walked to her car and she eventually asked for my number. 

Tuesday she comes in and sits right next to me and ran her hand over the exact spot again and was all glowing and smiling at me and talkative. 

Now, Normally I know what this means, but she is getting married soon, I am so lost and confused here. This girl is absolutely beautiful too and personality wise right up my alley, but I cannot breach her “commitment.”

791,"So as the title states, I asked a coworker to hang out. I’ve been mega depressed, making attempts to make friends, and I’ve known him for 1.5 years now, and we’ve always gotten along well, we talk to each other with ease, etc., so I thought I’d give it a shot. He said ‘I’d totally be interested in that’, ‘definitely want to’, so I suggested an activity, he agreed, then... silence.

The fun part is, I still have to work with him. He’s cordial enough in person but the awkwardness is definitely real. He definitely doesn’t engage me in conversation like before, just a ‘hello, how’s it going’ and moves on.

So... do I.. confront him? Or just shut my mouth and pretend like nothing was ever talked about? Was I stupid for even asking in the first place?",04Sep2019,2
792,"Hi guys! So there’s a trip I want to take this year but I am not sure I will raise enough money to cover the cost and another persons cost. I want to raise money but I’m not sure how. I paint a lot and have painted on shoes and pants and stuff like that, and I’d like to do that to get money, but I’m not sure how I would go about it. Any advice or other methods?",04Sep2019,1
793,"So if I am good at anything, I'd say I'm good at being analytical. My intelligence would be the one thing I'd be confident in being exceptional, and I have good evidence to support this (but would rather not go into this).

Anyway I find that I basically never trust my gut or intuition in life. I feel like I just rely on my thinking mode opposed to feeling (think Jung, but NOT MBTI).

It's just that my gut tells me some things that logically are unlikely, so it's this weird dichotomy - I don't know who to trust.

So I'm sort of stuck right now in this uncertain state, where I'm not quite sure of my true reality and future, and it's honestly quite frustrating. It's like I'm kinda expecting certain things to happen but I can't be sure at all that they'll come, and life is doing nothing for me to help settle this uncertainty. I'm not trying to blame ""life"" or some sort of higher power, ultimately I want to sort this out myself and find some sort of peace, but I feel like my usual way of figuring this out - which would be sort of testing out my gut feelings over the next few years and seeing if I get any results I can look at analytically and be sure that it holds some honest truth - is just going to be a long and tiring endeavor when really I kind of need some sort of relief now.

Idk man, I'm withdrawing from cigarettes too (on day 7) so that's probably exacerbating it because I have kind of just accepted that I won't know the ""truth"" for a while or ever, but right now I sort of need something because idk how I'm going to get through these withdrawals right now. Man I've whined so much about these withdrawals man, it's literally the worst tho, I try not to be like this usually but this is a bit too much tbh.",04Sep2019,1
794,"So I currently have my learners permit for a long time and so I said to my dad “when am I going to take behind the wheel test?” my dad just straight up said “you’re too young I called the driving instructor and he also said your too young” when I heard those words I didn’t talk to my dad at all because people in my grade and my age have their driving license and a car meanwhile I’m walking my ass to school. People on Snapchat flexing their car or license it’s just literally pissing me off that I can’t get my drivers license. Any advice? I could ask to take behind the wheel for my birthday which is on the beginning on October. And I don’t really want a expensive car because my dad can’t afford it I just want a cheap car. And sometimes the weather is so bad one time it was raining so hard I forgot my umbrella and my clothes, backpack and body got wet and there was lighting and thunder too and I had to run home too

796,"My mother has been gas lighting me for my whole life and it’s really been making me question  my sanity. Turns out she’s been gas lighting me. My mother has lime with severe anxiety problems. The thing is she gas lights me and then forgets she did it because of her lime. And uses her lime disease as an excuse. Just to get this out there, I do not have lime. I have taken many tests and all came out as negative for lime. Being constantly lied to and always having my father side with my mother has made me suicidal. I bought a bottle of sleeping pills and maybe find the courage to get out of this never ending nightmare.",04Sep2019,2
797,"I (female, 38) started a new job a couple of months ago. During a couple of coffee breaks and farewell events for colleagues I've been talking with a few of my coworkers. There is specially one that is very talkative and friendly, he quickly dropped that he recently broke up with his girlfriend and feels alone, and is looking for friends and rebuild his social life. I didn't mind to chat a bit because I'd like to get along with my new colleagues and integrate. This guy (36) is an accountant to whom I have to pass some work every once in a while. A few weeks ago I went to the accountancy office for giving them work and he asked how I was integrating in the new city, etc. The girl accountant that shares office with the guy (and also happens to be new in the city) was also there and joined the conversation, and the guy suggested that the girl accountant, him and me (and maybe other colleagues) could go for a drink sometime. I said yes, we could do it sometime. It's been a while since that and yesterday when I went to their office I said that maybe we could all go for an after-work coffee before the summer ends. The guy quickly proposed to go this week, and when I said yes and asked him to tell the girl accountant, he said she's on vacation and doesn't know when she will be back....and ""see you on Thursday"". I was caught off guard and didn't know what to say without making too obvious that I don't want to hang out with him alone. 

Am I being a paranoid if I don't like this situation and feel like I've been locked up? I don't mind to go out in group with my colleagues but definitely feel uncomfortable if it's only a guy and when he's intentionally not waiting for the girl that was supposed to come too. I'm feeling bad because my new office seems to be a place for gossip and weird social dynamics...I'm scared that things could turn weird with this guy and make my days at the office difficult, and don't know what to do. 

So what do you think? I've had in the past a string of bad experiences at work, including sexual harassment, and mobbing and all kinds of ugly things. This is not my best emotional moment starting alone in a new city and a new office which happened to be a not-so-friendly place, so I wonder if my judgement is clouded.",04Sep2019,1

801,"Okay, so we live in central Massachusetts. We have a pop-up Intex pool. My dad (50M) and I (16M) usually put up the pool in late May (Memorial Day), and sometimes early June, but it’s too cold for swimming until mid June. We usually are done using it the week of Labor Day (this week) or the week after. Then we drain it in late September.

This year the pool had a tear near the bottom. But instead of buying a new pool to replace our 5 year old pool, going into its’ 6th season, he patches it. Last week we noticed the water going down, and we’ve been looking for a hole ever since. It rained like hell on Monday but the pool is still probably down 6 inches from normal. He wants to drain it. Every year I protest until it’s too cold to even swim in anymore. This year the water is already cold and we have maybe one more weekend left of it. Should I just let him pull the plug?

803,"So I [F22] constantly am having discussions with my bf [M27] about my less than stellar driving skills. I am not denying that I sometimes don’t pay as close attention as I should, (I’ve only been in one serious accident 2 years ago) but every time we get in the car he picks apart everything I’m not doing right. I agree, and honestly tell him that I’m trying to do better. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I’m was attempting to park my Ford Focus hatchback on campus in a tight parking garage and got a little too close to the car beside me. After making sure the other car was not affected, it wasn’t, (I made sure there was no damage done to the car beside me, if there was I would have left my number and insurance) I found another parking spot and assessed the damage. There were some paint markings that I was able to remove with toothpaste, but now there is a fairly noticeable dent on my back right tire cover. 

My question is: do I confront my boyfriend, tell him what happened, and then receive a lecture to prove his point or do I go to the body shop, fix said dent and hope he doesn’t notice between now and then.",04Sep2019,1

805,"I'm not saying I'm depressed or have anything wrong with me because I'm most likely fine, I just want to know if it's normal to not really feel anything 99% of the time. I started noticing when I would be the only person not stressing out about GCSEs, not because I wasn't worried, because I was, but because I didn't really feel it. Then I looked around me, and saw how excited people got about going away on holiday, or going to a theme park and stuff like that, which doesn't even get a reaction out of me, like I never feel excited really. Like I'm not saying I don't feel anything, like I can feel sad, and I've had a girlfriend for like a year and a half and I definitely love her, but I only actually FEEL it occasionally, whereas she seems to always feel it. I really noticed it when I first tried drugs (I don't need lectures please) and I felt really happy, except I had an actual feeling in my body rather than just knowing that I'm happy. It usually just feels like I know I'm feeling something rather than actually feeling it, and I don't know if that's normal. I am on the spectrum with ADD, But i don't think that would have anything to do with emotions? Any help is appreciated, I have no idea what's going on haha

807,"    At my school I feel I am typically one of the first people who speaks to “the new kid” whenever there is a new student. This has given me a friendly reputation and many positive friendships. However, it has also made me friends with people I feel will have a negative influence on me and many attention seeking people. There are two people in specific I would like to distance myself  from without being rude but don’t know how? 

Person A - This person I sit at a lunch table with and feel has a negative influence on me. I am uninterested in nearly every conversation they start and want to move to another lunch table (that doesn’t have any available seats) without being rude. 

Person B - This person doesn’t go to my school anymore but I still run into quite often. They constantly message and try to call me. I am mostly uninterested in our conversations in which sometimes can last for hours, and have a hard time ending them without being rude.

808,"I work for a large corporation and have very reluctantly had to join my departments’ “employee engagement team” after my manager insisting several times I join this team. I am really, really not into that kind of stuff but my manager pushed me to do it and I thought that if I join and put a little bit of effort into that aspect or Corporate Life, doing smaller things (emails, meetings etc) then that should be enough for the extracurricular bit of my job and would get my manager to lay off that subject with me. I’ve been forced into organising the Christmas party and am not looking forward to it in the slightest. I am not a huge party person and don’t drink much at all, especially with work parties/outings–I don’t like or care to mix parties and work. I prefer doing that with my actual friend group. I’ve never even organised a party in my personal life, always found it too stressful.

810,"A little back story to explain my situation.
I live with my grandad who is constantly having issues with money, Me and my siblings usually get the blame for it even though we're usually out working. We've tried giving him advice on how he could save money but it usually falls on death ears. I even offered to pay him £100 a month a few years back but after.a few months he told me to stop saying it wasn't fair only I was paying it. But the biggest issue seems to be electricity, according to him. Again we're out most of the time. It's got to the point we're I'm only getting a few hours sleep each night in order to wake up early and steathily wash my clothes for the day. I work with children and hygiene is one of the most important things for my job, to the point I risk losing it. Which is giving me all sorts of panic attacks. To give an example of how different the two of us are when it comes to hygiene. Our washing machine broke recently and my Grandad said he wasn't going to buy one cause he never used it so I had to buy one. The other issue Is I only get between £500 to £600 a month (Apprenticeship wage). And some of that has to go to paying some things off as well as paying for food for myself and my brother who is having trouble finding work and stuff for cleaning around the house. So I'm usually only left with about £200 at the end of each month. We've considered moving into a house with our dad with the plan of splitting rent and bills between us but because we're all adults we usually get turned away. At the end of the day I want to pay him to just shut up so I can stop being stressed about not having clean clothes, or being able to shower properly.",04Sep2019,1

838,"I've been a coach for quite some time and have coached many people in my career; however, this situation is a first.

A person I really care for has a few bad issues. We're a circle of a few people and we all have the same issues with that one friend. None of us would confront them and we just try to avoid them or roll with them. This friend, X, has multiple issues that I'll list down below and I'd definitely love to receive some advice about how to approach them as they're all sensitive matters. The reason I decided to approach them is that I care too much about X but these issues are just outweighing the good in them.

Issues are:

1. Too whiny. 
2. Too much gossip and can't their mouth shut.
3. Extremely nosy. (They just jump in whatever conversation whether X is involved or not and tries to circulate the conversation around themselves).
4. They smell extremely bad.

Now I know for a fact that the last one is a VERY sensitive topic and has to be approached differently which is why I'm seeking advice. Do I just confront them? and if I do, X is very fragile and could take them to the extreme and totally stop. (Like the boy who cried wolf. 9/10 times X's complaints are very childish or unimportant \[coffee just fell, nails aren't polished well etc.\] while the 10th could actually be worth complaining about and seeking advice). That's the main reason why I have to deliver it the best way.

839,"Essentially, I had a 3.71 GPA in the previous college with 48 credits then transferred but failed a 4 credit class in my first semester and instead of taking a W (dropping the class) I decided to not do so, since I have a very limited amount of times I can drop, and since I knew I could take it in summer and at least get a C. However, due to transcript issues and validations, I was not allowed to take that class during summer so now my GPA in this new college is 2.71 (A in core computer class, B in rest and the D from the failed course)

Now is a prime time where companies come to my college and recruit people and I've been asked to send my resume to some possible opportunities, but they've stated they have a requirement of at least 3.00GPA.

Should I still apply and submit my gpa saying I have a 2.71 for just 17 credits in the current college but 3.71 for 48 credits in the previous college. (Both having core classes to my current major).",04Sep2019,1
840,"I've posted a couple of times here about my mom, and how she is. I have decided to write a letter to her. I would like to know if you have any tips, or corrections for my letter. I pasted it below:

&amp;#x200B;

**I’ve been wanting to say this for a while, and I am doing my best to be as nice as possible about it. I hope that you can learn from this, and help yourself:** 

**Maybe you don’t see what you’re doing is harmful, but it is. Nearly every day, you get upset, or irritated, or angry with me or dad. To me, a lot of your behavior is unjustified. Sometimes I don’t understand what is wrong, but I’m too afraid to ask. I feel like you take your anger out on us for no reason. I just don’t get why you have to be mean to me when something in your life goes wrong. Another thing is that you get angry and are rude to me at small things. Your attitude and behavior make me upset, too. It makes me angry, and upset, and It makes me not want to be around you. I feel like it's been happening more and more lately. Especially when you say things like “Lose your attitude” and “what's your problem”. Those make me more upset and angry, because you are the reason for my anger a lot of the time. I know that I am not the best at handling my anger, especially when it is directed at someone, and I am trying to fix that. I try to be a positive person, but when you are behaving like that towards me or dad, it really ruins my day.  I also do not like it when you tell us to “shut up”. I know that if dad or I said that to you, you would be furious. If we did any of the things you do, you would be. I am asking you;  please stop. I also want you to know that sometimes, you are being a hypocrite. On my birthday, I was upset, and you told me to “shut up” and that you “didn't care if it was my birthday”. On YOUR birthday, you complained to me how you just wanted a nice day, and you wanted us to appreciate you, etc. That upset me because of the way you acted on MY birthday. I found it ironic. A lot of the time, your actions upset me, and dad. I do not like negativity, you know that, and you’re bringing a lot of it into my life. This is why I sometimes don’t talk, and I keep my head down, and I also listen to music a lot, with my headphones. It’s because I don’t feel comfortable. Even talking about it, (in this case typing) makes me upset. Every time you’re wrong about something, you tell me to shut up, or go away, and I don't appreciate that. I don't appreciate any of this stuff. I don’t want to fight with you, so I try to stay calm a lot of the time, but sometimes, it's honestly really hard. I’m afraid to stand up for myself because I don’t want you to get angrier. Even if I want to say “I don’t appreciate how you’re talking to me”, I can’t make myself say it. Even writing this letter, I’m afraid that you're only going to be mad and you're not going to change. I hate confrontation. I spoke to some friends, and they suggested that we should go to family therapy, or just a therapist in general, so that we can have professional help, and learn to coexist.** **I love you, but I can not let you speak to me like this anymore.**",04Sep2019,1

846,"Hyperbole, of course (I think), but my list of things I fear is so long that I'm beginning to feel overwhelmed. These are the things I fear most / panic to:

Wide open, featureless spaces
Heights
Isolation
Being alone
Conflict
The dark
The unknown / unexplainable
Deep water
Sharks
Being pursued
Being alone in public
Tight spaces / immobility
Getting lost in space
Large objects / creatures

Much of this has followed me from childhood into adulthood, but some of it has appeared relatively recently, such as my fear of sharks. They all negatively affect my life in different ways. The thing is, as soon as I'm alone my mind begins distorting domestic home sounds into crazy scary monster sounds and I jump, literally, at my own shadow / reflection. In fact, if I'm alone in my house and it's dark out, the longer I stare at the blackened windows the more panic builds until either I have an attack or I begin to cry and feel helpless. The longer I think about sharks, the same. I can hardly play the games I love without a suppressed terror of falling into some dark pool full of virtual sharks. The feeling helpless response comes attached with a lot of nostalgia and hopeless terror which I trace back to my childhood, though.

I used to have a thing called ""Nightmare Disorder,"" which had me waking up every single night from the age of two to ten-eleven, when the nightmares began tapering off. The subject of my nightmares was always being stuck apart from my family, my mom abandoning us, my family dying tragically at the claws of wild animals or monsters / specters, faceless beasts chasing me through wide fields, and more. I was never soothed after awakening, instead I was scared via threat of punishment into staying in bed and waiting for my panic to exhaust me back to sleep, as my parents hated dealing with the issue.

As I've been reintroducing myself to my unaddressed and long neglected emotional problems, I've been finding my fears getting worse. My theory is that, emotionally, I never developed past that childlike state of uncertainty when you're a kid and the world just seems so vast and frightening. The constant neglect and isolation in my family home developed in me a deep fear of losing my parents forever and being eternally alone, and the generalized insecurity that has resulted I'm afraid may be leading to a gradual collection of ""phobias."" So now I'm wondering how one overcomes insecurity. How do you get beyond uncertainty about your state on Earth, in life, and come to just *be*? Where does a ""sense of security"" come from, or where do you find yours?

I've supposed in the past that one develops a sense of security from attaching in a trusted and loving family / community, but having already grown up without that, what can be done? I can't leave my house, don't trust anyone, can't clean or operate until my husband gets home, can't think clearly at all and end up while-ing away my time distracting myself from the terror I constantly experience. Do any of you who maybe don't share these experiences now, but may have in the past, recollect how you overcame or were helped to overcome your fears?

Or, perhaps you have children and can tell me, as an adult, why children ought not to fear the things they do? Or how you instruct your children in dealing with their insecurity?

The scientist in me is more interested in personal stories than straight advice, but any attempts to help are welcome. I'm just trying to think about the issue and where to go next.

*TL;DR: I seem to have developed an overall insecurity in life stemming from childhood neglect. Can any relatively secure person tell me about their childhood / otherwise experiences or thoughts on overcoming insecurity?*",04Sep2019,1
847,"Sister was diagnosed with social disabilities at a young age (probably 8-10 years old, back then it was ""somewhere on the spectrum"" and ""depressed"" etc.

She is taking anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, amphetamines as needed (5mg for focus) and has not had a med change in a long time. After hospital visit, no evidence of meds being abused etc. 

In terms of the situation, all my mother asked her to do was ""clean her room"" as it is often a mess (typical of executive functioning disorders). Mom got in threw window after my sister locked her out. 

Typically, as a trusted brother and twin, I end up comforting her after these situations unfold (again, much milder tantrums) but in the case, it seems she never realizes the severity of her outbursts and how it affects my mother now in her 60's looking to retire and the rest of the family.

850,"Vegue so aquantences don't figure this out, I know people involved will know but will delete later, hoping people involved dont find this obvi. Typing weird, I am an english speaker, sorry for typing so weird.


boyfriend got a new job a few months back, and they gave his old job to a kid my age (bf 25, me 22, kid 22) and he trained the kid with his last 2 weeks there.

The kid moved here from far away, and didn't have anywhere to stay. My boyfriend talked to me and our roommate, I agreed bc he said it was two nights, max of 5.

 Roommate disagreed bc it was a stranger (i want to agree with my boyfriend on things often, the kid had an intensive background check, we knew his work ect ect figured it was okay)

Kid had dinner with us, got a call from his brother, mentioned not having anywhere to stay, roommate's heart grew 3 times that day and said he could stay instead.

Roommate was going away after 1 week for military stuff. Figured kid would be gone when he got back (was gone for 2 weeks)

Kid gets declined from apartment for horrible credit score (it was under 400 i didnt know it was possible) and stays on our couch until he finds a place to stay.

Week 1 before roommate even leaves (night before) bf in bad accident, hospitalized for 3 weeks. Doesnt even remember kid until a few days after acciddnt.

Kid drives me to work in absence of bf, I thank him every day, we had always bought him food n gass ect ect until I couldn't afford it. He hated taking me to work and complained every second of the drive. Thats fine, he doesn't owe me a ride honestly, probably does it bc we ask for no money for him staying there.

Gives me rides for 3 weeks while bf gone. Bf comes home. Everyone makes jokes all the time about kicking kid out, kid laughs or jokes back, always smiling when doing so. I made a joke once too.

One day, I make joke while we sat in apartment parkinglot. He reaches for the gun in his car door, said ""I will kill you. I can kill bf too, he's defenseless up there in bed""(bf was in bed for another 2 weeks after hospital recovering) no smile. I didn't feel very threatened bc I thought no one actually threatens someone like that. But, he didn't seem like he was joking.

Realized he was always rude to me. Rude about rides, bought bf food and ignored me and never helped me or anything.

Start to resent him. Start to worry about him owning a gun. I'm scared. I'm scared.

After 2 nearly 3 months him living there, we can't afford our bills(bf hurt not working). He always offered to help with bills, so we asked for some money for electric bill (kid leaves tv and computer on all night every night...)

The next day kid moved out. He moved to bf's parents house. Pays rent there. Whatever.

Car still gone (it was totalled when bf was in accident at that first week) asked if kid could still give me rides. He agreed. Bf thanked him, I stopped thanking him after he threatened to kill me with gun.

Kid drives me no complaints. I'm scared. Weird remarks from him, nothing threatening though. He scares me, owns a gun, ect ect.

It's been another month. Bf parents (kid lives there now mind you) constantly hate on me for being mean to kid. Today bf brother said I should thank people who help me.

I don't want to thank someone who threatened to kill me. I'm scared. I don't talk to him. I don't talk when he is around. I come home and cry every day if he is the one to drive me.

No one cares or notices. Bf noticed and forced answer out of me two weeks ago, told me he would have kicked kid out if I told him. I cried.

Thing's have changed. Now that he doesnt live with us we are happy and cleaning again. Things were stressful with money, it was a bad time. I feel better.

A week ago I even thanked him for giving me a ride. Thing's feel okay.

But i am scared to talk to him still so I often don't say anything, and I still dont want to thank him

I just want to get my own car and ignore him forever. We will both be better off, I know I am not thankful, he drives me from kindness, he does not owe me a ride. Should I suck it up and thank him? Seems like the obvious solution right??

Sorry about typimg weird, we type short sentences at work and i get in the habit. I want... I want to buy kid dinner and gas next time I have money. I want to thank him for giving me a ride. But with all the pressure my boufriends family puts on me I don't want to do anything becaue they will think its forced but I honestly want to thank him for driving me.

It couldn't have been a real threat right??? For more info, when he first moved in he would check me out. Look at my legs when I had shorts on ect and look at me and smile often when i wasnt paying attention.

Then someone made a joke about us getting together (we hung out a lot when boyfriend was in the hospital) and I said ew no, suddnely he insulted me a lot, called me ugly often, called me a cunt and a bitch ect ect. One day we all drank together, he got drunk and asked why I never hug him like i hugged my boyfriend (Iw as holding my boyftiend in my arms between my boobs) and I helped him to the car and he leaned on me and called me comfy the whole ride home and said I deserve someone who loves me ect ect.

So I'm thinking he had a crush gone wrong or something. I don't think he THREATENED me with a gun, he couldn't have, but he knows I hate guns, I am terrified because he would even ""joke"" about it, you know? My boyfriend agreed it could be a joke but said that he shouldn't even joke about that since he knew I hated guns before that. I haven't told anyone, I was shot in the leg with a gun when I was a kid. So i just am terrified of them and I am scared I think being scared put all my walls up and made me hate the Kid.

That and we were extremely stressed, we had no money, my boyfriend was hurt, lost our car, couldn't afford anything, I was starved of food some days, I lost my job bc I pripritized my boyfriend, now that I have money and we are making a comeback from this mess I feel better and want to be kind to Kid but I think we've hurt each other enough and if I buy him dinner to then ghost him after or should I ghost him to begin with?",04Sep2019,1

I eventually started planing and figuring out my career and decided ""I want to be a cop"" it's now my dream because i love sports (specially Martial Arts) and adventure with some action while doing it all for the greater good but first i should do college just to be sure about my future (think of this as my plan B career).

My parents are not supportive of this though because they think it's nothing but a fantasy to me even after i told them i am serious about it, they do however support the college part but problem is they transferd my 6 year old brother (going to start 2nd grade) to a private school for better education (this was before i decided to do college) and the school is veary expensive way more than my college.

I told my parents that maybe it's better to let him finish the year and transfer him back to a public school then we can deal with my college, in the mean time i can find a job so i can help my family. But they didn't agree, they think you can't get a good job/career without college and want to go with this despite the insane financial hell.

I thought to myself ""They will suffer alot because of this, i can't let this happen"" so i told them ""i'm not going to college yet"" and leave it in stand by until i feel they are ok to help me because right now they need my help more than ever.

For context:

I am a very clean and organized person. I work 50 hours a week to keep the bills paid. They have a new car that I help with.

860,"**First off:** *I do not live on the states. So if your advice is 'go to this organization' I can't really do that.* 

This is gonna be one long post. Grab snacks. Sit tight.   


About a year ago, I moved in with my grandfather. It's just seven or eight blocks away from my mom's so it's not even that far from the city. Things happened too fast between my mother and the wrong man and he ended up threatening me a bunch of times because I intervened whenever they were having a bad fight. I'm an adult, I couldn't ignore what was going on. He was awfully mean to her, he could be really dismissive and demeaning. He also hated my cat. My baby Luna was very sick, she had diarrhea cause she had intestine damage. So she would often go wherever she felt like it. I'd clean it up and that was that. He thought my pet was nasty and a danger to his health. So this would produce fights with my mom about it, which made me very mad and aggitated because that animal was the love of my life. Then he'd get mad because i shouted at my mom and disrespected her. But it was only because she was being selfish and ignored my feelings. I never wanted him to come live with us.   
At one point it was enough for me. I left my cat in good hands because i couldn't take her with me. She died a few mothns after that. November 2018. I cried really hard. I had dreams about her very often.  


Fast forwarding a lot of depression-filled life filler.   
I'm doing better. My relationship with my grandfather was never amazing or deep, he's from another time and we differ on a lot of subjects. But with some time we made eachother laugh, share some [mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink)) *(tea-like drink)* and shoot the shit while he watched tv after he closed his small barrio grocery store and before I cooked dinner. After my grandmother passed from cancer he was quite alone for 2-3 years. Family life was complicated for my mother and her sister, so they all kind of dealt with it the best way they could. I was happy he wasn't alone anymore.   
My aunt had gotten into a big fight with pops over some issues between them. She moved to another province with my two cousins and nobody knew her location, situation or phone number.  
Over three months ago, about 2:30pm, the bell rang. It was her and one of my cousins. She said she was visiting for a week. Which turned into two weeks when she learned that her father was having some rather alarming tests done soon. Then more because *this*, another one because *that*. And that was like four months ago.  
Soon enough stuff started to... appear missing from the kitchen, mostly. Like a can opener, or some plates. She started to only come down the attic, where they are sleeping, at night. When my gradfather was admited into the hospital because he had  pleural effusion she started to come down even less. I'd cook, she wouldn't eat. She wasn't sad, not at all. She'd only go and see him when she was asked to, but she went. Those two weeks were hard. I visited my grandfather almost every day. She'd mostly stay in the attic and sleep or do whatever she is doing up there.   
One of those days, she allegedly took my cousin to see a doctor because she has porphyria and it was acting up.   
So I went spy-mode. I went up the attic. What i found disturbed me a lot. [Attatching pics.](https://imgur.com/a/kICH9gr)  
I remembered that my mother once mentioned she had an *accumulating issue* or something along those lines. That food in the picture was there for days. She was taking stuff from the kitchen and eating in the attic and never leaving stuff in the kitchen to be cleaned or done any of the dishes they used. She was taking stuff from the store, but too many items. No reason to. We never negated anything to her. She just had to ask or tell us she was taking it. All those missing glasses, dishes, food, etc was in their room that whole time.   
Then some more stuff started to disappear. My grandfather obviously knows because he told me that he shoulnd't speak about that and that he was gonna fix it when he felt better. Little did we know a little over a month after his lung surgery he'd be terminally ill. Turns out he has stage four lung cancer. And its metastasised. It's advancing really quick.   
Some of the stuff she took, like an icecream silver spoon or some salt/pepper shakers, wasn't important. So i couldn't care less. But a few days ago a bag with an amount of change in cash disappeared. I had stashed it along with more cash that i found laying around the store. My grandfather has little spots where he hides it. So i hid it all in my studio. But he wanted to count it, so i gave it back to him. After that he stashed it behind a wooden bar counter in the living room. I saw it and then forgot to take it back to my studio. It's no longer there.  
Recently she asked my mom for a dvd player so they could watch dvd's at night while they stay downstairs where pops's sleeping. She had one that she wanted to get rid off anyways so she gave it to her. Thing is, there is already a dvd player here. I couldn't tell you if it works. But aparently she can. Because she *'tested'* it, and my mom's too. None of them work according to her. At this point it sounds like she's trying to sell them or keep them with that excuse.   
With my grandfather's death being a fact she told me that she knew that I couldn't get a job or start university because I'm taking care of pops and that after he dies she didn't want me to be broke or homeless. So she told me that it was okay on her side to let me live here, as she has a job and a life in this other province and that my mom did too. That she wouldn't mind at all knowing I had to come here for a reason and that this is now (for better or worse) my home.  
Our relationship, while I dislike some of the aforementioned stuff she does, is fine. She used to play with me and take me for icecream when I was little and never really had any bad blood going on between us. I don't care if she takes all these things as I don't need them nor care if she has them. The money, maybe. Wasn't that much.  
But I'm starting to grow worried she's been manipulating me so I wouldn't notice this very noticeable things. For a long time I play dumb like Columbo, but I can't anymore. I'm afraid she might fuck me over. I can't find any reason why to be honest, but all these is making me worried.   
I believe she is somewhat of a hoarder and a kleptomaniac , and probably a pathological liar (probably because she grew up lying because she couldn't be honest). She knows I trust her and that we cool. If she's sick that's okay, I understand it. Everybody in our family has some issue whatsoever. I just don't want her to fuck me over as I've shown he respect and kindness.

866,"Hey, I'm new here so please bear with me, this is gonna be long.

So, a little bit about me: I have just moved to a new country to study at a pretty decent university - away from my only two close friends. Those are basically the only people I talk to and now here I am, only the other side of the planet with absolutely no one I know. Also, you can add extreme social anxiety (and years of untreated depression) to the list so yeah, making new friends is an extremely hard challenge for me and before I came here, I promised myself that I'd try my best to change up. I was also thinking about going to a therapist but there are 2 problems with that; I don't have money for it and my parents think it's a waste of money, and I've had bad experience with therapists in the past, who didn't help me at all and I've also spent my entire summer's student job salary to that...

Uni until now consisted of lectures and no social interaction at all. Yesterday, I've been to my first small classroom lesson, which was hands off the worst 2 hours of my life. We were supposed to introduce ourselves and work in groups etc. I tried to look approachable and put on my friendly face (or at least tried) Also, I've never done this before, but I tried to do some small talk with others (if you didn't notice, English is not my first language so that doesn't really help) but I got some cold 1-2 word answers from the people around me and they ignored every attempt and literally turned away from me (and I swear it wasn't awkward or forced, just the casual bullshit small talk people tend to enjoy). I mean come on ffs, whenever I'm somewhere at school and literally ANYONE comes up to me, I always try to act the nicest and friendliest way possible and not like an asshole...After that, I was like fuck this and just stared at my laptop for the entire session without talking to anyone. Others were talking and having good laughs, and I was just sitting there counting the minutes so that I could leave. We will have 5-6 classes like this every week and I'm sure I won't be able to sit through these classes without losing my mind.

I have zero fucking idea if I wanna do the course I'm studying at the moment (and if it's worth suffering every week for something I'm not even sure I wanna do). I'm just going with the flow so if I fail and drop out, it's not the end of the world. The problem is that I don't know what I REALLY want to do with my life. My main concern about making any big change is that I'm still on my parents' money and I could only be able to get a shitty part time student job next to uni. And you guessed it, my parents only support me financially if I study here, at uni.

What would you do if you were me? Anything is appreciated, really(:",04Sep2019,2

For the last three years i have known my friends. We started school together, went on many several trips together and have lots of memories together. Now that we have begun High School, me and my friends have split up. Some go to one school, some go to another. I fear that if i stay in my current school(school 1), i wont be able to stay connected with my current friends. The reason i think we are disconnecting, is because we barely talk with each other anymore, as before we would talk daily on the phone and IRL. The reason for why i am so paranoid is because i formerly had a friend who was my bff. When we started in middle school, he and i went to different schools, and our 7 year old bond quickly disappeared. I fear if i stay put in this school (school 1) i will lose the bond i had with my old friends.

But here is where it gets difficult. I have already started connecting with new people at my current school (school 1).The teachers are great, and my classmates are all nice. If i switch school (school 2), then i might have bad teachers and bad classmates, but i would reconnect with my former friends.

870,"So a little side information. I work at a tax firm as an administrative assistant. I have worked her 3 years this last July. I currently make 3,000 a month. I started at 2000 and after my first year went to 2500 and then that same year at the end of the year I was bumped to 3000. It has been that salary for a little over a year. 

Each admin is assigned to one case manager (EA) and does everything for them and their clients minus the actual case resolution. I do all of the following up, assemble all the documents, do all the legal documents, power of attorneys, talking to the client, and doing their financials with them. It is a lot of work and keeps me busy for my 8 hours a day. 

So basically, I was just informed today that they are firing another admin and instead of hiring another they are giving her EA to me. They said it very positively and said it is because I do such a good job and that was great. 

My issue is that now my workload has effectively doubled. This all goes into effect Monday but tomorrow I am going to get a meeting with my boss and tell them if they are doing this that I deserve to be compensated for it. My issue is that I don't know how much to ask for.

876,"So

I lent my sister a fair amount of money as a short term loan, she arranged as a means to pay it back an early pay out of shares which is due in her paycheck on 15th september.

I did lend her another smaller short term loan earlier in the year which she did pay back.  Before then there has been other lendings of money which she has not always paid back on time, and the occasions she didnt she would do things like avoid speaking to me on phone or face to face (but would respond to text).

So about a week ago she told me she has booked a holiday which by coincidence was the day before she got paid, meaning she will be abroad for 8 days after paid.  Conveniantly giving her an excuse to not pay me back.  However if none of the following also happened and we spoke and I was reassured I would have accepted it without been worried.

However that did not happen.

After telling me about this holiday I mentioned what about the money, her initial response was you will still get it I will send from my phone, but then within an hour or so she started acting weird.  I got another response saying she is not sure she will be online, so I said we need to talk to arrange whats going to happen,and I said I found it weird you decided to book a holiday the day before you agreed to pay me back.

Now she suddenly apparently has a infection thats apparently stopping her able to talk without singificant pain, yet this is somehow not stopping her going to work (where she has to talk) and hasnt stopped her from phoning our parents.  This infection has mysteriously carried on all week, and I expect as if by magic it will suddenly clear up right at the last moment before she goes on holiday.  Although she responds to text messages its only if its not about the money, if its about the money or asking her to ring, she will ignore or say she cannot deal with it.

Given the circumstances would it be reasonable behaviour for me to turn up at her house to talk to her, as she is been very evasive.  The amount of effort she puts in to avoid a phone call or a face to face conversation can be very extreme, she has issues with this type of behaviour in the past which is why I am struggling to find her story credible.

Also mysteriously she has sent me some of the money on paypal out of the blue, (when she shouldnt even have it yet given from what she told me), but this is a echeque on paypal, so it might not clear.  When I mentioned this her response was ay!!!!!

Finally this is a loan her partner doesnt know about which makes this harder to deal with, as it means if I turn up at her door I have to do it when he isnt there.  She usually finishes work before him so is a small 30-60 min window but her finishing time isnt consistent, I run the risk of her not been there at all of course.  If I tell her before hand I am coming it wouldnt surprise if she made sure she isnt there so it has to be a unannounced visit.

I expect replies telling me I am silly to lend it her, but its happened, I felt the need to help my sister and she is supposedly going to give me money on top as a motivation for doing it, but I am so anxious about this right now I would consider it a result just to get back what I lent her.

A bit about the situation, the reason for the loan(s) was to shift her toxic debt to my name so she could get a mortgage with her partner.  So to help her sort her life out.  There is also another ongoing loan which has monthly payments which is about halfway through and she isnt in arrears on that.  As far as I know she has none of these debts left in her name, and her and her partner are going to the bank about the mortgage before leaving for holiday.

So please productive advise rather than just to say I have been stupid, thanks.

In regards to the holiday it has been paid by her partner (According to my sister) if the question is asked how was it paid for.",04Sep2019,1

Basically, my bedroom is a seperate room in the basement that was built because we didn’t have enough bedrooms to have a place to sleep for all 5 people in the house.

My bedroom walls are very thin, so i hear every last word from the outside.

The reason my dad moved it into the basement was because my step mom was complaining about it being upstairs. This is because he has an Xbox in his office setup, and he plays this ALL DAY LONG.

&amp;#x200B;

My (17M) best friend (17F) just broke up with her boyfriend yesterday and, although she hasn't given me too much information about the event, it seems to have been pretty tumultuous. She seemed to have actually been in love with the guy (she'd been gushing to me about him even before they got together), and she's visibly devastated about the breakup. Not only this, but she's in general very emotionally vulnerable (she has pretty severe depression and anxiety, and I think she might be suffering from a form of minor PTSD after events that happened around a year ago), and I'm genuinely worried about her mental health and physical well-being. Problem is, I A) live in another country and B) have serious difficulties acting spontaneously in situations relating to emotions. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, does anyone have any ideas about how I could/should voice my concern for her and, if possible, help her out in any way? Thanks",04Sep2019,1

Today I bought some sushi from the store, and after eating a roll with the tiniest piece of cucumber, it made me want to gag for some reason, and no I'm not sick. But here's the kick: that same day I decided to buy a Sprite, and I can't even remember the last time I have ever drank soda. I haven't for at least a year, and I even only took a few sips before I didn't want it.

904,"I'm 16 years old (male). School starts in about a week. 
I feel so anxious and so scared. I don't know what to do...

I failed 9th grade twice and now I have to repeat 9th grade again. I have emotions and mental as well as Health issues. I was diagnosed with epilepsy, ADHD, tourettes Syndrome, depression, anxiety etc. And I feel like there are other things I have that I haven't been diagnosed with yet.

I'm socially awkward and have social anxiety. I don't have a single friend, nor do I know how to make any. 

Whenever I go to school I feel like having a mental breakdown. I feel like passing out, crying, screaming out in anger, acting violent, etc. 
And I feel even worst when someone in my school does anything or says anything to upset me.
I fucking hate my school. People are so loud and obnoxious. I also feel a lot of envy and anger towards teenagers who make out in the hallways because I wish I could be in their position. I wish I could have partner to make out with and even have sex with.  

I'm not Intelligent either. Im terrible at every subject and I can't even pay attention. I also don't have any confidence. I have NOTHING to my advantage. And the worst part is that I don't have anyone to talk to.
I feel so worried for my future and my safety in school. 

Also if you're gonna recommend a therapist or psychiatrist please don't. I already have those and it's not a quick fix to my problems. I already told them and they're working on these issues with me. So don't fucking bother bringing that that shit up. I'm tired of countless people telling me to see a therapist and/or psychiatrist.",04Sep2019,1

Im a 19 year old gay guy. While out at a club last week i bumped into a guy i used to go to school with who was year above me. Very attractive, typical sporty and popular ""straight"" guy. Ive met him a couple times because he used to date one of my best friends back in school. She's over him and they are both in new relationships. We were both drunk and while talking the conversation turned more sexual. He was very close to me and told me how he was actually bisexual and had only realised after leaving school. He then proceeded to make more moves on me and i let him.  We made out for a while but eventually stopped because he felt bad. He kept justifying it by saying his girlfriend kisses girls when shes drunk. I feel guilty because its my friends ex but more so because he has a girlfriend.

 Should I do anything? Im nervous to tell my friend who used to date him incase she'll be mad or tell lots of people.

Between juggling work, school, and questioning whether I'm even passionate about my courses I'm wondering if I should drop out and take some time off.

The kicker is that once I drop, I lose my scholarship which pays for all my classes, and will not be considered a dependent by financial aid for another 6 years.

910,"At the start of 2018 my father got diagnosed with prostate cancer, he’s told he has 4 years to live if he’s lucky, the day after, my mum decide she wants a divorce because he’s now “useless”. They were married for almost 20 years and one problem like this and my mum is gone. She moved out and got an apartment. Everybody on my dads side of the family hates my mum, I’m really disappointed and angry because  of what she did to my dad but she’s my mum I can’t hate her forever. Me and my brother are now living with my dad at this point mid 2018, he’s on kemo therapy and has constant mood swings shouting and swearing at us but we have to put up with it because I couldn’t imagine what he’s going through.  Soon enough I’m told by my mum that my grandad and his brother both have cancer. At this point I didn’t know what to do with myself, I cut myself off from my friends never left the house and missed as much of college as possible because I felt like if I went in all the thoughts of what was happing outside of college would coming flooding back to me and I would just break. 

I never told anybody about what was going on and to this day I have only told one person, my best friend. Who made sure I didn’t fail college and would always text me and ask me to play something on pc or come out with him. Things are only getting worse for me, dads getting sicker, I’m forced to meet my mums new boyfriend who she met about a month after divorcing my dad. My dad has put the house on the market so he can move in with his girlfriend who he has know for 3 months, our family home. Now gone.

Self harm came quite quickly to me after this, I don’t know why I did it, I just did. Every time I see my grand parents they would always tell me how proud they are of me and it was making me hate myself even more. 

When I did go to college pretending to be myself was the hardest thing I have ever done, always trying so hard to look happy and crack jokes, my course teachers know my mum personal and if they see me acting upset they are going to tell her then that will upset her and make her think she ruined my life. 

My other friends see me as the kid who has anything and they would never in a million years assume something was wrong with me or that I was going through something. I would really like to talk to someone irl about everything but I can’t, I struggle to order food at a restaurant because I get so worked up about talking to people. Let alone telling someone about all my life problems. 

My family are the most loving and caring people I know, they have done everything for me, and yet I still feel like nobody cares about me. At the end of 2018 I’ve pretty much just given up at this point, attempted suicide twice, theres only one thing holding me back. Family, with everything going on right now me not being around might just end my family’s happiness forever, but I don’t know how much more I can take of getting bad news everyday, it’s killing me.

   The first 6 months of our relationship we had a really healthy sex life. Since I hadn't been with men we explored each other and had sex regularly with out issue. We both enjoyed it. Then it just stopped out of nowhere. If I try to come on to him he gets mad and tells me to stop or yells at me. If we are cuddling and I rub my butt on him he gets mad and turns the other way. Anytime I ask him about it he gets the most mad and says he doesn't want to talk about it. We've gone 8 months with out having sex because I feel so bad that I just gave up.the last time we did have sex he wasn't into it at all nor did he enjoy it. We did doggy for like 6 minutes, he came got up and left. I've even said he wouldnt have to do anything that I would just pleasure him. I told him I'd buy him pizza and beer if he'd let me give him a blow job and he still says no. I haven't tried since then. 
    He has made comments saying that my vagina is too tight and that it hurts him but I dont know how to fix that with out being able to communicate with him about sex. I want him to want to enjoy it. I want to be able to pleasure him. I feel like maybe my lack of knowledge about men might be it? Or that he is flat out unattracted to me.",04Sep2019,4

So I [M, 17] have this female friend (I'll call P) who I'm really close to. We met almost a year ago, hit it off well and have been very close best friends since.

We also pretty much have a friends with benefits situation as well, we do sexual stuff all the time and we've slept together a few times.

I have an incredible bond with P, and wouldn't want to get rid of it for the world. She's my closest ever friend.

Problem is now I think she's caught some feelings for me and gotten super attached. We don't see each other that often, so when we see each other and do something we calm them 'dates' lmao.

I love her loads, and maybe I do have feelings for her. We text and talk very affectionately to each other, sending cute memes and wholesome messages and whatever. P is super affectionate to me, probably more than I am to her. 

My issue is I seem to have pretty bad commitment issues, and hate committing to anything. Maybe this stems from a bad relationship experimce I've had, but the thought of being in a relationship scares me.

I like to hook up with girls at parties or whatever and live - as awesome as a relationship with someone I love is, i feel like im missing out on my youth if I get into a longer term relationship. I can settle down into a proper relationship when I'm a little older. YOLO ya know?

I really do love P so much, we have the most incredible bond, and she's so perfect, and I'm 90% sure she's caught pretty serious romantic feelings for me, saying she doesn't want to hook up or be with anyone else.

In terms of school I am probably the most intelligent of us and people generally consider me to have a bright future. The rest of my friends are far less confident in their futures. A couple of them have opened up to me about their feelings and neither are positive about their lives in the present or future. My first advice to both of them was to try and get some professional help (e.g. see a therapist) as that has really helped an old friend of mine who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and me coping with autism (I don't get many problems with it that much anymore and I can cope fairly well in social situations now). Both of them were very adamant, however, that that wouldn't help them as it hasn't in the past and that they just wanted to talk to me about it. One of these guys has also been kicked out by his mum and a lot of people who are close to him are giving him shit at the moment. Another friend from this group is diagnosed with depression and is pretty much taking MDMA as a coping mechanism, I'm not all that close with him though and I think his brother is trying to help him out.

At the moment I just am trying to keep talking with these guys and making sure that they are doing ok, busy and not taking drugs at home.

I am also fully aware that being a teenager is a long period of hating yourself and just generally being unhappy. And that all of these people will probably get through their shit and live good lives. At the same time though I am a quite worried that if things do get worse for them and I haven't done anything it's going to eat away at me for a long time.

938,"People may know me here so I’m keeping it as vague as possible since I really can’t be bothered making a throwaway (nice). 

The past year hasn’t been too great in terms of relation-chips. To keep it simple, I was sexually assaulted more times than I’d like to admit in the last few months (and it was filmed! Woohoo motherfuckers) and then I’ve been accused of sexual harassment and the list goes on.

Didn’t think it really affected me badly until I realised how awful I was treating myself, especially more towards people that I liked, to keep it short, I became a rampant asshole, and put on some sort of player persona so I could get some sort of control again. (Big mistake, I don’t recommend).

Ive just started feeling comfortable maintaining eye contact with unfamiliar men again - but I’m still incredibly hostile when I feel vulnerable. Thing is, I never really told anyone about it. So a lot of people don’t know why I act the way I do. Also I’m not wanting to use that as an excuse either, if you’re shitty - you’re shitty, regardless of your past.

Learning from my past mistakes, there’s a guy that seems to really like me, he’s sweet and I don’t want to hurt his feelings. I’m really reluctant about seeing people again, but at the same time, I don’t really want to hurt him either - not to the point we become enemies because of my actions.  Eh, when is it a good idea to tell him shit that’s happened to me and set solid boundaries before anyone gets really hurt? I have a long road to self acceptance, I just want to let him know that I’m not exactly the... sweetest or fairest maiden - and if I act out I just don’t mean it.(and obviously he can get tf outta there whenever he wishes.) 

I just want him to have more context behind me before getting into it. I’m extremely irrational and impulsive at the moment, I’m really working on it but it takes time. I can’t unlearn bad behaviour overnight I suppose. If I don’t set anything though, it’s truly over. Seriously, I’m like the Jekyll and Hyde of relationships, it’s truly a shit show.",04Sep2019,1

947," I've been on a project for 2 years that is about to wrap up. The Co-Dependent Yes Man with the Napoleon Complex whom I have been forced to report to has been sabotaging my ideas and proposals a lot over the last 6 months. So I started going over his head to the Boss.

Recently Napoleon left his email open and I saw that he sent a scathing response about my latest proposal to the Boss who shared it with him. My ideas could turn around the $15k debt Napoleon has created and bring in huge profits.

Big meeting today between the head honchos. Another manager who attended the meeting revealed to me by accident that the project was not only #5 on the agenda, but also that every single thing I proposed they are now considering. With no credit or discussion with me about it.

Needless to say, I can turn a huge profit for this area for them because it is my expertise. Napoleon has no clue or education on the project and is even watching youtube vids to try to save his ass.

Now, people of Reddit - I ask you to post your best detailed advice to handle this Yes Man. This little sneaky nobody.

I don't want nicey nice stuff. This project is about to end, and I need all out ""fuck him up/fuck with him"" advice to use before I close it up.

Some things to keep in mind:

1. The Boss yells at him all the time.
2. He makes excuses.
3. He used to be a clown (for real) and is a stage performer. He loves an audience.
4. He's a crafty liar.
5. They recently hired another manager that can dance circles around him and has already swayed the Boss to look closer at Napoleon's bs.

So I'm a college student who works at a family fun center as a tech with a pay rate of $9 per hour. So lately I have been feeling burned out due to low pay compared to other techs at other family fun centers, hell an arcade attendant makes $12 per hour up north while ours make $7.50 per hour. I work part-time almost 40 hours per week and do college during the week. I'm going to college for IT and I hope after college to get a job on base as IT system admin, so basically I had a mental breakdown in my mind recently in class due to not understanding Cisco networking at all. I can never remember the commands for Cisco and it frustrates me because I feel like my future depends on it, on the plus side I got a couple of classes till I'm done with my associates degree. Now I'm amazing at hands on experience except not for networking, I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm in the right field or not, I love working with computers and fixing them.

966,"Hey Reddit, I know this is a really personal problem but I'm just a young person that really needs some advice right now.

I'm a Junior in Highschool. This year is my first year going to highschool alone without a sibling and October will mark the one year anniversary of my brother leaving for the Marines. 

Anyways, I've very unhappy with my life. It could be loneliness but I just feel invisible all of the time. Like I go to school, come home, do homework, sleep and repeat. I live about 30 minutes away from my school so whenever my ""friends"" make plans to hang out I can't go because it's too far away. I'm not friends with anyone in my neighborhood and my younger brother goes to a high school closer to our house because he can't be trusted. I just feel isolated, and I try so hard to look nice and be friendly to everyone in hopes of making new friends but no one even talks to me. I say ""friends"" because while I have people I talk to and hang out with I know I'm not their first choice. I only get asked to hang out if it's with a group, never has someone enjoyed just my company where they would just want to spend time with me, and that's a depressing thought.

Lately I haven't been able to hide how unhappy I am with my life. My mom has noticed and she thinks I'm on something. She worried about me and says it makes her sad because she doesn't know what she can do. My mom is like my best friend and knowing I'm hurting her makes me even more sad because I love her and now my misery is effecting her. But I can't even fake a smile for her anymore, that's how unhappy I am.

I miss my older brother and just the thought of him makes me cry now. I just wanna play video games with him and laugh at funny videos like we did before he left. It's just so hard feeling so alone and realizing that no one cares about you and wouldn't do anything you do for them. I always made the drive to hang out with my friends but the one time I set something up no one can make it. I took my friends out to eat individually because I liked spending time with them but no one has ever done the same for me. I couldn't get through writing this without crying because I need help and I feel so lost and alone like I have no one..

It's just sad and it makes me want to distance myself from everyone, but I know that's not the solution. How do I get better? 

How do I feel happy again...",04Sep2019,1

Her parents were not supportive of her sexuality and were abusive so she left home when she was 18 and my family and I took her in.

Recently she has been in contact with her father and her brothers and they seem to be on good terms. She does not want a relationship with her mother but is willing to tolerate her if it means seeing her brothers. Her brother invited me and her to his football game which happens to be on his birthday. I said it was her choice and I'd be supportive of whatever she thought was best. She decided we should go for her brother because he asked up personally and she appreciated him including me. Seeing as we will be seeing them in the coming weeks I am getting super anxious.

972,"I have been a corporate trainer for a medium sized company for about a year and a half. This is my first ever training role and I’ve learned so much about people, learning styles, communication, etc. This last quarter, I’ve been tasked with training a new round of employees. One in particular, whom I’ll refer to as Susie, is so blatantly disrespectful towards me, I’m at a loss. 

Now, I’ve already spoken with Susie’s manager and my manager a couple different times. We even had a private sit down with her manager to talk about her behavior. Each time she swears I am misinterpreting her words/actions... that she never meant to be disrespectful in the slightest and usually apologizes for coming off that way. She will even correct her behavior and express a positive attitude for about a week, convincing me she’s changed her tune. I’m not convinced she’s just a manipulator and has a real problem with either myself, authority or learning. She takes constant breaks, spends copious amounts of time on the phone, makes constant excuses for missing trainings and then complains that she’s confused. The past two weeks specifically I’ve had her shadowing other employees by listening in on their conference calls and webinars. She continuously doesn’t call in to the meetings, logs out before meetings are over or will call in but have her monitors off and her head laying on her desk. 

I try to be light hearted and I understand listening in to other people talk is boring. When I approach her directly about this in particular, she stares at me like I’m speaking another language and won’t give me more than a head nod or a sing songy “humph.” She wont even use real words, it feels like trying to teach a bratty child. Today when I asked her why she left a call early, she even went as far as pulling her phone out, pushing passed me and walking away. This is just one recent example of Susies many foibles. I can only assume she flat out has no respect for me. 

How can i approach this situation in a professional manner? I’m trying to treat her like an adult but it’s becoming harder every day.

976,"So last night or sometime during the day someone stole my bicycle. I live upstairs in an apartment complex made of four units: two upstairs two downstairs.  I had it downstairs hidden under the stairs. Someone had to directly walk out of their way to see it.

I can go through my Facebook marketplace history and maybe find the guy I bought it from over a year ago to get some kind of evidence to file a police report but I don’t know how well that will work. I don’t have any pictures of it. The only evidence I have is that my neighbors know it was mine.


Now this is strange but has anyone successfully found and retrieved a stolen good? I’m thinking I should first go to the pawn shop in the morning to see if it’s there. I’m also thinking maybe to keep stalking Facebook and Craigslist markets to see if it shows up for sell and act interested. I know it’s dangerous but I’m pissed.


Any thoughts or advice?",04Sep2019,1
977,"Hey Reddit, 

So bit of a preface I'm the worlds biggest sucker for a crying girl... I dont know my inner knight in shining armour just makes me want to fix everything for them no matter if I know them or not.

So I'm always of two minds when I see someone upset in public:

1. I have a really strong urge to help (as afformention)

2. I don't know if I'd want to talk to some random person about what ails me if I were in her shoes.

So we have about 10 minutes till the bus arrives any Advice appreciated.

Cheers",04Sep2019,1
978,"So- I have this long distance freind that I'm pretty close to but something has been bothering me lately, they vent to me ALOT- and I always try to give my best advice but its just been getting kinda sorta annoying? They come to me to vent but when ever I mention that I'm sad/mad or whatever, they just ignore it and change the subject or just say ""oof"" or 'same"". And I feel terrible because I haven't been giving my best efforts to help them out, but I have my own problems to deal with, like finding motivation to get out of bed each morning. I want to bring this up but Everytime I try to I get to nervous and back track- and I feel like a terrible friend since I'm annoyed with being constantly vented to, and I don't wanna lose them just because I didn't wanna listen to them vent everyday
Any advice on how to handle this? 

Sorry if its a bit strange- I'm bad at explaining things :(",04Sep2019,1
981,"I'm 18, left home and lived in Los Angeles for 3 months, and I head home later today. I still haven't got any gifts for my family, and I know they will probably except some. I have no idea what I should get them! All the souvenir shops just seem like they have useless trinkets. What sort of thing do you think my parents my appreciate?",04Sep2019,1
982,"So my dad and my stepmom were planning on going to dinner tomorrow in a town about 45 minutes from where I live. I planned on going originally. Then suddenly my dad dropped in 'bring a gift and a card', I asked why and he said tomorrow is my stepmom's birthday. To add some context my stepmom recently has been very dismissive with my mental health (She once was laughing and doing a little dance when I had a panic attack in the car, which later she said was so funny how I was crying and swearing) despite knowing I have problems and I've tried bringing it up with my dad but he continues to deny that what she's doing is harmful despite me telling him what she's doing is harmful. I don't want to bring it up with her because I don't feel close enough to her to open up about how she makes me feel. I've gotten mad at her once and tried expressing how the things I do when I'm stressed out are warning signs but her response was 'oh suck it up you're fine'. I really don't want to get her a gift and I'm already starting to get bad anxiety about the situation but I already committing to going. Should I get her a gift and a card despite my unease towards her? Should I trust the way my body's reacting to this situation and avoid it? Am I being paranoid and crazy? Tell me Reddit, how would you react to this situation if you were in my shoes?",04Sep2019,1
983,"So I’ve known my s/o for about 8 months now. They’re a high school student. And throughout time has mentioned how their parents had hit them, and yelled at them. And I’ve been told their parents left their depression go untreated for 3 years and hasnt even let them get medicated for it when they were FINALLY diagnosed despite showing symptoms since they were 11. Even though several professionals have told the parents over and over that it will help regulate their childs emotions. They just think that if they avoid it long enough it’ll go away. Basically never taking their kid seriously. My s/o wants to go back to therapy or impatient to get treatment but they can’t afford it and their parents wouldn’t take them seriously to begin with. I feel that this thing screams for action, but I don’t wanna possibly pour more salt on the wounds by prying into it so intensely. But I also want to help and make sure my s/o is safe and healthy. Any suggestions? I basically love them and want to make sure their healthy but fear that I’ll only make things worse",04Sep2019,1

985,"Hello, so I am a 28F who has been estranged from my father for most of my life. I recently reconnected with him and met his wife who is a sweetheart. She decided to get me a gift, and forgot to give it to me in person, so she mailed it to me. The problem is, they are earrings and my ears are not pierced, nor do I have the desire to get them pierced. I would just  send her a thank you, but I don't want her to waste money sending me more earrings in the future. Would it be rude to say something along the lines of ""I got your gift! Thank you! My ears aren't pierced, but I appreciate the thought."" 

 More possibly useful info: I don't think these earrings are expensive enough to warrant sending back either. Would it be weird to tell her I'll give them to a friend with pierced ears?",04Sep2019,1
986,"My poor wife has been trying to get a job in her field (graphic design) for a year and a half. She is young but she is so so talented. I've seen her work and it is amazing. But no one is giving her a shot here in the DC, Maryland, Virginia area for graphic design. Unfortunately the experience she has is one year at an agency, 6 weeks of contract work (they loved her), and 1.5 years doing her own freelance business working with various companies and individuals. Never really had an internship except at her college newspaper.

She had a job a while ago but lost it when some stuff went on with her family and she was depressed and went through some legal troubles that were dismissed (can't afford expungement rn). I know this doesn't sound great, but she has really gotten her shit together and continued to work on herself.

She is amazing at coding and design. She can make websites, she specializes in designing logos. She is awesome and her style is quite unique.

She does well in interviews and people really like her personality. The talent is still very much there and she is so ready to give her all to a job if someone would give her a shot.

It's so frustrating bc all we need is one person to give her a chance. It would be life changing for her. She has the skill ,drive, and dedication. I don't know how to maintain hope myself and simultaneously help her to not give up.",04Sep2019,1

988,"Hi, I'm seventeen and a senior in high school. I've had a few different jobs and bosses already, so I have a bit of experience. I've also been working for my dad every so often since I was eleven, but recently (since summer 2017) I had been working as an actual employee. Working for my dad is really difficult. He isn't like any of my other bosses. He expects you to be 100% reliable all the time, and practically perfect at your job. He will tell (not ask) you to come in to work less than 12 hours beforehand, sometimes only a few hours before. He also undermines his employees' work.

In his defense, he works over 100 hours a week, mostly understaffed and with people that constantly make excuses not to show up at work. He has a really difficult job. My dad and I got in a huge fight where essentially he told me to work the next day and I already had plans. I quit right there, and we didn't speak for MONTHS. 

Now my dad and I are really close again. Now that school is back in session, most of his workforce is gone. In the past couple of months, I realized that I needed to be making an income so that I could save for college, a car, and have a little spending money. I've realized trying to find a job is a LOT harder than it seems. At this rate, I probably won't be working for several more months. I've been thinking of asking my dad if I can work for him again and be more flexible and willing to work. I really don't want to work for him specifically, but I know how to do the job really well and it pays pretty nicely.

Should I ask if I can work for him again?",04Sep2019,1
