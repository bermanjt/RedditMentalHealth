0,"Ok, I'm 14, live with my parents, am homeschooled, blah blah. Anyways. So, a few weeks ago(I think) my mom and I were talking, and I decided to tell her that I wanted to see a therapist. Now, this wasn't the first time I'd asked her, but more on that later. So she says she'll talk to my dad about it, and that money didn't matter(we're kinda poor tbh) when it comes to that, and that she'll get me what I needed, sounds nice right? Oh btw, I think the reason I told her was that I was depressed, which isn't entirely false, but I didn't want to just tell her ""oh I can't remember most of my life and have voices in my head""(you can read about it if you look at my post history I think, it's kinda hard to explain here) So um, well, I mean about the depression thing, it would most likely be believable to her because, according to her(ya know, I don't remember) I was really depressed about a year or two ago, and I almost always act kinda eh cause of my headaches, so yeah.(ok guys, I know I probably shouldn't have lied about the reason, but I'm sorry ok?) So as you can see, a few weeks past, maybe even a month(I'm not good at keeping track of time) and it's never been brought up again. Like, ever. My mom never said anything, my dad never said anything, no one ever mentioned anything about therapy after that. Now I know it's kind of not something that you just talk about normally(well I mean idk, I'd just think that I guess) but like, ??? I mean, ik therapy costs money and we don't have much money, and that my mom's stressed and probably forgot or something, but like it's kind of important. And this isn't the first time I've asked her if I could go to therapy. Like, I've asked at least 3/4/5 times by now(i don't remember, maybe more) and, well, I'm here on Reddit asking why I'm not going to therapy, so what do you think happened? Ugh, I probably don't even need therapy, but Kyle(not his real name) says I should get it(guess who he is? Uh huh. Well I mean at least I have nice voices in my head that care about me) So like should I just not bring it up again cause i know it's not gonna do anything? Do I just straight up tell them about like, my...whatever it is? Do I tell them I'm like waiting for them to decide whether or not I'll go cause they never even said whether I'd actually go or not? Idk, I might just sound like some edgy teenager to you, but like, I'm not. I mean, from what you guys told me(*and* from what I found from looking up my symptoms) it sounds pretty serious, so...? Help? What should I do? What should I say? How do I convince my parents I need therapy? Or do I not actually need therapy and I'm just overreacting? Idk what to do.",23Apr2019,1
1,"So I've had a plan for a little under a year to go to an out of state university with some friends. This will be their freshman year of college, but I started at a local university 2 years early through the CCP program. I love my university and I love the staff and faculty in the French dept (my major). I've heard that the university I may transfer to has a good program but I haven't met with any of the professors yet. If I stay where I'm at I know I'll be fine, and it's around half the cost, which means I won't have to take out loans. if I go to the new university, it may be exciting to be out on my own, but I'll have to take out a 20k loan for the first semester, and enroll in a program that will take about 15% of my income for 10 years after college. I currently live at home, which is a bit of a wild situation, and rent at the apartment my friends are moving to would be about 150$ a month, which is incredible. 

TLDR: Should I stay where I'm at (stable environment, no college debt) or move out of state (independence, chance to have a true college experience with friends I've had for 6 years now)? 

I'm just incredibly anxious and would love to get advice from people who have no skin in the game! Thanks in advance!",23Apr2019,1
2,"So I have a friend I'll name Jack here, he doesn't use reddit so I hope this doesn't reach him. Jack really shouldn't be drinking but he does. I think Jack only drinks because his friends also drink. He usually only drinks for fun with friends in party type events. I've seen him drink and I can say he's a lightweight and gets drunk pretty quick, which didn't really bother me since he seemed to be enjoying it. But recently he's been drinking alone because he's been pretty down with a lot going on in his life with his family and his gf. I think he probably has depression and anxiety, which is why I'm worried about him taking up drinking. 

He would get drunk some nights and randomly text me stuff like ""I'm worthless how do I have such a great gf"", ""I'm ugly"", ""I'm so fucked up."", etc. I don't really know how to react to this so I usually say something like ""don't say that, of course you're a great person, don't look down on yourself."" 

He's dealing with a lot of complicated stuff that I have no good insights on, so I don't know if what I try to say will convince him. I've talked a bit about this to his gf. She says he really shouldn't be drinking when he's upset because he becomes different and says things he doesn't mean, but he always just ignored her and does it anyway. 

How do I nicely tell him that he shouldn't be drinking? I want him to know that I care about him and I think that drinking isn't good for him. I just really feel like he's drinking because it's what other people do when they're upset, but I don't want to call him out on that. I usually tell myself when I'm down that it'll get better or that whatever bad that's happening to me right now isn't really that bad because I still have myself, but I've tried that on him and he takes it as hippie nonsense.",23Apr2019,1
3,"I'm 23 years old and I've been living with my parents for a year to save money for a graduate program. 

Roughly a year and half ago my grandmother died end ever since my father has been gaining a lot of weight. He has always been heavy-set, but he's reaching a point to where it is interfering with his life. He's often too tired to work outside even though his favorite activities involve tending his garden. He wears a back brace now to help him keep stable if he has to do any labour. I've told him before that I'm concerned for his health, but he shuts down the conversation by saying his doctor says his cholesterol and blood pressure are healthy and goes off to bed. 

It's at least clear to me that there is more to this issue than simply his weight. He's repressing a lot of emotions and will not share them with anyone even my mother. No one not my mother or my siblings knows what to do. In fact my mother has mostly given up on trying to help him because it's become nearly impossible to discuss this with him. It's something that we all notice, how he can be incredibly sociable and happy around strangers or in business, but when it comes to his family he has nothing for us.

It's not like we've just left him to rot, we're actively going for hikes, going out in the garden, and making dinners, but little gets him off the couch. It has gotten to the point where I'm afraid to slight him at all because any minor inconvenience for him turns into an argument.

How can I or my family help him?  I'm moving out in a couple months and I feel like I can't leave him like this.",23Apr2019,1
4,"Hi everyone, not sure if this is a good place to put this, but can anyone direct me to a website or place that I can look for a room to rent that isn't sketchy? I live in Southern California, and I've been looking at Craigslist for a little over 2 months now. (I know, so much for not sketchy).

7,"Whenever I’m angry, I feel like I’m not supposed to, like it’s not an emotion I’m supposed to feel. Whenever I’m mad at my father, he makes me feel insanely guilty.

8,"I’m in grade 12, good grades, this semester should be a breeze, but I’m legit getting scared that I won’t graduate. 

My grade average is always somewhere in the 80’s could probably be in the 90’s if I cared. I see lots of people I know, including my friends, struggling with school. But for me, I don’t know why, but I just get it. This may seem like bragging, but it’s an actual problem, because I’ve never really had to work for anything. 

Whenever there is work that needs to be done outside of school, I just procrastinate (like I’m doing right now). I know it’s an issue, but it’s a catch 22 trying to solve it. With most work, I’ll know what need to do and when I can do it, but I just don’t.

A lot of the stuff isn’t even difficult, for example I’ve ment to write an email for the past couple weeks and it would literally take less time than to make this post but I have yet to do it. 

I want to do these things, but I don’t make the time. Or when I do, I don’t follow through. I know it’s a matter of willpower, but I don’t know how to achieve it.

Perhaps any advice I can get I already know, but I just don’t want to know. But I hope, at least, someone else telling me might help motivate me or something idk.",23Apr2019,0
9,"\*\*Long story to come, but in major need of advice\*\*

So... For privacy purposes and in case the person of this story comes across this, we're going to name my ""friend"", Leaf. I will also give inaccurate numbers and estimates (I will italicize) to throw Leaf off.

Leaf and I knew each other in *middle school* and disconnected for about *three* years. One day, we reconnected and hit it off right away. Like nothing changed. It was nice at first, but then, I realized that Leaf was being a little too flirty. I shut it down. Became cold (might be an exaggeration, I just wanted him to stop without calling it out because I knew he would get defensive). I was less of whatever I was to ensure that he wouldn't gain feelings and to make it known that I was just not interested.

Fast forward, he admits that he likes me. I still don't feel the same. I told him that we wouldn't work and I just didn't feel the same way. He was understanding... Supposedly. After that, he kept mentioning sex a little too much. Then, one day talked about how if I wanted, we could be fuck buddies. Once again, I had said no. He insisted that if I ever change my mind, then he is there. I brushed it off.

It has been a few months already and we are experiencing issues that I don't normally experience with other friends. He consistently felt like there is an issue within our friendship, but really the issue here is that I am busy all the time and don't always have the time to either hang out or text back. Leaf needs a place to stay and my *cousin* offered the place we were staying at. I was fine with it. But it became overbearing when Leaf kept asking to hang out when sometimes I was either too busy or just wanted some space to myself. Leaf always wanted to hang out 24/7. He eventually became ""understanding"" of my circumstances that I'm not really the type to always han gout and I have a social battery.

Another issue arises. He doesn't like that I don't tell him everything. Insists that ""best friends"" (which I didn't consider him to be one, but he considered me to be his) are supposed to tell each other everything. EVERYTHING. I'm not a very open person. I'm not good with talking about everything all the time. That bothered him. At this point, I had already had some pent up anger. It was either I wasn't spending enough time or wasn't giving him enough, but of course. It was all my fault. Here I was making changes, but I didn't see him doing much of anything. He used his past as an excuse, but I feel like you can only use that for so long... He hasn't done a whole lot to change.

He kept complaining about his love life, so I helped tweak his tinder. \*Ding\* he got a match. They hit it off, but before they meet, he complains a bit about her looks. I told him to give her a shot. They have a good time. But as time passes, he doesn't like her that way. He keeps expressing it, telling me, and my cousin. Leaf doesn't want to be with her, but he sure does keep leading her on. I told Leaf that he has to be straightforward with her. He claims that he has been.  Fast forward once again, we're all good friends with the girl. I figured it was time that she moved on and I offered her a date with my friend. Leaf finds out. My friend drives *four* hours to come and have a date with her. Leaf amplified his flirting. Tickling, playing of the hair, laying on each other's lap. In front of my friend. Hurt, my friend cancelled the date and left the next day. I scolded them. I put them in a group chat and started calling out Leaf. Telling him AND the girl everything Leaf has been saying. Things like: ""I thought you said you didn't like her"", ""You said that you thought she was bland"", and other things. He even used to complain that she sucked at sex. Complained. Told us that he wanted to go play the field more. Told me that he told her everything. But I quickly realized that he has not been honest with her. He denied each claim and she defended him. I was in shock. Another dent in the friendship.

Then... I was sexually assaulted. Raped. Not by Leaf. I had an old *acquaintance* over. He invited himself. I requested that Leaf would be there to make sure nothing bad happens. I don't know why, but Leaf immediately showed off his alcohol collection. Showed off his everclear. They both take a shot. I refused. I have work and school tomorrow, I can't. But Leaf wouldn't take a no for an answer. He kept persisting. He wanted to show my acquaintance the drunk me and how fast a light weight can get drunk off of everclear. Irritated, I took the shot. It hit me **so. fast.** After a while, Leaf went to go to the restroom. My acquaintance kept forcing me to kiss him. Pulling me to him. I kept trying to push him off or pulling away, but he's a muscular man and I was drunk and not capable of such brute strength. He comes back. I knock out. I wake up. Lights are off, Leaf is gone, and my acquaintance is standing at the foot of my bed. Pants off. Locked door. Scared, I tried to get up, but again. He was muscular and I was intoxicated. And well, you get the rest. Leaf knocks on the door. I use that opportunity to bounce. Leaf didn't find out what happened until weeks later. I lied. I told him he just tried to kiss me, but so much more was done. Leaf told me he knew something was up. He knew that something was going to happen. He saw it all. Listed it all off to me. Kept telling me he wanted to give my acquaintance the benefit of the doubt... I was hurt. Weeks later, I tell him what happened. No sincere apology. Just a ""it wasn't my fault and here are the reasons why"". I just wanted a sincere apology... Or maybe that's what I think I wanted? I don't know, but I just know I didn't like how he responded. He was ready to argue. That's what he sounded like.  But I shut it down. All that ever runs through my head... Why did he leave me there. Why didn't he stop him. Why did he leave me alone. Why didn't he ask him to leave. Another dent in the friendship.

Fast forward. They're finally together. Defeated. He said he was finally going to ""settle"". I didn't like that, but I didn't say anything. She was happy and she's sweet. I don't want to hurt her.

Jump forward. I reconnect with my old *high school* best friend. Go on a few dates, but I keep it quiet. We videochat often. One night, I was drinking cause I had just received some awful news. I am pregnant. I know what I want and it's an abortion. It's not my best friend. I know for sure. He comforts me through videocall. I go to Leaf's room because he had offered me a carrot. I asked Leaf to hold the phone while I eat my carrot with some ranch. Leaf recognizes who it is. Then, suddenly, I hear him say ""This is serious Leaf. Not drunk Leaf. Serious Leaf. I promise I am not drunk. I need to talk to you about her"". I sobered up really fast because I had a bad feelings about what was to come. ""She's not who you think she is."" ""She isn't as good as you think she is"" ""She's gone through six guys""  ""Don't get your feelings involved"" I heard everything I wanted to hear and put my carrot down. I go off on him. Not in an angry way, but in a betrayed, sad way.  I cried. I couldn't take it anymore. I actually like this one, I said. I've rejected many guys. Never gone through them. Has he been sabotaging me this entire time? It was the last straw. Luckily, the guy told me that he wasn't going to listen to Leaf... But... I've bent over backwards for Leaf. Questioned myself as a person because of him. Stepped over my own comfort zones for him. Kept his secrets. I have done everything he had asked. He wanted straightforwardness, but didn't like when I was. Wanted me to hang out with him, but didn't like the way I did my hang outs. Wanted me to talk about my own secrets, but would repeat it back to others...

I found out earlier that he has done this before. Pry someone open. Step over boundaries. Uses his good deeds against others. Try to have sex with his female friends.

Now... I ask... 

Should I kick him out? And if so... How should I go about it?

Should I tell his girlfriend everything that he had said before? If I do... Would it sound like I'm trying to get revenge on him?

He knows about my pregnancy, should I update him, so he doesn't repeat it to others? (the update would be that it turned out to be a miscarriage... Possibly from the sexual assault).

Stupid question, I know, but... Should I still stay his friend even if I kick him out? Would it be worth it?

What do I do?

11,"My housemate recently totaled his car. He managed to sell it off, but the person who took it left the car hood sitting on the grass.

My housemate came to me today and asked me to help him carry the hood out into the woods, he’s just going to leave it there. I told him I had no intention of helping him litter. He told me to suck his dick and then he stormed off, not believing I wouldn’t help him. I’m not sure what to do honestly.

13,"I've been talking to this girl that is in my english class for a couple of weeks, and it's been going really well. We have clicked, and I feel a lot of feelings for her, and she feels the same for me. We have had lots of deep talks, and part of that was our preferences and biases. I am personally very biased against tattoos, and I have always considered them to be the closest thing to a deal breaker. I told her about how I really dislike them, and she had mentioned how she actually wanted one in a casual way. I told her about how I didnt want her to get one in a teasing way, and she said she wouldnt for me. We couldnt see each other due to her being really busy, and I texted her throughout the weekend. Then today, I saw her before class and I noticed she got one on her collarbone, and its not too big, but its very visible. As soon as I noticed it, I felt my mood go really down and I did my best to act normal and I asked her about it. She said she really wanted to and that she was sorry but in a playful way. I am about to see her in like 20 minutes again because I skipped class. What do I do? Am I a shallow piece of garbage? I really care for her but its such a big turn off. Where do I go from here?

15,"hello everyone!! so this is a really confusing and intricate situation so ill just dive right into it

my name is antonio, i'm a 17 year old gay cuban nonbinary individual living in soflo with my mother and father. from a young age, my parents have been pretty shitty :/ probably the most objectively shitty thing theyve done is send me to conversion therapy when i was around 12 years old, but of course theres been many other things, like gaslighting, manipulation, guilt tripping, and just a bunch of verbal and emotional abuse that started wayyy before i was 12. i vividly remember myself wishing they would beat me so that there would be an objective, conclusive piece of evidence that would allow me to get away from them, but that never happened. im totally willing to get into specifics, its just that theres so much, i dont feel like typing it out (and also thats not really the point of this post lol)

&amp;#x200B;

so finally the day ive been dreaming of is approaching! i turn 18 and i have every right to have nothing to do with them ever again. i matured from a young age and ive known that that is a HUGE thing to say for a long time, especially considering how dependent i am on them for so many different things; insurance, food, shelter, my phone bill, etc. but even still considering these things, id rather lack them / have to provide them for myself and be away from them than have to rely on them for it. the idea of them having that control over me even while im away at college is absolutely horrifying. 

&amp;#x200B;

so my real question/purpose behind this post is, how do i go about starting that process? for example, i know that a parent is still responsible for the insurance of their child until they turn 25. but is that something i can opt out of? or would they still have executive say in that situation as my guardians? 

how would i go about cancelling my phone plan and opening my own when i leave the state for university? or should i just leave the phone i have behind and let them deal with it?

could these actions affect how FAFSA regards me as a student, and give me access to more financial aid?

how could i protect myself at my university if they try to involve themselves as my parents? 

&amp;#x200B;

for some more context, we live in palm beach county in florida, and the university i will (hopefully) be attending is Hawai'i Pacific in Honolulu. ive been offered a scholarship by the school that covers about 60% of costs (120,000 of the 200,000 expected tuition + room and board) and am applying to scholarships left and right to make up for the remaining costs. of course, i dont want to take out student loans, but if i have to, im more than willing. 

&amp;#x200B;

and the last thing before i post this, please please please dont respond with sentiments along the lines of ""try to mend the relationship with your parents"" or ""talk to them about it"". ive tried so many times to have conversations with them about the things theyve done to me, how its affected me as ive grown up, but they arent willing to listen. its an absolute tragedy that latinos have such a vibrant culture, but are so toxic in their family dynamics because of their pride and arrogance. the last thing i want to hear is that i should forgive my parents for the wrongs they wont even admit to, much less apologize for. 

&amp;#x200B;

other than that though, any and all help would be super appreciated, be it anecdotal advice or actual legal steps of what i have to do when my birthday hits/when i leave for college. i love u guys, thank u :')",23Apr2019,1

17,"Hey guys, I'm wondering what you think about this

I'm studying in college. Mind you, this is not a big college, this is a small, local one, focused on more practical courses. What this basically means is that most people here are not here because they want to, but because they didn't have the grades to go somewhere else (a few exceptions - some people, and I'm included in this group, are here because they live here and don't have the money to go somewhere else, other people are here because the course isn't available anywhere else).

Here's the thing. There's this guy in my class and he must be the most annoying person I've ever met. I consider myself a pretty calm guy most of the time, but I am really losing my patience here. I'm getting increasingly more annoyed, aggressive, and I don't know how to deal with this anymore apart from getting violent.

This is how every class goes. He will not shut up. At all. For one single minute. He will always be talking loudly to people around him. Every time he knows an answer, he will scream it out loud. Not once, not twice, but three or four times. Constant comments like ""I have everything to be brilliant"" or ""Yea that subject was pretty easy"". Say a teacher asks a question, you answer, and class moves on. He will turn to you and ask ""Sorry, I didn't hear the question, what did she ask?"". After you tell him, he will shout ""WELL OF COURSE THAT'S THE ANSWER!!"". And he's not even that smart!!!! Holy gee. He may get things right, but his grades are downright mediocre, and he didn't even manage to get into the college he wanted to. 

This is how he is outside class: CONSTANTLY putting people down, including strangers. There's a woman at our school who got involved in some kind of unfortunate accident and burnt her face. Every time he sees her, he goes ""Every time it seems like her face is falling off more and more"". Every time a black person passes by us, he makes a racist joke or comment. A black guy in our class has this short, curly hair look, and he grabbed him and went ""Hey your hair looks like a mop. My kitchen is pretty dirty you can come by whenever you want"", despite the guy clearly not engaging or laughing. He has told me that when his ex's mom died, next day she was crying, and he made a joke about her mother (didn't tell me the joke), and the girl broke up with him and completely isolated herself from him and the rest of her class at the time. Like wtf.

He has attacked me too. I don't have facial hair, but it does grow on small bunches, forcing me to clean shave. Sometimes, I don't have time to, and I get this kind of facial hair in some specific spots. One time he was talking to a friend of ours about facial hair, and he started making jokes about how guys with low amounts of facial hair look like creeps, pointing at me. I stopped the conversation I was having and went ""What do you want dude?"", and he just withdrew and went ""Nothing nothing nevermind"". 

The problem is: most of our class likes him, apart from 2-4 people (maybe not coincidentally, the older ones). Everyone else is constantly engaging with him, laughing at his jokes, whatever.  And I feel like if I stand up for myself or call him out on this, everyone will turn on me. I was friends with 2 girls from our class and I used to spend most of my day with them, but they were friends with him too. Eventually I told him I didn't really the guy; they could still be friends with him, but I would not join them whenever he was around. They told me to take a hike and are now actively bullying me as well (laughing loudly every time I pass them in the halls). 

I still get along with the vast majority of people in my class, but he is closer to most of them, apart from 2 girls and 1 guy who will go out of their way to invite me out for coffee or whatever, but even these 3 still enjoy his jokes and being around him.

Going to class has become this awful, resentful experience. I find myself constantly resenting this guy every time he talks in class, but I also end up resenting everyone who encourages him. I get along with people from other courses and I'm good at meeting people, and I've used that to create some distance away from anyone from my class during break hours (since they all sit together and I'm not comfortable at all being around them), but during classes I have nowhere to turn to. Which means I've also started to actively miss classes to be with other people or studying at home.

18,"A friend (F 21) messaged me today over Snapchat, and they seemed extremely distressed. For context, I knew this person had been feeling depressed for a while. Also while we had known eachother for a few years, we had only met in person a handful of times, mostly talking over Snapchat and sometimes going months without contact.

Today their messages became very distressing and I was worried they would harm themselves or worse. Saying she was fine with everything, and how this time she was just finished, things like that. 

She told be not to tell anyone, but when she simply said ""Goodbye"" I feared the worst and contacted her boyfriend (two year relationship, live together).

Apparently she found out, and messaged me saying I broke her trust. She swore at me, said I overreacted, then told me she wanted nothing to do with me anymore.

20,"Hello users of Reddit,

The past 2 years of my life have been by far the worst and most challenging ever. I feel like it is never going to end. My dad left me and my sister (moved to Hawaii) , I got cheated on by the girl I was with for over a year and have to see her walk around with this guy everyday at school (I’m a junior). 

All of these events made me realize how pointless life is and that we are all completely irrelevant. My mom and sister are religious and I was brought up that way. As I looked into it at an older age it is all bs which makes life irrelevant. I believe we are just here for no reason and no matter what I do it won’t actually matter. This causes me to procrastinate all my work (still have a 4.0 so mom doesn’t know), show up to school late, neglect hygiene and search for any quick escapes. 

I find temporary relief with weed and adderal. I hate reality so whatever makes me forgot about it I seek. After the high comes down I feel even worse and it’s just a repetitive cycle. I don’t know what to do or where to start. I’m not trying to complain but this is just how I feel and it makes me so lost. I waste every single day of my life but at the same time it doesn’t matter because I am irrelevant. I could never tell my mom about this as it would break her heart and I don’t think it even matters in the end of things. I guess asking for advice is irrelevant too by this logic but I guess I can try. Is there anything I can do to fix this?",23Apr2019,4
21,"To understand this story, I am going to have to back track to October 2018. My boyfriend and I broke up (one year of dating) and both fell into rebounds. We both were with our rebounds from November to January when we ultimately got back together, but we worked through everything and made changes before officially labeling us as a couple again.  Since then, everything has gone beautifully. We have really worked through our issues and honestly we have been better than ever. 

I must note that my boyfriend and I do not live together, but he comes over to my apartment daily considering where he lives is a two minutes walk to my place. Earlier in the semester, my boyfriend lost a black five subject notebook with all of his notes. It was a huge deal. About a week ago I found a black five subject notebook under my dresser, and I was so excited that I found it that I went to send him a text. Before I sent the text, I opened the notebook, and it turns out he had been journaling. Of course it was not my place to read it, but it capital letters was my name and a section written under it. That is all I read. 

This entry was dated back to two weeks ago. In this entry he writes about the little respect he assumes I have for myself getting with such an ugly rebound. He wrote on and on about how disgusted he was in me. My rebound was a 29 year old coworker who treated me and my sweet kitty with lots of love, and I hate myself for rebounding on him. I wish I was more emotionally ready for a relationship at the time so I wouldn’t have hurt him the way I did. 

Also within this entry it states in reference to his rebound, “Damn it if we weren’t a good match and damn I kind of miss her. In another universe, I suppose.”

I did talk to him about this and told him that I did a horrible thing by reading the entry. He was not upset that I read it because he believes those are things that I should have known. The inner thoughts he has for my self respect, and the thoughts he has about his rebound. He told me, although he misses her because he did like her, that ultimately he wants to be with me because rebound has “too many issues”. 

He has continued on everyday as if nothing happened. Comes over everyday, tells me about his day, and chats all day without acting like anything happened, and maybe I should too. I haven’t brought it up again, but it’s been almost a week and I haven’t let it go. Is this relationship a lost cause? Should I try talking to him again with a different approach to try to get this settled (at least for me)? I’m not sure the next steps to take. 

tldr; boyfriend and I broke up and had rebounds then got back together.  He hasn’t seen rebound in three months and he writes about her in amazing ways and writes about me having little respect for myself because of my rebound. He keeps blowing the situation off because he doesn’t believe he did wrong and I need to decide if this is break up worthy or how I should fix this.",23Apr2019,2
22,"So to start out, my significant other(we’ll call him Tyler) is practicing to become a tattoo artist, he’s learning from a professional, but this means he’s doing practice tattoos on people who want them. Not sure if that’s relevant but here we go.
Basically I drove with a mutual friend of ours to Vegas so said friend wouldn’t have to go alone. Before I left, a girl(we’ll call her Jaiden) showed up at the vape shop where my significant other works at. Tyler tells me he’s doing a tattoo on her to practice, which is completely fine with me. But she was being super touchy with him, which he seemed hesitant about, but other than that things seemed fine. 
About a week later and she’s back because she’s getting free juice for her birthday and immediately when she walked in, asked him for a hug(just from him might I mention) and kissed the top of his head twice?? A couple of times he walked by her to grab her stuff, she brushed his back with her hand which very much bothered me, because hey, Tyler and I are in a monogamous relationship, asshole! I threw around the “babe” word and tried to hiding my jealously which resulted in me getting up and telling him I was getting food(normal tone, no sign of me being distressed). I wonder if I’m being irrational, I trust Tyler, he followed me when I tried to leave and knew I was upset. He reassured me things were okay, chick’s known for sleeping around (politest way I can put it), and then he goes as far as to “yell” that he loves me which made me smile a lot. :) I love him but is there a way I can talk to the girl and express my concerns with her touchy behavior without losing my cool?",23Apr2019,3

26,"Hello reddit, I’m a 14 year old girl in my last year of middle school. Lately I’ve been arguing a lot with my friend (not my only friend but we are REALLY close). At the start of our friendship we would never argue because I would either ignore it if she said something rude or just apologize first for doing the simplest mistakes like not waiting for when she’s leaving class or not wanting to talk. Later I thought to myself that if she expects these things of me, I should raise my expectations as well. So when she didn’t wait for me when class ended, I thought I HAD the right to be mad. When she doesn’t want to talk, and I’m in the mood to do so, I can be mad. Turns out, NO I CANT.( I realized I was being petty so I stopped doing this btw, but she still hasn’t) . Now, let me tell you of something that JUST happened(2days ago)! So buckle your seatbelts and get ready for this crazy roller coaster I call “frieNdShiP”. 

Now getting to the actual story:
(F is friend obvi lol)

I was talking to her about the upcoming events at our school (we want to join a club together) and f was not listening and looking at her phone very uninterested in everything I said so I thought I would stop talking and picked up my phone for some good old waluigi memes. Seeing I stopped talking, f thought it was a great idea to start talking about something that’s completely not relevant to anything I was saying and about her own personal life. Now, I know friends listen to each other’s problems and that is what friends are for but we had SPECIFICALLY met up to talk about the club we were planning on joining. I thought nothing of it at the time and continued to nod away and try not to smirk at my memes. She then SISTER SNATCHED my PHONE and proceeded to tell me about how rude I was for not listening. Again, I was like OK SORRY it’s rude of me not to listen to you and thought “im not in the mood for her shit rn”. She moved to the other couch and just started texting. I said to her, “are you going to continue?” She looks at me dead in the eye and goes, “nah”. I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU THT SHE CREATED A WHOLE SCENE FOR THIS BTW. My dumb ass was like, “OkkkK...?” And then picked up my phone for more memes. F then starts sighing and trying to peek at my phone (I didn’t know she was mad because I was confused) i then thought “oh she probably wants to see some memes!” OH H E L L NAW she def didn’t. After turning my phone at her to show my memes and lighten the mood, she looks at me and goes , “IS THIS WHY YOU WERENT LISTENING TO MY PROBLEMS?!?! WHAT TYPE OF FRIEND ARE YOU?!?!”. I was ABOUT TO SNAP AT HER AND TELL HER HOW SHE WAS A FUCKING HYPOCRITE... but I didn’t. I’m not that easily angered so I told her, “ I’m sorry, you are right” and expected her to apologize for yelling at least. She didn’t even know she was supposed to apologize. She said and I quote, “ ig that’s ok, but next time you do it I’m going to ignore you for a WHILE” ok, NOW I snapped. I told her, as calmly as I could, “ok, don’t I get an apology? I was only on my phone because u weren’t listening to me in the first place...” she then turned RED. How dare I expected her to apologize (I’m usually always the one to apologize first and maybe even the only one to do so. I’m really passive and I try to understand why people are mad if they are my beloved friends) she said, “ I WAS DOING SOMETHING IMPORTANT WHILE YOU WERE JUST LOOKING AT MEMES!” (I started tearing up at this point because I hate getting yelled at by people because of a past experience) she then yelled at me to stop crying and I always cried and it was getting really old. I started full on bawling and tried telling that i couldn’t stop but that only made things worse.  (she doesn’t know about the event btw so I don’t exactly blame her) after a couple of minutes and washing my face, she started acting like NOTHING HAPPENED. Ok, NOW I got P I S S E D. “Then what were you doing?” I asked f responded with a “what?” I said, again, “then what were you doing on your phone?” She said, “are you still not over that?” My eyes started tearing up again, but this time because I was hurt (and also I don’t cry the second time lol) I said, “ no, I’m not over it. Can you please tell me what you were doing that was so important so it allowed you to ignore me and get mad when I did literally the SAME thing” she said, she was texting her mom. For the last 30 minutes. She was texting her “mom”. Now, I gave her the benefit of the doubt and said fine but you still raised your voice and i think I deserve at least an apology” she said, “LOL u def ain’t getting one for being so sensitive and plus I didn’t even do anything wrong lololol !” I got angry and left without a word. She didn’t try talking to me at school or text me, and this time, I sure as hell will NOT apologize. What am I supposed to do now? Should I wait for her to calm down and apologize to her or should I just not do anything. I’m just really confused. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",23Apr2019,1

28,"I wrote a lot so this is more of a rant but I just want help. Note, I am only 13 so this may seem small but all these little small things adds up in the end and makes me want to stop being hear friend. I talk about a lot of stuff she has done but not everything... 

Eight grade sucks but nobody should have a friend like this.

It isn't as worse as some other posts on this subreddit, but I have a friend who only thinks of herself. It just ruins the fun. I'll begin with a small but very annoying thing she does. Me and my friends play basketball. So there is my oldest friend with her sister, my friend who I am talking about, and my best friend who is also my neighbor. Me, my best friend, and the friend I am talking about always take turns being o my oldest friend and her sister's team. However, when it comes to her turn she is always saying something like ""Let's shoot and whoever misses has to be on their team!"" Then she picks a spot where she is good at shooting from. My other friend isn't that good at the very close up shots and she is more of a 3 pointer type of person so she misses and goes on their team. Or we have to randomly pick cards, whoever gets the scribble is on their team. Stuff like that. She also constantly changes rules in basketball to the point of ""Are we even playing basketball anymore?""

She gets cornered a lot and doesn't know what to do so she will just hold the ball and run out of the corner. She make a rule allowing you to hold the ball? What? She is a bad ball hogger so she won't even pass the ball. How many times have we not been able to score because of her because she won't pass it? A lot of times. Or she makes a rule saying it is ok if the ball is out on your, whoever gets the ball when it gets out gets the ball. Really stupid rules...

When I say ""You can't do that!"" She will say, ""You always complain!"" or ""This is OUR basketball rules and WE can change it to make it more fun."" One, it isn't fun, two this isn't communism! (Bad joke, but whatever.)

Ok so that is the basketball side of things. Next up, the things that just make me rage. So I have found a little hack I have found to make an admin account in the school laptops and download vpn so you can go on any websites and download whatever you want too. It is kind of a lengthy process, using third party stuff. Anyways I did it for my friends, and he thought my friend did it for ME so he asked her and she said sure and she promised. Then while we were in line at lunch he told her ""So when will you do the hacking thingy?"" She looked at me and said, ""Can you do it for him?""

I said no and she said, ""Well, I already promised you will do it."" Like wtf? She is going to make a great entitled parent when she grows up...

I have told her how bad that was and she said, ""I already promised so just do it. Come on. You are so selfish.""

She always ignores me and if I don't hear her, (I have bad hearing,) she gets mad!

She gets mad for the smallest things and then doesn't talk for me, or tries to get my other friends to run away from me but thankfully I have informed one of them why she does that and now she doesn't do it anymore. Then at the end of the day, she says ""It was just a prank!""

Yes! Let me punch you and say that was just a prank! Speaking of punching, she used to do that all the time last year! She would punch me in the stomach and one time she punched me too hard and I told her and she told me to grow up.

There is much more stuff she does but it is all little things and I want to go on a big rant too her because I don't want to be a fake friend hiding stuff behind people. I ranted to my best friend and she agrees with me. I don't know if she notices this stuff...

Sorry this was too long. I am just sick of this and I have to get it off my chest and ask how I should fix it.

Is it my fault or hers?",23Apr2019,2
29,"At 18 I wanted to become a cop and pursue a career in law enforcement. At 21 I got sick and that made me ineligible to pursue a military career or law enforcement career because of my auto immune disease. 

I then worked in construction from 21-25. Found I didnt like doing that either so I decided to go back to school. 

Now I am in school and work as a caregiver. But my career ideas are up in the air again. I dont know what I want to do or where I want to go. I just know my interests and next semester I will be a softmore and will have to start settling down on a major. 

I have interests and curiosity in business specifically in the world of health care, tech, and investing/real estate. But I'm not interested in accounting. More entrepreneurship and administration. I love the learning about consumer trends and marketing and the idea of investing money. But I'm so tired of changing my mind or not having my mind made up but I want to get a degree that is malleable and applicable to several industries and business seems like a good one.

32,"I have been an introvert all my life, I know being like this is a normal thing for many people, but for me it has escalated to the point I just hate being who I am sometimes. Since a really young age I isolated myself from the outside world and that created a fear of speaking to others I'm just starting to solve.

I'm 17, currently doing the Junior year of HS, and I  never had any person I could call a friend until a couple months ago, when I started the school year (which btw, it was the first time for me going to school in years, but that's a whole other story).

At the beginning of the year I encouraged myself to talk more and meet people, at first it was the most difficult task ever because I wanted to be friendly, but my unconcious also avoided social interaction whenever it could. With time i've managed myself to get a small group of friends. I and also got myself on some activities that helped me knowing more people and getting more confidence like Cross Country and Track. Those where honestly one of the most heartwarming experiences I've ever had, but I still have constant letdowns and mental breakdowns, sometimes I don't even know why I get them, and when I know, I feel totally useless and loose all my desire for talking and my self encouragement. 

At some point I know there's more people I would like to know, but I don't feel capable. I also experienced what having a crush on someone feels like, it's great, but also feels horrible trying to express my feelings about somebody and just pushing me back EVERY TIME because I fear that person my not even be interested. Even getting to know people I like is an imposible task because I don't know when or how to make conversation flow. Besides, I live in the US, but English is not my first language, so whenever I get anxious my words get mixed up.

I think the main reason for all of this is that I never had a father figure that did father stuff like teach me how to play sports or how to defend myself. Also, most of my childhood I wen't to an all-boys school where I was bullied to the point of failing all my classes and hating talking to people who weren't my family. I wrote this to clear my mind, but if anybody has any advice to leave my comfort zone, build more confidence, or have more courage to ask someone out and know new people I'll appreciate it.",23Apr2019,1

35,"The moment you walk in the house its like sticking your face in a bucket of algae.

&amp;#x200B;

The shower reeks of algae, the kitchen sink faucet reeks of algae, the garden hose reeks of algae.

&amp;#x200B;

After I shower my hair smells strongly of algae for days, the water tastes like algae, my clothes are reek of algae and the worst part is any thing boiled, like pasta, tastes like algae. Spaghetti is my favorite food but I ate it yesterday and it honestly tasted like straight algae covered in tomato sauce. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom says my tongue is messed up, so I ate and drank different foods that hadn't been in contact with our water, they all tasted fine. Neither of my parents have noticed anything wrong. I thought maybe I was going crazy so I took some spaghetti, ask my friend to try it and tell me if it tasted weird, had my friend smell my hair and clothes. She said yes the spaghetti tastes like it was made with pond water, my hair smelled of algae and so did my clothes.  Idk why my parents are doing this? Our house is clean and my mom has always absolutely hated bad smells, surely even if they are sense blind to it they would have noticed it the first time? I can't believe that actually don't taste/smell it because it is \*very\* strong. When I asked them about it they get real defensive and angry and try to avoid the subject. It's weird.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something I can do, like make some kind of solution and pour it down the sinks and bathroom drains to kill the algae? I hate smelling like a pond. I hope its algae, I'm not sure what the difference in smell is between mold and algae but the spaghetti tasted the way moss smells in the rain, thats the only way I can describe it.

Because of his addiction he was kicked out of his home and since then has been temporarily living in different places with different people until now, he’s struggling to find somewhere to live.

40,"I've never been successful at anything other than being somewhat good at speaking English (I speak Spanish originally). When I was a kid I was raised between my aunt, grandmother and mother. No dad, no grandfather. No father figure. I am an only child from a single mother, raised in a super overprotective environment.

Until I was 10, I was one of the top students at my class, which wasn't a great deal tbh. But that changed when I got transferred to another school and my mom and I moved to a new house just by ourselves. I started seeing my aunt and grandmother only on weekends and my grades were lower and lower. I saw my mom only by night after she came home from work and I became depressed because my school life was a mess. I was bullied and made fun of everyday.

Monthly, there were these 'meetings' between all my classmates' parents in which they received a sheet of paper with our grades. Besides English having 10s only, None of my grades were higher than 5, and many were even under that. When my mom saw that sheet and came home, she yelled at me for my results, slapped me very hard in the face, sometimes she grabbed a wooden stick to beat me with. She even broke it on my head because of how hard she had hit me. Many days I had to wear a long-sleeved shirt to school because my arms were bruised from the encounters and I had to hide them. Not that anyone would have cared though, but still.


I managed to pass every year though without having to repeat years. And now I'm at the University at another city (I moved from my mom's) but flaking miserably, I'm paying for it but I feel that I cannot keep going anymore. I'm just losing my time I think. I've been learning some woodworking and honestly working on that would be my life dream I don't know what to do anymore. I've been having these flashbacks about my mom beating me and it makes me sad every time. I came to mom's home for Easter's but we had a discussion which made my mind go nuts and began having the flashbacks. This had never happened before in my life, I had to come to the bathroom to cry in peace.

What should I do? I haven't told this to anyone ever at all. It kinda feels a bit better to tell it though. Even when there's a possibility that no one will read it.

But if you do, thank you a lot.

43,"I (F21) split with my first boyfriend(M now 21) at 17 as I fell out of love with him and wanted to be single for university. 
To summarise, my mother(F40) was not happy and simply told me I’d never find another like him and I was supposed to be “end game” with him. She bullied me over the internet about the break up for the next 4 months after slating my life choices, begging me to get back with him and sharing confidential information about my mental health with him and between her friends.  Our relationship was fine prior to the break up. 

Now she still talks to him over private message, likes his and his now girlfriends posts together and berates my new partner because he isn’t my first.  He isn’t over me and has made this well known to me where possible and I do get messages here and there from him when he is low in mood. 

Please tell me this isn’t normal? What can I do? I block him on her social media where possible but it’s always undone by her.. feels like I can never fully get him out of my life?",23Apr2019,3

My issue is that I desperately want to move back to my old state. Its where all my friends and connections are. Its a great state I really enjoyed living in. How... does one go about finding both a job and an apartment not only in another state but a state thats many, many states away?

51,"Hi, I am M19 student and have been part time working in a bar for half a year. In our bar it was never officially allowed for us employees to drink anything but water unless we pay for it. However nobody really cared about it and it was pretty common to give coffee, sodas or beer to coworkers for free (never to guests). Now a couple weeks ago our boss implemented new devices to track how many drinks we tap. It had a strong effect the first few days and then diminished more and more. Fast forward today, I had a very stressful day, my coworker has his very last day before he moves to the other side of our country and I was more or less fine giving him and his friends (3 ppl) free beer for 3 rounds. I kinda thought they would at least pay for one round to make it less obvious, but they didn't really care (oh what a surprise) and now I am afraid my boss will tomorrow just check his computer and see that there is way too much beer missing (we always miss a bit, since we sell a lot and there's some beer canceled etc.) and he might get really mad with me. Anything for me to do here, or is it just, well if it gets called out I am kinda screwed and will need to take responsibility? I honestly don't know why I did it, I mean we are nice and friendly to each other but not exactly friends and I just wanted my peace while finishing/cleaning my bar (they came to drink short before closing)  so I simply said ok. The more I think about it, the more I regret it. I prolly wouldn't mind if it was just one round of beer. I could tell my boss without regret, that is if he would even ask me (prolly not) about it, ""yeah it's his very last day and I wanted to give him a nice last memory and gave it him, I am sorry I shouldn't have done it""

53,"Hey guys-
This might be a little long winded, so bear with me.

I own a 2008 ford ranger. It has a differential issue which will be $700 to fix, along with a brake issue that should be warranty, and a couple other minor things.

I may be moving 800 miles away this year. I’ve been debating a new vehicle for a while now, but here’s my dilemma:

I don’t have too much as far as possessions go, but among those is a 1000+ lb toolbox, for which I’ll need a trailer or something.

If I buy a new car, I’d want a sedan or something, and would end up having to rent a uhaul truck to move all my stuff, and tow my new car behind it.

I don’t want to put more money in the ranger, as I do really want to get something soon with better mileage, and a better passenger capacity. I don’t need a truck.

The advantage of it though, is if I do fix it up (I don’t trust it presently to go cross country), I can get away with renting a small 4x8 trailer, and driving that to my new home. I can always do that, and deal with it for the time until I do decide to sell it and get something new.

Hopefully all of that made sense.


Again, I don’t feel like it’s really worth it to put even more money into a truck that is only worth ~$4000, however I feel like by doing this I’ll save more in the long run just because of moving costs. Does repairing my truck sound like the better route?

Thanks.

Back to the topic, we gave each other a few months and then late February came along and outta the blue she contacted me and we started talking a lot, we hanged out and FaceTimed everyday for like 2 weeks, felt like everything was going great and outta nowhere went cold on me, felt so sudden because pretty sure it was an overnight thing. Contacted her to see if everything was alright and she said she was “fine” so I dropped it. Ever since that it’s been inconsistent chatting with her, we will talk for like 2-3 days or 1 good day and then she will go cold, I’m really trying to build a friendship with her lol and I told her about it and what she thought and she agreed with it but it seems like she doesn’t really care or her actions don’t really match up with her words.

Both he and I are young (20's) and so I don't think sending a text would be an issue (versus a call) and he'd appreciate it regardless and know my pure intentions. The way I see it, a text is less intrusive than a call at this moment in time. He would feel more obligated to answer a call right then and there versus being able to glance at a text at any time he has a minute.

61,"Hi, I’m new to Reddit so sorry If I do anything wrong.

Anyways, a backstory; I was In a relationship with my ex for about two years, during the end of this relationship we started arguing a lot, and things were becoming extremely unhealthy. At the same time, I had this best friend, who absolutely hated my girlfriend at the time, and every now and then my best friend would be a little flirty, (but I think that’s just her personality though) a month passes by, and I move into college. (a couple states away) and I thought this may be good for our relationship since we needed some time apart. I come back to visit and me and my ex are straight back to arguing, moving to college just seemed to make it worse. One night, Im talking to my best friend about how to make the relationship better, and she told me yet again, to break up with her, and later on during the conversation, she said something along the lines “I should be your girlfriend, she shouldn’t,” and at the time, I didn’t think much of it, I just let it slide, but eventually me and my ex ended our relationship. About 4 months go by and I’m back home for winter break, and I start hanging with my best friend everyday, and this is when I started catching feelings. During the end of break, I told her that I have feelings for her, she said something along the lines “I’m so glad you told me, I have feelings for you too, but I can’t right now, I just got out of a relationship and I’m not ready.” So I told her that’s perfectly fine, do whatever makes you happy, I’m going to be in college until summer, so maybe we can try it out then, and she agreed. During the time span from January to now, I visited my hometown a couple times, and I have been getting mixed feelings from her, sometimes she’s touchy, flirty, and I sometimes see her just straight up staring at me in my peripheral, but other times she does not seem interested at all. Now, I’m currently finishing up my first year of college, finals in about 3 weeks, and she is constantly talking about her ex, about how much she loves him, of how she can’t love anyone else but him, and how much she wants him back. 

This girl and I pretty similar, we have the same personality, we have the same interests and we could be perfect together, she even said all of this herself. She keeps telling me that I should come live with her in boston when she buys her new apartment, and how she wants to visit me in my new house in Maine and chill by the beach. But now I’m just really confused...I think she just wants to feel loved and that’s why she keeps talking to her ex, but why does she mention that to me? She knows that we stated we have mutual feelings so why bring it up?

It’s one of those situations where they’re good friends, but absolutely horrible roommates (loud, messy, inconsiderate, etc.), and I’ve been trying to move out for well over a year. I haven’t mentioned anything to them about wanting to leave yet, but a room on-campus with some other friends recently opened up, and I’ll finally be able to move out. 

The main issue is that the friends I’m living with are brothers, and their parents are our landlords (this is a house they bought specifically for us; not one they previously owned). I would’ve loved to give them ample notice, but it’s currently the end of April and I would be moving out some time in August for the start of next school year.

76,"(I’m 21, older brother is 24)

I always looked up to my older brother when I was a kid. I wanted to be just like him. I don’t know what happened and when it started but he’s like stranger to me now. It has been like for over 5 years and since I’m not the type to confront people, I have never really told him about it + the fact he’s like a stranger to me, kinda scary, very stubborn blah blah blah blah blah. 

He’s the type of person to think his way is the best and he always pushes you to do things the way he does, otherwise he judges you in a very patronising way. I remember one time my sister went to the gym for the first time and the first thing he does when she comes home is fire questions at her, almost as if he’s interrogating her
“How long did you work out for?”
“How long on the treadmill? Speed? Any incline?
“Did you do any weights? How heavy?”
My brother chuckles a little bit. “You run on 6? That’s way too easy. I do 9” (I can’t remember the exact numbers but whatever). It isn’t just gym related, he does this when he’s teaching her maths. If it’s ‘easy’ but she still doesn’t understand, she’s an idiot, according to my brother. He forces us to do things we don’t want to do e.g. when I’m playing a game and he’s watching ‘do this, do that, go there, kill that’ etc, tells us to do push-ups when we clearly don’t want to, us being me, my younger sister and also my younger brother (who happens to be disabled). There are many other examples that I want to address but I don’t want to write too much.

Maybe it’s because of that I started to become very uncomfortable around him. The way he talks to us is almost like a stranger - it doesn’t have that casual/comfortable flair that you normally have when speaking with a sibling/best friend. I’ve noticed that I subconsciously avoid him when I’m back home and I don’t think that’s a normal thing to do when this is your brother. When we’re having dinner, I pray to God he doesn’t open his mouth to talk to me. I’m probably happiest when I’m not around him, and that’s not a very nice thing to say about your own brother.

My mom suggested biomedical engineering and it does sound interesting but I just don’t know. The problem I always have is that I want to do good in the world, to help people, to have enough money to support my family well, to be well known, to make a change, to be free from normal work routines, to have time for a personal life and there really isn’t anything that can meet all my criteria. 
Sometimes I just think that I am still young and naive and in real life you can’t have it all but it’s still something I’d like to achieve. 
Anyway, my strengths and interests are definitely in the math and science area and do not excel in any of the arts.

84,"
March of 2018 my girlfriend moved 1,500 miles away from home in order to start a new life with me as young adults. We did long distance for about a year and eventually were able to make the move happen.

She didn't just move from home though, she moved from her single father and her younger brother who is in high school. Her father got in a divorce with the mother of my girlfriend nearly 7 years ago. In order to cope with this, for years now he has abused alcohol and prescription drugs. He never really recovered from it until last year when he began dating for the first time in years. He seemed to be happy again, and had even began to quit using drugs. 
My girlfriend was so happy to see her dad happy again, as she hadn't really seen it since she was a little girl. 

The other day, he was driving his girlfriend to a doctors appointment and planned on picking her up a bit later once she was finished. As he showed up, he was approached by police who told him he was under arrest for domestic abuse. He had absolutely no idea what was going on, but was taken to jail regardless. He has now been in jail for over 24 hours, bail has been posted and he will be out by morning hopefully. 

I've talked to my girlfriend about this. Some might say she is bias being his daughter, and that's understandable. As for me, I don't believe she is, because when her dad has fucked up with drugs, alcohol, etc she openly confronts him and has definitely holds him accountable. She told me how when she was smaller she witnessed her mother lay hands on him, and he always kept his composure and never laid a finger on her once. From how well I know him, and how much he cherishes the women in his life, including his daughter, I don't believe he would ever do this. 

Anyways, no one was able to get ahold of his girlfriend after this incident. So tonight my girlfriend attempted to reach out to his girlfriend via Facebook Messenger with a simple message of ""Can we talk?"" She opened the message and ignored her, so Kayla tried to call her, she denied the call, then blocked her account. Before she blocked her, she noticed she had unfriended her and updated her relationship status to single. To me this just suggests that there isn't much validity in anything she claimed happened. My girlfriend 1,500 miles way is no threat to her, and if her story was true, there shouldn't have been any sort of problem with trying to explain what is going on.

So here is where I need advice. My girlfriend is terrified when her dad gets out of jail and finds out she has fucked him over and completely removed herself from his life based on claims that we believe are false, he is going to sink into a deep depression again as he did after his divorce. She is afraid he is going to go back to abusing drugs and alcohol, and could eventually even kill himself unintentionally with the substances he has a history of abusing. He recovered from a divorce from years ago, only to date again for about a year, and then this happens. How do I console my girlfriend? How do we console her dad from so far away after something so life changing happened so fast? This is really a tough situation for everyone involved. I could really use advice right now. 

Note -- I'm not here to debate whether or not you think he assaulted his girlfriend, false accusations are all too common in the United States, and once they're made, there is really nothing men can do to completely prove their innocence, even when little evidence is provided to say they are guilty, and until you personally know someone, it's really difficult to determine what you think they're capable of.",23Apr2019,1

86,"I have been working at my current job (construction) for over two years.  The people are great,  but I do not see my self wanting to work there for the rest of my life or make a career out of it.  I have been offered a few different career opportunities including apprenticeships, management courses and various other courses but have just said I'd think about it. The truth is I don't enjoy my job and there are days where I just plain hate it.  I don't have enough spare time to do much anymore and sometimes I just call in sick because I want to get stuff done. 

I've been thinking of this for a while, I want to study this year or early next. The intakes for university are either July coming or February nect year. I want to leave my job and take a few months off to just self improve before university starts where I will study either business or law. Likely business as I'd like to work overseas in Asia eventually. 

There are many things I'd like to do, get my full lisence, hit the gym,  get surgery,  dental work and improve my posture. I feel as though I should do these things while I am young (21) before I get too old and m trapped. I just don't have the time to do these things whilst at my current job. I have saved a decent amount of money since working but I could work part time to afford my rent until my courses for school start. Financially it wouldn't be a problem, but I am a very indecisive person and am quite frugal and paranoid about spending. I'm a bit nervous of a drastic change in income, but am willing to take a chance with it if it were to improve my life. 


So, should I leave my construction job to self improve before university starts? Has anyone been in a similar situation as mine and what advice could anyone give me? If need more details I'm happy to share.",23Apr2019,3

I had protected POV sex with a girl and we both gave each other unprotected oral. To be precise, I “tried” giving her oral, but I only did it for a second, because she tasted salty and I couldn’t do it. 

After about a week I got a sore throat which would only hurt if I swallowed. Now I had this sore throat for about 4-5 days and it got worse and my throat is all red. The pain would also move from one side to another and in the centre and it’s a very sharp pain when swallowing. I’ve been also feeling kinda weak and had lower back pain yesterday, which resolved after a few hours, but I still feel weakness in my lower body (like when I get cold or flu). I’ve been feeling really off these past 4-5 days. 

Today I woke up and I feel kinda worse than yesterday: my throat is no longer red, but my tongue is yellow and my tonsils are white and I feel really weak and I my heart rate is high. I’m starting to get worried.

94,"I'm in an ldr of one year with my best friend. We met online in August of 2017 and hit it off immediately. At the time I was 16 and had no intention of being anything more than friends with him. However the following March he told me that he liked me and a month after that (then 17) we began to date. I hid him from my family for nine months because I was underage at the time and my family would've gone crazy. After he came down for a festival and met my mom, things blew up. She saw right through my plan which led to months of emotional pain. I'd wake up every morning (we fall asleep on the phone every night; even then when I had my phone) terrified because I didn't know if that day would be the day my phone got taken for good. I didn't know if I'd hear from him ever again. I didn't know if today would be an extreme day with hours upon hours of discussion and yelling about what happened or a good day with only an hour of talking about it. 

Fast forward to now, (things have been a lot better and he's visited me and my family once a month for the pat eight months (totaling about three months down here)) I'm 18 and have been thinking seriously about where I want to go to college these past eight months or so. I really wanted nothing more than to be near him because right now he's 330 miles away from me. I asked my mom if I could go to a university near him, one which happens to offer one of the best nursing programs in the US; nursing is something I've wanted to do for probably a decade). Promptly, this led to a three hour shouting match about how she'd do everything in her power to make sure I wouldn't go up there because she didn't want me to get pregnant. Since I was 17 at the time, I had no choice but to let it go.

Things have been tremendously better since I turned 18. For nearly three months I never heard a sour word about him which was heavenly. Then, I told her I wanted to visit him and his parents (still haven't met them or anyone he knows) after I graduate this May before school gets busy in the fall along with work. Literally my only chance to go see him for an extended period of time. He's self employed so it's easier for him to see me. Nonetheless, I love him dearly and it is necessary for me to go up there. 

I feel like I'm being cheated out of the life decisions that really matter and affect my future. I want to tell her that I'm going anyways, even if she doesn't approve because I can't always get approval and I need to put myself first. I'd appreciate any thoughts or encouraging words you may have. This is honestly all I think about anymore and it consumes me. It is very unhealthy.",23Apr2019,1

I'm attending a career fair soon and one of the vendors happens to be listed several times in lists of places that have good work environments.

103,"my wife, two-year old daughter and i live with her mother. also in the house is my wife’s brother who is 19-years old. brother has: no father in the picture, chron’s disease, not completed high-school as he was kicked out for lack of attendance, no job (mom won’t allow it because it will interfere with gov’t insurance), plays video games from morning to night with minimal breaks, hardly leaves the house, very little social life outside of snapchat and online gaming, and...the most defining aspect of his personality, very, very, very violent tendencies towards, particularly, his mother. 

this isn’t a recently developed dynamic. for as long as i have been with my wife i have heard stories of him, in a fit of rage, locking his mother in the garage as she went in to grab something. or calling her names from “dumb b*tch” to “stupid motherf*cker” and everything in between. 

this sort of behavior hasn’t subsided. perhaps he isn’t so bold as to lock his mother in the garage anymore, but the name calling is frequent; particularly when he is upset with her (which really occurs anytime he can’t get what he wants.) he has a propensity for slamming and hitting things as well. there is a rather large hole in his mother’s bedroom door from where he’s punched through. and as recently as just a few hours ago of this post, yelled a few obscenities at his mother while repeatedly hitting a different door in the house. 

yes, the cops have been called on him by neighbors who have overheard the yelling, screaming, and banging. but nothings come of it. 

by this point, i know what you’re thinking: “well, what about the mom?”

to put it lightly, she’s indifferent. 50-something, in menopause, and who is looking forward to some day where she can vacation in the beach with her life partner. she isn’t a saint. she can be extremely irritating and irritable, i’ll admit, with incredibly thin patience, but does not react violently towards her son. as a matter of fact, has not reprimanded him physically since he about was six. in many, many ways she’s an enabler. 

but when brother is not around, mother is much more tolerable, calmer and happier, to her own admittance. the thing is, she feels bad for her son. no matter what, she excuses him. it’s either his illness, or lack of father, etc. but it’s never him. even when he attacks her. she knows he treats her poorly, but is too lazy/and feels too sorry for him to do anything about it. it’s a very circular and toxic cycle. 

my question is: what can my wife and i do? we are both going to school to make a way into our respective careers. hence, why were living with her (the only place we have to live, really, so moving out isn’t an option) but we hate the idea that our two-year old daughter is forced to witness, either visually or audibly, these violent, childish fits. he is a danger to his own mother—whether she wants to acknowledge it or not—and he is sure to inflict more property damage the more upset he becomes. 

he won’t voluntarily seek help, mother won’t push it on him either. police can’t do much cause mother excuses him and apologizes on his behalf every time they’re called. and we truly feel it’s only a matter of time he puts someone’s life in danger on a night where he’s pushed too far. what can we do?",23Apr2019,1

Let me start from the beginning, my mother tells me that shes going to take my siblings on vacation from April 9th - April 20th to Florida (Driving the whole way). Why? Well I'm in college and my spring break already past. 

I only heard from my mother April 11, April 15 and then Easter. I paid no mind until tonight, overhearing my father ask her when she'll come home. She didn't give a response. 

Today,April 22nd, is when my siblings were suppose to go back to school. My father repeatedly demands she tell him when they will come home to New York. She refuses. She refuses to let him talk to my sisters and claims he mentally abuse them and will file domestic abuse on her. (All BS from my point of view, I only heard him reiterate what she's saying and him being confused.) My dad explains they need to go to school and he cares about their education. He only keeps demanding for an explanation as to when he will see his kids. ""If they're not back by Thursday, I'm going to family court.""

I sat here trembling, hearing his reaction to her saying she won't because she always planned to move and expects him to come too. (I love this part.) He questions her logic as to just previously stating he abuses all of them and asks does she understand what shes saying. Eventually I listen to my father break down in tears and tell her to hang up.

Immediately she calls me asking what I'm doing. I act oblivious and 'normal'. She tells me to call hee on my break inbetween classes tomorrow.

Now here I am, not even in tears until I heard my father cry. I expect my mother to convince me to be on her side for whatever happens in the next couple days. I feel so sicken and lost that I might not see my siblings in a long time. I know my parents have argued in the past and shes cussed him out several times. Also claiming she's going to divorce him.

We are graduated from high school as of this June, and my partner works a full time job. I am at home with baby all the time. I am going to start to attend college to get my career going so I can provide for my little family. 
As of right now, we don’t have enough money to provide for ourselves at all, and we are still minors. This means we can’t live in our own place. So we switch between our parents’ houses. It’s hard to keep up with finding rides to appointments, work, etc. because everyone has different schedules. It is so overwhelming to switch between houses when there is so much tension and frustrations...
The biggest frustration is my partners’ family. It’s a house with a few rooms but lots of people, including kids ages 14-19. Some children are my partner’s children, some are not and just staying there. My partner and I always had a place there in his room. After he got a job, we started to pay for our own stuff such as food, gas $, formula for baby, basically anything we needed. On top of this, we give the house all of our WIC (government food) benefits. Now his mother is telling us we need to pay 100$ rent (we have never paid rent before, we have always had this room before I got pregnant, and it is her legal child) every month (keep in mind we are still minors, pay for our own stuff). Nobody else in the house has a job or pays any type of rent. On top of this, she constantly asks to borrow gas money for UNNECESSARY car rides to visit her boyfriend. She goes out a few times a week and doesn’t buy food often for the house. What do I do? What do I tell her? What do I tell my partner? How do I approach the fact that she is awful at budgeting and needs to be more responsible with her money? Do I tell my partner to stop enabling her?",23Apr2019,1
110,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I’m on mobile so excuse the format. 

I don’t know where to start this and it’s eating me up inside I feel like such an asshole. 

Backstory: I’m a 21 year old female who has been with two people throughout my life. The first guy I dated, I was 14 and we dated for a year. My second boyfriend I met when I was 16 and we have been dating for almost 5 years now. 

We have a great relationship. He’s my best friend, we get along great. Our sex life (sorry tmi) is amazing too. 

My problem is I’ve started to develop a crush on one of our mutual friends. I’ve been friends with him for awhile now and literally nothing changed between how we talk or anything. Out of the blue I just started to realize I liked him more than a friend? 

I feel so confused and my heart hurts I feel like such a piece of shit. I don’t really know why I feel this way. Is there anything I can do to make these stupid feelings go away?",23Apr2019,1
111,"As of late, I have had a real struggle with maintaining motivation and fighting depression. I am  currently in my last year of university. I have had rough time bringing up my GPA, got OWVI now I am worried employers wont hire me, and I have trouble connecting with friends and family. 

During this time I think I need to reevaluate somethings and figure out what is important to me. I often think if I wasn't in school I don't know what I would be doing. So I think if I can rekindle what makes me passionate for living it can guide me on a good path and start figuring things out.

So, I would like you guys to share with me what are some of your passions and how did you guys figured out what you're passionate about.",23Apr2019,1

113,"I’m graduating law school soon and I have two professors that I love and I want to do something special for them. I bought this one professor a relevant shirt that I think he’ll appreciate (it’s tailored for him— specifically references a case we talked about in class). However, I commissioned a comic book cover poster for another professor. It fits his personality since he loves superheroes. It’s a picture of him as a superhero and has references to him throughout! It’s awesome. 

However, I feel kinda awkward because I don’t know how to give it to him. This professor is younger (38) and we have a professional but casual relationship (it’s not uncommon for him to go out drinking or do other fun events with his students).

The problem is I’m a girl and I sometimes think that gets in the way of us having a closer (platonic) relationship. So I don’t want him to think this is... weird. I genuinely wanted to do it as appreciation. 

So how should I give this to him? When he’s alone in his office? At graduation? 

I may be overthinking it but I would really appreciate any advice! 

Also: I’m not going to act like I don’t have a crush on him (he’s single, so it’s not a big deal). But I don’t want to give off a vibe that I did this because of that fact. I want to make clear I got my other professor a very thoughtful gift as well.",23Apr2019,2

116,"I'm a senior student at a university with only about two weeks before graduation... I've been extremely overwhelmed with finishing assignments, preparing for graduation and moving out among other things. I also have been struggling greatly with depression, anxiety and promiscuity. Everything has been going well during the last few weeks though, I took a break from going out to clubs and have been doing assignments and haven't had a drop to drink. 

I have been talking to a therapist about how I tend to over drink sometimes and end up having sex with different friends. This is not something I'm proud of it's terrible and I feel absolutely horrible about it. So on Friday, I went out to support a friend who was DJing and I ended up getting so drunk that I passed out in a stall at the club. The guards came and got me, put me into an Uber and then the Uber driver could not find my address. I also liked in his car and was in and out of consciousness. 

I don't remember any of this. The driver finally found my campus and the guards at the gate let us in. Apparently, they called the RA who is a young guy at school to look for me. I had walked into a bush and passed out inside it. The RA went into my room to look for me (it is incredibly messy with clothes everywhere) with a bunch of other guys. And they eventually found me in the bush and brought me to my room. 

I am extremely embarrassed and don't know how I'll ever face anyone knowing that they now know how I really am. They know my problems and it's eating away at me knowing that they saw me and my living area in that condition. Many people saw me like that and I have no recollection of it. I only found out when my dorm neighbour came to ask me how I am. I asked her why and she told me everything. It explains all of the concerned stares I've been getting from people. I just wanted to crawl into a hole and die. So I looked for the RA and apologised to him. 

He insisted that everything is okay but I walked away and broke down crying knowing that he and everyone who saw me that night probably have such a low perception of me now. All of the looks I've been getting are humiliating and people probably think I've even more mentally ill because I shaved my hair recently. I don't know how I'll get over this... How can I look everyone in the face again? This is all my fault. I should never have gone out knowing that my drinking has been a problem. 

TL;DR: A bunch of students at the campus I live in found me passed out in a bush at 3 am and all saw my extremely cluttered and messy room. I have no recollection of it all and am just humiliated that they all know I have issues with depression and alcoholism. I have always protested a well put together image until this. How do I face it all?",23Apr2019,1
117,"ok so in December I became friends with this girl (I’m 16 and a guy) and later developed a crush on her. We became really close mostly through snapchat and it was just fun. I do have a crush on her, but honestly I’d rather think of her as my friend first and foremost. A couple weeks ago she starts getting more distant than usual and talks to me less. Until this week where she just straight up ignores me like she doesn’t even know me. I’ve always said if she doesn’t want to talk to me she doesn’t have to, but it’s frustrating regardless. I’ve replayed every possible moment in my head and i 100% did not do anything to piss her off, everything was normal leading up to this. Girls are hard to read especially this one.

I listened to both sides of the argument and friend 1 was in the wrong so I stayed friends with friend 2. When friend 1 found out she went off on me saying I switched up on her and I tried to apologize but she ignored me and hasn’t talked me since. Do I try and talk to her again or do I just give her space and talk it out. And if I give her space how long do I give her space for?

121,"Hi guys, this is kind of a sequel to my previous post where I had to ditch home because of domestic abuse. My parents were clearly very worried about me (now that I’d left) and continued contacting me even after I told them I needed a break and would like some time alone. 

I told the police and they made sure my parents would not be able to find my whereabouts, but somehow they managed to find my car and find where I was staying, and showed up this morning to have a talk. They attempted to get me to return and managed to bully me into handing over my car.

Just for some background, this car is 100% completely owned by me however has been paid for mostly by my parents, it was essentially a gift to me before I ran away. I have paid off maybe 1/3 of the car’s value, however it has registration under MY license. They have made my life significantly harder by taking this off me and I now utterly despise them for it. They said they accept my decision to move out, however actively hinder my attempts to.

I’m considering reporting the car as stolen (because it’s mine) and am also considering any legal issues I may have considering I did not pay for it, but I own it as a gift. Anyone got a clue?",23Apr2019,1

When I hugged my grandpa, he joked around, same ol ""love ya,"" and stuff, and then he grabbed my bra from the outside of my shirt and snapped it against my back. He joked again. Don't remember what he said, only remember freaking the fuck out because I didn't know what to think. 

I feel it is also important to mention my cousin (26F) said something to me a while beforehand, asking if he was ever creepy around me; that he had made some uncomfortable comments about her looks/clothes/etc when she was younger.

But now I do belive her. But, to his credit, my grandpa has never actually ""done anything"" — to my knowledge.

128,"  As the title say, I’ve got a major decision to make. So, I’ve been working at my current job, which is a non-profit for almost two years. I love the people I work with, have a great supervisor and a great team of co-workers, although the job can be stressful at times, I feel like I get enough time off, support, and am able to take one day off per week. Area I live in, I also like but have basically been living here most of my life, however love the peacefulness and being close to nature. Also, within this job, I do use my car quite a bit (as expected), however get mileage reimbursement. 
   Recently, I was just offered a job in the public sector, the VA, and my pay would increase slightly, however there would always be an increase in pay. I’ve been trying to land a job within the public sector since I graduated. I hear benefits are excellent, however it can be rather rigid and wouldn’t get enough time off as my other job, and perhaps not valued as well. If I take this job, it would be as if I were stepping into the unknown, as I don’t know how I’d get along with my supervisor and co-workers. I would be able to drive a company car, which is a nice perk.  Another thing too is that I would have to relocate as I do not think I’d be able to commute 3 hours to and back each day.

I have toured both schools and like both about equally, in terms of campus feel, etc. But the kicker is that my girlfriend will be attending Syracuse.

133," 

Heyo okay so im a bit drunk so im sorry if im not formatting the story right.  
My Y key is sortoff broken so they might be missing here and then.

Im a pretty laid back dude, 24years old.I was a bit wilder in my younger years, doing alot of drugs with random people, seeing alot of people bad trip, being made fun off and sometimes being used. Somewhat shy and uneasy people being used and fucked with after a good nights of drinking. Sometimes stuff got stolen. Ive been on the floor myself a couple of times, too drunk, too drugged to really do stuff.  
People being my friends i was not a target of ""Bad trip fucking with"" but the shitty feeling and state a person is in when they have done too much of a substance is dreadfull and horrifying.  
Alot of people get used and abused unknowingly by even the person doing it and thats of course perfectly okay when everyone is messed up and having a good time. But i cant stress this enough;

You need to get home safely and wake up in your own bed.

I have only had a girlfriend that i barely even kissed in high school.7 years later i have one crapp tinder one night stand that sucked so bad.And with that vast unknowingness i am suddenly thrust into this..

Anyways.. Here goes. This might be a bit of a venting outlet

\*\*this happened first 2 days ago,\*\*I was having a bbq with a lot of friends that went on the whole day, had tons of alcohol and very good time.  
This random girl ive never seen before came up to me, being even drunker than i am, sat next to me and started a conversation with me, she seemed super interested in me. (I am a bit of a hippy in between mostly metal and kindoff generic like music tastes and clothing style, my pants is an extremely comfortable monk style pants with a tripp pattern)She seemed really into it and me overal. Asking me tons of questions of where i was from and what i did and liked, Where the pants are from, they are from Tibet. some cool store that hand mades them. I dont know if her being asian had something to do with the fact that she seemed to adore me and never stopped clinging to me throughout the evening.

I was ofcourse quite flattered by all the attention and before i knew it the whole party was piss drunk and everyone was smoking weed. Some of us got a guy to bring some and it went like a wildfire.So fast forward. a case of beer, 23 sixpacks of beers, about 5 bottles of super sweet liqour that when you open the bottle has a bunch of crusted crystalized sugar on it, and ofcourse the real 40% stuff went like a wildfire as well.

The parents wanted us gone, the whole party. a bunch of people still. and we ended up in a field not far from the home. with a bunch of people.  
We were riding eachother the whole night and if i had drunk more myfels im not sure what else crazy might have happened right there and then.  
But the girl kept asking me to bring her home and make sure i got her home. I was intent on doing so.  
Ive seen and experienced people in such a messed up state that they couldnt move anymore and i wouldnt want to wish that on anyone. Thing is. She lost her bicycle keys somehow after misplacing them atleast 3 times and me looking for them and finding them, trying to keep her shit together basicly..i got her stuff together twice as she was unable to find even her phone as she was holding it in her hand. Alot of messing around and the hours going by..  
Just having fun and i spot the GF making out with her, talking in on her with my friend (her bf) I didnt think too much of it until we all wanted to go home and and this extremely drunk girl somehow lost her keys which i had made extra extra sure were secured in her pocket that had a zipper.  
The friend and gf swooped in as we were at the bickes. Alot of to me manipultion tactics and the obviousness of her not being to cycle home made my friend and his GF take her home to her house. And tried to kindoff manipulate her into sex and having a threesome while shes passing out.  
I felt powerless and really bad when she went with them and both the friend and his gf didnt give a fuck about her bike,It was jsut left in the field.  
I decided to whatsapp her to tell her to try and be carefull back at their house like; ""be carefull of any weird shit and to try and just go to sleep because i feel like they are trying to use you."" Then i just kinda went home feeling terrible.

About 9 in the morning when i had just gotten into my bed and was starting to doze off from the extremely messed up night and emotions i just had. I get a message on whatsapp, and i grab my phone gleefully to see if its her. its her!! She says she doesnt remember a thing and woke up next to their bed (i think) still in her clothes, she told me she went home as we spoke and i asked me to tell her about what happened the night.  
Noticable is that she called a couple of gay women ""Dykes"" a bunch of times. and when i told her she was mortified. Asked me to make up an apology for her.  
quite funny.Anyways- it turned to a rather long conversation throughout the day. (We messaged at 9am on the same morning of that night, i then slept and we messaged the entire next day)

**Just this Day/night**

She messaged me! She spoke to some friends who were there that had told her some more about what happened that evening before. Asking about me i guess. As she apped me saying that i kept giving her more and more beer. Which i did. I was drinking them twice as fast probably..  
still i feel like i should have known that she had enough and stopped giving and sharing the booze. It was free afterall.  
I guess its a bad defence to say that i dont know when to stop. When its quite obvious i should have seen it.  
And that she explicitly told me to get her home, and fucked that one up.

Im not sure what the friends told about me and what we both did that evening, I think the GF of my friend. that i kindoff Hate right now..  
But is honestly a great person. I know she thinks the same about me and knows what kindoff person i am, had spoken with the girl also.  
My guess is that eventhough what happened the night before she didnt say anything untruthfully bad about me.  
Or try to make me out as a bad person. (Im not sure if this is the case but Ayyyyyyyy?)

I got a simple ''Hey""

""Do you feel like hanging out tonight?""

I jumped at the opportunity and said yes, we spoke a bit and decided to meet up at this playground sortoff.  
Coincidently where i hang out some other friends alot. We decided to meet there, drink some beers and hang out just together as our friends were hanging out, but after a while the group just kinda went off..

Few minutes later i get a message on m phone from the girl saying she couldnt find me and that her phone had run out of battery. Eventhough we were obviously 50metres away from eachother. She asked me what i was doing next weekend when there is major festivities all over the country, and asked me to name alot of fun places. And yes, i should have walked over there myself when they were sitting there.

I think the girl was too shy to actually come up to me while i was with two mates, expecially after the whole drunken crazy night and at that moment being Sober. We apped a bit after that as i was still hanging out on the spot and she considered comming but she had school tomorrow. I told her i would love it but its best if she just went to sleep for school and that we would meet up later that week for sure.

Now im having good feelings about it myself. I haven't had any sort of situation like this happen to me beforeand my last ''Serious'' ""relationship"" was back in highschool

134,"The title

I don’t get why i get these thoughts, i’ve been isolated in my room the whole day, legit didn’t have a conversation today, just some stuff like: 

Mom: “¿how’s everything you hungry?”
Me: “No, thank you” 
Mom: “what are you doing?”
Me: “nothing, good”

And that’s all i’ve talked today, i didn’t talk to my brother or anyone

My mom just asked me a few minutes earlier if i was okay because she feels i’ve been isolated and “not talking” 

I don’t know why i get these thoughts and feeling of being alone and pushing anyone away, i’m kinda angry with myself for not talking and having “the spirit” but at the same time i’m not

137,"I went home for Easter and the smell is pretty strong - I noticed it right away when I opened the door. I think my parents' dog is either peeing somewhere or is leaking occasionally. 

They're generally pretty clean people, not hoarders, and not mentally deficient (no dementia or anything thankfully).  

Their dog is very shy. For example it barks like crazy at everything and when I come visit it hides and will shake and run away if I approach it. It's scared of everything, and very poorly trained. They tried obedience classes, but frankly I think they just lack the discipline required to keep a dog obedient. They're sort of push-overs. The dog jumps up on tables and the arms of chairs and scratches everything up. It ruined some nice couch they had and apparently wrecked the carpet in one of the rooms. And it chews on everything. So I imagine it also isn't 100% house-broken and likely pees inside sometimes.

I tried talking with my dad a couple times about the importance of training the dog and keeping it obedient especially when it's young, but that didn't really work out. He agreed but then never carried through with it and basically gave up.

I'm not really sure how to broach the subject of the urine smell without offending them. I don't even know if they can smell it any more. But it's a very strong odor which I can smell in every room. Any ideas? Maybe it's not even worth bringing up.",23Apr2019,1

This is a long, but very important post. 

Some information is withheld in detail to protect myself , but I will try to keep it as detailed as possible. 

\*\*\*TLDR: Started a paid tattoo apprenticeship four months ago. It's been my dream my whole life to do art for a living. I have sacrificed a lot for this opportunity, so this is a big deal. I find out the owner and mentor is a fraud, volatile alcoholic and a narcissist. She physically assaulted me and another employee last week, and has been teaching me nothing of the trade during this time-she has just been procuring free labor from me. Tension is thick, the other employee is leaving at the end of the week. How do I end this properly ? How do I continue somewhere else? Should I stick this out given her history already? Help me please. \*\*\*

LONG VERSION WITH DETAILS: 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been trying to get an apprenticeship for roughly 10 years now in the tattoo field, with two that had fell through at various stages on their behalf. 

 I approached someone to apprentice under, and said I would pay them for the apprenticeship along with working for free (40+ hours a week). They agreed, and they said it would be a six month time frame for the entire process.

 I started in January, not knowing much about my mentor. She was supposed to have a contract drawn up with an agreement, but it never manifested. I asked her time and time again, and got a different excuse every time. 

Some odd things started coming to my attention like :

1.  She was only a few days sober from alcohol. ( which is fine, but have you ever been around an unstable alcoholic who's drying out? Not fun.)

2.  Has legal issues from assaulting a friend ( and former employee of hers) days before I started.

3.  Hadn't drawn anything for a tattoo. I have literally never seen her draw in four months...

4.  Wasn't booked up in the slightest.

5. Her teaching methods included an outdated DVD about the autoclave from who knows where, and me googling things or getting on youtube to watch videos. ( she wasn't ever there to teach me). 

6. Constantly criticizing everyone but herself. ( everyone is bad/ not a good tattoo artist even the people she employs there)

7. Extremely inflated ego..and every picture in the shop was of her. ( shes a conventionally attractive person with tattoos) She wanted an all female shop, and constantly wanted me to ""dress up"" etc , which i don't do if I'm scrubbing toilets for free and mopping all day...

8. Ignoring messages and complaints from paying customers, for sometimes months at a time. 

9. Hazardous work environment.  ( had an in house procedure done to remove implants in her face and left syringes/needles/suture hooks out and told me to clean up her station without letting me know any of those things were present in the rubbish she asked me to clean.) Also is required by law to get me a hepatitis shot, and has yet to do so. 

10. Spending upwards of 2k in one week on head tattoos for herself but will not buy printer ink for the rest of the shop so they can do stencils for tattoos, and not getting supplies that we desperately need. 

&amp;#x200B;

So these are just a few things i can think of at the moment. But you get the gist of whats happening. This is not including some of the ""guest artists"" that have been an absolute nightmare...starting fights, yelling, and fucking up clients bodies because they're on drugs or drinking during work.  

I began to realize she was a hack. Then a narcissist. Then a pretty severe alcoholic. Her boyfriend passed away over a year ago... His family hated her, she caught a lot of flack and blocked all of his family members on social media. Things that now are making sense in hindsight.  

&amp;#x200B;

So this brings me to my final point. She went on a trip, again, out of town last week with her bf ( she is almost never at the shop).  Me and the other employee basically run the shop at this point because shes so preoccupied with her new love. She is maybe there when shes not on ""vacation"" 5 hours a week tops. She comes back from vacation, blows off all the appointments for the day to take us out for an ""employee appreciation lunch"". I complied, i'm broke so a free meal is great for all the money we made her over the last week and a half.  She was in a good enough mood, then she orders a beer with her burger. Then that turned into more beer at a bar down the road, shots etc with me , her and the other employee. 

She's supposed to be in recovery, and her boyfriend catches wind that shes drinking and shows up to the bar. A confrontation ensues, he drives us all back to the tattoo shop. 

&amp;#x200B;

She tells him to fuck off, hits him and he leaves. Then she turns her anger towards us and starts relentlessly hitting and scratching and cussing at the other employee. At one point to restrain her he had to get on top of her and bat her hands away ( she has those claw dagger nails) and he never hit her once. He goes to pack his stuff up and she attacks him from behind, throws his machines, and his supplies and inks to the floor and is literally clawing his face and screaming at him.  

At this point I'm so upset and I don't know what to do, because this is my boss and mentor. I'm drunk, but I'm just bewildered at what's going on in front of me. I see my coworker struggling to maintain his composure as he's eating punches and kicks left and right. She even spits in his face at one point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I intervene, break them apart and tell them to knock it off or I'm calling the police. Then she starts to hit me. 

She started pummeling my arm, just for telling her to stop assaulting my coworker. At this point I could not get her to stop so I took her by the shoulders as hard as i could and just started screaming in her face to stop it. I walked out and called her boyfriend, meanwhile shes destroying the lobby, ripping things off the wall etc and wrestling with her employee on the lobby floor. 

Her boyfriend comes and gets her, I sleep it off in the break room and then head home. 

&amp;#x200B;

She apologizes the next day, via text message. Then she shows back up to work two days later with a pretty salty attitude. We were both anxious about her return, and the other employee is on a month long trip so shes not aware of whats going on ( she knew we were both attacked though and was not very shocked). My boss, this same day, sends me a message on facebook about ""me not making my apprentice payments for some time now"" , and then starts criticizing and calling me out on a group chat over a piercing that she didn't bother to do that ended up complaining ( it should also be noted that her piercing ""teaching"" was literally just making me do piercings and figuring it out on the spot which is very unprofessional and cruel).

 I become pretty mad at this point with how shes acted all week like this ( the assaulting) wasn't a big deal ( even brushing it off and laughing while she came in with her bf) and how shes been acting basically during this entire apprenticeship.  I said "" then i just wont pierce anymore ( i didn't want to learn anyways i just want to tattoo) and I also said i'd fix it and refund her money. I got no response. 

She has not responded to be about becoming a shop manager ( which i am by default because shes not there) , and getting paid for it. I handle all the money( including paying the employees), customers, forms, cleaning, appointments and designs for 90% of the clientele. This was discussed at the beginning of the apprenticeship that I would eventually be shop manager and get paid hourly on top of everything else, or i could take a higher percentage of commission when I started tattooing. 

&amp;#x200B;

SO ( sorry I know this is long) , I started doing small tattoos , since I need practice. I had appointments and flash lined up ( im talking 8 a day for a few weeks because I was so anxious to get going) and she made me cancel ALL of them. "" I need to be here to watch you, they need to be your friends etc."" WELL shes never there? How am I supposed to practice? I was able to convince her to let me do three over the last month ( she was present during 1 and didn't help me at all, she took selfies in the corner). They turned out fine for my first three tattoos, but of course she had to criticize them. So I'm pretty much just working for free up there, all the time and because of that I'm not able to make money to pay my bills that are now becoming delinquent. I also have paid her close to a grand, but stopped payments about a month or so ago when I realized she wasn't teaching me anything, she never got a contract, and that I was just basically spinning my wheels up there for no reason.  

 I just want to finish this apprenticeship, but I can't even look at her as a trustworthy person, let alone a mentor thats responsible for teaching me my trade for my career. Not after how I've seen she treats her employees,myself, her clients.. how wretched she is as a human being, what an awful mother she is, and honestly, what a fraud she is. Beauty is truly deceiving, because shes very ugly on the inside. 

So, How do I end this gracefully? I plan on just picking up my coworker tomorrow ( like usual) and opening the shop, getting my stuff, signing out of everything up there and leaving a note. Should I do anything else? Am I wrong? Am I being over dramatic? Is this normal? Please..any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",23Apr2019,2

147,"Hey all, I really need some help on this one. Most probably won't find it to be a pressing matter but it is to me. 
Tl;dr I graduate from college in a few weeks and I need advise on ways to properly thank my mentor, letting him know just how impactful he was on my life. I have crippling social anxiety, potentially an undiagnosed disorder so I really do not know what is and what is not acceptable and worthy.

Background (with vagueness): I started college attempting to achieve a degree in a science field which I thought I loved. The first year and a half of my endeavor was quite catastrophic resulting in me nearly dropping out of college. In addition to this, I lived close enough to the college that I would commute. Unfortunately, my parents were going through a bitter divorce so that took a toll on me. I ended up taking a semester break just for the sake of my mental health. When I returned I started kicking butt in the science field, making it all the way to the top level courses and achieving top marks in some of them, but at the same time I had taken a generally education class with Dr. S (obviously not a real name) and it was the most interesting thing I had ever studied. Despite Dr. S not knowing me well because I didn't speak in class (since I have crippling social anxiety from a potentially undiagnosed social disorder-thanks parent-), he agreed to do an independent study with me. He swiftly became my mentor. I come from a poor family and I can't really afford college so he got me a high paying student job and also gave me tons of scholarships. I ended up changing my major and will graduate with a degree in his field. He has taught me specialized knowledge of the field which sets me well above where I should be.
Basically, I would not have gotten through college (money wise) nor would I have found my calling in my current field if it wasn't for him. He also helped me in a time of severe personal crisis.
Unfortunately I am still awkward around him because I don't know how to not be. I try so hard to not be weird but I always am, so I don't think I have shown just how much his efforts for me have mattered. I really wish I wasn't like that and I have no reason to be but I can't not be. It's the most frustrating thing on the planet when you think the world of people yet they are always at an arms length because of no reason whatsoever except the way your mind reacts to social stimuli. 
Anyways, I want to honor him and thank him properly, how would you go about in in such a situation?
Thank you so much.",23Apr2019,1
148,"Cw: (minor) sexual abuse / child abuse

Posting from my main acct bc I trust the only irl friend knowing about it. Also this is my first time posting in this sub so please tell me what mistakes I did in this post. 

Might get a little long, but if you care, I hope you read all the way through.

I will probably share a large amount of details on a highly private manner and would prefer if you  respect that and keep it discreet, should you think to recognize me.

Some information regarding my background and upbringing, to make the following (more) understandable. 

I am the third of four Brothers (will refer to them as 1,2 and 4 with descent in numbers meaning descent in age)  our maximal age span is 4 and a half years, and my family is more or less normal, maybe a little bit of an academic background. 

I'm from Germany (important for age of consent laws, idk, and also to excuse mistakes I might make). 

Please recognize that also all of this is obv from my perspective, I try to reflect the truth as good as I am able to perceive it, with hindsight more often added than being included in the statement. 

I never really got along with 1,who is 3 years older than me. I always had the feeling that he was antagonistic towards me, but nowadays I think he was very often trying to exert power over somebody, as he was often bullied in school (as was I, we both were/are incredibly introverted).

This often only amounted in debates over how to behave at dinner, but sometimes resulted in violence (nothing out of the ordinary for brothers, nothing to condone either).

When he got older (13-15?) and got into puberty, he began asking me and 4 for ""blowjobs"", neither of us had heard of this before, so we didn't immediately run to our parents, and as soon as he explained this to ous he stated that we were not to tell them (and it was kinda cool to know something you weren't meant to know. For me it was the kind of secret we had as brothers, like 1 and 2 told us that Santa wasn't real, before our parents did)

He kept asking and began bargaining over weeks, to the point where I said yes.

So one day, when only 1 and I were at home I gave him a blowjob. I don't want to go into a lot of detail.

Afterwards he reiterated how I was not supposed to tell ANYONE, and he wouldn't too (I nowadays trust him so little that I would not be shocked if he bragged in front of his classmates afterwards ). 

Many more years pass and I begin to understand what happened back than whilst trying not to think about it too much. 

He also gets older and goes to college.

I think I enjoyed life more with him far away, but it was not like I got flashbacks every time I saw him. It was more like a vague feeling of hate.

Later he returned home, having abandoned his studies for psychological reasons.

In that time I reflected on what then happened 5-7 years ago and hoped he would come forward with these events first to his counselor and then to my parents. He never did so.

I didn't tell anyone either, mostly because I did not want to hurt my family and I also didn't want to put such a weight on the teenage boys that my friends all were.

Fast forward some more years and sometimes I begin to feel uneasy. Especially in times k of great stress or during vacation, laying awake, I return to that night and try to find a way out of my current situation, telling somebody without destroying / hurting my family, or just 1, who is not very emotionally stable right now.

That's why I turn to a (hopefully) anonymous community, hoping you can see a way that I don't.

Regarding some things you might have thought(or I did at least) :

I probably will not be able to get any legal kind of conviction for 1,as I'm fairly sure that no evidence exists and  it would be his word against mine.

I really didn't know anything about the meaning of consent in sexual activity during the events and I'm not certain 1 did know either.

I don't live at home right now, but 1 does, which allows me a certain kind of emotional distance.

Please, if you have any advice, even if it is just ""go to somebody in charge"" I'm ready to listen.",23Apr2019,1

156,"My parents got divorced when I was nine, and it was a heartbreaking experience for me. After awhile it became easier to manage moving from house to house, but now that I’m in high school it’s getting really hard. The schedule is I’m with my day Wednesday through Saturday and I’m with my mom Sunday through Tuesday. My parents live in the same town so this is an easy schedule to keep track of, but I’ve been getting tired of it.
Chores, clothes, friends, family, and even being able to get rides to places is harder to manage now than it has ever been. Everything I need is at the other house and I always forget to bring things my parents request. Its also getting harder to interact with my parents, I feel like two completely different people around them. With my dad I’m usually upbeat and innocent, but with my mom I swear around and joke with a lot. I feel like they don’t genuinely know who I am or what I’m feeling. My parents also “spill the tea” about their Ex-in-laws and it makes me uncomfortable. They may not be their family anymore, but they’re still my family at the end of the day. I want to tell them to stop but I know they’ll just forget when I’m gone and continue when I come back.
I’m starting to gain a temper too when it comes to chores. For example, it’s annoying to do all my laundry, fold it and put it away, then go to my next house and do the same process again. I’ve also been the kid who’d do task without minding, but all I want is to sit in my temporary room and wait until I leave again. My homes don’t feel like homes anymore either which is hard to say considering I grew up in my dad’s house.
I’ve only started to realize how bad this was affecting me until I was assigned a project in art to recreate our room as a drawing. I was torn between which room I should do, and after I chose my room at my dads, I realized I’d forgotten what it looks like. I feel unloved and unwelcome and overall lonely.

157,"(TLDR): Poor family. Should I take fully funded online classes or do something ""meaningful"" such as join the USAF?

So I'm going through a pretty rough period in my life. I'm 
finishing up community college (without an associate's degree because I'm bad at math) this May, and I already got accepted to a university for the fall semester. This university is offering to pay for tuition, and if I were to take online classes, they'd be completely funded. However, here's the thing, I don't particularly want to take online classes and stay cooped up at home for another 2 years. I come from a fairly poor family, so living on campus and taking traditional classes honestly isn't an option. 

This is where the military comes in. I'm already in the process of enlisting into the USAF, and I won't lie I am kind of hesitant, but it's not the end of the world, and I feel like it would offer good experiences. My mom does *not* want me to join, and I can understand her viewpoint, but I honestly don't know what to do. I  didn't even particularly want to go university because I'm just not motivated to try anymore especially after failing pre-calculus twice. I don't have any particular interest or field I want to go into and that's why I was considering the USAF, so that I could become financially stable and possibly find something I like doing. I'm not even the fittest guy either, but I've been exercising so that I can try to prepare for what lies ahead of me. 

Currently I do not have a job because I quit my last job about 5 months ago, and recently my car broke down and as I mentioned before, we are in a rough financial situation. I'm constantly down in the dumps when I think about our situation and I may be using the military as an escape because, to me, it is definitely a tempting option. Anyways, I know I may have rambled a bit, but I could definitely use some insight as to whether I should just do online classes (which won't even ensure that I'll get a job) or if I should join the USAF which I've already been working towards.",23Apr2019,1
158,"You know those little day to day problem everyone has that aren’t drastic enough to affect a persons life but they’re still there? Well, at this point in my life it seems like every little problem I have is caused by low confidence. 

So, I grew up being severely abused, my mother used to beat me herself but mostly used dad to do her dirty work. Pretty much controlled everyone. At some point she told my siblings “don’t talk to (my name) don’t even acknowledge him” and sure enough, it happened. Another time that something major happened is when she cracked my skull and didn’t take me to the doc. She didn’t think a huge pool of blood was reason enough to take me to the doctor 🤷‍♂️

I well, I fixed myself as best as I could. Stopped “hating” my parents, fixed my depression and fixed my social anxiety/selective mutism. But as you can probably guess, growing up with all these left side effects (zero social skills) 

Anyway, if I told you about myself you’d probably think I have a buttload of confidence, example, 

- male

- US marine 

- 6’1

- regular compliments such as, “wow, your face is really chiseled” “damn boy, you’re hot” “your face is really symmetrical” “I like your eyebrows” there was another one that stood out but having a hard time remembering.. OH “you have really broad shoulders” (that wasn’t the one but that one came up) 

Anyways, along with creepy old men staring at me in the gym. 

Somehow I always have a smile on my face (idk how) &amp; I have a buttload of confidence when no one talks to me but as soon as someone comes up to me and says hi I have like -30 confidence lmfao

Growing up (and even more now) I’ve never really had trouble with people not wanting to talk to me or anything like that, people have always tried to talk with me including the popular kids but idk🤷‍♂️

It disgusts me that the hardest part about this event for me is to be kind to others. I'm always kind to people at school, and I want to know why I can't do it out in the open. And just I'm realizing that this whole situation made me realize just how antisocial I am. 

So how do I let myself get out there more often and be kind to strangers?",23Apr2019,2
161,"So, basically my mom is moving, right? She has been planning this move for awhile but she hasn't decided on a house. I was gonna stay with her for the summer but she texted me today asking if i could stay with someone else cause she may be looking at different house. I usually stay on campus since i graduated from high school. However, university ends in 2 weeks and i'm not sure where i should go?

I do not have a job or a licence on me but I do get $634 every month for this 18-21 program due to being in foster care since i was 14. Don't have much saved up.

I asked my aunt, she said no.

Foster mom hasn't replied.

My brothers, we ain't close since being in foster care.

I haven't contact my G.A.L yet, maybe he could help?

Contacted some friends, not really social. They said no or don't know anybody.

162,"I started working at a local company 10 months ago or so. It started off great. We hung out after work (at work) on Friday's, a super positive and inspiring environment. I was, and still am super grateful for it. In the recent months (4 or so) the entire vibe of the building has went straight into the shitter. We started renovations to expand the shop space and increase production and profits. Stress started to build and it wasn't long until the attitude of management and ownership began to sour. The bad mood has tickled down to all 9 or so employees. I feel like I have valuable input but it goes ignored. Days are now long and stressful; I don't come remotely close to enjoying it. I've considered quitting several times. I almost walked off the job today when it became too much to bare. I don't know what to do.",23Apr2019,2
163,"So I've known this girl since I was seven. We kind of grew up together as to that we went to the same school up until 7 grade. I moved to another school district and so did she. We never stayed in contact unless we would see each other at a mutuals party. High school came and went and I haven't even thought about her in 5+ years until the summer after my high school graduation. I got a job (which I am still at) and coincidentally she also works there. We caught up and I guess became friends but more like work friends because we never really talked outside of work. Most of my friends now that I have work with me, and I'm not that social with. My best friend at the time, who we will call Bob, invited me to a theme park and of course I said yes, one conversation leads to another and then the girl I've known since elementary school is now coming with us. I thought oh ok cool. So us three and another coworker went and had a great time. The night ended pretty weird but that's not really important. However over the course of the night I was really infatuated with this girl. At this time she had a boyfriend, and I was like ok not cool for me to be forward with this girl so I decided to chill for a bit. A year or so later she breaks up with this guy and I'm like hell yeah. So I start getting closer to her. I have extremely low confidence so me asking her out is a big fat no-go. I asked my friend Bob if he would talk around her about me and drop subtle hints. At this time her and I are really close friends. So when she was really sad about said break-up she got talky about the whole thing and started saying that she doesnt remember what it was like not in a relationship and Bob was like would you date anyone from workplace and she said idk. Bob then say what about David(me but not my name) and she laughed and said no. Bob told me this and my dreams were crushed. Bob's advice to me was to try and distance yourself from her because you are only gonna get deeper in this friendzone and you're gonna hate it. Me doing that only increased our friendship.

Fast forward 6 months and her and I are like best friends. I talk to her everyday and see her almost everyday. One day she and I are doing doing an activity with my older cousin who lives with me. We were all chatting normally and she always talks about other guys and shit like that. My cousin who we will call Jen says ""You to should just date your are like the same person"" and the girl, who we will call Rachel, says ""I know! We are like a match made in hwaven"" and I sit there stunned as to what just happened and awkwardly laugh it off and so does Rachel.

Fast forward 2 months and now shes always talking about Tinder guys and how she met one and is gonna go on a date with one and I'm sitting there completely being a dick because I just can't handle my feelings anymore. I think I might actually love this girl and I have never said that before about anyone in my life. I'm too much of a pussy to say something and my opportunity has already come and gone and I am way to far down this rabbit hole. 

I've heard writing about your problems can help but we'll see how this goes. I dont even know if this is even the right outlet for me to express such feelings. I'm seriously debating on to just slowly detaching from her and let her be. I know we can never be just friends cause I'll always have these feelings for her and I don't know what to do.

168,"Hi I’m very new to reddit and I have no clue where I should be posting this but my mind has been racing since the night before and I really need to vent. Sorry this turned out to be super long D:

I’ve been friends with this boy for a year and a half now, and my current boyfriend is one of his friends. 

I met this boy over a game and as soon as we found out we lived an hour away from each other he took interest in me. Thinking back, it really wasn’t interest, more just pretending to care and I was to naive to see. He is pretty attractive, looks exactly like a f*ckboy and no one like that had ever talked to me, so it made me feel cooler, I guess. He soon started asking for nudes, and silly little me sent them, thinking this meant he actually had feelings for me. He then started asking if he could screenshot them, and I hesitantly let him do that once too, cause he said I could screenshot one of his too (what a gentleman). He talked about setting a day to come over and f*ck (I was a virgin) and I was very nervous about this no matter how he put it. He also added, “don’t worry, if you’re not comfortable with that you can just suck my d*ck. Anyway I started making excuses for ‘not sending tonight’ and he stopped asking. I began dating a mutual friend, and we lasted 8 months. I told myself I’d never send nudes again, and I asked the boy to deleted the pic he had of me and he said he did but I doubt it.

When we broke up, he started chatting me up again. He told me he liked me this time. I tell him I don’t want to send nudes, that I don’t do that anymore. Note that I fall for people very fast (this was a benefit with my current boyfriend because I’m 99% sure he’s the one I’ll be with forever), and so I started liking him. The nudes started up again (why the hell I did this idk), along with more screenshots. 

One night, 4 of us decided to hang out. I snuck out of my house for the first time, and I was out all night hanging with them. He acted like nothing was going on between us, so he obviously didn’t actually like me and hadn’t even told our friends. The 4 of us go to his place to crash, we’re all tired and the other two pass out soon enough. Three of us are on a pull out couch. I turn to fall asleep and he puts his arm around me, I thought this was cute. He started feeling me up, gave me hickies and then turned me around and started kissing me. I thought this was normal for some reason, that he really did like me. We went to sleep.

The next morning, I tell my mom I’m staying home sick (my parents don’t check on me in the morning and are both at work by 6) and she calls the school to report my absence. The boy and I are cuddling. My ride home, one of our friends, gets called in to work and he leaves with my other friend, leaving me and the boy. He starts feeling me up again and one by one he gets my clothes off. He offers to eat me out, I say I’m not sure I want this, but he insists and does. He then asks if I want to f*ck (I’m still a virgin) and I say that I’m really nervous and scared, and that I don’t really want to. “Come on, it will be okay. You trust me, right?” he says. This goes on for ten minutes until I ask, “Will you use protection?” He says yes and I hesitantly agree. We do it for about five minutes tops until I bleed, he stops, and then asks if I’ll suck his d*ck. I said no and he got dressed. I ended up apologizing about the blood and he soon presses me about going home, so I take the bus and train (for 2 and 1/2 hours rather than a 43 minute drive) and eventually get home. This is when I notice the golf ball sized hickies on my neck (which I was proud of??? Why?? I’m so dumb???). The two friends that were there that night find out and I then talk to the boy about wanting to date. He tells me he isn’t looking for a relationship, he stops chatting with me often. 

A month later, little naive me goes liking another mutual friend, boy B. He doesn’t like me back, and the biggest thing we ever did was hold hands. I’m okay with him not liking me, and by this time I’m starting to realize that I don’t have to like every single guy I talk to. 

Fast forward to two months ago, I turn 18 and my friend group invites some of their friends to come along to the club. My current boyfriend said he’d be there then couldn’t go, he then apologized and said he owed me a drink. This is how we both fell for each other and he soon asked me to be his girlfriend. I am extremely comfortable with him, he triple checks that I consent to everything he does, doesn’t force anything, has never asked for nudes, takes care of me and makes me feel safe, especially during sex. We even have a safe word. 

My bf and I get on the subject of our friends, and he tells me he knows what happened between the boy (the first one, I’ll call him boy A) and I tell him how it was a mistake and I always regret it. My bf tells me it’s okay. He then says, “I also know about boy B (the one I liked)”, he continues with,”You guys f*cked too, right?”. Turns out boy B told our whole friend group we f*cked when WE VERY MUCH DID NOT. I was shocked and really hurt because I trusted that boy like a big brother, meanwhile he was spreading stuff like this.

Fast forward again to yesterday. My bf and I are talking. Somehow, boy A comes up and he mentions that he had talked about us in front of my bf and another friend. The boy had said, “I went to eat her out, saw it, tasted it and noped out of there.” This stung. I sobbed and spilled the whole night to my bf, telling him how forced I felt to do it and how much I regret it. “I never wanted any of it.” I told my bf over and over. I realized if he hadn’t asked for nudes I wouldn’t have sent any, if he hadn’t asked me constantly for sex I wouldn’t have given my virginity to him. I realized just how wrong that story sounded when I told it to him. I remembered the feeling of a pit in my stomach that I had gotten every time I sent a picture. I really feel like I’m an object in boy As eyes now. It was all my fault. My boyfriend had to leave for a second because he felt like he was going to be sick. He said he wanted to beat that boys face in.

This is nowhere near as harsh as most cases of sexual assault but I feel so sick every time I think of this boy and what happened. Is it even sexual assault? Or did I just make a big mistake? I can’t get it out of my head. I was so stupid, I realize it’s really hard for me to say no. My bf says he still feels the same about me and I am so very happy about that.

Where do I go from here? I want to cut both boy A and B off but I’ll see them because my bf still considers them friends, even though he does not like either of them nearly as much. He knew that boy A was always a f*ckboy, and that boy B is a liar. He can’t exactly cut them off either, all of our friends hang out together, them included, so we’d see them either way.

Should I tell someone about this? Am I over reacting? How do I stop myself from blaming myself and being mad at myself? I mean, it is my fault but there’s no use in hating myself. How do I get my mind off of this?

This is a giant mess of a story but I hope someone takes the time to read it and help me out. I really don’t know what to do.",23Apr2019,1

For the last 2 years, one of my coworkers would casually talk to me, come with me for rides, and we would go out for dinner with another lady from the office. She would give me gifts after each ride. I kept telling her it's not necessary and I would gift her back. I didn't notice that she wanted to have more control. So she started talking about porn, and how women get disrespected. Anyway, lately she has been doing acts in the office hinting at BDSM. It is making me and the men around me very uncomfortable. I ended up with a series of panic attacks and was rushed to the emergency room. I had to skip work as a result.

I know it does not make a lot of sense, but I am 100% sure it is gas lighting. I didn't see the signs from the beginning.

Also, I can't talk to my manager about it since I have no proof and also sexuality is seen as a taboo where I work.

171,"I live in a very tight knit conservative family. All of my dad's extended family gets together for lunch weekly. I am pretty liberal, but kinda in the closet about it.

Almost weekly, one of my relatives will go on a rant about immigration, crime, regulation, etc., often laden with misconceptions or even genuine prejudice. 

For example, quite a few of my relatives have very extremist views on immigration, which are often based in ignorance or prejudice. They believe that crime is rising in my city ([it's not](https://www.cabq.gov/police/documents/police-crime-stats-2019-03-18.pdf)) due to immigrants ([not true either](https://sociology.unc.edu/files/2018/01/2017SocComp-Providing-Sanctuary-or-Fostering-Crime-A-Review-of-the-Research-on-Sanctuary-Cities-and-Crime.pdf)) and that immigrants are straining our economy ([they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States#Economic)) which is overburdened ([it isn't](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/upshot/trump-america-full-or-emptying.html)). They often even blame unrelated things on immigrants, such as high healthcare costs. Some have even repeated extremely prejudiced rhetoric, couple even beleive that [ISIS is across the border](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tijuana-transfer/), that there are roving bands of mexicans shitting in the streets in border cities, etc.

Their solutions for these ""problems"" are usually extreme, and even abhorrent. One said that anybody who employs illegals should be put in prison for 10 years and given 1 $250,000 fine. Another said that we should have a literal military DMZ with mexico.

About 3-5 out of the usual 9-12 of my relatives attending will outwardly agree. This may not seem like much, but the people who agree are usually the most active and assertive conversationally out of the whole family, and are usually in a position of respect as being elders in the family. 

Everyone else usually take a more passive role in the conversation, including me. Idk how many people would actively be with me in the conversation, and I only definitely know that 2 or so would already agree with me (albeit probably not enough to speak up).

I also doubt that, unless I relay the facts to them very carefully and maybe even subtly, that they'd be open minded towards my points. Science denial is definitely something that they're not above, so even if I were to pull up PDFs of studies in front of them they may still consider them ""fake news"".

It's something that I feel like it needs to happen, but idk if it would produce good results. Any advice/experience with this?",23Apr2019,2

And we known each other since like 2010 which is about nine years.

So about maybe sometime in 2011 or 2012
We had to have the same room but different beds and one they I got in her bed for some reason and I took off my pants and she took off hers (We still had stuff like underwear and panties on) But we were both trying to convince each other to go fully with no pants (We were like 6-8 years old) so so really didn't understand what sex was.

Fast-forward to late 2012 and we have recently have moved to a house and in are new house we still will sleep in the same room and we had a Xbox 360 and we would both play Forza Motorsport. One night when she went to sleep I got bored and went over to her bed and FOR WHATEVER REASON TRIED TO TOUCH HER.....let's just say body part but my dad would come up to check up on me and On other days when I tried to touch her body part she would move around and I would be scared to wake her up.

When my dad got divorced with her mom I stopped seeing her often we would still see each other especially during the summer time but not as frequently as before so we both kinda grew out of each other. As we got older I got a little bit more shy for whatever reason and started to like her more I am to chicken to ask her if she remember those events and to ask her if she feels the same towards me I kinda doubt it but there have been times where she showed signs of liking me so hey it is a 50/50 chance....well at least to me and I am to chicken to tell her like I said before so I took it upon my self to see what other people think on reddit.

175,"I've been working at this place for 2 months now, and I thought that the stress would go away, but it just doesn't. I've made a few acquaintances (2 men 1 female) so far, and it feels okay. What I really want to talk about is the others who stress me out.

I like to start my morning at work by saying hi to everyone, so I say ""good morning,"" and most of females decide to ignore me or look at me funny. It doesn't help that one of the female team leaders likes to make condescending comments towards me when I make a small mistake that can easily be fixed like ""You know it's not that hard to staple a paper with another paper. \*proceeds to show me\* See? Easy."" She literally nitpicks everything I do and it makes me embarrassed. Another female team leader likes to call me out on mistakes in front of everyone like ""What are you doing? You're not supposed to do that! The person who worked your position before was way faster than you and you're slowing us all down,"" like wow no wonder they left.

**I'm not saying that working with women is terrible**, **I'm saying that the women I work with are terrible**. Why is it when I'm so open to make conversation and make friendships, I get rejected? I don't think I'm a bad person? Instead of encouraging me to do better, they do things to push my buttons. They're all so nice with each other, but they treat me like crap and they tend to lash out at the guys a lot too. The only person who actually encourages me is the manager, in the most honest way possible. He doesn't throw snippy comments at me or anything, he makes actual critiques and shows me how to do better.

To me, it's so strange how he chose these two people to lead the place, like they are not constructive whatsoever and all they do is make new people like me feel unwelcome.

177,"For background information, I'm a high school senior less than two months away from graduation. I was born and raised in California--aside from two years I spent in Kentucky when I was 10-11 years old, I spent my whole life here. My whole family is here, too, with the exception of my dad and my stepmom (and a few of my siblings who live with them) in Washington state. Needless to say, I never planned on leaving this place. Of course, I wanted to go to universities in other parts of the state, but in the end I wanted to go back home to the place I grew up at. But life seems to get in the way, and now I've been presented with two choices: stay here with my mom, or move to an unknown place where my dad is.

To keep things simple, I created a list of pro's and con's of moving.

\-

Pros of moving to Washington:

\- I will have my dad's financial support--my mom does make good money, but my dad has a much better financial situation as he has been serving in the military for many years. He also has other benefits.

\- Better support for mental and emotional health--my mom was never an advocate for taking me to get professional help for my severe anxiety issues. On the other hand, my dad is fiercely supportive of me getting the help I need, and would be more than happy to take me to see a therapist. This especially is a major factor.

\- The chance to get to know my half-sister well. She was born while I lived with my dad, and only ever got to meet her once when she was only a few months old. I wonder if she knows I exist, as that one time meeting her is my only experience interacting with her in any way (no calls or anything).

\- The universities aren't so bad there! I always grew up thinking California was the best place in the world to go to for literally anything, but it really isn't all that. There are many good universities out-of-state--in this case, in Washington! Up until recently, I only decided to stay in California because of college plans. That isn't the case anymore--now I'm reconsidering everything.

\- Rekindling my broken relationships with all my family in Washington--my dad, stepmom, stepbrother, and stepsister. I rarely, if ever, talk to them. I'd like that to change as they aren't bad people.

\-

Cons of moving to Washington:

\- I'll be leaving the place I call home. I hold California dear to my heart, in the same way older generations of my family hold their homelands of the Philippines and China dear to theirs. I'm slowly coming to understand how they felt when they decided to leave everything behind in pursuit of a better life.

\- Separating from my beloved family. I have no full-blood sister, only a half and a step. My paternal cousins who grew up with me are like my real sisters. I couldn't bear to part with them for too long, it breaks my heart thinking of moving away from them now. There's also my maternal half-brother, who I've raised since he was a baby. I'm too young to be saying this, but I feel like he's a son to me.

\- Leaving my friends behind. Honestly, this is the hardest part. My friends. I know I can make more friends in Washington, but my current friend group is just... I dunno. I can't put into words just how much these people changed my life for the better. They're people that I'll never forget, ever! I know that thanks to technology, we can still communicate on the daily, but it isn't the same...

\- The chance of more legal battles. Up until my sophomore year (about two years ago), my mom and dad often fought in court. Mostly over custody cases. However, many other members of my family (on both sides) often got dragged in. It caused a huge mess and an even larger rift to form between people who formerly got along well. I worry that if I move, my dad will ask why--knowing me, I can't lie forever. I'll slip-up and he'll try to take her to court again. The last major legal battle, he accused her of child alienation (which is true) amongst other things. I'm deathly afraid that she might face jail time, leaving my little half-brother with no one (he doesn't know his dad, who lives in the Philippines and has divorced our mom).

That is all I can think of as of right now. Please help me weigh these! I don't want to go to my friends about this until it has all been cemented.",23Apr2019,1
178,So I just moved into a new place with my girlfriend and dog. It's been one week and we got a note on our door from our neighbor telling us that our dog has been waking them up early in the morning and crying for hours at a time. They said that they would contact the condo board if it continues. I'm not sure what neighbor it is and I know that what they said isn't true. I've been home until not at least 11:30am every day since we've moved here as I've been working evenings and my dog doesn't make a peep. I left a note on the door of the neighbor who I suspect left the note (I tried knocking but they didn't come to the door even though I can hear that they're home) apologizing and explaining our end of things. Should I let the condo board know that this is happening before they complain? I don't want problems with neighbors but the tone of their note was very unpleasant and I know that they're mistaken or not telling the truth.,23Apr2019,1

181,"There is a forum that I got sent and I’m supposed to print it out and fill it out and show it to them, but I don’t have anyone in real life to help. Where can I go in real life to get the advice from someone with the job?",23Apr2019,0
182,"I (20F) live in a student housing apartment with 3 other girls(19-21)on our lease. About 5 months ago one of the girls let her boyfriend (25M) move into our apartment without saying anything about it. She and I were close friends at one point, but haven’t been close since her and her boyfriend began dating a year ago.

He and I never got along due to issues he would cause in our living space and flash forward to recent months he has been taking things of mine without asking and my roommate and him fight constantly, so it’s been a stressful place to live to say the least.

Had she and I not been friends I would have called her out on breaking the lease and gone to management ASAP, as we are not allowed to have guests stay for over 3 days, let alone live here. But, his situation is that after he graduated from our school in December and could no longer live in the dorm, he had nowhere else to go.  Personally I don’t believe this is true since his parents paid fully for his schooling, housing, and new car after graduation, but it’s not something she would discuss with me. 

I finally broke down from lack of sleep from her boyfriends yelling and punching at walls and told my roommate that it wasn’t fair to us living in the apartment to put up with her boyfriend anymore and her response was basically that as a friend I “owed her” and by my reaction to his situation we were no longer friends. I said I would take action if it happened again and we haven’t talked since. I’ve been getting the cold shoulder now and the boyfriends behavior isn’t improving much, so I don’t know what to do. 

If I do go to management they would make sure he’s removed, but I’m worried of the consequences—if he has nowhere else to go then I could be making someone homeless. Also he has anger issues so I fear for my safety too since he knows it would have been me that got him kicked out. Should I just put up with it until the lease ends near August? Or what other option would work?",23Apr2019,1
183,"I’m running out of time to make a decision and it’s really stressing me out. So basically, I came from an abusive childhood home, and after getting kicked out at 18 I’ve been mostly consumed with just landing on my feet and sorting things out that I’ve never been able to before - such as opening my first bank account and learning how to drive. It’s been hard, and I’ve just been totally satisfied with having a place to stay and the ability to order a pizza once a week. 

So right now I work as a CNA. It’s very hard. I’m happy right now except for the assloads of physical labor - every part of my body hurts after a shift. So I was thinking that I should go to school this fall and become an LPN, so I’m still kind of doing similar things but with less physical work. I think most colleges are full up with their nursing courses for the fall by now, and I still haven’t made a decision. I just can’t think if this is something I really want to do. The environment in healthcare is so hard and stressful. I’m in a good place right now but there’s ups and huge downs and I don’t know if I’m ready to take on more responsibilities and stresses. But then, what do I do with my life/career? 

I don’t know what’s out there, I don’t know what I should do, I have no one to talk to or ask for help. Does anyone have any advice for me, or good stories about being an LPN? How can I discover the right job/career for me? I’ve already taken a year off without going to college, it’s seriously looking like I might take another one off and I just don’t know what I’m doing right now!",23Apr2019,3
184,"My boyfriend of three months have been talking about moving out shortly after I graduate from high school (May). I plan on taking a year off to work and figure out what I want to do.

186,"Hey. I’m having a little trouble here. For some context, I’m currently 22 weeks pregnant. My friend is getting married this late August, by then I will be 37.5 weeks pregnant. I am one of her bridesmaids...  I want to be there, but it’s a 15 hour drive, and a 2 hour boat ride to the wedding destination. I’ve talked to my doctor already and he says I shouldn’t go. 

So, I’ve told the bride as sensitive as I could, but she says I should still come and need to be there. She and the other girls will accommodate me. I told her thank you, but it’s your day you’ll be to busy with yourself and husband and wedding day itself. I’am more of a logical communication kind of person than emotional, and she is a emotional communication type of person. I’ve tried 3 times, and feel like it’s still not getting through...

She is one of my longest/oldest friends and I feel so awful that I can’t make it. I could give birth early, or have complications, and again would be roughly 17 hours away from my doctor/hospital/all our baby necessities.

Her husband to be on the other hand... hates me, which also makes this more difficult, as he’s made it clear he hates me and if I miss this/mess up the wedding than I can never see my friend again. 

How do I try communicating to her that I really won’t be able to go?",23Apr2019,2
188,"I wasn't sure where to ask so I chose this subreddit.

I recently experienced 3-4 days of continuous abdominal pain and was unable to sleep because of that. I went to a hospital (more than one actually), got my haemogram, urine tests etc. done, and got my problem fixed. I no longer experience abdominal pain. However, I still can't sleep.

I managed to get a 3 hours sleep at afternoon last sunday. And yesterday since I was so tired I threw myself to the bed and slept, from 7.10pm to 11.43pm, which was a normal sleep. The problem is, I can't get a night's sleep and my before night sleeps are way too short when compared to an 8-9 hour night sleep. I turn around in bed and talk with myself in my mind throughout the night. I actually tried not to, I left my mind empty but it didn't help. How can I get that most needed sleep?",23Apr2019,1

191,"Fair warning: this will likely be pretty lengthy.

Before I get into the story, I'll provide a little bit of back story. I'm currently 20 yrs old, working full time and living with my family. I met this girl who shall rename nameless about a year and a half-2 years ago through the app Vine. She's currently 19 and going to full school time at X university across the country.

When I had met her, it didn't turn into an LDR right away, although she had broached the idea to me pretty early on. I quickly turned it down knowing that I wasn't the type to be in an LDR, but had no problem remaining friends with her being that I enjoyed her company. We had a lot of things in common, talked a lot, laughed a lot, and so on and so forth. Fast forward about a year later and we end up getting into an LDR for reasons I won't explain because that in of itself is a very lengthy post.

We had dated on and off again for quite sometime (I think it totaled a little over a year's worth of time) and actually did end up meeting in X state. We spent about a week together and had a great time, yet ended the relationship close to the last day due to the reason that even after the time we spent together, I still wasn't into the whole LDR thing. Fast forward *again* a few months later and yet again, we got back together. (Like I said - on again off again.)

I know I did her an injustice by getting into a relationship that I myself wasn't comfortable with, but here's the thing. I have always had a problem of not putting myself first, because I think I care to much about other people and their feelings. Often times I go somewhat outspoken or get put into a situation I dont want to be in, simple because I lack to back bone to say ""no"" or ""I don't want to."" This isn't to say that I got into the relationship against my will - because like I had said I do enjoy her company, but after some reflection it's fairly safe to say that I would've been better off hurting her feelings and saying no. 

Here's where things get sticky and why I think the relationship was toxic. We argued. A lot. I don't really know how to say this without sounding like an asshole but my ex was fairly insecure, and often times took issue with the fact that I had a lot of female friends. In essence, I could understand where she was coming from. It just so happened that I had female friends and that made her uncomfortable - I get it - and I certainly tried to work with her in that instance. But unfortunately, there were times where she would have me not talk to a person period. I would have to cut off contact with girls who I had known for longer than I knew my ex, simply because perhaps I had crushed on them in the past, or in some cases simply because she felt threatened by them.

Now I am in no way shape or form trying to make myself seem like I've never done anything wrong in my whole life. That's not to say I ever cheated on her because I swore to myself that I would never be a cheater - but there were times where I did break her trust regarding certain issues. I never fully understood why, but we always tried our best to work through them.

That's just one example of arguments that we had, mind you. We would get into very heated exchanges quite often. Weather it be because I was talking to a girl, I went X-amount of time without talking to her, you name it. And these arguments got *ugly*. I don't mean to blow smoke up my ass but I'd like to think I am a kind person, however, we ended up in confrontations so often that I got very fed up, and a lot of times voices would be raised. Things would be said that weren't meant, and many, many tears would be shed.

Absolute shitshow, right? Despite all this, she *still* wanted to keep trying and pushing forward. To this day, I don't understand why. I tried to break up with her many, many times during the relationship, but as previously mentioned, I lack serious backbone. I would always back down because she would cry, scream, and fight back, which in turn made me feel like a failure of a human being. Why couldn't I get out of a relationship with a person who I couldn't even physically touch?

I was turning into a person who I was scared of. I started to sink into a depression, started talking to less and less people due to fear of confrontation of my ex, and would get blistering furious at the mere feeling of an oncoming confrontation. I felt sad, and I felt even worse being that my poor family had to hear *all* of my agony filled babbling.

I don't mean to make her sound like a terrible human being because I truly don't believe she isn't. She has a very big heart when we're not arguing, and she cares deeply about people. I just think she had gone about a lot of aspects of our relationship in the wrong way.

Fast forward again to last night, Easter Sunday. Her and I had pretty much gone the whole day without talking to each other. I had just got done going for a run and I was in the process of cleaning my room when she called me. We exchanged pleasantries, followed by the inevitable questions.

*before the transcription: note that I am an introverted individual who heals and thrives during time to myself, or, alone time. she is extremely extroverted, yet aware of this fact and worked with me to the best of her ability*

Her: Have you been having actual alone time? 
Me: Yes.
Her: I don't believe you.

And thus began our last argument. Like I said, I had gotten to the point where I could no longer control my anger and frustration, and things quickly escalated. It once again got to the point of me saying that I wanted out of the relationship, her pleading with me that it was all just a big misunderstanding, her crying and trying to explain herself - essentially our run of the mill confrontation.  Of course, I was crying, frustrated, angry, and feeling utterly helpless. God, how could I be so weak to let someone across the country control my life like this. As things continued to develop, Easter dinner with my family was ready, yet I was stuck in my room, arguing. My brother, 18, came in and hugged me. He started crying. He told me that he hates to see me like this, and he told me that she wasn't worth the long nights.

I had never felt so shattered. My brother is quieter than I am - and it made me realize that I have been setting such a horrible example for him. I felt like a failure of an older brother. Relationships should NOT be like this, yet he has to hear me yelling all the time, and has to see me depressed. My mom and dad can't stand the sight either. They felt very sorry for me, and they wanted me out of the relationship more than anything, despite liking my ex as a person.

After many, and I mean many, failed break up attempts, I did something that I really, and I mean *really*, didn't want to resort to. I wrote her a break up text, sent it after about 30 minutes of hesitation, then swiftly blocked her everywhere I could.

Not long after, she contacted my mom and through my mom got to speak to me. We had a very long, drawn out, emotion fueled conversation that lasted till about 2am my time, 4am hers. During that conversation, we both spilled our guts out to each other. She told me things that made me feel like I was a very horrible person. She told me that she doesn't think she'll ever be able to move on. She told me that she has never felt so broken before, and it was because of the way I went about breaking up with her. I apologized for every argument that we had ever had, regardless of who was in the right, I cried my eyes out with my mom by my side, and eventually we hung up the phone. 

Here's where things get tricky. At some point, she had pleaded with me to keep her unblocked at *least* on iMessage as a coping mechanism for her. I really didn't think it was a good idea, but of course me being a push over, I heard her plea and agreed, despite my parents advising me otherwise. Of course this meant that I had to tell my parents a bit of a white lie that she was blocked *everywhere*, which of course no one likes lying to their mama, but I did it anyways.

Now, the reason why I didn't end up blocking her all the way is because i'm absolutely terrified of what she might do to herself. She has had a history of depression and self harm in the past, and  if the arguments and screaming weren't bad enough, this break up certainly didn't help either. She had once told me that if we broke up she would never kill herself, but then just last night completely shattered that by saying that if she were ever to kill herself, this breakup would be one of the reasons. I can't fucking handle the thought of having blood on my hands, reddit. I want to be optimistic about her getting help and moving on, despite her saying that she never will (truthfully I just think she's being dramatic) but there's this side of me that is scared of what will happen. I know that ultimately, if she were to ever do anything to herself, it wouldn't be my fault. If she was gunna harm herself then she was gunna harm herself regardless to if I came into her life or not - but that still doesn't help me to be any less scared, especially after what she told me last night. 

Am I being manipulated? *Have* I been getting manipulated this entire time? She wants a super human amount of me and truthfully I feel like my caring nature is being exploited. I'm scared that this has turned into emotional dependency and I don't know what to do. Should I block her out of my life completely and never look back? Change my number and change my social medias? Or should I keep her unblocked and leave the possibility of becoming friends again open for the future? That's her goal with staying unblocked on iMessage is to leave a so called ""lifeline"" available for us to get back to being friends in the future. She promised me that she wouldn't try contacting me if I kept her unblocked but has *already* broken that promise by saying she ""can't do this"" and it hasn't even been 24 fucking hours.

I feel drained, reddit. I feel cold, and I feel like I have changed. I'm scared. Don't worry, I plan to see a therapist sometime this week or weekend. I just wanted some outside perspective. I apologize for any spelling or grammatical errors, and I'm sorry that this is an absolutely clusterfuck of a post. My mind is very jumbled right now so I hope you can understand.

193,"Hi there. I’m a guy and I’m 22 years old. 

I don’t know where to start exactly, or what to say or how to say it, so I’m sorry if this is all a jumbled mess. 

About three months ago, I found out that I was sexually abused (maybe raped, don’t know the difference) when I was five years old. It happened while my sister and I were at our babysitters house. I think it could have been the babysitter’s husband, but he might have been a brother of hers, I don’t remember him exactly. 

I think that this is something that I have known about all my life, but it wasn’t until I found out (got proof), that it really started to take a toll on me. 

I’m pretty sure that I have a lot of issues because I was exposed to my sexuality at such a young age, but I don’t know how to start to even pin point them all. 

There are two main reasons for me posting on here today. One, is that I am gay. Now that I do realize that I was abused, I can’t help but wonder if what happened to me as a child could have contributed to my sexual orientation. And I know that we all say that it’s not a choice... but I am just so confused that I don’t know what to think. 

Another issue of mine is that I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder two years ago. I have recently decided to come off of my medication because I am just tired of all the side effects that come with them. But in doing so, I am having so much trouble dealing with the emotions of my abuse. I know it’s been a long time and that I should get over it because I really was over it for a long time (probably just suppressing it), but now it’s really becoming an issue for me. I’m seriously feeling myself becoming depressed and I can’t even take antidepressants because I don’t want to go manic.  

I’ve started to rant, I’m sorry, but I just wish, if someone out there has been through something like this, can you please help me. I know it’s easy to say to go talk to a therapist or find someone to talk to, but I just need someone that can give me advice, real advice. I’m tired of asking doctors and therapists for help. It’s useless. You can only see them for like 30 minutes, once every one or two months. That’s not going to get me anywhere. 

If anyone out there has any real advice, other than “you need to talk to your doctor, psychiatrist, therapist”, please reach out. 

Thank you.

194,"Lets call her Susie. She dumped me over forgetting to call her one night a week or two ago, and treated me like a whore over it. I have memory loss issues that are not usually as bad or even existant for others my age. She also compared me to an ex. Ouch. We are long distance and also open. My communication has always been flawless. i talked to her everyday and id message her all the time to remind her how beautiful she is and how much i love her. We had/have been dating since late January. We spoke about if she was alright with me doing sexual things with a (longtime) friend of mine, and she was fine with it. We talked about this for months. I regularly checked in with her to make sure she was still alright with it. she was. When the time comes, she gets angry and jelous and i ask her again if she is still okay with it, she said she still was. She went off on a facebook rampage throwing shade at me as if i was cheating on her. After reassuring her i wasnt gonna leave her for my friend she seemed calm. I again asked her, are you sure you are okay with this? she said yes. i literally wouldve done nothing with my friend if she told me not to. i asked her for clarification more times than i had to. even though she gave it the okay i still didnt feel right about it. my friend understood i didnt wanna go very far with anything between us after that whole thing. i told Susie i was gonna call her that night. of course, i forgot. woke up to a text saying ""I guess you got busy, huh?"" and i replied by apologizing and telling her about a few things that i knew would make her giggle-.... and realized she was ghosting me. i felt bad. i checked facebook and susie posted ""I guess im busy too then"". i replied by messaging her again asking if we can talk things out and she leaves me on read... lovely. a few hours later, i get an ""i have nothing to say to you, have fun with your stupid hookup"" then she blocked me. i got on facebook to see all the ""I WONT BE TREATED LIKE CRAP IM SINGLE FOREVER"" posts. i blocked her on everything. i was a wreck. i love that woman, the next day i already having a ton of her friends messaging me to talk to her and unblock her and i told them i was not ready to talk with her. they kept being persistant and everyone and their mother was pressuring me to get back with her when i wasnt ready to even think about dating anyone anytime soon, or talk to her. She eventually got even her exes to get on me about it. My brother was about ready to snap her neck over all this and my sister seemed pissed as all hell even though she want anywhere close to as vocal about it her feelings as my brother was. My brother went fucking beast mode and had the balls to deadass @ her. She is terrifying when shes angry, i dont know if my brother is even sane after watching him do that with no hesitation. he wasnt afraid to do that... HOW???? but yeah. Everyone i know was either mad at me or her or both. everyone made it their business. i was pissed. So was my best friend (she doesnt know i took susie back, she might flip out at susie, and susie might get angry if anyone else gets in our business). My ex forwarded me her apology text, and i just...  i took her back because oh my god everyone went off at me until i didnt really feel like i had a choice. She has been trying really hard to fix things. i see her efforts but im scared of her or what might happen if i tell her how badly she hurt me. there isnt a spark for me anymore.... my self confidence was already in the gutter before all that... I dont think  i wanna be with her anymore, i just wanna at least try and stay friends cause i really do love her to pieces.

195,So me and my ex-best friend have grown apart and I now 100% am aware that it was my fault and that it was a reasonable of him to distance him self from me. I was a pretty annoying and intrusive person back than. We don’t text a lot these days (maybe once a month asking how we are doing). He’s changed as well but in my opinion for the worse to the point where I am fine not being friends with him anymore. But now that I realize that us growing apart was my fault would it be weird if I admitted to him via text that I was a dick back than and apologize for it?

I've been in therapy for years, and thought I had a pretty good handle on my mental health, but I've been so depressed recently, I don't know what to do. No one in my life right now really knows how bad it can get, not even my SO who I've been with for over a year now. (She knows about my suicide attempts and the trauma I dealt with when I was younger, but I'm pretty sure she thinks it's a thing of the past.) (The reason I really don't want to tell her about this is that, when these sort of situations arise where I need her to be there for me emotionally, in my opinion, she falls short . It's not on her, please don't misunderstand, we've spoken about the fact that we approach emotional situations extremely differently, and it's something she's working on to try and support me, but she's no where near the point that I need right now, and I really don't want to stress her out and cause fights between us.)

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as if I have no one to confide in, especially because all of my friends assume I'm making stupid jokes when I do try to hint at things. I know everyone in my life loves me, but there's something stopping me from telling people how bad I am right now. It just feels really pointless when no one can even do anything to help me. Worst case scenario, I have to go to the hospital and that'll just make everything 1000x worse. Best case scenario, my friends feel awkward around me while trying to be supportive and it alienates us from each other. It feels pointless to even be writing this right now.

I am pretty good, Ive always been told I had potential but I never took it that far. I only did what I was told, and sometimes, I would rush it to get it out of the way. I felt guilty about it. I didn't know what to do. I felt lost.

However, I've found approaches of design that I really like, companies that made me think differently about the stigma of design careers and I have a newfound love for it. I just, I don't want to go into some random corporate job. At least not as my first and only option. I always think. What if I go into one of these amazing companies? its always on my mind but I'm always afraid I will be too slow or not good enough. I have always had such a strange and complex relationship with my career and I'm tired of thinking what if.  

Decided I'll just do it. Opinions?",23Apr2019,2
203,"My boyfriend deferred from uni this year and is working a couple of nights a week. The other time he's been hanging out with mates a lot, and smoking weed. I've been sick recently quite a bit so haven't been able to go out as well as being a student and intern. He's done it multiple times before but he just won't tell me when he's out and halfway through our conversations will just not reply for hours. I've told him I don't care if he goes out, who with, or what he does as long as he's safe but just to let me know so I know not to wait for a reply and leave him be. However, he's been doing it all the time. Finding out through friends he out without saying, saying he didn't want me to be upset I couldn't come out (after I said idc just say it doesn't affect me), thinking if he talked to me he didn't have to say he was out (I dont need to be talked to I've told him this multiple times). He's doing it so often and all I've said is just tell me you're off so I know so I don't expect a reply/context etc, even so, I can say hi to my friends too but he keeps doing it and I'm really pissed off. All I want is honesty. Am I overreacting?",23Apr2019,1
204,"My identical twin sister and I are in the same major at the same school.  We both have above average GPAs, but mine is .15 higher, and I got a summer internship while she hasn't gotten one yet.  Since I found out I got my internship, every time someone asks about our summer plans or offers advice on getting an internship, she completely breaks down.  She sobs for an hour, saying that she is stupid (even though this is definitely not the case) and generally ""bad"" and a failure.  I try to tell her that she is smart and simply not succeeding in one thing does not make her a failure, but she rejects any positivy.  At this point, I think she is very depressed, and seems to think that it is impossible for anything to go well for her.  This also has caused a huge rift between us since everytime I succeed she only feels worse about herself. What do I do?",23Apr2019,3

207,"I live in California, in a nice neighborhood.

This evening, I walked past a neighbor, and his dog latched onto my ankle with her teeth, through my jeans.  A second later, I wrenched my leg away and kept walking.  After ~20 seconds of self-doubt, I turned around and approached the owner, asking him whether the dog was vaccinated.  He said that his dog was vaccinated, but kept insisting ""she doesn't bite""...which was irrelevant to me at that point.

At this point, I rushed home to check my ankle.  It stung, but the dog didn't rip my jeans or puncture my skin - there was just the tiniest bit of skin removed, like the dead skin you might find on your hands or feet.  No blood.

I didn't take a picture or get the owner's name, but he almost certainly lives in the same apartment complex as me.  Should I report this as aggressive behavior?  And, should I follow up with my landlord to ensure that the dog actually is vaccinated?",23Apr2019,1

211,"Okay so here's some background context. I was with this guy for almost a year and a half and since he was in the military, we admittedly moved very fast. However, leading up to all of these events, our relationship seemed pretty good and neither one of us seemed to have a problem with how things were going.

However, when he came back from AIT and the initial high faded, he started acting super shady, staying out late, hanging out with girls behind my back who he's already done shady things with and saying things like ""Hey babe you know I would never go through your phone"" and ""You know if you kissed someone else I still wouldn't break up with you."" So I did the obvious thing and checked his phone and sure enough found out not only did he kiss another girl but was talking to many others and talking bad about me. So I confront him, act like I have no idea what's been going on, and he lies up and down and swears on our relationship that he would never cheat on me.

I break up with him, he apologizes and promises me the world, and I stupidly take him back. For a while it was actually going pretty well and he was doing a lot of things to genuinely earn my trust back and with the possibility of an upcoming deployment, he proposed and I said yes.

THEN a few months later he goes to drill and I know the girl he cheated on me with is back from AIT and will be there too. He lies about her not being there yet somehow drill miraculously gets out 3 hours later than it ever has and he breaks up with me as soon as he gets home…interesting…

Fast forward through a few more on and offs and that brings us to now…we've been officially broken up for about a month with less contact then we've ever had and I'm actually moving on this time and seeing other people. Then he texts me out of the blue one day saying he needs to see me immediately and that he has to show me something and that it's super urgent. I say okay for whatever reason and he pulls up to my apartment and shows me a gigantic tattoo that takes up his whole thigh of my initials surrounded with the Hannibal Lecter quote that says ""We will either find a way, or make one.""

After he left, we had a huge argument about the fact that I thought it was creepy and that a tattoo doesn't solve our issues and he started saying things like ""Doesn't this show how committed I am to you?"" and ""You can't leave me now that I got this"" …so then I unfollowed him on everything and blocked his number…am I an asshole??...",23Apr2019,1
212,"This is a stupid question but I’m not willing to go to anyone in my personal life for input so here I am I guess.
I made friends with a girl about a year ago and only recently did we start actually being pretty good friends, she ended up telling me she thought she was bi or a lesbian but she wasn’t sure and we talked it out. For context I’m an outspoken lesbian, I have a supportive group of friends so I’m comfortable with myself and being laidback and generally approachable I’ve talked to quite a few people on figuring out who they are.
Anyways she realized she had a heavy preference for girls and I told her to embrace it and whatnot.
Few days ago she confessed to having feelings for me, no big deal, she’s pretty dope, but a part of me thinks it’s just because I’m the only other lesbian at our school and she’s never really hung out with someone open and comfortable. I feel like she’s confusing admiration for affection.
She’s fun to be around but I’m just not sure.
I’d just like some outside opinions I guess.",23Apr2019,1
213,"My friend, let's call her Lisa, and I have been friends for 2 years now, and I consider her one of my closest friends in my city (she's one year older). She and I have had very few arguments (only one other small tiff), but we worked through it. I'm one of her few friends in the city, and I would consider her one of my closest friends at the moment. 

I left on a work trip on Monday and asked her to watch my dog, as she + her boyfriend love my dog and almost always watch him when I'm out of town. She also happens to be watching an ex-coworker's dog (let's call him Chocolate) for the first time that week, but he + my dog (let's call him Gizmo) got along really well and played together nicely.

On Thursday, I receive a text telling me that her coworker's dog + my dog chewed through some of her couch pillows, along with the one of the armcaps. She said her boyfriend saw the other dog chewing through one of her yellow throw pillows (of which she has 2), and that my dog was on top of one of the kidney pillows that came with the couch, appearing to be gnawing on a corner. We don't have proof as to who did what beyond the yellow throw pillow and that my dog was on top of one of the kidney pillows.

I then of course freak out, as I know that Gizmo has NEVER done anything like this, and she's watched him multiple times with no issues. He's also lived with multiple other dogs and has never caused any chewing damage. She says Chocolate's owner also said the same thing, but Lisa hadn't watched Chocolate before and Chocolate hadn't lived with other dogs. 

I know she was freaking out because she recently purchased this $2500 couch that came with the 3 kidney pillows from Crate &amp; Barrel. I immediately offer to pay for the damage of a new pillow replacement. She warns me it's going to be expensive, but she said we'll see once we get the quote from Crate &amp; Barrel (in which she was going to call the next day).

I then called Crate &amp; Barrel on Friday for 45 min, but I couldn't find her account info with any of her info (phone, email, address), so I figured she had to have gone through one of her parent's account. Crate &amp; Barrel told me to email me back with account info if I ever got it.

Lisa said that she would charge the two throw pillows (because she doesn't just want to have one yellow throw pillow without a match) + set of armcaps (same thing, she wanted her matching set even though only one was damaged) + bath mat (which she saw Chocolate chew through) + half of a one of the kidney pillow to her ex-coworker, and that I'd be responsible for one kidney pillow cover + half of the cost of the other kidney pillow cover, since she didn't know who did that damage. She said we would just need covers since the insiders were fine. I agreed to this because it sounded reasonable. 

I went to pick up my dog, Gizmo, on Sunday and assessed the damage while I was there. The two long kidney pillows both had puncture wounds, but one was worse than the other. The yellow pillow Chocolate got a hold of + armcap both had unfixable damage. I offered to sew the first one up, as it was an easy fix for me since it was just smaller than a 1-inch rip, but she insisted on getting new ones since she just recently got this super expensive couch. We were still waiting on the quote back from Crate &amp; Barrel, which we were supposed to get Monday (today).

She texted me the quote back today, and it is $308/per kidney pillow, meaning I'd need to pay $462 (before tax/shipping)- I was absolutely gobsmacked. They also couldn't do just the covers, and needed to charge for the entire pillow replacement, even though the insides were fine. I don't come from money like she does -- her family is wealthy and she drives a Porsche, so I told her this wouldn't be possible for me right now. She said that she'd be willing to work it out with me in payment plans.

Anyway, the reason the pillows were so expensive was because it was a custom upholstery for the default pillows that came with the couch and that the fabric was no longer carried, and that fabric had to be sourced from a manufacturing company (that I looked up and found).  I called her to try to ask if she would be ok with other pillows in another color, but she said she didn't want to ""downgrade"" since she paid extra for these, and if that I were in her shoes, I'd be freaking out way more. 

So the other owner would be paying for the following: 

2 throw pillows from Crate &amp; Barrel average roughly $100, set of armcaps (this was included in the quote) = $101, half of the kidney pillow = $154, and a bath mat = $20: Total $375 before tax

And I would be paying for:

1 and a half kidney pillows: Total $462 before tax

This didn't seem fair to me to be paying for more, so I asked her for the order #/account number/any identifying info I could look this up so that I could call Crate &amp; Barrel myself and try to see if there were any alternative solutions, and she kept telling me I was being annoying by going back-and-forth and dragging this out. She did say it was under her parents' account because they helped her with this couch (how much of it, I don't know) and because they went through an interior designer for their house and this was the same people they used for their house. All I wanted to do was exhaust all my options and see if I could get a discount. 

She did text her stepdad after the call about the account info, and sent me screenshots that of her stepdad cussing at her/being pissed at her for messing up the couch. The whole time, I could tell she was irritated with me for asking.

I later called her again to see if she'd be willing to proportionally split the cost apart by damage, since the other dog caused more visible damage and she knew my dog's behavior history, so maybe the other owner pay more than I do. She took great offense to this, and spent the rest of the phone call calling me annoying and that I was making this situation worse and telling me she was being fair and accused me of trying to ""bargain"" with her. She said I had to pay the amount I was quoted because the kidney pillow was that was the only one she could prove that was under my dog, and the other owner was paying for more items, so that's why we were already splitting the other kidney pillow. 

To her, this was the fairest way she could charge us, as she and I talked about it before with no problems (before I knew about the price). I told her I didn't realize it was going to be this expensive, and she said that that isn't her problem. I feel defeated after how non-understanding and short with me she was. 

I have asked my sister and a friend, and they've given me conflicting responses. My sister doesn't think I should pay + lose the friendship, but my friend said she'd pay and try to talk it out with her and just pay it.

Please help... I have no idea what to do. What should I do, Reddit?",23Apr2019,2
214,"I took over my uncles car that was under my moms name. Up until recently she decided we should put it under my name. We began the process and then about a week ago the car got totaled. A drunk driver hit it blah blah. 

We received a rental car, but it has to be returned tomorrow. I explained to my mom that I need to move on it quickly and get my boyfriend[of 3.7 years] (19) and I(20) a new car out. She seems to think I’m buying him a new car because I do not drive. Which ok fair. However, if she were to ever  ask me how my day went she’d learn that he is teaching me how to drive. That being said I’m clearly buying us a car.

Now I guess my mom ranted to my grandma about it and my grandma calls me up [while I’m with him] and says, “ are you sure you’re making the right decision , you don’t know if you guys are going to last , do you think he’d do the same for you. “ I’m super upset at this phone call. My boyfriend pretty much heard the whole thing. 

I do my best explaining he hasn’t given reason to be doubted. He treats me with the upmost respect. Loves me unconditionally and is the guy everyone wants their daughter to have. He has his flaws, but he is perfect. He doesn’t get sad often, but I could tell in his eyes that this hurt. He said if family ever felt a certain way about him he wouldn’t want to know. 

I explained to my mom if she thinks I’m making the wrong decision she should be nervous about it and speak to me and not tell my business. I really hope he doesn’t feel uncomfortable with my family now. I really don’t know what to do or how to feel. I have a broken family and he does not. Both homes are very different and I’m torn. I couldn’t imagine his hearing his family tell him those things. 

Told my mom to allow me to grow up and if I make the wrong decision at least I lived in the moment and enjoyed life while it was there. I believe that even if things go wrong in the future never hold grudge or anger, but cherrish those times bc at one point is was happiness.

219,"TLDR: Read degrading messages about myself on bf's phone he sent to his friends, can't recover from it. What should I do.

I (26F) have been dating my boyfriend (33M) Ben for almost 3.5 years now, all of which have been long distance. We are closing the distance soon in couple months and I think this is the best relationship I’ve been in in my entire life. We met in my city in Dec 2015 where he was visiting for work, we actually started out as “casual romantic partner” which kept on going for almost two years, then we decided to make it official the last year and a half since Jan 2018. Pretty much everything is smooth sailing, of course, except one thing.

We’ve had a longer “non-exclusive” period than most couples I know. We both didn’t want to do long distance. He told me in the beginning, after we hooked up, that he had went through a complicated situation with his “best friend” Karen and he was not in the right mind for a relationship. I accepted this, and I also had reservations about being ""official"" because I was not used to dating a man outside my ethnicity (who doesn't speak my native tongue). We just carried on our “romantic friendship” - I say “romantic friendship” not “friends with benefits” because, despite us usually being in different cities, he texted me 247 (we had great banter and still do), and at least I definitely had feelings for him (not sure if was ""love"" but definitely romantic affection) and I was pretty certain he did as well. We had a don't-ask-don't-tell policy about other men/women in our lives. We were on-and-off, but not “exclusive” for almost 2 years. By Jan 2018, he helped me recruit for jobs in his city, and we made things official.

Fast forward, I did a internship in his city Jun 2018. This is when I fucked up. Karen (Ben’s complicated “best friend”)’s friend who happened to be my colleague noted how I much I looked like Karen. I checked Karen’s facebook and she did look very much like me, and I immediately started feeling like some extended rebound. Then I did what I should have not done - I looked through Ben’s phone when he was sleeping (more than once). Ben had disclosed a lot of his romantic life to his friends, and below is what I read (all texts of six months before we made it exclusive):

“I invited OP to my friend’s wedding, bummer she can’t come. Karen was going to come and it would have been good to have OP by my side. OP is a younger, prettier version of Karen.”

“There’s nothing like getting over a chick than fucking another chick. I got OP to dress up like how Karen used to dress and I hate fucked her, it really made me get over Karen.” (regarding a night where he requested I put on a certain dress and a certain eyeliner look cos it made me look “hot”)

“It’s kinda hard, Sandy (another random girl he was hooking up with) is a real marriage material but a bit dumpy. OP is a hot crazy bitch. I can’t finish on Sandy’s face cos she says it's degrading but OP..she loves it. Sandy is so wholesome though.”

I actually got caught snooping through his phone one night. Ben flew into a rage (righteously) and lectured me about how I breached his trust. I apologized. I did not bring the texts up as I was too focused on apologizing for violating his privacy behind his back.

Now it’s April 2019. I had made passive aggressive comments about Karen and Sandy since, but since never brought up these texts...until today. I thought I did wrong by him by looking through his messages and I tried so hard to just delete them from my memory. But I realized I can’t, after a mutual friend casually mentioned Sandy yesterday and the feeling of insecurity actually numbed me.

Ben technically did nothing wrong. Since we made it official he never had any woman issues (nor did I) and was clear about his love and commitment. I am not mad about the fact he slept with other women during our “casual” time. I am more hurt by the fact he continued to disrespect me in front of his friends for at least months/almost a year, granted we weren’t official, constantly comparing me to other girls or using me to get over others. Sandy, Karen, and I are of similar “attractiveness” and education level - I feel the reason Ben respected Sandy and Karen more than me was because I was more sexually open. And I feel so betrayed because I was so giddy I had found someone I could be so open sexually (Ben was my first partner who didn’t shame me for my submissive kinks) - and I felt it actually backfired into him somehow respecting me less. I also have always felt humiliated whenever I met his friends, although they have been respectful to me to my face.

Today I broke down and told Ben about how these texts bothered me, how every time I think about them I cry in my sleep. He apologized but quickly qualified with “don’t bring it up again as it reminds me of the time you went through my phone.” I still cannot emotionally resolve my insecurities out of my head.

I don’t want to break up. I regret going through his phone. I don’t want to press this issue further with Ben as it will only upset him about his invasion of privacy. With that said, I cannot unsee what I saw. I am losing sleep and I am not happy. Please tell me what I should do.",23Apr2019,1

221,"I want to preface this by saying that I am fully aware I cannot just walk into a salon and they will be able to get me back to my natural color; I am just looking for advice and a realistic timeline. 

My natural hair color is a light blonde. Over the past two years, I have consistently colored my hair dark brown/black. It currently is black, but I have about half an inch of my blonde roots growing in. I’ve decided that I no longer want to pay for/keep up with the constant salon visits, and so I want to find the least painful way to go back to natural (basically, I don’t want to just let my very light blonde hair grow in while having the rest of my hair be black - it’s just not the look I am going for). 

What would some of my options be? My initial thought is that I should go in every 2 months or so to get my roots blended in with the rest of my hair in a slightly lighter shade, to eventually just kind of ombré out until I’m fully blonde again (and of course, getting haircuts to slowly cut out the darker colors.)

223,"Me: I just want to thank you and Mrs. G for everything y’all did for me. I didn’t thank y’all enough in the past and I did not thank y’all enough after Adam and I split because I was so bitter. thank you two so much for being loving and caring and shaping who I am today. As I get older, I see parts of you two in myself and I appreciate yalls role in developing who I am. Sorry for when I pushed y’all away. Y’all are awesome parents!

Him: That was the sweetest message! I'm glad you think we had a positive influence on you. Honestly Mrs. G has had a positive influence on me too. I love how she's always in a good mood, always excited to do anything. She lives in the moment. Whatever she's doing right now, she gives it her best and makes it fun. I have enjoyed watching you grow up and mature. Even though we dont talk very often, I can tell that you have been working on yourself, that you more comfortable with yourself.

Me: Y’all definitely deserve that appreciation and more! 

I was afraid of being nice to y’all and Adam after everything because I thought it would make things hurt even more. now it feels better to thank y’all for everything. I constantly am reminded of y’all in the way I think and act and the things I enjoy. I also love Mrs. G’s positive attitude and when I’m being my best self I see part of Her in me. Always down for an adventure, excited for the possibilities the future holds, and always seeing the positive side of anything that happens, good or bad. 

I know we don’t talk often. it’s because I wanted to protect myself so I wouldn’t feel hurt. 

Him: I’ve always been proud of you and have always loved you. I understand sometimes you have to burn a bridge in order to force yourself to find another bridge. I get that. But I've learned over the years that you don't need to burn  bridges. Yeah, there are a few people that if I saw them at the grocery store before they saw me, I'd turn around. But it's better if I can just be nice and respectful to everyone. I try not to judge anyone... I don't know what they're going through.

Me: I didn’t mean to burn a bridge. It was my first breakup so I had no idea how to act.

Adam has been nice and understanding despite the mean things I said and did and I recently thanked him for that. I realize what I saw in him when we dated and how he still is that person despite what we have been through. his chill calmed the negative parts of my feisty/fiery/passionate side but allowed me to express it in a positive way. He told me he does appreciate someone who is emotional where he valued logic more in the past. he’s been very nice to me despite what has transpired. 

We talked for hours a few months ago till 5 am and after his birthday we talked for two hours. I am grateful he has been nice to me and we have gotten along well and we plan on talking again sometime soon-ish. I’m realizing the value of having him as a friend even though people say don’t be friends with exes.

224,"I work on a small but growing team which is sorely understaffed. This team has doubled in the three years I have been on it - including restructuring ourselves.  There are around 20 members with 3 main focuses. 

There is a single VP with 5 directors. I report to a director along with a new, part-time individual. With our company expecting massive changes that will impact our entire organization, VPs time has become limited to interact with the whole team. Instead, we only interact with our directors who then take decisions to the VP - or to other directors. As a result my projects are a matter of me asking for permission to proceed on a direction. Most days look like this:

- I am project manager for a program that spends more than $500K a year. I am no longer in strategy discussions with stakeholders, but instead receive short and limited instruction on massive decisions from Directors. (previously I hosted and led these discussions with the stakeholders before director was ever on board). My job mainly consists of completing forms now. 

- my Director is overloaded. Every question or discussion becomes a takeaway that they alone can discuss with other directors or with VP. When we ask “what support do you need? How can we take more initiative?” There is no answer except “standardize things more”. Then, when standardizing is proposed I am told “that isn’t yours to own” (despite being project manager) and that “your colleagues are going to need to do that” despite the fact that I have been made the primary project owner. 

As a team, we truly have more work than people to support. I’ve asked to sit on meetings to learn different approaches, to have opportunities to attend conferences where I can sharpen skills, etc. etc. I rarely get a response, let alone approval to do any of those items. 

I have been with this company for over 5 years (and I’m a Millennial!) and this is my third position with this company. The kicker is, I turned down a management opportunity on another team a year ago so I could partner with and build solutions with my Director. 

Is there hope? Should I try something different with this structure in place? I take less enjoyment in my work daily and dread having to complete another “order” versus creating/guiding/building something of value. 

TL;DR: my department has become siloed where decisions are only made by a few. Unsure if I should try new tactics or give up on this team and look for new role.",23Apr2019,1

226,"My dad in particular has a helicopter and authoritarian parenting style. He calls me when I come home from work late, like at 6pm instead of 5pm, or when I'm out with friends even after I've already told him I will be out that day. He micromanages and tries to control my daily activities like telling me to shower before it gets too late, or sleep by 10pm, or to eat some food at a certain time. I would move out, but financially, it makes better sense for me to stay with my parents. I've had countless open talks with him about it, and partly he says it stems from his insecurities from having retired and feeling useless from not contributing financially or otherwise to the family like he used to. I tell him that he defines how he views his life and self-worth, and I or others in the family can't be the only reason for his wanting to be useful and having a good life. It sometimes feels like he's guilt-tripping us, saying, stuff like ""well, if you don't need me anymore, then I should just die."" I love him and value the time I have with him, but I feel like I'm in a subtly hostile environment.

I know they have a few other group chats but I don’t know if they made a new one cause of me and kind of exclude me. There is this 1 person who hasn’t liked me for a while but I thought I started to get him to like me and now I feel like he tries to avoid me (on Xbox) and when this other 1 would get on he would always invite me to play but now he never does and they always make plans and stuff and talk about them around me but they never really invite me (is it cause they don’t like me?). There is this other guy who I think likes me but I think I’m getting pushed out and for context I’ve known them for a long time (would play with them every few weeks or so or few months) but I really started to try and get into the group these past 1-2 months.. am I paranoid or should I just give up trying to get into the group?,23Apr2019,1

234,"Hi guys. I'm in a pretty dark place at the moment. I've been dealing with debilitating chronic major depressive disorder since I was a kid. Decided that philosophically speaking I have no interest in living any part of a human life in this world and the good is not worth the bad a long time ago, about the age of 6 or 7, and have been fighting to remain alive for the sake of those I love ever since. No treatment has work. I have spent months in hospitals undergoing treatments, trying all kinds of different medications, lifestyle changes, etc, nothing really quite does it and it gets harder every day.

I've been going through a particularly rough patch the last 6 months or so and haven't been working, been unable to get dressed or clean my room, or tend to my body's needs most days, let alone leave the house.

My mother has been less than supportive about it all for a long time as she believes that a lot of it comes down to pure laziness and my unwillingness to do anything to be a functioning human. Especially as she has struggled with issues herself but has always been able to juggle the welfare of the entire rest of her family (her parents, elderly aunts, and siblings on her shoulders solo for years now, in addition to trying to keep up being a single income household that she can't afford. She's given up expecting me to be able to help her with literally anything a long time ago, and definitely resents me to a degree for it, which I totally understand.

I feel nothing but constant guilt for what a shitty daughter I am and have been for my whole life. She worked so hard, she always has, and she wanted a perfect daughter who was well-behaved and organized and driven to succeed and I am none of those things. I can't even sleep the proper hours or brush my teeth every day. Washing my face when I finally manage to force myself out of bed at 5 in the afternoon is like climbing Mount Everest. I couldn't possibly have failed her more and all I want to is to be better for her but I just don't have it in me, I really really don't

Lately my grandparents have been really sick, her debt is growing and she's going to have to sell our house, she's completely overworked and exhausted in absolutely every aspect of her life, and she comes home fuming and crying and telling me she's going to have a mental breakdown soon so whatever I want to do with myself I better figure it out and do it soon cause I'm not going to be able to count on her for anything at all.

I feel so helpless and frustrated. I want so badly to help and I really do try but what feels like a huge accomplishment to me that I've done in an attempt to help her, she just rolls her eyes at because that's something anyone wouldn't think twice about and it would take them 1/12 the time and effort it takes me. I don't want to keep letting her down. I need to help her because that's what is right to do and what I owe her and much much much more but I just fucking can't I can barely keep myself alive at all how the hell am I supposed to help her??

She refuses to put my grandparents in a home, can't get them home care, the siblings (my aunts) don't help all that much and both just want to put my granparents in governement homes. My dad and my mother have been divorced for most of my life and he hasn't worked for most of my life, plus he isn't at all involved with her or her family so he isn't of help, not to mention he and I haven't spoken in a few months after a big fight about my condition.

And I'm an only child. So there's no other siblings to step up and take control. We're broke. She's got no one to pick up the slack. I am in hell every second of the day both by attack from my own mind and from the guilt of not being able to get up even a fraction of the strength or energy, emotional, mental, or physical, that I can to finally be the person I need to be for my mother.

The only thing that ever helped me be better for a while was spontaneously running off to another country for a while, which I have been trying to get up the strength and the money to do. I now have the visa to go but as I was asked to leave work back in December and been having to dip into my move savings for our groceries and daily essentials so now not only is my best shot at saving myself and finding some kind of will to live again potentially gone due to a lack of finances, but even if it weren't how can I leave her right now? But me staying here in this state isn't actually helping anyway. I don't know. It's all too fucking much. I want to not exist. I want to go back to England and try to find that better, infinitely happier version of myself again. I want to be better for her and actually be able to help her in some genuinely significant way.

What am I supposed to do? Please give me some kind of advice. It all feels so dreadfully utterly hopeless.",23Apr2019,0

241,"Sooo...story time (tldr at bottom)

&amp;#x200B;

In August, moved to Colorado and am staying in a ""studio"" right now, aka an old lady's renovated garage that is at most 200sqft. Prior to moving, I knew eventually I wanted to move into an apartment, but housing was hard to find while I'm out of state and have pets to consider so I settled for this place. 

&amp;#x200B;

I began searching around for an apartment as that was everyone's suggestion since the housing market is very competitive here but luckily I found the perfect place in November. The structure was still being build and the projected finish date was February at first, so I went ahead and let my landlord know that I had found some place that worked better for me and that I'd like to know if I can break the least with her (before signing and paying the application fee for the new place).

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently she didn't take that well. She straight up accused me of taking advantage of her, and that I never intended to honor my lease in the first place. I've never met this lady in person although she's supposed to be living in the house part of my garage. The only times I've talked to her is through text, telling her I've paid rent basically. 

&amp;#x200B;

In her extremely accusatory rant to me, she said that she has no sympathy for me but she will let me break the lease. If I paid for 2 months of rent AFTER I moved out. She said that the time I wanted to move was bad and that its hard to find another tenant (which is a lie, I know this from talking with other longtime locals and trying to find potential tenants myself.)

&amp;#x200B;

After some back and forth with the new apartment management, it looks like a second building would be available at a later move in date, the end of April (Next week yay!!!)  I had spent a lot of time trying to see if my landlord would allow a lower penalty for moving out early. According to her, the $2300 extra I have to pay is due to how early in the year I'd be moving, and that moving in March would be $1150 (1 month) and anything after that would be $500. Even if I'm moving in June with my lease ending in July. I decided to go with moving out at the end of April for $500.

&amp;#x200B;

I had assumed that my $500 would go towards any cleaning or repairs she needs to do before moving in a new tenant, or maybe to help cover some extra time she needs to find someone. But today, she just sent me a text demanding for my apartment to be shown because she wants to move someone in by May 1st and ""can't afford to miss a month's rent.""

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm sitting here wondering what the heck am I paying the $500 for since she clearly has plenty of picks in potential tenants (I'm not surprised per my own research and colleagues calling out her bs to me.) She doesn't seem to be planning any kind of additional maintenance to the place since I move out April 30 and someone else moves in May 1st. She did buy a few items for the place specifically for when I moved in - 2 bath mats, some hand towels, and curtains. These certainly do not cost $500.

&amp;#x200B;

**I guess my ultimate question is:** 

What am I paying $500 for? Should I be paying it at all? Is there foul play going on? I'm Asian in this 90% white/mexican community. I have always spoken to her with respect (texts confirmed by new apartment manager since I was paranoid that I'd said something to set her off), never had any complaints about me from the other tenants, always paid my rent on time and if not, I gave a heads up, am a professor at a nearby college so my occupation shouldn't raise any flags. But she is still very rude in her language toward me and I'm just at a loss at how someone can be distressing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tldr;** 

Rude landlord demands that OP pays a ridiculous fee for needing to move out early despite having several month's notice in advance (and offers to clean &amp; search for a tenant, which were refused.) OP wants to know if this is reasonable, and if so, what is her money going towards if the new tenant is moving in right away.",23Apr2019,1

246,"After having to move from my apartment due to an abusive relationship I started sharing a house with a “friend” I had for about 10 years. Shortly after moving in she allowed 2 of her co workers to also move in, no big deal I said that was fine, it brought down my part of the rent. The 2 co workers were a young gay couple fresh out of high school. Things were ok for a couple weeks. After some time she regularly had a bunch of friends over who were all very loud and completely disrespectful to the fact she wasn’t the only one living there. One day apparently she told her current fuck boy it was ok to move into our basement. I was not informed of this at all. I come home to find a bunch of people I don’t know in my home in the basement moving the things I has stored down there out of there way. (They moved my things to a room that eventually got really wet and everything that was down there was ruined). After having to yell at them to leave because my roommate wasn’t even home. I went down to see what they had done. It looked like they were trying to make a stupid recording studio down there. But I also found a backpack. It was in my home so I went threw it knowing these guys were up to no good. In it I found an assortment of drugs and baggies and a scale. So I threw his bag into a pool of water and left that there. Pissed that these people had no problem bringing and leaving heavy amounts of drugs into my home. I told her about this and she didn’t care. More then likely because she was joining in on the fun. I also told her I was not comfortable with her allowing this guy to be at our house without her. She for some reason can’t see she’s being completely used for a fuck and a place to stay. This chick is not cute at all. Fast forward a little. She’s to the point that she has now given the guy her house and car keys so he can bring and pick her up from work and use her car. Guy shows up at the house again without her. And with a bunch of his friends. My rooms in the attic and I came down to let my dog out and find about 15 people I don’t no partying in my home. I again ask them to leave they refused saying my roommate said it was ok and that because her name is on the lease first her say matters more. Know idea where they got that idea from. They continue to refuse and are arguing with me at this point. I’m surrounded by about 5 Spanish guys I don’t know, at this point they’re yelling at me because I’m telling them to leave. I call my roommate and ask her to tell them to leave. She then informed me that this guys apparently moving in. I currently have her on the phone as they’re yelling at me. One of the boys that lives with us came down to see what all the yelling was about. Her fuck boy gets in this poor kids face and says you’re a faggot I’m moving in here because there needs to be a man in this house. And various other things. She herd all this on the phone and still said she didn’t care this guys moving in. So I said fine fuck this I’m moving out. I got my shit and moved out within the week. She dodge me lied to me and eventually changed her phone number because I wanted my deposit back since she now has 3 other deposits from other people. Her mother lied about the deposit saying I never gave it to her. She’s not worth my time for court so I’ll take that as a lesson learned.

247,"I met 3 new people. A couple and a goth. We're supposed to start playing dungeon together (a role playing table game). He belittle my strengths, ridiculed me, has to be the best about everything, knows it all... He's very demeaning.

Instead to admit that he doesn't know how to make a good story, he claimed that we'd practice the mechanics of the game, to help us learn. As if we were too dumb to play. When we all already did. The other dungeon masters just explained to us as we played, but he expects us to learn all on our own. And when I asked a question, I noticed that it's actually because he doesn't remember the book that he wrote himself. 

So I made the mistake to say that I might buy a tablet one day, and he laughed saying not to get one, because I suck so much at computers that I'll fuck it up. I have a college diploma in web design, computers. My own web site. I hack my window registry to modify my OS to my own liking. I have a mentally retarded friend who never fucked her own tablet. He wants to work in computers but has no degrees. I think he got threatened by my actual skills and wanted to belittle me to feel less insecure. He didn't even mock my weaknesses, but my abilities. I tend to be arrogant, I think he wanted to crush me to dominate me. I replied that he underestimate my skills. He replied that I still shouldn't because they're expensive. I replied that he underestimate my capacity to save money. I was cold. But I got angry later... to have someone laugh in my face calling me too stupid to use basic tools when it was my career. I'm no longer up to date, and I'm using a mega old OS, because I customized it so much that I'm in no hurry to change. I can do cooler things with photoshop 7 than he can with the most recent suite, because I have more creativity. I don't use the pre-made gaudy garbage, I draw. All he does is to put a text on someone else's art... he starves himself to buy the best tech, but what he does with it is just text on other people's art, it's more boring than a rage comic (I love those). But I can't tell him that.

I utterly dread going back to play dungeon with an incompetent DM who take us for retards because he can't be bothered to make a story, and claim that it's to do us a favor, poor inferior mortals. (my words, not his, but he would have been cooler if he had said it that way)

Wanting to be the best at everything, even things he knows nothing about, belittling our strength to dominate us, I think he's a narcissist. I want to keep the couple as friends, I wish I could play dungeon with them and not feel left out, but I don't want to be belittled and mocked by an incompetent DM doing a boring game without even a story...

What would you do... is there a way to save anything? I feel like I should cut my loses and avoid the places he goes to. Should I explain the situation to our common friends? It's mean to talk behind someone's back and put them in a difficult situation, but maybe they are abused too and never noticed, or maybe they aren't because they're super sweet and docile. Narcs feel the urge to crush me.

What enraged me the most is how he claimed to know better than me at nutrition, even though I studied it for 10 years and can do a roasted duck. He eats uncooked ramen... If he knew what I know, he'd be unable to eat that way, it's the equivalent of doing auto mutilation and suicide. Deficiency of vitamin C, B and magnesium is so utterly dangerous and painful, physically and mentally, that it makes us wish we were dead. He's on antidepressants... and anti diarrhea. Duh! And he tells me that I should be on drugs too and feel sorry for me when I feel sad... well, I just lost a previous group of friends because of death threats, let me mourn, I have a heart damnit!

Should I bail on that group of friends too... But the couple is nice. Maybe I should avoid the goth like a plague and just do things outside with them alone, since he's as antisocial as a vampire scared to leave his coffin for more than 2 hours... it was cool at first, how he dressed, how he seemed to have his shit together... and something to teach me about being assertive... but if he thinks that ramen is nutrition at all, and better than a roasted duck and bone broth with veggies that cured my diabetes in a week... and my suicidal urges in 3 days... without fucking dope... because it stabilized my blood sugar and corrected nutritional deficiencies... if he thinks that ramen is better and good enough for basic survival... then he's seriously delusional, the lack of B made him psychotic, and I shouldn't trust a word he says... especially since he's a narc. People who think they know everything never learn... so it feels pointless to explain to him. He even mocked the gentle way that I express my boundaries, thinks it's only valid if you do it loud and firm... Never seeing him again would be more effective than a constant power play of who can intimidate the other more.

I don't want this shit in my life. Sorry for the rant and confusion...

So basically... would you play the game to see the couple and avoid feeling left out, or at the second he mocked you like retard and invalidated your skills, you're out? I want to kick him out of my life, but they're kind of a trio package deal... do I see the couple alone outside and play it cool claiming I'm busy and mourn the game? Or should I just bail before they turn on me too?

The irony is that I told him that someone did psychological violence on me, without saying who... that he belittle my strengths, probably to dominate me... and they replied that he's not a good friend for me.

I dread seeing him again. Would you tell him to never belittle you again, not for your weaknesses, and not for your strengths? I think it,s pointless because that's who he is, an insecure jerk who'll crush people to be on top. Who thinks the value of what he owns gives him value, and that I'm a retard about tech to still use my old programs for free, when it does the job because I have creativity.

I'm sick of him... how do I keep the talk to a minimum, how do I avoid being abused? I don't even want to be in the same room, but we go to the same activity center. I don't want people who mock me in my life. I was in special classes for the gifted, and my mother called me a retard constantly... Now I see that she attacked my strengths to destroy me harder... so that I'd have nothing left... make herself feel powerful and in control, so less insecure... and he's doing the same. I didn't keep that whore in my life even though she gave birth to me... so a fat guy with huge tits who burps as loud as possible with no class whatsoever, claiming to know more than me at my specialty... it sickens me. I've seen homeless people eat better than he does... I have an existential crisis because I can't meet anyone who share my passion for the link between nutrition the body and the mind... it's so beyond anything mainstream... people want to care for animals so they become vegan, or they restrict calories hoping to be thin (it doesn't work that way, sugar makes you fat, not fat... and veggies makes you shit so hard those calories doesn't matter as much than eating junk food that goes straight into body fat)... God he doesn't even know how to boil ramen and he tells me that he knows more than me, who knows how to cure everything... someone cured cancer stage 4 with something similar to what I used to cure myself... No one looks down on me about nutrition. Not an obese guy burping after eating his ramen raw...

I want him out of my life... but I wish I had friends, fun games, and be included... But a dungeon without a story, while the DM belittle all my skills and threat us like we're retard who need to practice rolling dices for months before we can play for real... and expect us to do his job ""to help us learn faster""... without help... without a story... that's not a game... that's not fun.

I don't want to play that game, but I don't want to be left out alone... I wish I wasn't so toxic myself and could attract saner people... But just because I'm at the bottom of the barrel doesn't mean that I should have no class and no standards for myself and others. I don't want to be deliberately hurt, I don't want people to shit on my self esteem on a regular basic, and claim that it's doing me a favor, claim that they know better by not even trying than me after struggling to eat right and learn for 10 YEARS!!!

My pride is probably bigger than a narc, because I base it on my ability to learn, so my capacities is endless. It's not the best already, but it's limitless. 

It's pointless to even explain to him the value of what he lost. How he lost all credibility when he kept claiming that he knows better than me about nutrition, how I'd fuck up a tablet because I'm so inept at tech. I never even needed to use one of my backup (on a separated drive) after messing with the registry... and he thinks that any average Joe is better at tech than me...

If I stay... he'll slowly erode my dignity and sanity... bullshit and loud burps will see normal. In his other game, people make fart jokes... 

I want better. Should I cut my losses now or wait for better while enjoying the couple playing his shitty half baked dungeon? Or should I run from toxic narcs like my life depends on it? I don't even want to hear him burp... it disgusts me to no end... It makes me feel miserable to be at the bottom of the barrel, not just financially, about my health, but also the dignity of the people around me... dignity is free. I didn't even like burp contests when I was a teen, I'm 40 he's 30... some people never evolve.

I want to evolve... How do I handle this situation? Is there anything to salvage? I want to play, and have friends, but the cost and reward isn't worth it... but why are others able to be happy in that... maybe I'm just snob... and should find better... but I have flaws that classy people dislike... But I think I'd rather be alone than with people ""below me"" and who deliberately try to drag me down... even lower than their level.

I refuse to be dominated by an obese person who can't even cook ramen, too scared to go out for more than 2h, and who feel the need to belittle his friends to boost his insecure narc ego.

I worry that I'm a narc too, because my mother was... and I'm so damn arrogant. I'm not going to lose to a narc. I like them flashy, not a retard who can't even cook noodles for 2 minutes in a microwave. 

If I'm inferior to that, kill me now.

Without self care, there's nothing but misery. And not letting people belittle me for fun is part of it. I've been crushed all my childhood and must work extremely hard to undo the brainwash... I don't want to be a crazy needy person feeling helpless like a poor little victim. I want to empower myself with focusing on my strengths, and improving them, slowly. Knowing that good is good enough even if nothing is perfect. That even if someone in the world is better than  me, I'm better than I was, and improvement is the most important skill, because it opens the door for all of them! Even if I'm not predisposed to some. I refuse to have my head shoved in a shit that isn't mine. Mocked for his own shortcomings, trying to transfer them on me...

I am beyond enraged by the brainwash he's trying to do to me, not as subtly as it seems insignificant, once you've been through years of narcissistic manipulations...

Damnit, I'm stuck on a loop.

So what would you do? Would you try to go play? Or the game isn't worth it, the friend isn't worth it, and I can see them in other places? I'm absolutely sure that I don't want him to have the opportunity to mock me again. Maybe I'm a drama queen for wanting to cut people out of my life easily all the time... or maybe I wouldn't be so badly mentally damaged if I had done that sooner...

As I wrote... it,s obvious that I want nothing to do with him... but I wish I could just play the game and have fun, I wish he didn't ruin a mutually respectful relationship to be a dominating control freak... He seemed tough, but it's all lies, he's even more insecure than me and the other girl combined. 

Pathetic... and he won't improve no matter what I say... because he thinks that he's perfect and that ramen is absolute knowledge. I might as well argue with a dog turd.

I feel like I'm in the movie idiocracy... I'm angry at myself for being attracted to yet another narc... I long for a worthy leader to help me improve... he pretended to be that, then crushed me where I shine... while pretending to be a savior... and crushing back deeper than I was every time he sees something good... This is sick... sick mind blowing cruelty.

I want out, I want to run. How do I avoid him when he's always with the other 2 friends and I want to play games with them? How do I mourn and let go... I don't want to give him another chance, I don't want to try to ignore him while he ruins my mood and poison my inner field with seeds of insecurities... I lost trust in him, not myself... if I stay that could change...

What would you do? I don't want to lose all my friends and the center to flee a narc... but that's usually necessary... and I don't think I'm strong enough... what do I tell him the next time I see him in the group... I should keep it trivial... and slowly distance myself... without ever letting him know why... because he's not worth the effort... and someone who thinks he knows it all and perfect won't improve... The last time I snapped he claimed that it was just a misunderstanding, when it was clear disregard... I let it slide... I shouldn't have... Saner people wouldn't have spoken to him at all...

I want out, out of my old patterns... out of low lives... How do I reach higher... how do I improve myself... I talk too much, freak out, am negative, it's red toxic flags... How do I break the cycle... I'm negative because I dare to face that I'm in a miserable situation, I won't have anything fun to say until I have fun with people, without being belittled... but if I'm miserable, the happy people should and will flee that... and I don't want to be with people who self sabotage and neglect themselves and embrace the gutter with open arms... 

How do I let go... How do I stop being so afraid and haunted by darkness... without drugs.",23Apr2019,2
248,"I don't necessarily know if this is the right place for this, but I just need some form of help or suggestions.

I  looked out my window and I see someone parked on the side of the road, lights blinking, standing in my yard with their flashlight out. At first I thought they were broken down or hit my mailbox, but I had an eerie feeling so I decided against going out there and helping. They were just standing and walking around for a good 20 minutes with a flashlight, occasionally crouching down, and eventually they left and took off. 

I headed out to where they were, and there's a fresh, dead possum neatly propped onto cardboard in my yard.

The person could have just hit it and didn't want to leave it in the road, but why go through so much effort to neatly display it in someone's yard? This person could have easily have dumped it into the other side of the road where there's plenty of weeds and forest. Why specifically my front yard? Basically, there's tons of other places this person could have put this thing, seeing as I live in the middle of nowhere in the country. 

Or perhaps the possum wasn't dead and they were trying to finish it off so it wouldn't suffer? It didn't look that injured, just some blood underneath it, I also couldn't see any blood in the road. 

I'm pretty sure I also saw them take pictures of it.

I don't know, but the whole thing is really making me uneasy. I took a picture of the person while they were doing their thing, and I'm going to take pictures of the possum if it's still there when the suns up, I just feel too disturbed to be outside in the dark alone with a dead animal displayed in my yard. 

Could this be a possible threat? Or something more nefarious? Or am I just getting caught up in the creepiness of this whole incident? Should I just ignore this, clean up the mess, and move on?",23Apr2019,2
249,"In 2015 and 2016 I was in a lot of emotional turmoil due to some online bullying and some unrelated events that scarred me later on. For some reason my understanding of teacher-student boundaries was lost in the process and I was trying really hard to confide in my teachers as if we were friends. I know it made most of them uncomfortable for those years and I still don’t really know how to cope. I also know I tried to add one of them to FB several times (not that they were rejecting), would revoke the friend request pretty much immediately, and then did it again when I was feeling confident.. I bet that looked super creepy and weird. I just feel so stupid. They’re in a lot of circles related to my career too and even classmates have become friends with some of them. So I’m feeling especially stupid for leaving bad impressions. I don’t think there’s a reason to try to fix these relationships? I feel like emails out of the blue apologizing would also be weird considering how many years it’s been.

I’m just super embarrassed. My friend, who is a professor, told me he never really holds that sort of thing against students because he knows they’re going through periods of change and growth and probably won’t be that way if they ever meet again. But I don’t know. I’m still feeling stupid for being so weird and overly personal.

I have literally lost sleep over this. I feel so cringey and bizarre and I just feel terrible... I’ve changed so much since then. I would never do this sort of thing at this stage in my life.

How do I get over the fact that I probably left poor impressions on a few of my teachers?",23Apr2019,3
250,"I (19F) met an amazing girl (24F) online and we instantly hit it off. We have been chatting for weeks and everything was going great. Although recently I’ve started to feel guilty because I have a drug addiction that affects multiple aspects of my life. I came clean to her expecting the worst and for things to end, because let’s face it nobody wants to waste their time with a deadbeat addict. Much to my surprise she reacted the opposite to what I had expected; she was beyond accepting and did not judge me. She actually wanted to continue talking and see where things went. This floored me. After hearing that she wanted to pursue this further given my drug issue I naturally panicked, fled, and broke things off. Over the time we have spent talking I have come to realize she is a great person based on her involvement in the community, her actions, and ultimately how caring she is. With this in mind I began to think of myself as less than her because I am introverted, awkward, and can’t go a day with out getting high. For this reason I told her I could not continue as I am on a destructive path and I couldn’t bear to have her come along with me on such a dark journey. Looking back at it now I’m beginning to feel like I made a mistake if she was willing to pursue me further given my love for hard drugs. I’m currently reflecting on this situation and it’s leaving me wondering if I made the right decision by removing her from my life so I would not ruin hers or losing someone that genuinely cared about/accepted me. 
Did I do the right thing by not allowing the possibility for my awful decisions to affect her? 

Tl:dr  

Met a great girl that I hit it off with. I felt I had to end things because she 100% accepted my drug addiction; it seemed too good to be true. I didn’t want to corrupt her “normal” life with my messed up one.",23Apr2019,1

252,"Hey all, I don't really know what the best course of action here is so I figured I'd turn to reddit and hope for the best lol. 

There's a girl I've been hanging out with for about 8 years at this point, starting in 8th grade until now where I'm about to graduate college, absolutely one of my greatest friends. I've been in love with her the whole time, back in 8th grade I tried to get a date but she didn't. Fast forward to sophmore year I still have these feelings and she then also wants to date, and we had a thing for about 2 weeks until she decided she didn't want to do that anymore. 

Throughout all this time there have been people that I've had small relationships with (small as in length of time), all short because every time they happen I think to myself ""if that other girl changes her mind I would drop anyone out of my life to be with her"", so I eventually stopped dating because to drop someone out of nowhere like that would be a real shitty thing to do to a person. About a year ago I asked her if anything between me and her would happen, she skirted around the question real hard. 6 months ago I asked the same question, this time emphasizing the no dating thing, she replied saying that she has no feelings beyond friendship, and then apologized for maybe leading me on back in sophmore year.

The current situation is we still hangout and it's always a great time, I still have that love feeling for her but I'm trying to keep it platonic. The thing is now she has a boyfriend, and has been with him for a few months now, which I just found out about yesterday, I was hoping I would be over my feelings and be able to just be happy for her by the time something like this would inevitably happen, and just leave things at that without any changes. But this is the most intense jealousy I've ever felt, going through all the different steps of jealousy like 'what does he have that I don't', sitting around moping, etc. 

I'm trying to keep my cool, this intense emotion will probably wash away after a few days but that doesn't address the root cause of the issue. I can't seem to move on when she was never interested like that in the first place. I value our friendship a lot, 8 years is 40% of my life I've been friends with her, but that may just be a hard pill to swallow to get out of this, but idk. 

So I guess my thing is, what are good ways to deal with jealousy in the mean time to sort of bandaid the situation, and then how do I address this for a more long term solution?",23Apr2019,1
253,"For a recent scene assignment in my college acting class we had to partner up with people we hadnt worked with before. Cool, whatever. I (f19) wanted to pair up with my friend in class (f20) but new she liked a guy in class so i decided to encourage her to partner with him instead (yes theyre dating now). I partnered up with a dude in class i thought was okay (m23) and it turned out to he a huge mistake. I wont go into too much detail but to put it simply he gets super butt hurt, makes backhanded comments, passive aggressive to me and other students, is nit picky, and force me/made me feel like i had to do everything perfectly when it turns out he didnt do any share of his work at all. Despite him flaking on the midterm and not memorizing his lines he still acted like a huge dick to me and talked down to me when i was mid tears because of a depressive episode (5th day in row i forgot to take anti depressants, mom got rushed to hospital, am stressed about finishing up my transfer process to university, had to get rid of all my online friends/social media to focus on school, favorite coworkers were being promoted). I told my sister about the situation and she told me to tell him to show me a little more respect but the few times i tried speaking up on something as small as suggesting he use a different tone on certain lines he would get snappy and angry at me and im worried that if i say something ill make a scene when i just want him to be a little nicer and maybe just let me survive this assignment. Can someone help me, if possible, find a way i can calmly communicate to him in the nicest way possible that hes being a dick and it would be cool if he would stop picking on me when he's the one failing the class/project?

260,"So this is going to be confusing so I’m sorry in advance. Last fall (2017) I began my freshman year of college, prior to attending (this is important) my parent and I were able to complete my FAFSA with no problem and fill out another financial aid program through our state, again with no problem. So my freshman year of college was completely paid for through FAFSA, the state program, and scholarships I received from my school, aside from $5,000 that I had to take out in loans due to losing a scholarship during my second semester (due to grades bc something bad happened to me), I almost wasn’t able to take out student loans because my family members have bad credit, however, my grandparent was able to be my co-signer. During my freshman year when it came time to fill out my FAFSA for the next year (2018) I don’t recall there being any issues, however, my parent and I did notice through the state financial aid program we were unable to complete it for an unknown reason. We called the program asking what was wrong and we were told that the IRS was unable to locate my parents’ tax return for 2017. My parent and I both found this strange because FAFSA was able to retrieve it with no problem. So we thought it wouldn’t be a big deal and we could probably get it resolved with no problem. We were dead wrong. During the summer before my sophomore year there was no luck with the IRS, we were repeatedly told “We will see what the problem is and get back to you”, which was strange, then we were told that my parent hadn’t filled out their tax return from that year, which again they did as FAFSA was able to retrieve it. So during my fall semester as a sophomore I received financial aid from FAFSA but still owed money in order to come back for the spring semester, I didn’t receive money from my school once again due to poor grades. I went to the financial aid office and explained what had happened to me as a freshman and brought my police report to confirm it. My school was able to give me financial aid, however, I still owed around $1500. I tried reaching back out to the state program but was told they still couldn’t locate my parents tax return. My parent and I contacted the IRS and was told that they have no record of my parent doing their taxes in several years, this goes back to the beginning of my story - FAFSA was able to retrieve my parents’ tax return the first time with no problem. I know my parent has been filing taxes as they were doing online school and using FAFSA while I was growing up. So I am unable to return to college until this issue can be fixed. I didn’t begin making payments on the $1500 as I believed the IRS situation would quickly be resolved, that was my mistake. I am unable to take out another loan due to not having good credit as I am only 19, and my grandparent is no longer eligible as my co-signer as they are no longer working. What I now owe to my school is $2000 after interest came along. I recently got a call from a tax collected saying that I have to pay this by May 30th or else it will cause a huge issue with my credit. I am working as a waitress and in no way am I going to be able to come up with that much money by that time. I have no idea what to do.

With that out of the way, let me set the stage, my girlfriend is pregnant, we're having a boy, she's roughly 31 weeks. We're both very excited, it's our first child we weren't ready, but we're happy regardless. I'm so fucking happy I'm having a child, I really am. One of my hobbies that keeps me sane is I take care of animals, 10 geckos, a chameleon, 5 cats, 2 ducks, and the aforementioned fish. The only animals that reside in my room are the fish and chameleon, I pour my heart and soul into my animals and I take their health into high consideration. Recently my gal has approached with what was more or less an ultimatum, remove the animals from the room or the baby won't be in it. That twists a certain knot in my head, I put a lot of work into my fish and the tank. Its that one thing I can really be proudly of, I don't get that too much. I feel like I'd be neglecting my animals if I just threw everything in the living room, which is already pretty taken up as it is, and having to sideline them for my child. Now don't get it twisted, I'm not trying to say I'm prioritizing my animals over my child, not at all. But it feels like I'm being more or less forced to take that part of my life away or else my child will be held over my head. I want my boy to be into animals like me, maybe I'm just jumping the gun I don't know. I'm torn, I know I'll just end up moving them anyway.

I’m just gonna preface this by saying that I’m young, I’m dumb, and i know that people have bigger problems than what I’m dealing with rn. I’ve just never felt so helpless and lost in my life and if I can reach just one person with this post that would really make my night. Or my whole week.

So to start this off, I (M, 17) am about to finish senior year in June, and in August I’ll be 18 and I’ll be entering into a vocational school (aircraft mechanics). Now just based off that I might sound like a typical stressed out high schooler abt to enter the real world, but everything was going good for me until it wasn’t. But that’s life I guess.

A few months ago I had it good. I had a future naively planned with my girlfriend (F, 20) who is currently serving in the army, a school lined up for after high school, and a motivated and happy attitude about life in general. I was optimistic for high school to be over and to start living for myself. I had the next few years generally planned out and I wanted to see those plans through.

This last week was spring break. Instead of having a fun break I spent the week dealing with breaking up (but not really) with my girlfriend of almost two years, mourning the loss of my grandma, relapsing on drugs and balancing my academics with everything else.

Two months ago, on Valentine’s Day, my girlfriend was raped. It changed her, and she started cheating on me, which inevitably led to our breakup a day after her 20th birthday. To see her change so fast like that as a result of something neither of us could control or stop, it just fucking destroys me. We still have feelings for each other, and this weekend when she visited home from her duty station I saw her again. She kissed me and told me she still loved me and she cares and still wants everything we planned.  

While reeling over my breakup but not really, I was woken up 2am last Sunday to my mom crying horribly over the phone. Her mom, my grandma, had been shot dead. Me and my mom don’t have the best relationship but to hear her cry like that kept me up all night. She went back to her home country to be with family, leaving me and my dad in charge of my four brothers at home.

On top of all that personal shit I also have to worry about scholarships, my grades, and a senior thesis that apparently was written very well but got a failing grade because it didn’t comply to the formatting of the assignment or some bullshit. I’ve grown very disillusioned with how some subjects (specifically English) are taught which is a big reason I didn’t go to a four year. What sucks is after everything that happened Idek if I want the school or career path I chose, and it’s too late to apply anywhere else. And as an added bonus my grades tanked and I’m in danger of not graduating.

I used to party hard and do a shopping list of drugs during my sophomore/junior year (they kinda blur together). I swore off everything except weed and alcohol at the start of senior year, and I stopped going to parties, because high school parties are lowkey lame unless ur tryna get fucked up or fucked. I went so far as to block plugs and hoes as a favor to my girlfriend, which bit me in the ass because I couldn’t even have a meaningless rebound after the breakup. I was loyal to a fault lol

But over spring break the stress got to me. I started smoking weed like I used to, which is a lot. 4/20 being on a weekend didn’t help, it was fun but I was just worried about going down that road and doing harder shit like bars and tabs and pills again. But after seeing my girlfriend or whatever she is over the weekend, I fronted my boy 75$ for dabs and syrup which was an impulsive and stupid decision that I’m gonna spend the next few weeks literally paying for.

I just don’t know what I want anymore. I should be rebuilding myself but idk where to start. I know some of you might read this and see just another kid making stupid mistakes but I’ve never reached out to reddit and this is really a last resort for me.

282,"This is a very long story so, um yeah. A few days ago, I was on a throwaway account on reddit and wrote a story about a toxic crush I had. A guy (M18), we will call him A, texted me (F14) and asked if I needed advice. We talked and A asked for my Instagram. This should of and was a red flag for me but I decided to give it to A. We started texting on Instagram and because A lives on the other side of the world, I had to text him really late at night. It was all fine until A suddenly asked for nudes. I blocked A, then unblocked to check if he said anything. A was actually just joking regarding to something I told him early. A was telling me that a lot of guys do that and you just have to learn to say no. 

A few days later, I was talking to A again and he wanted to face time (another red flag), he told me he couldn't do it now but wanted to schedule a time. I told A that I was going away with family for three days so couldn't. A started saying that he wouldn't wait though. I joking asked what A couldn't wait for. And A started talking about how he has a very big sex drive and how he wanted to have sex with. In my story that I told him, a guy told my brother that I was thick. A also told me that he got hard thinking about it. I am really scared since this guy is 18. I was okay to keep talking to him but then he started asking me for photos of my butt, I said no, and he kept saying how he doesn't even need it nude, just with pants on. He harassed me for hours until I blocked him. He created another Instagram account pretending to be someone else and then sent me a photo of his dick.

I am really scared and I don't know if I am overreacting. I keep having dreams that he flies to my country and finds me because he knows my Instagram and I have photos that show like what school I go to etc.

283,"Hello!

I am a first year university student and we are currently in last few weeks of the term. I have taken notes all term, (even recording lectures) but I cannot take *good* notes for the life of me. (I am getting mentally evaluated later on this year) They always end up as jot notes that I don't understand later and I get confused with what I should/shouldn't write down. However, there is another student in my class that takes excellent notes and I managed to get one of the study guides they made for the third and final term test from a friend.  It made everything so much clearer and easier to study for me (I scored higher on my test than usual). 

Now, here's my question:

Would it be wrong of me to ask them for their notes for the other two term tests (roughly 5 pages each) just a few days before the final? I would compensate them with coffee/bubble tea/food/money for their work. I just don't want to come across as a lazy selfish prick that's using them for their notes.

284,"I never thought I’d be actually doing a post here, I’m always a lurker because most of the times someone else has already given the advice I was originally going to give, so I just upvote and lurk. 

I’m in a LDR with my boyfriend, we live in different countries and we’ll have our 1 year anniversary in a month. We met in my country by mutual friends, fell for each other and started a relationship, 3 months into the relationship he moved with his family to a different country because of his dad getting a new job. 

We have what I would describe as a very healthy, loving and respectful relationship, we have our fights here and there but nothing good communication can’t solve. Despite him being younger than me, he is so mature, an old soul, I’d say. He has never given me reasons to not trust him or to feel like he’s hiding something from me until today. 

We always text throughout the day and then we call/FaceTime every night. He sent me a voice note today telling me a friend (22F) of his asked him for a ride from her work to her house since she didn’t have money to Uber home, he asked me if it was okay if he helped her and I said of course, no problem, I’d help a friend too in his situation, so to me it was a no brainer. 

Then 8:30pm came and he told me he was out of work and on his way to pick his friend from work and that he’d call me once he dropped her off. I didn’t keep time but moments later he texted me and said and I quote, “This dude told me she’d invite me to a Denny’s as a thank you for giving her a ride, so I’m here right now. I love you so much.” So, my immediate thought and reply to that was, “She invited you to eat dinner but she didn’t even have money for an Uber? What?? Enjoy your meal.” He replied, “Idk, but she invited me, babe.” I didn’t immediately answer, I just felt he was lying because none of it made/makes sense to me. I later on replied and said, “ok.” Because I didn’t want to make drama about it or talk about it while he was out having dinner and ruin it for him, so I decided to wait it out until he got home so we could discuss it. 

Then around an hour later he texted me and said he was on his way home now and if he could call me, I didn’t answer because I was very upset as I was sure he had lied to me. He called and I didn’t answer, then he gets home and calls me again and I declined (which I know I should’ve answered but I had sit on it for about an hour and I was sure he was lying and didn’t want to be on a call) and texted instead, I asked if he had lied to me and that if he wanted to go out with his friend he should’ve just said so and I wouldn’t have had a problem with it. He told me he didn’t lie to me and that it really didn’t even occur to him to ask her why if she had money for dinner not just for her but for him, she hadn’t Ubered home instead of asking him for a ride. I kept bringing up how weird the whole thing was and how it didn’t make any sense to me and he swore to his dead grandmother he wasn’t lying to me and apologized because he said he understands how bad it looks and how it made me feel that he was lying to me but he would never hurt me like that. 

Now, I don’t even know what to do, what to say or how to move on from what I don’t even know for sure if it was a lie or not. 
 
Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated, thank you. 


TLDR: (26F) My (23M)boyfriend told me a friend (22F) had asked him for a ride to her house because she didn’t have money to Uber home but ended up inviting him for dinner, he swears he isn’t lying about the whole situation but I’m not sure what to believe.",23Apr2019,1

So I’ve worked at my previous job for the last 2 and a half years and just recently got fired from it for snapping at a coworker who’s been pissing me off for the last year or so, and it was just a warehouse job which obviously isn’t my passion. 
     I have a strong passion for music, and tbh it’s the only thing in this world that keeps me going besides my family. I’ve always been a talented musician throughout middle and high school, received numerous awards, and have been a part of many talented ensembles throughout the last few years. 
     I’m 20 now, so I’ve had the last couple years to start figuring out what I want to do with my life, and music is exactly that. As much as I LOVE performing, it’s not something that I could sustain as a career. This is where the problem lies.
     My dream is to make music for video games/movies/tv, since I’ve always had an incredible ear for music, and I have perfect pitch which makes it that much easier to do and enjoy my work at the same time. The problem is that I live in Wisconsin out in the middle of nowhere, and it’s basically impossible to find job opportunities/clients to work for. 
     I’ve spent 100s of hours looking for ANYTHING to do for someone, but have never gotten any opportunities to do so. Having no previous experience is what’s killing me. How is anyone supposed to trust anything I say if I don’t even have previous work to show them? I would like to at least be somewhere that’s more suited for my field of work such as the west coast, but money is my main concern. If I don’t find a sustainable source of income to live off of, I’m just back to square one, and I refuse to accept that. 
     The thing about freelance work is that you’re always competing against someone else for your job which doesn’t make anything easier. And none of the jobs you do get are permanent, which really sucks. 
     All I know is that I can’t continue to live like this. I don’t have a job at the moment but when I did, I just dragged myself into work every day, and was always getting pissed off at the dumbest things. I’ve been dealing with anxiety/depression for a long time, but it’s gotten to the point where it’s affecting my mindset and how I work. I’ve been on numerous medications and nothing seems to help at all. How am I supposed to go to work and enjoy a job that I’m not passionate about? It’s to the point where it just ticks me off thinking about it. 
     If there are any freelancers that read this, or anyone in general who’s take the time to read this, I’d love to hear any advice you might have for me. I’m at my wits end and need any advice I can get. Thank you",23Apr2019,0

291,"I’m getting married at the end of this year. It has been a long engagement. 
After I got engaged I asked an old friend to be a bridesmaid. I was excited and didn’t really consider everything before asking. 

I’ve known her for 20 years, which is the main reason for me asking her. We used to be very close but not anymore. I rarely see her and when I do, we have nothing in common. For example, we both have a young child but she is more interested in going out drinking and hooking up with different guys, while I’m entirely focused on my family life. 

The last time I saw her, it was awkward. She is stuck in the “glory days” of high school and that’s all we have to talk about now. For most of the afternoon she sat on my couch texting other people while I kept her child entertained. 
For lunch options (which I paid for as always) her only input was “somewhere with a bar” and then she asked to take alcohol from my fridge home with her. 

Wedding wise, I know that she can’t afford to stay at our venue and I don’t want to pay her way anymore as I have done for the last 10 years (she’s never bought so much as a cup of coffee in the entire time I’ve known her). 

I told her when I was going wedding dress shopping and she responded with “ok” and changed the subject. She was more interested in her dress. That was the last I heard from her. 

Now almost 3 months after I’ve bought my dress (which she wasn’t there for) she’s started messaging me again. With photos from high school and how she wishes she could go back. 

I’ve already decided that she will not be a part of my wedding due to all these issues. I just don’t know how to tell her. It’s come to the point where I know that after this we will probably not be friends anymore... and I’m ok with that.

It was pretty obvious that I liked her but she wasn't feeling the same way, so she let me know that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with me. I wasn't expecting her to get with me so that wasn't really surprising and we decided it's ok to be friends. 

After talking for 2 more days, she changed her mind and said she wanted to date me. I told her to think a bit more about it because I didn't want her to change her mind while we're already dating. We ended up becoming a thing, and things were going pretty good for 2 days, we talked about a lot of really personal stuff and went on a semi-date. She told me she liked getting attention, and I was fine with giving her attention. During these 2 days I said ""I love you"" around 5 times, which I thought she liked, because that's what I expected a relationship to be like, especially because she wanted attention. 

Well, I was wrong about that. She did not enjoy it. On the 3rd day she said she thought the relationship was going too quick, and while I believe me saying I loved her could've caused this, I also feel like if she really wanted us to be a thing she would love me back. Because of this, I told her to decide between breaking up and staying in a relationship, since our relationship was stressing her and I really felt like she didn't really like me the way people who are in a relationship like each other. 

We ended up breaking up, agreeing to stay as friends (which probably won't happen ngl), and while this really makes me sad, I'm not sure if this whole thing was my fault. Is saying ""I love you"" too much initially? Was this something that I messed up or was she uninterested from the start? Was it a good idea to start dating 2 days after she told me she didn't want us to be a thing?

I want to learn from my mistake and I would really appreciate some outside perspectives.

TLDR: Girl I was dating thought it was too soon for me to say ""I love you"" even though we were a thing, which caused us to break up. Is saying ""I love you"" too much initially or is it an ok thing to say when in a relationship?",23Apr2019,1

You  see, we've , *or more specifically I've* grown up doing only activities  that had guaranteed results. I study, I'd pass with flying colors. I  passed tenth grade , then i took science in eleventh. I took coaching classes , then i  came to a good college.   
There is uncertainty then too, sure, but within certain parameters. The results were more or less guaranteed.   
And  now...... not so much. theirs no right or wrong way to do anything.  My mums not there anymore to push and encourage me (honestly phone calls aren't the same). There's no one to tell me  when and where and how.   
Literally now, all decisions are in my hands.  And i get to decide what i want. And I have to yell at myself, keep  myself in line. Manage my own time. Hug myself when I cry, and comfort  myself.

What do i keep my faith in?  
I  just want to be able to talk to a real adult about this.  Ask someone,  where do i begin to be responsible for myself? How do I know what  benchmarks I should set for myself? What should be acceptable to me? What amount of work? What grades?  Because I'm slowly learning, perhaps  it is impossible for me to do somethings.

Daily I find myself reading a fair number of articles both nationally and internationally, and while I do enjoy this and in the very short term finding myself thinking about the things that I've read, only a few hours later the specifics have been forgotten and let's say a day after only a headline, a name or some general idea of what the article was about is present - if so at all. For me it's news but I remember having the same problem in the past reading non-fictional litterature. Have you got any good idea on what I could try and do different?

297,"I have a difficult relationship with my mom. I want to be there for her, to love and support her as her son, but our dynamic isn't very open or supportive.

She's depressed because of her divorce (parents together 22 years, split 18 months ago), but she is closed to talking about it, and our relationship sometimes feels toxic.

I think mistrust is really at the core of it. She locks the garage, the garage door, her office, her room, and keeps all her valuables in a gun safe.

She feels like my father controlled and diminished her, and shattered her confidence. Elements of that might be true, but from my perspective he shared the load. Worked 9-5, family doctor, cooked breakfast, dropped me off at school, often cooked dinner, supported her hobbies. She says he's a great father and they can still talk, but he broke her trust (minor infidelity) and she can never trust again.

When I bring my perspective and try to show her she can be more trusting, she defends herself and says I can't understand, it's different for ""girls"" (I wish she'd call herself a woman). Or she'll cry and say it's too hard to talk about. I want to be there for her, and help her rebuild trust. But it's hard when our relationship sometimes feels one-sided.

She rarely makes an effort to call me. She often won't answer the phone, is too tired to talk, or will call the next day. But I keep reaching out.

When we do talk (1-2 times a week, 20-60 minutes) she always hints that I should call her more, that it means a lot when I do, and I think I should put more effort there. 5 minute daily conversations could probably go a long way.

But that's where I fail. I don't call her every day. Partly because I am busy. Partly because I have a sense of not wanting to. I feel like an asshole for saying that.

She was a helicopter parent growing up, still is in many ways, and I constantly have to remind her that I'm an individual now. But I still hold on to that. I get frustrated with her nitpicking and misunderstanding when maybe I shouldn't.

I get little from our conversations other than knowing I made her day a little better. I would like to talk about my career, politics, science, and relationships, but she doesn't follow the news, or science, and is lost when I talk about my career in SaaS marketing. We can comment on relationship advice, but her advice is to ""make a girl feel pursued"", not about building a lasting emotional bond. If I bring up lonliness, I hear her voice get heavy. If I bring up moving to a new company (horrible politics) she worries that I can't find something better. She wants to talk about her night out, the divorce settlement, and her terrible bosses, so we do. But I'm bored.

Again I feel like an asshole for saying that. I want to find more ways to connect and open her up that are comfortable for her and aren't selfish of me.",23Apr2019,1

302,"I need a therapist because I have too much emotional baggage this whole year. The few months I've been with this little turd has been nothing but a kick in the balls.  


I have a little brother that's spoiled rotten and I'm wondering what should I do in this situation?  
 It literally came to a point where he just flat out broke my laptop and he didn't even apologize for breaking it. As a matter of fact, he was laughing ""I got what I wanted"".  


I was so close to kicking that bastard down the stairs.. What kind of sadistic bullshit was that?!!  


WHO SAYS THAT?!!!!  


That is a high premium ticket asking for death in my books.   


I even told that little shit I just wanted to be left alone after he swiped my phone when his father toke his phone as punishment. He lied that it was his phone and then he said he was trying to call his dad and throughout the whole night he lied the whole time.  


I eventually had to snatch the phone from him and he got mad but I didnt care.  


Luckly I went to a class in i.t so I quickly found whats wrong with the laptop because the screen was broken so I simply plugged it into an external monitor and it still works. I still need it repaired by samsung anyways..... and thats going to take a while.  


It was at this point, I officially cut conversations short and yet he still has the gall to speak to me.  


His father told him to not bring friends in the house and he of course brings friends to the house everyday.  


Today we installed security cameras for intruders and for people that might enter the house because we already have cameras on the external part of the house and he threw them in the garbage or at least thats what hes said. (I dont really believe that but they're nowhere to be found)   


Our family is rather alien to children with attitude and behavior problems so hes easily the worst family member worse than my mother.  


The best I could do in this situation is try to find a place for myself and pray hes out of sight and out of mind as I currently live with my uncles at the moment with my father.  


I'm in a jiffy as well. My car is broken and I'm unemployed right now.  


My uncle left on a long vacation and his divorced wife still comes to his house for some reason. Shes always on the phone bitching and complaining and acting like the victim.  


This kid is just fairly toxic like his mother. They both lie about petty things, they both like to act like the victim but also want to be tough predators.....  


Yeah... Its one of those people.   


  


I keep hearing from my father ""our family doesn't deal well with depression"" and it clearly shows. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Its the same bullshit weekly.  


  
 I honestly don't like talking about my problems in this manner and I'm seriously depressed. At the time given, I don't really have that much friends but they hardly get in contact with me honestly. Anytime I talk nowadays it feels like i'm talking into a brick wall. Nothing well seems to be happening well this year. I'm not letting that as an excuse for me to feel sorry for myself.  But LORD this year was going by smoothly until we decided to pick up my brother from my mother.  


Now it just feels like goddamn nails hammered on my chest.  
We couldve been out of this situation of living with my uncles AGES AGO but somewhere along the line, my brother screws things up.

&amp;#x200B;

Im depressed so I need advice on either what to do about this moron or how I can cope with my depression.  


Like I could care less if its a person I dont even know but if its a person that you have to be with for the rest of your life, THATS WHERE IT BOTHERS ME.  


The thing is is that the people who treat him like shit are the people who he likes and the people who actually care about him he scraps them off like dog shit.  


Like my father helped him get a private tutor for his flunking grades, let him go to public school (he wanted to go to public school to have some friends) ,let him hang out with his mother (even though they're divorced) , put food on his damn table, toke him out to the movies (We recently saw hell boy) gave him the best clothes and YET he still wants to dress up like what he sees on the internet which is dressing up like hood rats and gang members.  


  
This makes no fucking sense in my mind.

305,"Hello, it’s my first post ever so please be kind with my writing.

As an explanation for all the story, I (F) study in Switzerland, my boyfriend in Sweden (for a year) and my best friend in France.

Yesterday, my best friend (F) told me she met a girl, implying telling me she was probably gay. I was really happy for her as she seemed happy. 

As I was so happy, I told my boyfriend (he doesn’t know her, they live in different countries). He told me that I shouldn’t have told him, that it was a secret... I understood but because he is so close to me, and doesn’t know her, I knew it wouldn’t be a problem, I just wanted to share my happiness for my best friend.

We argued a lot for the fact that I shouldn’t have told him. And then by text, he just sent me “I think I am probably bi, now you know”.

I thought he was joking with me at first (he always love to make fun of the fact I’m very naïve), I called him, to know if he was serious. He was. I had the worst possible reaction, I was crying, didn’t know what to think of the man I thought knowing so well, that he lied to me all this time. Then he told me he had a secret boyfriend in high school for several month (he is now 24). I was feeling so so so bad. I felt I didn’t know him anymore, that he could have lied about so much things to me, did he lied telling me he loved me? I was completely lost.

He was crying, I never saw him cry, ever. I can’t believe I made him cry, I feel so bad. I don’t want to hurt him.

So the advice I need is, I love him, more than I imagine I could, but I don’t now what to think of the fact that he is bi, and that he lied to me all this time.

As I get older, I see parts of you two in myself and I appreciate yalls role in developing who I am. Sorry for when I pushed y’all away. Y’all are awesome parents!

Him: That was the sweetest message! I'm glad you think we had a positive influence on you. Honestly Mrs. G has had a positive influence on me too. I love how she's always in a good mood, always excited to do anything. She lives in the moment. Whatever she's doing right now, she gives it her best and makes it fun. I have enjoyed watching you grow up and mature. Even though we dont talk very often, I can tell that you have been working on yourself, that you more comfortable with yourself.

Me: Y’all definitely deserve that appreciation and more! 

I was afraid of being nice to y’all and Adam after everything because I thought it would make things hurt even more. now it feels better to thank y’all for everything. I constantly am reminded of y’all in the way I think and act and the things I enjoy. I also love Mrs. G’s positive attitude and when I’m being my best self I see part of Her in me. Always down for an adventure, excited for the possibilities the future holds, and always seeing the positive side of anything that happens, good or bad. 

I know we don’t talk often. it’s because I wanted to protect myself so I wouldn’t feel hurt. 

Him: I’ve always been proud of you and have always loved you. I understand sometimes you have to burn a bridge in order to force yourself to find another bridge. I get that. But I've learned over the years that you don't need to burn  bridges. Yeah, there are a few people that if I saw them at the grocery store before they saw me, I'd turn around. But it's better if I can just be nice and respectful to everyone. I try not to judge anyone... I don't know what they're going through.

Me: I didn’t mean to burn a bridge. It was my first breakup so I had no idea how to act.

Adam has been nice and understanding despite the mean things I said and did and I recently thanked him for that. I realize what I saw in him when we dated and how he still is that person despite what we have been through. his chill calmed the negative parts of my feisty/fiery/passionate side but allowed me to express it in a positive way. He told me he does appreciate someone who is emotional where he valued logic more in the past. he’s been very nice to me despite what has transpired. 

We talked for hours a few months ago till 5 am and after his birthday we talked for two hours. I am grateful he has been nice to me and we have gotten along well and we plan on talking again sometime soon-ish.

314,"Okay so, kind of long story ahead so buckle up. English isnt my first language so if I make any grammar mistakes please try to forgive me.

I'm a freshman in college, never had a girlfriend, mainly because I wasn't looking for one. My parents taught me that I should only get into a relationship with a girl if I'm in love with her, and I think of her as my future wife, otherwise I'm just wasting my, and her time as well, and might do something I'll regret later.

When I started my first college year in last september, I met a girl. She was absolutely gorgeous, the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I'm a huge HIMYM fan, so if you remember the scene where Ted first sees Robin, thats what happened with me. I was completely frozen, my brain shut down, and immediately I fell in love. From that moment forward, I had to try hard not to stare at her all day, but I failed miserably multiple times. Thats when I noticed, that she was watching me too, and when we shared a look, she didn't turn away, but started smiling. We did this for like 2 months. In the meantime we  started talking a little before our classes, like 10 minutes tops each time, and she mentioned that she has a boyfriend for 1,5 years. That kind of crushed me, but hope returned after she asked If I was going to the party my university organised. I said sure, and we decided to meet up there. There we ordered some drinks, and talked for like 2-3 hours straight. I found out that we are on the same page on everything (literally every topic, and we touched quite a few). She loves children, and is an active girlscout working with younger scouts in the summer. I also work with younger kids in the summer in a fantasy roleplay camp (long story, dont ask lol). I asked her if she was watching any series lately, and I said to myself ""if she says HIMYM im marrying her"". And she actually did. On top of all this, our classmates asked both of us when we were going to get together, because it was so obvious that we liked each other. So you can see how perfect this girl seemed to me.

Then, in december, she decided that our major wasnt  for her, so she quit university. Since then, I invited her to a few places, but she never was able to come, sometimes because of me, and sometimes because she had something else. We havent spoken since january, but I just can't seem to be able to forget her. I'm thinking about her all the time, she basically ruined other girls for me. I've been on a few dates since then, and I always felt like ""thats not the person who should be sitting there"". I cant help but feel like there is something unfinished between us. Call me a hopeless romantic, but I feel like I will explode if I don't tell her how I feel.

What do you guys think? Would it be weird to text her after more than 3 months, and invite her to a coffee to ""talk about something""? Should I do it? Or should I just ignore my feelings, and try to forget her? Remember, she has a boyfriend for 2 years now, thats the main reason I'm hesitating to do anything. I'm not the stealyourgirl kind of guy, and I dont intend to start being one, but I want to tell her, even if we dont end up getting together, at least it wouldnt be on my chest anymore.

I love life, but not my life. I’ve been such a failure and I probably shouldn’t go into detail because I’m a sensitive soul and don’t want to be berated. I just feel so sad. My family doesn’t want me around, my friends have all grown up and have lives of their own and I never really did anything with my life.

Every time I had someone in my life it always seemed like I was giving so much and whenever I needed anything no one was there. And after bad relationships I became a shut in because I was over it all. Years went by. And now I’m living in a shell. Not literally. It would be too cold. But mentally. I have no one I can trust. No one I feel like I can call a friend. No one I can really talk to. 

I’m the black sheep in my family. They are all close and even when I try to include myself I’m often forgotten or excluded (this goes deep but it would make too long of a post) and honestly I shouldn’t care because I shouldn’t be around them at this point in my life. I should be far from all of them and living my own life. Staring a family of my own. I don’t need them and they don’t need me. But here I am. 

Anyway. Im just lost. I’m tired of feeling like I don’t matter and like I’m so insignificant. And lately when I think I can change it all by moving far from my family and carving my own life without them I just feel like I will fail. And when I fail at that point I’ll be truly alone.

I don’t know what to do. I’m not suicidal but I’m so overwhelmed. Every day there are little moments that crush me. It sounds so dramatic and maybe it is. But I’m so hurt and it’s all my fault. I chose to let my life crumble and I never bothered to pick myself up. I let myself become nothing. If I died, I’m sure the only person who would truly be hurt by it is my mom.

318,"Hi Reddit,

Just a disclaimer that I'm on my phone so I apologize for the awkward formatting.

As the title reads, I'm considering dropping out of school (college, to be specific). I've attempted to hold out until graduation (which is in 2020) but I really can't stand attending the lectures anymore; I struggle to keep up in class and everyday I force myself out of the house (heck, even out of the bed). My anxiety is at its worst lately at the thought of going to school (and how others will perceive me for dropping out); I got help and even attended social anxiety therapy groups but I just recently finished my visits to therapy and did well for a while, but now I fear going out even.
I'm studying 3D &amp; Animation, by the way.

(This may sound like an excuse but) I have ADHD and therefore I struggle to start or even complete many tasks, at the start I was really eager to make animations but even then I had second thoughts about whether or not I would work within the 3D/Animation industry. 
A personality trait of mine is to, when I first become introduced to something I enjoy, to work or research obsessively over it but then quickly lose interest in a couple months - I feel like that's the situation with 3D&amp;A; I would love to make my own series one day but even so I know I cannot be the one sitting behind the desk animating or rigging it.

Only reason I'm holding out (but I seriously cannot anymore) is because I don't want to disappoint the people closest to me, since I promised I would complete what I had started but also because if I graduate successfully then 40% of my student loan becomes scholarship money which I won't have to pay back.

I have no plans for what I would consider doing if I do actually drop out of school, probably get a normal 9-5 desk job. But I have always wanted to write (as silly as that may sound considering my awful grammar and how I suck at completing tasks) but everything I do is either half-assed or...I simply give up before even starting.

Any help would be appreciated. If you went through the same, would you kindly tell me how things worked out for you? I stated that I'm ""considering"" dropping out but I'm really close to actually doing so (if I can just find the office and even so I don't know what to tell them lol, ""hi I wanna drop out""?) Who should I talk to at the school and what should I tell them?

321,"Long story short I met a girl at a party, we hit it off and were talking a lot of the night. I got her snap and we text on and off all day but it can be scarce. I don’t know if the flirting was because of the party atmosphere or actual interest.

322,"Backstory: partner (25M) and I have been smoking every day pretty much for 6 years (self medicating for depression/anxiety) we are now both quitting due to financial and mental reasons.

So, I've come to the conclusion with my partners help that I have a big anger problem.

Always happens when he tries to get in the way of me smoking my end of day joint. Say we had a small fight he would hide the weed until I do as he says or until I 'learn a lesson' he wants me to learn.

I tend to lose my shit and yell and freak out when he does this, in my eyes hes trying to control me, I've had a very rough childhood and I know it's no excuse but I think it all stems from that.

I never get that angry unless it's about weed, and I'm hoping it won't happen again seeing as we are quitting.
Since weve quit I've been very antsy, very on edge and very highly strung.

I dont want to snap and yell at every small thing so I would love some tips on how to calm tf down when I can tell I'm getting wound up. 

Sorry if this is a bit ranty, I think I woke up in a sour mood today!",23Apr2019,2
323,"I’m gonna be honest, I’m lost when I comes to relationships, but I, personally find it weird if she’s letting him do this.

Anyway, my girlfriend was on her phone and this dude who always likes her pictures and comments on them, changed her name to “my girl”, and she never said anything about it.

Even if I don’t have anything to worry about, isn’t it a little messed up that she seems accepting of other men who aren’t her boyfriend call her, “my girl”?

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.",23Apr2019,1

325,"Hello, as the title says I have unfortunately lied myself into a corner and I am not proud about. Heres the story. A while back I did some work for my friends father who gave me a .357 handgun in return, I was originally going to give him $200 for the gun, but instead gave me a really cool Taurus .357 in a beautiful gun metal gray for helping him move stuff and doing a dump run. Well due to state laws at the time and currently I guess, I was 18 and you couldn’t legally open carry or travel with a handgun until you are 21 let alone even buy handgun ammo (You can open carry with parents permission). I showed my good friend who was also my co worker at the time the .357 and he offered to trade me a very nice old single shot break open 12 gauge that I could legally own, transport, and buy ammo for. I agreed to the trade, and he got the gun transferred to his name. My friend who is also the son of the man who gave me the .357 has since  returned from UTI and has asked multiple times where the “Tree fifty seven” was and my first reaction was to tell him it was in my grandpas safe at the ranch because my mom said she did not want any firearms in the house which at the time was true, my mom did not want any guns in the house. The shotgun was at the ranch. This has gone over for over a year with me telling him the gun is at the ranch. His dad has asked me and I lied to his face telling him it was at the ranch.  Made me feel really guilty and shameful because he is the one who gave it to me. I am going to ranch Sunday to give the calfs shots and brand them, and I thought it would really cool to take my friend for the day so we can go hunting and fishing while there. I have 6 days to tell my friend that I traded the .357 and I do not know how because it makes me fill with guilt. At the same time it was my gun and I (somewhat legally owned it not really?) could do what I wish with it. I feel like if I tell him he will be pissed off and blow off a really cool experience working on a cattle ranch first hand and actually have the freedom to good shooting where ever you please out there and just have fun riding quads. How would you go about telling your friend something like this? Am I overthinking it or did I fuck myself",23Apr2019,1

328,"So first and foremost I want to apologise because the things I say in this are going to seem very conflicting. I was in love with my recent partner but I'm not absolutely sure how much of it was love, how much was lust, or how much was just made up. 

I dated this girl for 10 months let's call her P. P was a new kind of relationship for me. She was very social, friend oriented, and was the Instagram posting for every single thing type. I myself am very much of an introvert and a homebody. When I go out I go travel and see things, not really do the go out to bar and parties type. It was very opposites attract kind of deal.

For a long time, I thought things were fine. It was hard because she had dropped out of college due to too much partying and she worked long hours and between the two of us we struggled but made it work with bills,rent, and seeing one another. We had our issues like any couple and neither of us were perfect. 

The only decisive split in our relationship was over her parents. Her parents were incredibly southern Baptist but underneath it all was the exact opposite of a religious family. Her father was an abusive alcoholic and her mother was a hyper controlling helicopter parent. despite this they put up a front to others to make them seem as if they were the perfect family. On top of this if any of her four children did not bow to her whims they would be on the barrell end of constant insult and verbal abuse. I supported my partner and told her that if she didn't want to see her folks she didn't have to and I voiced how this was wrong of her mother to treat her this way. 

Now up until the day before our breakup things were fine. She had mentioned she was speaking to her mother and planned on moving home due to the hardship of living on a waitress salary. I told her that I loved her and despite how I felt I supported her. Hell I only thought it was going to be just for a few months. I am graduating in May and plan on having a job in the Atlanta area which is a few states away so I didn't think much of it. 

Then comes the next day and out of the blue she tells me she's moved back home and never loved me and doesn't love herself and she can't move away. I was heartbroken to say the least and I started checking myself into therapy to help strive on to finish my degree. Then that's where things have started to unfurl and after going over everything I realized how fucked up of a relationship I was actually in.

First things first is that she was verbally abusive. She made fun of me for liking video games, shows, science, and all the other things that made me well me. She played it off and said if she didn't pick on you that means she didn't like you. She would consistently abandon me or flake on hanging out to go see her friends. She always told me that there will always be more time because we were moving together to Atlanta. She was always so secretive with her phone and when I asked who she was talking to she would be defensive and angry. Hell when she figured out I had money I started paying for food and half of the rent with only staying there two to three nights a week and that was the max I was allowed. I constantly bought gifts, took her places, and fixed any minor inconvenience like her car troubles, extra housing fees, low food, medicine and everything in between. I realized this person was fucking horrible to me and I thought this was absolutely what a healthy relationship was. I see now why I was so tired and depressed and stressed and it was over her.

With that said I have been working diligently to overcome this and continue to strive to finish my computer science degree and get a good job and I thought it was all but good until tonight. Tonight I saw her driving her shitty Beatle for only a split moment and all of this miss and want came rushing into me like a river and I don't know why. Hell the thought of her invades my dreams and I can't make it stop. It's like the rational person that is me KNOWS this was not a healthy relationship but my brain keeps telling me to pine for her and it scares me. When I was with her I was so unhappy and it was such a bad relationship. Yet despite this all these feelings of ache and want keep rushing back and I can't stand it.

I feel like my relationship with her was very much like her Instagram obsession. It was so pretty to the outside and hell even to me until you dig real deep and you see the inner person and it's not what it seems. It just hurts so bad and I don't know how to overcome it. I just want to run away or make my own head stop telling me this was a healthy happy relationship because it absolutely wasn't. 

If anybody has any experience with this or relatable advice on how to stop these thoughts or how to avoid this type of relationship I'd love to know. Sorry it's such a long post but thank you for reading.",23Apr2019,1

Hey guys,  
Not sure if anyone will be able to help me. Currently enrolled in the UCWE for the may start. looking to get into maybe the August intake if I'm lucky enough.

The only thing I'm worried about is the declarable associates. My brother has an assault charge and smokes marijuana recreationally, my other brother is doing a 2.12 year sentence for drug possession and supply and my first cousin is in prison on a 5 year sentence for possession (completely not related to my brother's charges).

The thing is these peoples choices are most likely going to hinder my chances I assume, but I'm going to try anyway.

I personally have no criminal charges, just 2 traffic offenses from 5 and 3 years ago. I do live at home with the brother with the assault charge, if I could move out I would but on a casual coles wage, I cant. I'm just hoping I get given a chance.

Hopefully, if I get a chance I can explain during an interview that while in Goulburn I won't be coming home on the weekends and ill be staying with my partner, I will hopefully be able to say that I'm more than happy to not put any preferences down for a station and I will happily go country or rural, wherever I am needed.

I would just like to hear from someone who has been int he same position or knows someone that has been through this just to help me out.

Thanks!",23Apr2019,1
332,"On a throwaway account because people I know are aware of my other account. 

So this morning I woke up, got ready for work and found myself questioning ""why am I even bothering?"" And the thought of going into work today just filled me with dread. 
I ended up calling in sick. I'm not suffering from depression or anything, just found myself questioning the point of it all. 

I worked full-time for years straight out of school. I have recently graduated from university as a mature student and got a job in the field I wanted to go into. I thought I'd be happy in this job but I'm not enjoying it at all. I'm being paid a shitty wage to do a meaningless job at a place with a high turnover of staff. You're just another number there.

One of the things I'm really struggling to buy into is the idea that we should just work for most of our days in the hopes we can do what? Buy a nice house? A new car? Spend 4 weeks a year having holidays? 

I know some people will just take this post as me being lazy or entitled and I'm really not either. I worked full-time hours alongside studying my degree at university and I don't feel like I'm owed anything by the world at all. 

I guess I'm just struggling today with the concept of throwing away your best years for possessions that really don't mean a great deal. 

Does anyone else get this? 
Have you found a way around dealing with it? 

I'm considering looking into either working for myself or finding a job that has a bit more flexibility and freedom as I feel like I would be much happier in both these situations as opposed to working 9-5 in an office, Monday to Friday.",23Apr2019,1

My parents are poor. Father is sugar farmer. We live in rattan huts, grounded. And we slept on a bed made of rattan too. Cooking using a furnace.

Before I entered elementary school, my mother went to Singapore to work as a maid. My father continued to work as a sugar farmer, and service workers in the fields. 2 Years Finally my mother came home and bought the house of my fater's brother. so it was more comfortable because it has terraced, then my mother became pregnant.

But since I started my teens, my father has changed greatly. He no longer wants to work as a sugar farmer or a service that makes his hands dirty from the ground..

The more days the money was thinning, finally my mother took to the fields, offering services as a farmer. And, I take care my little sister. The Days change to Year after year, my mother does whatever work can produce money, washing services, farming services, cooking services, cleaning services, sell vegetables that she has bought in traditional markets. Whatever her hands are dirty. Most important is that children can eat and school well.

336,"Let me tell you a quick backstory, just so you know details about my question. 

Like four months ago I was in a terrible mental state. I ended up hospital, got diagnosed with anxiety and depressive disorder with many other things, bla bla bla. Even before that, I had a friend. Best friend, to be exact. While we were friends, she was basically bullying me. I started hating myself and her ego was growing by insulting me. I broke it off, lost my other friend too, was in hospital and all that jazz.

After coming back to school from hospital I was lonely as heck. No one even wanted to give me homework, because my classmates really hate me for some reason. And once, my old best friend and old bully came up to me and asked me if I needed anything. She said she could give me her notebooks and stuff and help me with some school stuff that I missed out on.

We became friends again also with the other friend that I had, and we were our iconic trio again. 

The thing is, I just can't call them my friend after what happened. I know it sounds weird, but I just can't. I like to call them 'people that talk to me'. Also, I don't think they want to be my friends either.

My ex-bully and the other friend are constantly going to their other friends from other class every between-class break. They don't go home with me, nor to school. They barely talk to me or text me. And when they do, it just feels awkward. I invited my ex-bully over and she keeps avoiding me, saying she has to go there and there.

I'm not saying I don't believe her, but I wouldn't be surprised if she was lying.

My question is: how do I find friends that actually want to be friends with me? no one in my school likes me and if so, they're not showing it. my classmates hate me. I really wish I had actual friends. It sucks being replaced. I'm not jealous, just hurt.",23Apr2019,1
337,"I usually run at night, on this walkway which sometimes has a lot of people walking through it. Occasionally when I run on the walkway, a group of drunk people may get in my way to make me stop running(?), or they may start running next to me for whatever reason.

I wasn’t quite sure what to do so I just said “stop”. The kid did get out of the way, but then he said “shutup”, and tried to spit on my shoes. They didn’t seem to be with their parents or guardians.

I’m wondering if maybe I handled the situation with the child wrong. Possibly the kid misheard me and thought that I said “shutup”? I’m not really sure why they said that.

Last time she texted me she said the song ""on a beach in hawaii"" reminded her of me. I used to play it a lot.

Anyways, it took me like 7 months to get over it lol. Randomly today she texted me happy birthday out of the blue. My actual birthday was 6 days after my b/day lol.

After a couple of great weeks speaking the replies got dead and instead of being instant she took hours. I told her how I felt about her and she said it was too soon after her past relationship and wanted to speak as friends and see if anything came from that. Being absolutely heartbroken at this I decided to try and move on as I didn’t want to be caught up on her no matter how it hurt. A few weeks later after ignoring her at school and not messaging her she sends me a Snapchat out of the blue. She changed her look and snapped me trying to make a joke and talk. As I was trying to get over her I blanked it. A couple of days later me and my mates are going on a night out and went to the pub before we usual. She was there and was going to the same club. In the pub she playfully hit me and we just spoke about nothing interesting. At the club the whole night her best mate kept trying to get us together. Then at some point her and I spend a bit of time alone. We started speaking about what happened with us stopping talking. She told me she was upset that I couldn’t even look at her or Snapchat her for a while. She also told me that she wanted to carry on speaking and that I must have got the wrong message about speaking as friends. Anyway I said sorry and said I’ll give it another go. Then we got off with each other and went home. Now this is where it gets really confusing for me. The next day I Snapchat her and we speak for a bit. The next 2 days after she’s gone back to blanking me and giving dead replies. I even asked her to go out somewhere but she said she couldn’t but still went to the same place with her mate that day. Now at this point I don’t know what to do. I’ve decided to just ignore her because I don’t want to keep chasing someone that doesn’t like me as much as I like them. It sucks because it hurts knowing that she probably doesn’t feel the same way and I can’t be with her. I love her personality and thinks she’s beautiful. But the emotional stress and heartache makes me question if love is even worth it. I just want to hold and love her but I think I’m getting mixed messages and she doesn’t really like me.

My friend said that I should try to get with him since he was my type, and at the time I was casually dating. I played it off saying he wasn't my type and that I wasn't interested. Now, fast forward to about a month ago when I somehow ended up in a game of truth or dare with a bunch of guys that I didn't know. The skateboard boy was playing. We all ended up having a really great time, and then at the end, my friend asked for all of their snapchats.

348,"I've liked this guy, let's say his name is Jim, for 3+ months already. I'm not really sure if he's gay, bi, or what not but he gives me vibes that he at least is bi. We met through a class we both have together. I'm not that close with him but I would say we're friends as of right now. I don't know about these signals I'm getting. I need help.

I may be the only one seeing this but Jim always sits next to his guy friend (let's call him Matt and he seems pretty feminine as well) in class. Over time, I realized that he would always mess around with Matt whenever I start talking to Jim always telling me Matt is stupid and what not as a friend thing? Is this normal to make fun of your friends all the time in front of others? They definitely act differently around me I'm pretty sure. Before I introduced myself or became good friends, they would have their sassy tone sometimes but even more amplified when they knew who I was.

What made me question this even more was this one day where we had a test in our class and had about an hour left to study. Jim saw me in the library and told Matt, ""Hey, it's Chris!"" Even though he's never been that happy to see me, I noticed his tone change from being lethargic to energetic. During that hour, Jim would only test me about the answers and would just chuckle a bit if I didn't know. He could just be friendly but he even also offered some advice and such that I didn't ask for.

I may be overthinking this as well but there is this feeling I always have. You know the feeling when someone looks at you and you think they're not looking at you. (Keep in mind, I don't want to look but whenever I try Jim would already look the other direction.)

The only problem is that the cost of each classes are getting to the point where I cannot afford to pay them off.

353,"For the last two year I have been feeling like my life has been falling apart and its only been getting worse. I use to be a decent student I'm not going to lie I missed assignments and at some times didn't care but its only been getting worst. I think that this stems from me not being happy with my major. I'm a computer science major and I still want to make code but I just can't deal with all the math anymore and my hearts just not in enough to care. I want to change my major to history. I love history and researching so I think I could do it, but I still want to make video games. This has been my dream and goal as long as I could remember, but I just can't stay focused anymore.

As I said I have been feeling this for the last two years. I have been going to school for about four years and am almost done, but this feeling what I'm going to call General Dissatisfaction has really increased when I transverd to a four year about a year ago. I've always been a bit melancholic and have been diagnosed with depression a few time but not matter what I try I just can't stop feeling hollow. Over the last year I have had really bad headache and when I when to the doctors they said it was just migraines but they just won't go away. I can't sleep (I'm writing this at around 3:00 am my time) because I just keep getting in my head thinking about how much of a failure I am and how I should have this life thing at least partly figured out, how I don't know what I want. I just lie away get depressed and scared about my life. I think about dying but I know I'll never go thought with it. I am not proud to say, but I've started cutting my arms. It calms me, but I know that it's not healthy. I can't tell my family because I know that I'll be a pariah. The man who couldn't deal with life. I've gone to a family member about my depression and I had a diagnostics and they said your not depressed. I love my family and I know they love me, but I feel like no one knows me on nothing more than a surface level. This is not their fault as I have always been a quite and closed person.

When I finally fall asleep I wake up just as tired as when I wanted to sleep. I spell anywhere four hours one night, and twelve hours the next day. I know I can't keep going like this but I don't know what to do. The only thing that makes since to me is my dead end retail job it's simple. If I take time to deal with me mental health I lose my dorm room and take time off school life will get in the way and it will take a while to return. I'm 22 and I know I shouldn't be feeling this way. I don't know what to do.

I feel the only thing I can do to fix my issues is to find out who I am and what I want with my life, but I don't know how to. Part of me want to just buy a tent and walk into the wilderness and just separate myself from my life. I have ideas of what I want like write fantasy novels, have a family, make games, etc, but all of these feel so distant.

In short I need help and I need advice on how to fix my life. I'm sorry that is long and a bit jumbled, but I'm compressing years of issues into a few paragraphs.",23Apr2019,1
354,"I am a 19 year old female, over the course of my life I have had 3 sexual partners, all male. One was a long term relationship, the other was something similar to a friend with benefits, and the third was an unwelcome experience. 

I lost my virginity at the age of 17 (age of consent in England is 16, so nothing illegal) and in all that time I have never had an orgasm while sleeping with any one them. 

I’m not shy in the bedroom, so I was never hesitant to suggest new techniques. I know what I like, I know what gets me off when I’m alone, but as soon as there’s someone else there trying to do the same, it just felt wrong. 

The two that I was close with genuinely tried their best, but I never even came close. I even tried masturbating while they were present, but I guess I just have performance anxiety. 

I’m at the point where I just don’t enjoy sex anymore. It’s a lot of effort with little pay off. 

I’d like to mention, the unwelcome experience was the most recent guy, so he isn’t responsible for this. Although it certainly didn’t help.

So it sounds ridiculous but I am just so so so tired when I have to get up for work. I really should be getting up at 5am but recently it’s been so bad I wait until 6 (pushing my time, being later than usual). I’m a medical marijuana patient and recently had to stop smoking for a possible drug test at work. I’m totally okay with doing this other than the fact that I cannot fall asleep. That was the main reason I used, and it’s just irritating because although I’m 100% legal to use it cannot show up in a drug test without termination. The point of this is, no matter how tired I am all day I can’t fall asleep until at least 11:30 pm. 6 hours of sleep is really just not working for me and I don’t know what to do. I tried sleeping pills and I had the worst nightmares I have ever had, and I was so much more drowsy the next day at work. I also tried some cbd gummies but I feel like they didn’t do much.

360,"As the title says, I really wanted to do homeschool. Each person has their own reasons to do homeschool but for me, school is a place where many problems takes place which makes my school life worse and worse everytime. The problem for me most of the time is that I have to deal with pressure all the time and I'm not mentally ready for this much pressure and sometimes it gets to the point where I have tears once I get on bed back at home. It seems like new problems emerges every week and there is always a new problem for me to complain about. I don't think this is healthy for my future educational needs at all and I see that I feel a need to move schools.

However, my parents disagrees with me. I understand that I can't force my opinions on them but I just need my opinion to be heard and I feel like they don't really understand my situation at school. They say that I would not be studying and I would be on my phone for the whole day, they also said that I would be eating for the whole day and they mainly believe that doing homeschool could not be used to go to university which, from what I read online, is false, but I can't prove to them. They haven't seen my dedication to my studies while I'm at school and they only see what I do at home, I could also limit my food to the minimum very easily but again, they don't see that in me. I really hope that I can convince them to get me to homeschool soon.

TL;DR

So...a little background info, I'm 26 and my last girlfriend was when I was a junior in High School. Sure I've met other girls and gone on dates and hooked up since then but few and far between and no real relationships. Resulting in me becoming super lonely and drinking like a fish, I realized this though and haven't drank in 9 months.

I had pretty much given up on ever meeting someone and was thinking ""hey, maybe some people aren't meant to find someone, maybe some people just live and die alone""...until I met a girl recently and things seemed to be going good in the way of actually having someone to be with, a companion. From dinner dates, to going to the gym together, to running errands together, and deep conversations...I thought we were together.

Then last night she plugs in my phone and I say ""thanks babe"" and she begins to give me the talk of we should just be friends...

So I guess its back the loneliness now, just me and my dog.

365,"okay, so my mother was going through the death of her father, and a divorce, and all of these are hitting me at the same time, about 4 years ago. I didn't want to deal with it and that is when my relationship began to break down with my mother. She moved out and lived with a friend. During this period of time me and my mother didnt speak much, she never visted me at home (live with dad), and i never visited her.

So eventually after a year or so of this, she ended up finding a boyfriend. We began to speak a little again, however I soon found out from my sisters that he had been physically abusing her. Nothing crazy, like beating the shit out of her, but slaps and punches here and there. I was fuming. I have never been more pissed of in all of my life. But also this situation made me feel powerless. On one hand she would defend him, if the cops were called she would lie to the cops. She would make excuses for him, such as ""he was just coming down off of meth."" or ""I shouldnt have made him angry."" That kind of bullshit. I feel helpless, even writing this now. I didnt think fighting him would solve anything besides get me a criminal record and get myself thrown in jail. it continued, mostly verbal harassment, granted all of the information i was being given was from my sisters, my mother wouldnt talk to me about it, and i tried to get her to leave him. She would not.

​

Now fast forward a year (present), during that year she had moved out of state with him (his family is wealthy and he never holds down a job due to this), and the abuse continues, however less frequent, but i still hear about him hitting her. i even offered to pay for a flight and a place to stay after once of the incidents but she never took me up on the offer. Since then she has moved back to my state, and he is currently in jail for a year(unrelated charges), but she is still adamant to wait for him and stay with him. During the last year i have rarely spoken to her, I feel hurt that she would let herself be put in this situation. I know that me not speaking with her affects her negatively, but i cant respect her for staying in an abusive relationship. I dont want to victim blame, but I dont know what to do here. If it was anything but abuse i would be able to get over it but i cant have a relationship with her while she shows herself no respect. I feel that our relationship is the only thing i can use against her to make he leave the situation.

Pros:
Getting back to where we were happy
Better living conditions 
Better paying jobs
We’ll be around friends and family that love us 
More opportunities to go back to school 

Cons:
We’re going to have to leave a lot behind

We met on Whisper app and was pretty much hanging out or having sex for around 2 years. It was clear we weren't in a relationship nor do we have feelings for each other as he said (in his words) ""Dont be like me it's been 3+ years and I'm still hung up with my ex"" and I agreed cause I didnt really have much to say.

He was 9 years older than me, and we met when I was 20. He was of a different nationality and english isnt his first language. So everything was great up until he left. In the two years that we were friends, we never really fought about anything. We both dont chat with each other unless it's about direction on when we will meet and we did try to chat after he left the country but I got so busy I dont really want to talk about anything. He is on a different field of work and I currently have 3 jobs (Im a busybody, I like money) and when he asked for favors to do in my country (paperwork etc) I try to offer a hand but the one time we had a fight was when I was talking to him about depression and talking to a therapist, he said I was being ungrateful and unappreciative of what I have and many more other people have less things than I do so what do I have to be sad about. That's when I realized we have absolutely nothing in common besides sexual fetishes and by this time I havent had sex for a year now since he has left and that's cause I wasn't and still am not interested. He messaged me yesterday about how Im going to block him now and that I only talk to him when he is in my country. Which I then replied that I am busy and that we dont have much in common to talk about. I said that Im only being honest as I've always been and he said no, someone must be courting you. No one is and it just annoyed the crap out of me. 


So the question is do I block him or just ignore his messages? I'm really annoyed and frankly it made me like him less as a person.

387,"So as the title states, my boss is like this through and through. Ive been working at my new job which is essentially a care taker in a school for around 3 months now. The job itself isn't difficult, a lot of it is very basic stuff like cleaning, replenishing bathroom supplies, locking the building up at the end of the night etc. Don't get me wrong I LOVE the job, its given me the escape from my background in retail/customer service I've been looking for for years, my boss however I don't have much love for. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I first started the job I was chirpy as hell, went to the interview wearing my best suit, was extra friendly to my boss and the head teacher who interviewed me and this all won me the job. I was super pumped to finally be in full time, consistently paying work and was eager to get started. My boss came across as stern but fair when I first started, he was even friendly to an extent but as I slowly began getting into the job the mask slowly started falling off. To give you an example of his toxicity, I clearly stated on my CV and application when I applied that my experience is mainly in retail with some relevant points to the job e.g cleaning, he said to me ""I'm not expecting you to perform wonders when you first start, we all have to learn somewhere."" I 100 % agree with that statement as I'm sure most of you would, trouble is he didn't put that into practise. At times he would hand me tools I had no idea how to use and expect me to know exactly how to use them or what to do with them from the second they land in my hands. Then he would proceed to get obscenely pissed off at me because of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

He threatened my job after one major mistake, it didn't put anyone in danger or break anything, it was stupid granted but I learned from it. Sure I would understand a sit down with him to discuss the mistake and what to do so I don't make it again but to threaten my job over one mistake seems a bit extreme to me. Also he was apparently calling me some pretty colourful names behind my back which is totally unprofessional and just shows me he's a pretty bad manager. Another thing he does is CONSTANTLY ring me when I'm not in work, not to ask me to come in early or whatever, but to berate me for any little thing he can find. I mean he will slam me for the most minimal thing he can possibly find, like for instance he slammed me because when I was doing some hoovering in another area of the school I locked the hoover in our lockup we have in that area instead of the other. Keep in mind it doesn't make a blind bit of difference which lockup its in, its locked up and safe regardless. 

&amp;#x200B;

He could have just asked me where the hoover was, but instead he went through the trouble of creating a WhatsApp group just to berate me over this minor ""inconvenience"" . Its gotten to the point where I get anxious just hearing my phone go off when I'm not in work for any reason whatsoever, like I will near enough suffer a small panic attack and then it instantly goes away when I realise its not him calling or texting me. To sort of wrap this post up, the kids were on easter break for the last two weeks(they're back today) and our inspectors are coming in some time this week, this meant me and my colleague had to work our butts off to make the place absolutely spotless for them as my boss went on holiday for those two weeks. Now I didn't get time to do everything on my list, there just wasn't enough time and I know he'll slam me for that. How would you guys best confront him if he does get obscenely angry over this? 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate to admit that I've been very timid round him, I've let him bully me and I think he feels like he can get away with it so I think its time to professionally knock him down a peg or two because I know the only way to deal with these people is confront them. Trouble is I'll plan it out professionally then I'll end up just exploding from pent up stress and biting my tongue for too long. How would you guys do it?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; My extremely toxic boss slams me at every opportunity, never says thank you if you go out of your way to something he never asked you to do, seems to go out of his way to make my life a misery. Wondering how best to deal with him face to face",23Apr2019,1

389,"Alright so me and this girl know each other from back in college/6th form and we had classes together and spoke every now and then, we were always pretty friendly with each other when we spoke but it was more just casual conversation.

Recently we’ve bumped into each other a few times and every time we met we would have a good chat and a laugh and normally I wouldn’t fuss about it because she’s just being friendly. 

However on a recent night out i bumped into her again and she was pretty damn enthusiastic about seeing me, i walked by not noticing she was there and the next thing she shouts my name and runs over to hug me. 

Obviously this caught me way off guard as our friendship is nowhere near that level of casualness and as far as i know shes not that friendly with other people. Bear in mind we are basically just acquaintances at this point.

This just has me a bit confused and I’m not gonna lie i do like her and i would like it if we saw more of each other. But part of me is convinced she was just being friendly and it would be a bit weird to contact her.",23Apr2019,4
390,"A few months ago I left an emotionally/verbally abusive partner. Long story short, I spent a good majority of the relationship taking all the blame and suffering from awful anxiety/panic attacks.

Since then, I’ve been good for the most part. However, I noticed that over the past few months when I go out with friends... I tend to drink a lot and while I’m having a great time and not putting anyone else in harms way I tend to be a little risky with decisions for myself.

For example, this past weekend I was at a bar with friends having a great time. A cute guy asked if I wanted to go for a ride on his motorcycle.. and while I could tell he wasn’t SUPER drunk, he had a beer while we were chatting. Long story short.. I went and while I had so much fun the next day I had THE WORST panic and anxiety attacks just because this is SO unlike me.. when I’m sober I’m really cautious and never would imagine getting on a bike... but since then I haven’t been able to even think about me doing this. I mean, it was incredibly dangerous getting on the back of a bike even if I was wearing a helmet and driving down a dark road at night and on top of that.. with a complete stranger. 

I feel like since I’ve been single while I go out and have fun I am not so proud of the decisions I make when I get around certain individuals.

Anyway, I'm 22, actually good looking and I always thought I had it good in life until I lived through the past few years. I got into the whole medschool thing, researched a ton, even bought a few books and read them and got all hyped about it. It was my dream, my destiny, I planned out everything and what path I'd choose after I was finished with med school. So then I finished school with 19, was naive and my grades weren't perfect, had the hope the universe or some shit would guide me to my destiny and all would be fine. Of course I was wrong. A year later in summer 2017 I decided I will move on and study education to become a teacher. My cousin suggested I study in the same city as him and I thought all would be fine, long story short I didn't like it and quit in 2018, went back home to a clusterfuck of trashtalk behind my back and my whole family turning against me. Told them I wanted to study psychology which I actually didn't want, naive me came back and had hope I could study medicine somehow, now I'm sitting here, with a family that is dependent on a high paying job and especially on me. This time I want to do things the way I don't want to, but the way that I have to. How do I escape this prison?

401,"23f, 28m duration: 1 year 
A year ago I met a guy on POF. He lived a few miles away from me, and he was about 5 years older than me. We texted for a few days, and we had so much in common. We FaceTimed a few times, chatted on the phone. I felt comfortable enough to meet him IRL. 

One night I had one of my close friends over; and I had told her about this guy I’ll call “J”. I’m sure I looked foolish and “loveblind”. I expressed that I was nervous about meeting him, but absolutely giddy and excited that I had met someone. She talked about the dangers of meeting a stranger from the internet, and suggested I should just invite him over to meet me *that night* while she was there, Incase anything strange was to happen, she would be witness/help me. This made me less nervous. I casually invited him to come over.

“*hey so, my best friend is over. I was wondering if you wanted to smoke and chill; maybe have a few drinks at my place?”*

He rides his bike over about a half hour later. I made sure I looked perfect, made my house look “cute”. He was totally handsome. (IMO). I have a strange sense of style, and have a definite “type”. I like skinny, tall guys, who wear skinny jeans. Long hair. Tattoos. Piercings. Some might call this style punk, emo, scene, hipster (?) I don’t really know how to classify this type of dude, but he was literally my “dream guy”. (I know this sounds ridiculous but this is important info)

We totally hit it off, he literally was as smooth as black ice. He had a sexy voice, these gorgeous green eyes. His smile was disgustingly sexy. He had this long “Fabio-esque” dark hair. He knew all the right things to say.

My friend kinda purposely played 3rd wheel, but was super chill and we all had a great time hanging out. We walked up to the store, and on the way he had pulled me closer to him, and then sort of switched sides with me, forcing me to be on the inside versus the side of the walkway that was next to the street. I thought this was super sweet. He bought us a 5th of Bacardi and I bought the chasers. As soon as my front door was unlocked, my friend poured herself a stiff drink, and laid down on my couch. She declared she was going to bed, so I laid a blanket over her, and she was snoring a minute later. 

That left J and I alone. Out on the porch smoking a cigarette, and talking about the moon, half drunk, we totally started making out. Literally I felt sparks flying. More intense than my first kiss ever. More intense than anything I’d ever felt. 

We move back into the house, flowing from kitchen, down the hallway, to my room. We totally bang, and it was the best fucking sex I’ve ever had in my life. We hang out literally Till sunrise, and then I send him home. I sleep in my recliner in the living room with my friend for a few hours until she wakes up. Upon rising, she says to me, 

“I don’t know what it is about that guy. I can’t put my finger on it but he is just weird.” 

I couldn’t even comprehend the statement. I was totally infatuated with him. Later my friend goes home, and late that night I get a text from him. 

“*Wyd tonight? Stargaze again with me?*

I had played it cool all day, didn’t text him at all. I didn’t want to scare him off. 

Tickled pink, I happily obliged his request. He was at my door 20 minutes later. It was about 1 am. We talked and once again it felt as if I had known him for centuries. We cuddled, kissed, and had sex a few more times. We made breakfast together the next day, and he stayed at my house literally all day long, and then again that night. At my house a full 24 hrs now. He showered at my place. We did it all again, and before I knew it, day 3 rolled around. I send him home again, literally just trying to digest the past 96 hours. 

I continue to see him for about a month, nearly every single day. Literally missed maybe 2 days out of that month that I didn’t see him. We had conversations about actually officially dating. He would say something like 

“well we pretty much are dating, let’s not complicate things with labels. “

We “date” for about 3 months, but we never go out. I learn from all of our conversations, that he lives with his brother. He doesn’t have a car. No mention of a job ever, and since he had been spending nearly every day with me I fully assume he is unemployed. He talks often about how he goes to “raves” and shows me pics of them. Pictures of him with half naked chicks, draped around him, high on molly. He had expressed this “scene” that he was into. In the area I live in it’s not an uncommon thing for people my age to go to these underground parties. But legit this guy looks *nasty* in these pics. Hes always shirtless, wearing a bandana over his face, sweating his ass off,  covered in glitter, candi bracelets up both of his arms, glow sticks, etc. The videos he shows me...these girls are literally stripping; high on drugs, everyone’s all fucked up. They make me super jealous, as we had been dating for months and he never asked if I would want to go to these things? Or even go out in general on any sort of date. 

He blames it on circumstance, 

“Oh, well my brother is a bouncer there. I drive with him, and I stay at the club for his shift and I go with him wherever he’s going. It’s not really a thing I could bring you to...”

I know for a fact the club he frequents, has a “girls get in free before 11 EVERY NIGHT!” thing. They advertise it on the radio, and also I know, because I have been there before! I know it wouldn’t even be a big deal. I’m a cute girl, and it wouldn’t be strange for someone to bring me along...
Nearly every other night he’s out at the club, doing god knows what with god knows who. Nearly every day he’s at my door, with his charming smile, with his loving embrace. 

I became addicted to him. His smell. The way he laughed, the warmth of him next to me. It became that I would do anything for him. 

Finally he invited me out. We went to a motel, not far from my house. We got fucked up, and partied in the motel room. Did our usual thing. We’re outside in the parking lot, smoking a cigarette, when he grabs my arm and looks deep into my fucking soul.

*I gotta drop a bomb on you.*

These words shook me to my core. What could it be? 
I had no idea what the fuck he coulda came out of left field with. I was a deer in the headlights.
A few seconds that lasted an eternity passed.

“....I’m... I’m a registered sex offender....”

I was floored. I had known him this long. Didn’t ever think to *look him up*...... I was so naive. 
Through a series of sobering conversations, he alluded to why he had been convicted. Apparently one night after the club, as he was fucked up, smoking a cigarette outside his brothers house, a chick “approached” him on his porch. It was dark, and he was drunk. He invited her inside, and they had sex. About a month later he’s got the cops knocking at his door, telling him he had raped a 14 year old girl. 

I couldn’t believe it. I didn’t know what to do or believe. 

I had not introduced him to any of my family. My relationship with him was completely low key. I continued to keep it that way. 

I don’t know why, but I fell in love with him. I felt bad for him, but he was clearly marked, forever as a pedophile. 

I begged him to formally date me. I wanted to be his girlfriend. I wanted him to exclusively date me. He always had some excuse for why he couldn’t, or that he felt I was “too good”... I deserved better..etc. 

Here I was, literally begging for a pedophile to give me the time of day. Not to mention. When I was 14, I lost my virginity to a *24 year old man*....as this was some huge contradiction in my head. I was disgusted that this had happened to him. I felt bad for the girl. I had weird trauma in my own head from my past. I had been to therapy, and came to terms with the fact that The man who took *my* virginity was a pedophile/rapist. And this was triggering. Plus his promiscuity and unclear truth of what he really did at the club jarred me. 

I abruptly stopped talking to him. Deleted him off of everything. 

He never came to my door. He never tried to contact me. 

9 months later and I was still thinking about him daily. Everything reminded me of him. 

I go into my blocked numbers in my phone, unblock about 5 numbers and text all of them, hoping that one of them was still his number. Nothing.

I literally make a Facebook, knowing he has one. Finally I find his. I message him. Within 2 hours, were talking like nothing ever happened. 

He comes over, we go through our usual motions. Then he goes to sleep on my couch for hours. For whatever reason. That was the closure I needed. I wake him up, tell him he has to go. I hug him goodbye. And I then blocked him again and deleted my Facebook. 

3 months later, here I am today posting this. I reactivated my Facebook, and messaged him and got a vague reply. 

Why am I infatuated, head over heels, obsessively in love with this disgusting man?? He has done nothing but use me. He is a pedophile. he told me I was not the only woman he has sex with. I was one of many, and I’m sure he has had these intimate, close relationships with many women. Simultaneously. But why is he all I can think about? I’ve tried dating other people, but nobody compares to him. I think there is something seriously wrong with me. Please, someone shed some light on this dark, subject. Any advise, anyone who has been through this?

403,"I still live with my mother and have little to no financial independence.

I intentionally make long Christmas or birthday lists. It's not that I expect to get *everything* on the list - it's my way of playing the odds. The longer the list, the more likely I'll get *something* on it.

However, with some of the things, like collectors' toys or model kits, they'd probably all look the same to my mother, so I began including URLs for the items in question in the list to sites like GundamPlanet and BigBadToyStore. This arrangement worked out pretty well, but recently Mom's started getting... ""duds"" as she calls them.

The first time was my asking of a *Mazinger Z* DVD collection. For this one, she struck out twice. The first time, she got a Spanish-only DVD. The second time, she got *Great Mazinger*, the sequel series. I didn't have it in me to correct her the second time.

The second time occurred just a few days ago. Remember those model kits I mentioned? Well, these are *Gundam* models that come in specialized ""grades."" I'm a pretty amateurish builder, and all the ones I've built so far are basic ""High Grades."" This time, my mother got me a more advanced ""Real Grade"" kit. It's not that the kit is a dud. It's actually a pretty awesome-looking kit. It's just that I'm worried that *I'm* the dud. Like I said, I've only built more basic kits, and I'm worried I'll screw up the RG somehow. So I'm actually afraid to start building it.

So that's the problem. I think part of it is that my Mom and I have different expectations as to what sites to go to. My mother swears by Amazon because of their free shipping, but because of Amazon's ethical issues, less stable pricing (they're vulnerable to scalpers), and lack of specialization (which makes them less likely to have certain items), I tend to prefer places like BigBadToyStore or GundamPlanet that specialize in the items I want.

I thought that by having a long list and linking directly to the sites in question, I'd averted this problem, but like I said, to my mother, they all look the same.

Some people have suggested just asking for money, or getting things myself, but I don't know how to adult (I don't know *anything* about budgeting or financing or whatnot), so I'm afraid to take the initiative.",23Apr2019,1
404,"A few weeks ago the charger port on my 6-month old Nokia 7.1 phone broke. I was only able to charge by pressing my charger cable firmly upwards, which basically makes it useless. I register for warranty, send it up and just a few days later I get an email saying that the defect doesn't fall under warranty. Reason: ""5010-Touch Panel is mechanically broken, without external impact e.g. due to a drop, or external object.""

This obviously has nothing to do with my charger port, and sounds like the screen is broken which was not the case when I sent it out. Of course it could have broken in transport but that is highly unlikely since I packed it very carefully. The only defect in my phone is a broken glass back panel, which happened within two weeks of buying the phone. In the months in between I have not had any problems charging my phone. I immediately sent an email asking about this and they answered that the screen needs to be removed to access the charger port. However, the reason they gave seems to imply the screen is broken and like I said that's not the case. In the email I got back they even confirmed that the back glass would not be replaced unless I'd explicitly ask for that.

I sent another mail asking why the repair does not fall under warranty and to give me proof of the broken screen and the only reply I got was an email saying ""This is according to our warranty conditions, as remote support we can not discuss the decision of the technicians"" with a link to the warranty conditions. I read them and everything says the defect should reasonably fall under warranty. It came out of nowhere and I did not use my device in any out of the ordinary way. I just sent an email back saying I want contact with the technicians who made this decision either directly or through support, but I have little hope that they are able to give this to me.

My boyfriend  comes into the room and tells me not to accept her follow request. I asked why and he said he had to tell me something. He told me that a few months into our relationship, him and I got into an argument, and because he was upset he went to an old FWB's house and she ended up jerking him off (apparently they didnt finish) and apparently nothing else happened. (like sex or anything). Apparently he was telling this girl all of this on Instagram (I guess getting it off his chest). He even asked to hang out with her and ""catch up""-she denied. (Apparently they had a class in high school together-but they weren't really ever friends) so that made me think he was going to try to get with her too. He still denies that he was going to do anything with her. But anyway, he kept this secret from me for a YEAR. He said he was too ashamed and I guess wanted to forget about it- he didnt want to ruin our relationship by telling me the truth. 7 months later from him telling me, I still feel hurt and I feel confused if I should trust what he says.

415,"I [17M] live alone with my mother for the majority of the time. (I go to school closer to where she lives than my father, my 3 siblings stay with him more often for the same reason).

Now. Our house. 

It looks fine on the inside. But first impressions matter, and wanting to bring people home only for them to see what looks like a dirty, trashy, cracked up redneck house from the outside doesn’t go down well. (At least I can’t imagine anyone is impressed by it). The house was initially white, but now looks an orange brown. Dirty. The garden is overgrown. The soil is sandy. There are various oddities lying amongst the grass, examples viewable from my window are:

&gt; a disused mic stand
&gt; patches of coffee grounds
&gt; a holey yoga mat
&gt; various fruit peels
&gt; boxes of rubbish that haven’t been moved in weeks

I’ve tried to talk to her about cleaning up outside, buying soil for the lawn, getting the grass cut, growing plants, getting a paint job done, but in vain. Whenever I bring up these topics she cries out in anguish “I’m really tired, u/EhrHD!

He passed away a few days before Christmas, and I'm near Boston so the ground has been frozen and me and my dad just buried him this past Easter Sunday.

417,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

424,"First began drinking around 16, and I’m only 18 now, but since the first day I drank I fell in love with it, loved the way it made me feel and loved the way it got rid of my social anxiety/awkwardness. I never know what to say or talk about when I’m sober. 

Everything feels boring and dull when I’m sober. The positives seem to outweigh the negatives, but I feel like that’s wrong because if I told anyone how much I drank they’d think badly of me.

425,"Okay so currently I’m 23, young and fresh and finally just settled in and tied up all loose end of the first job. Job isn’t that kinda bad, entire workplace divided into 2 shifts (for example: a shift have to work for entire day then the next day you work only half a day then got half a day off). Payment is not bad for a first job, thing is the job take away too much of personal time and compare to the payment, I just felt that it wasn’t that worth it, but then again it my first job, I can’t be too demanding. 

Frustrating thing is, just when i just settled for the job, our branch has a new manager. Now the manager he has 2 guys that will supervising our works and report to him (in a way they can be called vice-manager). We’re fine with the 2 supervisors since they’ve been with our branch for a while. 

So after working with him for a while, despite i myself pretty much a newbie (not even close to 2 years of experience this is my first job anyway), the new manager pretty much like to target me for criticism and picking on my errors (remember that i’m still a newbie). At first I feel like yeah, maybe this guy is just a little bit cranky, he will open up himself after a while.

But nope, it got to the point where he will publicly criticize me in the weekly meeting. And a thing I noticed that whenever my senior make a mistake, they can talk him out of it (curious so i ask around and learn that he has absolutely no experience in leadership and management, he only got his position because he somewhat a relative to our superiors, so he rely a lot on the seniors to polish his name while criticizing me as a way for him to think he is a leader for once in a while). And since i don’t have much experience whenever i try to talk him out it don’t work out that well. Whenever i have free time i try to ask him out for a friendly drinks or meal but turn out he’s a vegetarian so he doesn’t accept meal but asking him out to an expensive club or wine party, he will accept and for obvious reason I can’t afford that.

So yeah he clearly want to cast me aside (i later learned that he has a relative in need for job and promise that relative of his a job). So right now i still put up with him and all his BS, but i know that I won’t last long with him around. 

I did try to consult co-workers, family but the co-workers don’t want to involve anything with him (can’t blame them though) and i’m just a regular Joe so all my family can do is cheer me.

So I did found another job that would fit me better, the pay isn’t the same like the current job but there are more leeway for free time. Thing is i need to study probably for a year to get the application before working. Which mean i will have to quit my current job and investing on the studying which also mean there’s not enough payment to invest which mean help from family is unavoidable. Right now what i want is still trying to put up with my manager and try saving up as long as i could then start investing on the other job.

Right now i’m just so confusing.

436,"This is going to be a long one sorry guys

Ever since I was a little kid I’ve been a bitch. I was scared of everything and was made fun of in school by my former friends. 

In middle school is really where I became a piece of shit. I played video games constantly and I got chubby. I had a handful of friends but I was looked at as the fat kid who plays pc games. Again no one could take me seriously so I mostly just shut the fuck up in class. 

When high school came around I was skinnier but still about a 6/10. I tried asking out girls, some flat out said no, others laughed, and one freaked out. That pattern continued until my sophomore year. I met a new friend group and we did everything together. We went driving around late at night screwing with people and just doing highschool kid shit. Then the drama started between us. People started accusing of others of saying this and that and it spiraled out of control.

To make matters worse I ended up dating the sister of what is now my biggest enemy. But back then we were friends. It was a stupid decision and I regret dating her everyday. I regret being friends with them everyday. By this time I had started my junior year of highschool. I  ended up not speaking with my ex’s brother for the whole year. This kid was evil. He lied, munipulated, and used people for everything. He was the epitome of gas lighting. So I cut him out of my life. I ended up breaking up with his sister around christmas but she guilt tripped me with gifts so I ended up back with her. 

I then broke up with her around the beginning of April late March. I couldn’t take it anymore. She was clingy and I needed to work on myself and get away from that family. I regret the sex we had and the things I’ve told her. I worry about blackmail everyday from her and her brother. The reason I had waited so long to break up with her the 2nd time was to be nice and let her enjoy herself. Well a week after we split she found a new guy. The same guy she always talked about when we hung out. 

I am at a cross roads now. I want to work on myself and become something great. Summers coming up and I plan on working out everyday if I can. However I’m still soft and a pussy. I want to go fucking crazy and get yoked as shit. I want to make people take me seriously. I want that little shit to see me next year and fear me. But I’m still a fucking bitch. I’m lazy as fuck.

I’m hoping if I work out this summer by next year I’ll be yoked and people will take me seriously.

Either way, it was all my fault according to my husband and when I pressed this seriousness of the issue he told me that I am just a b!+CH looking for a fight......

440,"So quick backstory on myself first...

&amp;#x200B;

I just turned 20 years old, I dropped out of high school at 17 years old and was hired within 3 months of dropping out making over 40k a year as a developer... I've been there for 2.5 years now. I've been coding for the past 7 years of my life and have reached a ""boiling point"". I have aspergers syndrome and some other medical conditions that impact my life on a daily basis, I live with my parents and have absolutely no debt or monthly bills other than $230 for my phone and servers for websites/apps. I also do not have any savings but do have around 2k in bonds that I could use if need be.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's what's up, my job has pretty much become complete menial work, absolute terrible work that I know as a developer I am capable of more... I'm talking updating web page type shit, not actually developing anything other than bug fixes from time to time. The area I live in does not have any other options, so just leaving and finding a new job isn't possible in my current location. I have an app idea that I believe could make me enough money to support myself and want to pursue it but by time I get home from work I am so exhausted that I literally just fall asleep and repeat the next day. I have considered just straight up quitting after I save up 2k, so basically a month, and then going hard on my app for the next few months until it's ready to release but that's where the other issue comes in....

&amp;#x200B;

My parents ride my dick constantly about how I ""need to keep a stable job"" and there's a ""proper way to do things""... which to a point I understand but at the same time, I'm 20 years old, have no debt, no bills, nothing... yes I'm living at their house and I've told them I can pull my weight but they just keep telling me over and over to just suck it up and deal with the job. When I started this job it was never about the money... it was about growing as a developer and I have outgrown the position there.  


I could write on and on about this but basically my question to you is... what the fuck do I do? I'm not going anywhere at my current company and there are no options around me for other jobs. My parents are overly harsh on me about MY DECISIONS and it's just reaching a point where I feel like I might just say ""fuck it"" hop in my car with 2k and go somewhere.

442,"I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

444,"To give you some context, I (24F) met him two years ago online. He was the first guy ever to catch my attention and make me want to break down my walls. Never really dated or talked to any other guy in the way that I did with him. So we started talking and eventually, we fell in love. I was really happy and was so looking forward to having a relationship with this guy. 

There was a catch though. I never knew of his name or saw him in real life. I really wanted to know him beyond texting and sending pictures and videos but he said that we should wait until we really met. He said that if he were to tell me his name, I might discover things about him (from Googling) that would make me think of him in a different way. And thinking that I would be seeing him soon anyway, I agreed.

The meeting never happened though. Months and then a year would pass. There would always be something that would come up and I would always try to understand. I would always ask him about when we’d see each other and he would always say “soon”. I understood that he had businesses he needed to attend to and was always out of the country but it really made me feel sad, insecure and anxious. But I still hoped that it would happen. 

A year later, my friends found out about him through social media. Turned out that he had a long term relationship with someone else. This broke my heart. I asked him about it and he said that it was nothing, that it was only set up by his parents and that he wasn’t committed, and I believed him. I was also shocked to know that he was some sort of a socialite and it made me feel depressed to not know this side of him, like his everyday life felt so far away from me and I was not a part of it.  Ever since then I became really anxious and super insecure. I tried to get over it but I couldn't. It also caused a rift in my relationship with my friends because they felt like I chose him over them. I was so incredibly blinded by my love for him that for a while, my problem with my friends didn’t matter as much to me as it should have. As long as him and I were okay, all was well.

The anxiety and insecurity didn’t stop. I tried to talk to him about my feelings but for some reason it would always turn out that I was trying to hurt him or something so I stopped trying to open up. I was afraid of losing him so I kept my feelings to myself. I also felt like I was losing my mind at times because of the pain of not knowing what was happening to him whenever he would not message me for a day or two. It was horrible. 

We would fight about different things and make up throughout the two years that we talked. But it all ended last month when I just couldn’t handle my anxiety and decided to end it. He said some nice things when we ended it and it felt like it was all my fault for trying to take away a good thing from him. He said that I was one of the good things in his life that he wanted to keep. 

I wasn’t able to tell him everything that I have been feeling for those two years that we were talking and that contributes to my guilt and extreme sadness. I know that it really wasn’t the healthiest relationship and there were a lot of “red flags” that I chose to ignore but I still feel really guilty and sad about it. He knew that I was anxious and worried about our relationship that was why I wanted to end it but I was never able to communicate why I was the way I was.

The aim was to take some workload off of my father, assuming it'd be fairly cheap to live down here. Cheaper than Long Island, anyway.

Welp, my father is currently on Long Island. He had to go back about 8 months into our first year living in Florida. Couldn't find any real work here, so he went back to his old job and has been there ever since. I've been cooking at a shitty Village Inn since my first week here. I bring home $380ish a week. No driver's license, no second car beyond that. The one car we do have has a flat tire every other month and is basically just garbage. So, I don't do much of anything other than work fairly hard, for peanuts.

My sister lost her job two months ago, after not having a job for about 3 months once we moved.My brother went through a divorce and hasn't had a job in.. I don't even know how long.(Both in their 30s, for the record.)

They both leech off of me and my parents and just actively detract from our lives, but my dad isn't here to enforce anything, my mom is something of an enabler, and I'm so depressed I don't even give a shit anymore.

My meager earnings pay for three phones, a portion of the rent, food and whatever else pops up throughout the month. That last one is usually me paying for my sister's portion of rent, or her phone, or some other bullshit.

Despite getting away from all this being my one feverish desire, I can't just leave in good conscience.My parents took good care of me, so I want to help them out when times are tough. I can't just abandon my mom.

That being said, I've been down here for almost three years. I have no friends.I've been told we were moving back to our old state for about two years, only for the story to change a few hours later.

I'm kind of at my wits' end. I despise the majority of the people I interact with in my daily life.I have no passion for my music anymore.I have no passion for my work.I have no passion for anything.

I actively hate Florida. Between the weather, the bugs and the fact I'm essentially alone, I just, hate it.

Therapy is out of the question, between my low funds and lack of insurance, so that isn't an option on the table.

Things could always be worse, of course, but that isn't something I can honestly take solace in.I miss my smile.

447,"Firstly, I am an animal lover.  I've had my geckos for a while, they're both female and are friendly.  They like to cuddle and explore with one another.

Leo's live close to 20 years (I think) and my geckos are fairly young.  I bought them maybe 2 or 3 years ago?  They are happy and well taken care of.

My problem is, I'm getting married and moving out of my parents house in November.  Every apartment I see doesn't allow any sort of pets, and obviously there's a stigma with reptiles, that they are gross and slimy.

Also, they are taken care of but I'm slowly losing time to give them the attention they deserve.  I feel so much guilt and sadness knowing that they deserve so much more than I can give right now.  I feel like a horrible owner for questioning keeping them as well.

I think they're precious, but my moving dilemma and all of these new responsibilities make it difficult to give them the life they deserve.

448,"Backstory: I’ve known this girl for bloody ages, think she joined my primary (elementary) school in year 3 (2nd grade). She’s the only person I ever had a crush on throughout primary school but that soon fizzed out as she would end up leaving for high school a year earlier than me, being a year older. 

Time goes on, I get meaningless girlfriends to fill the hole in my body that reeks and screams of “singleness-anxiety” and self-confidence reassurance. However, I’ve never really felt, you know, happy, or, feelings I guess.

Fast forward and I’m in year 11, she’s at college and we haven’t been at the same school, and I won’t be at her college. 

Dad decides to cheat on my mum, house is a mess, mums sad, sisters sad and I feel like I’m not aloud to be sad because it would be letting the team down. I continuously cease to show emotion within the house and end up going into a rut where nothing makes me happy for prolonged periods of time but nothing makes me sad because it’s not fair on my family. But then, all of a sudden, she’s back in my life. And I get kinda happy. 

Meeting her is the only thing I wanna do but I’m too scared to do it by myself. So I resort to only seeing her at parties, or with Mutuals. 

-Side note (1): I’m quite confident, I’m happy to be open and usually don’t have trouble talking to girls, I’m trying not to sound like a nob but I also don’t want to lie about a lack of confidence. Albeit, this stemmed from paragraph two. 

Anyway: party’s, mutuals, her. She ran my mind and had no clue, Until New Years. We’re at a party and I’m slaughtered, so’s she. I decide the best thing to do is look after her but continue drinking. Not entirely sure what I said to her but I’m pretty certain I admitted my adoration to her. Subtly I think. 
This seemed  like a bad move until a couple weeks on and one of her friends told me that I should’ve made a move as she was waiting for me to kiss her. 
Fuck. 

This is where were we are led to, [unnamed friend’s] birthday party. She’s there and I’m happy about it. As the night progresses I become astronomically mangled and She joins me. Confidence begins to emit from every molecule of my being, every orifice of my body and I begin to admit to her, in detail, everything. But sloppily in a drunk and choked manner. 

-side note (2): this was all told to me from a friendly witness. 
I remember nothing from that night. Fucking nothing. 

I regret everything and start to feel sorry for myself, seeing her at party’s makes me embarrassed as I just get sad. Her friend ask’s me what’s wrong when In actuality they know and just want to be there for me. She decides the best thing i can do is tell [crush] what’s what as it will make me at ease. 

-side note (3): I think the main thing that upset me after [friends] party was that, subconsciously, I knew she didn’t like me like that, but she hadn’t told me herself. So I had this burning optimism that I might actually have a chance. 

So, yesterday I get to the point where I tell her. She ultimately friend-zones me. And my feelings stay the same.

I really like her and would do anything to be with her, but then maybe it’s just that she’s a distraction or an escape from my family and exams. 

Is there anyway I can win her back? Or is that it?",23Apr2019,1

450,"For the past year I have been dating this woman. She's been through a lot of mental and physical abuse, and it sort of became my job to help her deal with those feelings when she was between psychology appointments. It was demanding and sometimes painful, but I didn't mind because I loved her and wanted to help however I could.

About a month ago we were texting when she dropped a bomb on me. Apparently her mental health was in a much worse state than she had previously thought. Enough so that she didn't remember me ever asking her to be my girlfriend in the first place. She had been going along with it because upon reading receipts of our messages it had clearly happened and she was afraid that calling things off because she didn't remember them would be unfair to me. That was a hard pill to swallow, and I told her I needed time to think and process what she was saying.

A few days later I came back to talk about it and it seemed like she had thought about it a bit too. She was able to explain that she thought there might be someone else making  emotional decisions for her and said that at least that meant some part of her did want to be with me in that way. However, a bigger part of her didn't, and there was someone else that she had strong feelings for. We talked a bit more and ultimately I broke up with her, not wanting to hold her in a relationship she didn't feel fully committed to. I told her to try to pursue her feelings and be as happy as she could.

For about a week and a half I stopped contact and stayed away from places where I might run into her. Yesterday, (admittedly in a moment of weakness) I messaged her to make sure she was doing okay. We talked for a bit and she eventually mentioned her problems with the person she had feelings for and how she was becoming more and more afraid of going to her doctor's appointments. Instinctively I volunteered to be there for her and to help however I could and even gave her advice on how to deal with the person she has feelings for.

I guess my issue now is that I feel alone. For the last year, we were support systems for one another. Right now I feel like shit every day, and the only person I want to talk to is her. Further, I don't want her to feel alone the same way I do, especially if her feelings for this other person are ultimately unreciprocated. I'm asking for advice as I don't know what to do now. Is it okay for me to continue to try to be there for her? Right now I just don't know what I'm doing or what to do next.",23Apr2019,0

So I'm in a bit of a situation right now. I take public transportation to my job right now, and it takes 15 minutes to get there on a good day, but 30 minutes on a bad day. It's really not that bad right now.

My issue is that I'm moving out of my current living arrangement in September, but I'm moving even further away from my work. Public transportation would take closer to an hour, maybe even an hour and a half, and I really don't think I could do that 5/7 days a week, to and from work.

The good news is that I work for Starbucks, and there are plenty of locations closer to my new living arrangement. My biggest concern is that I'm still new (will have passed the 3 month probation mark mid-May).

Should I wait until I've passed the probation mark? I love my store right now, but it wouldn't be ideal to stay.

464,"About 1 week ago, a new client of mine asked me a variety of semi-personal questions while we were finishing up. He asked what my SO and I liked to do for fun? He asked where I went to college-just basic stuff. He then said he had a mentor that he thinks would be beneficial to me. I am going to quote him (I’ll call him “K” from now on) verbatim, or at least as closely as possible.  

Upon leaving he said “I have a mentor who has helped him greatly in the past few years. He’s a very wealthy man, he’s retired Marine and just a really wonderful dude who has a heart of gold and just loves to help individuals. Would you be interested?”  

K is potentially going to be a big client of mine so I didn’t want to do anything to possibly ruin a positive business relationship. I have him my personal phone number and he said “I’ll be contacting you within the week.”  

Yesterday I cut out of work early around 12:15 and around 12:30 he says 

“Hey Josh! This is K. We met the other day. We talked about being mentored by successful individuals in life. If you were serious about keeping your options open then let's figure out a time we can sit down for about 45 mins and just get to know each other better.”

I didn’t reply and about an hour later he sends “?”  

I texted him back and basically agreed to meet him. We met in a hotel lobby in town and talked for precisely 45 minutes. I will recap the main questions he asked. This next part may be boring but i want to get the full effect across. 

He starts off by saying he doesn’t want anything from me. (I thought it might be a multi-level marketing scheme but it’s not). 

He asks if I’ve seen the movie Pay it Forward, which I have and he said that what they do is closely related to that. Just people trying to help other people. 

Here’s where more personal questions come in. 

What do you like most about your fiancée?

Tell me about your childhood and upbringing? 

Have you ever had someone you considered a mentor in life? And do you still live by or consider their advice in daily life? 

On a scale of 1-10, how pleased are you with your life right now? 

I said 7.5. Why is it only a 7.5? 

How could you improve it? 

What are your hobbies? 

Tell me of a time in which you helped someone. 

What does financial independence mean to you? 

If I asked you what the word “rich” means to you, what would you tell me? 

How do you want your life to be in 10 years?

What are your goals? 

Just questions like that. There may have been a few more but it was more basic stuff. We talked for about 45 mins and before departing he handed me a book entitled “The Business of the 21st Century” by Robert T. Kiyosaki. He said that if he and his “people” decided to move on with this, there would be 4-5 potential interviews similar to this one. He asked that my fiancée and I read the book and when we are through, to meet with him again. Sooner than later. 

As we left the lobby, he states that he was impressed with my answers and he thinks we were moving in the right direction.  He also said that if for some reason it didn’t work out that “I can tell you’re a very passionate and genuine individual. I think very highly of you and I’m impressed with the way you handled those questions”. 

That’s about it. I’m bamboozled... what could this possibly be? Is it someone trying to get me to invest in a business and just being coy about it? Does someone just want to give me a lump sum of money for being a decent person? He did say that too many people expect something in return far too often and that’s not what he’s about.

This type of thing lasts anywhere between 5 minutes to a couple hours. Sometimes I hear the woman crying. 

Today my boyfriend is home and he said the woman’s car is gone but he can hear the baby crying and the man yelling for the last hour.

466,"A bit of background. I have been a craftsman at my current work place for the last five years. I only have ten years experience on this field. 3 years ago we hired a 30 year experience craftsman.

This guy whom I'll call Eddie. Eddie and I have worked a multitude of times together. I can tell he isn't experienced in a lot of basic aspects. Also, everytime we work together my tools disappear and they magically appear in his truck everytime. I reported it to my boss about his inabilities and my missing tools. My boss sided with him becuase he didn't want to let go of a thirty year craftsman.

Last year, Eddie and I had a four day job together. The place was isolated and it was just us within a mile diameter. I was charging my batteries, come lunch time I go to gather them, and they are missing. I asked him about it, he denied seeing them, and suspiciously enough, he wouldn't allow me access to his toolbox. I reported him and my boss sided with him. I vented to coworkers and I came to find out nepotism was happening. I was infuriated because I worked my ass off to gain my craft and this imposter was allowed free reign. 

I whined to my boss enough times, and he allowed me to purchase a new battery and charger set. I also exchanged an old battery that was under warranty and I got a replacement. In total I got a new charger, two new batteries, and an old battery. Eddie was jealous but I kept ever vigilant and kept multiple locks on my tool boxes.

Yesterday morning, I was charging up in the meeting room with the rest of the group, when Eddie decided to look at my batteries/charger. I stood up and confronted him. He was baffled he infuriated me in such a short manner. I told him off, in front of the other six craftsmen, how my previous set disappeared in mysterious circumstances. He said he just wanted to look at them and his set looks different. 

I usually let things go by the end of the day but this morning, I thought of ways of mocking him. He tells tall tales of his life and I know they are all lies. Some people call him out on it but I don't partake but now I'm rightfully pissed and I can't stop ruminating about the current and previous incidents.

What should I do? The common sense is to try to stop ruminating and move on. I don't want to do that. I wanna call him out and mock him, hide his tools, and just mess with him. Basically be a nuisance for all the previous times.",23Apr2019,1

468,"So, after I graduated high school, I took a year off before really starting to figure out my life. A couple of my friends were also doing it and my parents supported taking some time to just live my life and have some fun. 
After the year went by, I decided to say fuck it and go to school for medical assisting. I still hadn’t figured out what I really wanted to do or where to even start so I thought that it would be perfect. Well, lesson learned because I fucking hated it. It just wasn’t my thing and luckily I dropped out before having to repay my entire loan. 
However, ever since then I haven’t done anything with my life. I lost interest in almost everything I liked doing - hanging out with friends, music, hobbies I had, etc. My parents have been worried about me because I just have an overall lack of interest in everything I do these days.  I moved back in with my mom because I have no money. I feel awful that they’re worried about me and that I’m not doing enough to help. I clean the house and help with my younger brother just to not feel like a burden on her, but I don’t think it really works. 
I’ve been applying to jobs for about 4 months now and it just feels like kicking a dead horse because it’s either a rejection or they never get back to me. I’m scared of getting back into working or going back to school or literally anything because it feels impossible to do these things when I can’t even leave bed some days. I just feel so bummed out.

 Yesterday I had the time of my life with the man I thought was the love of my life.  We just started dating so we decided to meet up for movies at his house.  We watched a movie, we hugged,  we kissed and now here I am waking up naked with him in bed with no idea what happened yesterday night.  
  He said we both wanted it,  but this was my first time.  I have no idea what to do or what to believe since I can't remember if I really wanted it yesterday.  What should I do, should I still go on with the relationship ?",23Apr2019,1
474,"Hey guys, first post here. I cannot post this to any Facebook confession pages in my country (Vietnam) as there guys are not serious. Now I am serious. I have VERY strong sexual drive. I can do it everyday (I am 23, single, haven't found a love yet). But I have VERY VERY strong sexual drive. I also love cuddling and hugging and having physical connection to someone close. Without all of that, I will be irritated and crazy. I would be crazy without having someone close to talk to and to sleep with, but I am choosy and irrational.

But I have not been able to find a serious relationship though I have tried a lot. I have given up on finding a long term relationship until I have a good job and feel satisfied with what I am doing. I changed to finding fwb. My ex-fwb is quite okay except the fact that sometimes I expect him more than just a fwb: I want him to share my feelings, encourage me, stand by me and so on; I am also too harsh with him speaking that he is only a fwb. He does not have a good job, he does not see eye to eye with me about most of the things, in which the most important is that I am ambitious and work-aholic, I do the entrepreneurship, I work for myself and want to be a boss, but he only wants a stable job, and usually gets drunk.

Then a married man approached me. At first I denied every of his efforts but then I cannot fight back, I cannot resist all kinds of temptation. He lives far from his wife and children because of the job. Normally he only comes back to his home 2-3 times a month. He is a director of a big company, he has lived alone for more than 1 year because his work requires him to stay in Capital Hanoi but his wife has to take care of his parents back home. Again, he is a director of a big company, rich, very rich, knowledgable, understanding, as busy as I am, as alone as I am, as gentle as I am and as ambitious as I am. We can talk about business and politics. He can voluntarily drive me to meet my customers (I am currently a real estate broker) and wait for me until I finish my deal with my customers ON OUR DATE. He seems to sympathize for my job (I know, what else can he ask for?). We do not have many dates, just once a week or less because we are both busy while I have 2 jobs. Sometimes we go on a holiday for 1-2 days to release stress. I am very into him because he is such a mature man with wide knowledge, sufficient finance and have same interests as mine. Plus, I am not a slut doing sex for money. He wants to give me money and house rent but I denies all. I do not have to share our date but I do not receive his money, or ask him for luxury things. I can earn money by myself.

I am sane enough to know that this is not right. He is married. He has wife and children. They are still ok. I never ask about his wife but I think it is still ok. He has never said he might go on a long term relationship with me. He asked to be with me until I had a real boyfriend. But I am too busy and too smart to find a real boyfriend of similar age, I tell the truth. I know he will be totally perfect without me. He is a simple man, he can work all day, talk to his wife at noon and sleep early at night. They do not chat late at night as the boys have to go bed early with their mom. He has a group of male friends that hang out and drink together. His life is that simple, and he can live totally well with that. Then he met me. You know, I somehow make his life a bit more colorful and less simple. He of course prefers to stay, and so do I.

What should I do you guys? Should I continue? Should I stop? If then, what next should I do? Thankssss for your advice!!",23Apr2019,1

My uncle (Who is basically like a father figure to me) decided to go vegetarian about 6 months ago to lose weight and lower his cholesterol. The problem is that he doesn't subscribe to a plant based diet, he just eats junk. He doesn't really eat that many vegetables and the healthiest he will get is a processed veggie burger with lettuce and tomato. Other than that it's just heaping bowls of pasta, pizza (Except on days where he decides he's no longer eating dairy/cheese), Cheese sandwiches with hummus, chips, candy and snacks.

He binges constantly because nothing he eats comes with a high amount of satiety. He doesn't typically eat breakfast or lunch due to a busy job and consumes his entire days worth of calories through various simple carbs and beer (That's the Wisconsin in us) at night.

I love him to death but he is very stubborn and claims ""it works for him"" because he has lost 3 lbs over 6 months. Meals turn into fights as he randomly decides what he is or isn't eating, and his frustrations with himself manifest themselves as him getting frustrated with others. It's not that he doesn't have will power, it's that he has completely convoluted ideas on what makes a healthy diet and takes it very personally when someone tries to have a conversation about that. 

He is not avoiding meat for any scientific/environmental/or morale reason. Just a whim that he has gotten into his head. I'd like to introduce him to a balanced healthy diet, but he is very stubborn and I'm not sure how to even do this. I think if there was a really convincing podcast/netflix show about the dangers of loading up on simple carbs nonstop, and the need for balanced macros it would be helpful. Also any thoughts on how to have this type of conversation would be extremely helpful.

I want to help him so bad and help him feel good, lose weight, have more energy, but having that initial break through is difficult. I feel like his taste buds are warped as is his ideas on what constitutes a healthy diet. His wife (My aunt) would make him any food/meal to help but he has to take the first step.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts on how to help.",23Apr2019,1
486,"Hello, first post. So sorry if this is in the wrong section or what not and of my grammar and spelling.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if I should report harassment of a girl who is employed through my university. She works for the school's pantry and there are always guys flirting with her when I want to get food and it is awkward in there, one time some guy gave her a box of chocolates when another girl and I were in the room...These guys don't always tend to get food but just stay in the room and talk to her when no one is in the room. Yesterday there was a guy in the room who was ""looking"" to get things, she and I were talking about school while i was browsing what foods to get, yada yada and then a guy storms into the room telling her about him finding an opportunity for a job or intern and she was like ""oh cool"". First guy tells the girl he is leaving and is empty handed the second guy tells her he is leaving too. After the guys leave I was like ""why don't you say you have a boyfriend?"" she's told me she has multiple times and they don't seem to care and are still persistent. I apologize to her, because no one should feel harassed like that especially when they say they have a partner even if they do or do not. She's told me she has been tempted to ""go to meetings"" just so she can escape for a few. 

I  felt like a bystander watching all of this happen and never said anything about it until yesterday... As someone who has been stalked and harassed back in my teenage years, I felt hopeless and scared. I don't want her to feel like she should deal with this or any person to ever feel like that. I don't want her to lose her job, i don't even know if her boss is aware of this too.

487,"I’ve always been very active in my sleep, since I was a little kid. I would sleep walk all the time, climb out of bed, sing songs, have conversations with people, the whole nine yards. It’s gotten better over the years, but not by much. When I’m sleeping alone it’s not all that big of an issue, but it’s always caused problems with boyfriends as I’m so spastic in my sleep I end up waking them up all night long, which I feel terrible about! I’ve tried melatonin, Benadryl, tea, everything I can think of to make myself stop flailing in my sleep. I’m always moving around in reaction to my dreams. For example, last night I dreamed I found and saved a kitten and went to put in in another room till I could take it home but there was a dog hiding in the room so I grabbed the cat and kicked the door shut to save the kitten. But in actuality I kicked my boyfriend! Hard! This woke us both up and I obviously felt terrible so I slept the rest of the night on the couch to spare him the abuse. Boyfriend has been nice about it, but I can see how exhausted he is in the morning and I’ve just resorted to sleeping on the couch some nights so he can get some rest, but that’s less fun for everyone, and not a long term solution.

492,"Today, I went to the doctors with my mother in hope of doing a throat culture because I've been experiencing sore throat for quite some time.

When we arrived at the clinic, we had to check-in and the lady gave me a paper and she sent me to the first floor.

As we were waiting for someone to tell us where to go I looked at the paper I got and it didn't explicitly say anything about a throat culture rather otorhinolaryngologist examination which I never found strange since it is connected and I just assumed this is what they label it as.

I got sent in into one of the rooms and there I was with a doctor and he asked me a couple of questions and then he looked at my nose and my throat and I thought he was going to do the throat culture, but he never did. 
He wrote down some prescription and said what he thinks is the cause of my sore throat and I left.

My mother and I were at the check-out and I paid double what my mom told me I was going to pay. I got my receipt and I went to the ATM because I needed money for something else and my mom starts asking questions such as ""how long until you get your results"" etc etc and I wanted to wait until we get outside because she tends to make a scene, but I don't know, I just told her, I guess in hope this time would be different.
I told her I never did what I wanted to do and she started asking me for papers and how she's going to ask them why we got this if we asked for that and so on and she was right, I'm not denying it, I should've given her papers or at least ask myself, but just the way she was raising her voice and how aggressive she became (pulling my shirt as I'm trying to leave) I was getting embarrassed and I didn't care if I paid more and I didn't care how I didn't do what I wanted to do... I just simply wanted to leave and so I did.

I walked away from her and I could hear her cursing behind me as she was following me and as we left the clinic and walking towards the car (she was still behind me) she started yelling at me and calling me names, particularly stupid, incompetent and retarded. People were turning around and looking at us and I just wanted to disappear from how embarrassed I was. We got into the car where my dad was waiting for us, she's still yelling and cursing and insulting me and he's confused and asking what's happening.

I started crying and I didn't want her to see that I'm crying so I put my sunglasses on and I also put my headphones on because it was painful listening to all the things she was saying about me.
My dad starts driving, she's still yelling and this is the part that freaked me out the most. 
I don't remember what I was thinking at that moment and now looking back it felt as if I wasn't thinking about anything at all like I just turned off. And I can still hear her saying ""stupid, retarded, useless.."" through my headphones and I just started kicking her seat (she was sitting in front of me). I don't know why. I just did. And when she turned around I started hitting her on her shoulder and I called her stupid and retarded. And then I proceeded to have, which I believe was, a panic attack.

Before I did what I did, I don't remember thinking about anything alike and I know I didn't plan it, it just happened. Why? It felt as if it weren't me. After it happened, just, everything felt so strange, as if I woke up or regained consciousness or something. But also, I wasn't completely unaware of what I was doing - more so unable to control my actions, but when I stopped, everything seemed... clearer?

I am so confused and scared and I hate myself for this because this never happened to me and I don't know why it happened. I didn't want this to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

||Uni X|Uni Y|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Distance (from my hometown)|578 miles|289 miles|
|Safety|not so good/you'd have to be extra careful|excellent|
|Language Barrier|I don't speak the primary language but I do understand it (they also speak english)|I speak and understand the language|

|Familiarity|I have friends in this location, I've also been there thrice|I don't know anyone and I've only been there once|

494,"I'll try to keep this short (sorry mobile format)

So my friend Sherry (fake name) was dating a girl online named Yumi (fake name)

One day after 3 days of NC Yumi supposedly shot herself in the head.

Here are the specifics of the suicide:
She shot herself from the lower jaw, facing upwards
She had short term amnesia, but no other noticeable changes in behavior (Sherry said she's just a lot more distrustful of everyone now, but no random tantrum)
**She was able to snapchat after 2 days**

Now the bold one really weirds me out. The chat they were having shows that Yumi was completely normal (no incoherent speech or something) and she was able to remember Sherry as well. 

I must say I'm not really bought into this whole suicide thing. But Sherry was fucking depressed ever since they went NC and now Yumi's like this. I really don't want her to feel like I don't trust her, I give her the benefit of the doubt, but to say that I support her GF's side, it's just not too true.

Yumi's cousin and best friends did say she suicide though, so I may be inclined to say she told the truth since more than 1 people backed her claim.

Okay to start things off, he has been dating this girl for about 5 years now, he is only 20 so it's literally 1/4 of his life. He also is living with her family so there's that issue. For the last few months he has been pretty conflicted on what to do. His girlfriend is SUPER clingy, he has basically zero ""me time"". Going out for simple errands, they have to be together. Hanging out with his family without her gets her upset. Just simple small things, will upset her which she is just passive aggressive about vs being straight up angry. This has been going on for months and just today he told me he is basically ready to just end it.  


I've told him he \*needs\* to talk to her about it but I guess she basically won't. She simply says ""okay"", and he feels she is won't be willing to change. From an outside view, it fully looks like he is always walking on glass. He simply can't have any alone time it seems or she gets upset. He told me the other night they did speak about some issues, she explained her problems but once he told her his he told me she was back to the ""okays"". And the next day he said everything was great until the following where it became walking on glass again. He is also pretty sure she dislikes our family, which I won't judge her for it. I personally don't care for my sisters, so I can understand. However, they can never be late to her family events but doesn't care if they are late to ours which my brother isn't happy about, which I understand.   


However, the way I see things. Once he does try to break up she will then want to talk things over and try to stay together. So that's why I kept pushing for him to seriously talk to her. Tell her he can't handle it and \*needs\* some space. I feel like he isn't fully talking to her, letting her understand how much of an issue this is.

499,"My Grandfather born to a farmer in the Great Depression. He was a drunken mess when he raised my mother (he is sober and a wonderful man now) in a dirt-floored cabin. My father grew up in a trailer park in bumfuck Ohio. I was lucky to be born into the upper-middle class as well as to have been raised by people who knew what it is like to be poor. I am now in college, surrounded by people who do not understand how to be poor. They believe that the world has wronged them, and that the Baby Boomer's success in life is somehow hurting them in the present. 

Although they have been wronged, they were not betrayed by capitalism or conservatism, they were wronged because they were never properly educated how to live. High School should have a four-year class dedicated to taxes, loans, rental payments, and how to live your life- and it should be mandatory. That being said, here are the tips that I believe can make a newly poor young person's life better. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Jobs**

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently living in a thriving economy. Just look for a job, and follow any other advice on this subreddit on how to get one. Even if there are no explicit job openings in your area, there are other ways to make money. Even if you live in the middle of a city there are probably people willing to pay you under-the-table for certain odds and ends. 

If you cannot get a job, volunteer at a church in your denomination (if you are an atheist like me, then pretend you are just an agnostic). If you are a hard worker and you are friendly to the people around you, and you casually mention that you are unemployed and looking for work, then there is a 95% chance that someone will give you a job. Religious people, especially Christians and Jews, look out for their own. LGBT is surprisingly not an issue in most churches, and even if you live in a rural area there is probably at least one nearby that is open to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Housing Situation**

&amp;#x200B;

Politicians and political activists often cite the high expenses of living situations as a reason for a higher minimum wage. It is absolutely true that nobody can afford a $2400 apartment on minimum wage alone. The problem is: you are not meant to have a mid-level apartment, and you are not supposed to do it alone. 

Unless you have a career and make good money, you need to be realistic about apartment choices, and you should not live alone. You have a ton of friends and acquaintances from work, High School, and College who are in the same situation you are in. If you are willing to spend a few years sleeping on a cot and you have found a lenient landlord, you can fit at least five people in a $2000 apartment. 

The increased efficiency in terms of rent, utilities, food, cooking, etc. means that, so long as they all hold to contract, each individual person can pay a tiny fraction of what they normally would. Those $2500 per month housing, electricity, and food expenses turn into a clean $600 check. If one member of the apartment takes fewer hours of work and takes care of cooking and cleaning, that means that more hours can be worked by others to get even more overall income. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Luxuries**

Most things you believe to be necessities are luxuries, and many luxuries are so heavily used by the middle and lower classes that people do not realize that they can live without them. 

Smart phones are most certainly not a complete luxury, as they fill the vital functions of both a computer and a telephone, but their uses can be more cheaply approximated in other ways. If you own a $20 laptop for Microsoft Word and a cheap $10 cellphone, you eliminate the telephone bill as well as saving at least $70 from purchasing a smart phone. If you are living in a group with a data plan, however, it is more debatable and is up to you. 

Internet is necessary for you to function in the modern world, but high-speed internet is a luxury. If your landlord does not include affordable internet as part of your rental agreement, then it sure is a good thing that almost all libraries offer free internet alongside your library card, which not only gives you access to millions of books but is always cheaper than internet alone. You do not need Netflix, Hulu, or HBO because most libraries keep DVDs in stock. The books and study rooms can help you with school. Ultimately, this point can be summarized as ""read a freaking book.""

You do not need a flat screen TV to watch television and movies. An analog tube television and an old DVD player are cheap and functional. 

If you have an oven, use it. If not, buy a hotplate. Do not use a microwave. They cost a lot of money out-of-pocket, they take huge amounts of electricity, and there is nothing you can use a microwave for that is better than boiling water. That, and microwaveable foods are expensive when compared to their nutritional value. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Entertainment**

&amp;#x200B;

Modern video game systems and good televisions are expensive. Old TVs and Super Nintendo's/Play Station 2's can be found for $20 in a yard sale or free in your parent's attic. 

Army men are just as good as 40k miniatures.

You have enough Magic cards. 

Bars have free nuts and TV and cheap beer. 

Ultimately, just find a cheaper hobby. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Food**

&amp;#x200B;

Do not use restaurants or fast food, ever. They are more expensive than you think, and they are super bad for you. 

You can buy a month's worth of rice and potatoes for five bucks. You can get bread for $0.99 a loaf. 99% of all people who have ever lived have eaten almost nothing but rice, potatoes, and grain, and it is good enough for you. Just eat a chicken or two every week, and get some beans if you are a vegan. Lemons taste horrible, but they are a relatively cheap fruit and have plenty of vitamins. Broccoli is a green vegetable and you can eat the entire plant. 

Everything you have ever heard about GMOs is overblown. Non-GMO foods are three times as expensive and you do not need them. 

Unless you have celiac disease (or some other diagnosed disorder), you have no reason to avoid gluten. If you do have one, then you should probably buy gluten free bread. 

Pizzas are shockingly price effective when you know what you are doing. Most people do not understand how circles work, so large pizzas are cheaper per square inch of food than smaller pizzas- if they didn't do that then nobody would ever buy them. Buy a 36 or 48 inch pizza every Sunday as a treat for the entire living group.

(They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

507,"Let me give the back story first: Back in November, I was on Twitter when I saw one of my followers (who I talked to regularly) getting bullied by some girl, from calling her boyfriend a junk\*ie right down to suggesting that she end her life. Furious and annoyed, I didn't want to get involved... but I did. I replied to one of my followers' tweets saying only, ""Wow, that's messed up.""

&amp;#x200B;

Looking back, I wish I kept my mouth shut.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm the one she started attacking and now this girl will not leave. me. alone. Everything I would tweet, she'd have something to say on her own feed. For example, someone asked about my racial background and I said that I was part Japanese. She went on to tweet about ""how she don't f\*ck with chi\*nks."" Literally anything I tweeted, she had a response. Fast forward a couple of months and she was reporting my tweets until my Twitter got completely suspended. I was disappointed because I loved Twitter, but knew that it was probably for the best since this girl wouldn't leave me alone.

&amp;#x200B;

But it didn't end there.

&amp;#x200B;

She has now somehow found my Facebook page, my Instagram, etc. She's sent me messages saying that she's working with the police to press charges on me (not sure what those charges would necessarily be....) She found out where I work, she found out my boyfriend's name, and it is STILL going on since November. Granted, she lives in Canada and I live in the US, so I don't see how she could physically stalk me, but this has been going on for way too long and I'm scared for my safety. I do have her blocked from everything but I believe she has fake accounts where she is still watching my every move on social media. I have to assume this girl has some serious mental issues since she's literally out for me.

512,"Hello, I am having some trouble as I have reached a fork in the road of my life so to speak and I was wondering if anyone would mind lending an ear and perhaps offering some advice.

I was accepted to Boston University's Masters in Preservation Studies Program. I am 20 years old and I have a Bachelor's in American Studies. I live in Texas. The cost of tuition is $55k (that is already including my 33% scholarship). This total does not include room and board or other expenses. There is little chance I would be accepted into the only affordable grad school housing available as I am not a current student.

I was rejected from UT which was my top choice as I have potential roommates there making housing MUCH more affordable and the tuition would be far less expensive.

If I go to Boston I would have to take out $55k in loans (Stafford and PLUS), and there is very little chance of me being awarded any scholarships because if we are being honest no one cares about American Studies so there aren't many scholarships to go around in the first place and they would definitely not cover a substantial portion of the $55k. If I shoot for a museum position I won't make near enough money to pay back those loans and live comfortably (I have to support myself). I think I read it would be about $700-$800 a month.

I've been thinking I could just move to Austin with my potential roommates and explore my options there and save up to go to graduate school in the future when I have more funds and more experience. I could possibly reapply to UT and get a dog in the meantime. The only issue with this is that I would have to reapply and getting those Letters of Recommendation was hard enough the first time. Alternatively, maybe I could use my credits and go back to school and pursue a more realistic degree.

I am very concerned with coming off as a failure if I don't go to graduate school right away. I place a lot of unnecessary pressure on myself.

I know logically I should move to Austin and save up but it's hard for me to admit that I won't be going to graduate school right away. I know getting in was an accomplishment in itself but I still feel like I am accepting defeat.

If anyone has any advice or kind words I would greatly appreciate it.",23Apr2019,1
513,"(not sure if this is best for here or relationships — will post on both)

I know this all sounds like teenager drama, which is most likely because it mostly is. (I'm a guy also, for context). Anyways, so there's been this guy I've known for a while from our ""rival"" high school (~15 minutes west) and like he seemed nice enough on Snapchat and stuff, but I never really talked to him much. A few weeks ago we started talking more and then a few nights ago I forget how we got to the topic but he told me he liked me and he'd date me. Cool, right?


So we've been like talking a lot this weekend and I guess I kind of started to catch feelings too. Then, since yesterday morning, he hasn't opened or responded to any of my snaps/messages, and I'm just really confused, like what? I don't see how it would have been possible for me to make him mad or whatever overnight, so I'm not sure. Part of me wants to ask and figure out what happened, but then I also feel like maybe he's just been busy and leave him be, as we all need space, and it's only been a little over a day.

514,"My SO and I (both 24) have been together 8 years, 6 of those years I was close to his mother... but something changed when she was diagnosed with cancer. She was living with us, and it was stressful (we live in a small one bedroom), but we still seemed to be getting along. Fast forward 6 months and she is introduced to her now fiance. He is scum, and since meeting him she has been a totally different person - the polar opposite of herself. She started picking fights on social media with family, defending her low life bf. My SO decided to say something when he took it too far, insulting his grandmother and trying to dismiss his very own life experience, and I backed him up. Since she has treated me like a poison, like somehow I am the reason she no longer sees her son or talks to him often. Lately she has been passive aggressive, saying things like ""tell me who is in your ear"", ""this isn't the man I raised"", and ""oh no, I'll come get you"" when he tries to invite me out with them. She has even whined her way into his sister and grandmothers minds, making them jump on the bandwagon. 

Last night it finally hit me, the heart ache and frustration came pouring out. I hate that her behavior has influenced my emotions to this extent. That I did nothing to her, but suddenly I am the enemy... I love that woman like my own mom and I hate that she's forced her son in the middle.

517,"Fair warning: this will likely be pretty lengthy.

Before I get into the story, I'll provide a little bit of back story. I'm currently 20 yrs old, working full time and living with my family. I met this girl who shall rename nameless about a year and a half-2 years ago through the app Vine. She's currently 19 and going to full school time at X university across the country.

When I had met her, it didn't turn into an LDR right away, although she had broached the idea to me pretty early on. I quickly turned it down knowing that I wasn't the type to be in an LDR, but had no problem remaining friends with her being that I enjoyed her company. We had a lot of things in common, talked a lot, laughed a lot, and so on and so forth. Fast forward about a year later and we end up getting into an LDR for reasons I won't explain because that in of itself is a very lengthy post.

We had dated on and off again for quite sometime (I think it totaled a little over a year's worth of time) and actually did end up meeting in X state. We spent about a week together and had a great time, yet ended the relationship close to the last day due to the reason that even after the time we spent together, I still wasn't into the whole LDR thing. Fast forward again a few months later and yet again, we got back together. (Like I said - on again off again.)

I know I did her an injustice by getting into a relationship that I myself wasn't comfortable with, but here's the thing. I have always had a problem of not putting myself first, because I think I care to much about other people and their feelings. Often times I go somewhat outspoken or get put into a situation I dont want to be in, simple because I lack to back bone to say ""no"" or ""I don't want to."" This isn't to say that I got into the relationship against my will - because like I had said I do enjoy her company, but after some reflection it's fairly safe to say that I would've been better off hurting her feelings and saying no.

Here's where things get sticky and why I think the relationship was toxic. We argued. A lot. I don't really know how to say this without sounding like an asshole but my ex was fairly insecure, and often times took issue with the fact that I had a lot of female friends. In essence, I could understand where she was coming from. It just so happened that I had female friends and that made her uncomfortable - I get it - and I certainly tried to work with her in that instance. But unfortunately, there were times where she would have me not talk to a person period. I would have to cut off contact with girls who I had known for longer than I knew my ex, simply because perhaps I had crushed on them in the past, or in some cases simply because she felt threatened by them.

Now I am in no way shape or form trying to make myself seem like I've never done anything wrong in my whole life. That's not to say I ever cheated on her because I swore to myself that I would never be a cheater - but there were times where I did break her trust regarding certain issues. I never fully understood why, but we always tried our best to work through them.

That's just one example of arguments that we had, mind you. We would get into very heated exchanges quite often. Weather it be because I was talking to a girl, I went X-amount of time without talking to her, you name it. And these arguments got ugly. I don't mean to blow smoke up my ass but I'd like to think I am a kind person, however, we ended up in confrontations so often that I got very fed up, and a lot of times voices would be raised. Things would be said that weren't meant, and many, many tears would be shed.

Absolute shitshow, right? Despite all this, she still wanted to keep trying and pushing forward. To this day, I don't understand why. I tried to break up with her many, many times during the relationship, but as previously mentioned, I lack serious backbone. I would always back down because she would cry, scream, and fight back, which in turn made me feel like a failure of a human being. Why couldn't I get out of a relationship with a person who I couldn't even physically touch?

I was turning into a person who I was scared of. I started to sink into a depression, started talking to less and less people due to fear of confrontation of my ex, and would get blistering furious at the mere feeling of an oncoming confrontation. I felt sad, and I felt even worse being that my poor family had to hear all of my agony filled babbling.

I don't mean to make her sound like a terrible human being because I truly don't believe she isn't. She has a very big heart when we're not arguing, and she cares deeply about people. I just think she had gone about a lot of aspects of our relationship in the wrong way.

Fast forward again to last night, Easter Sunday. Her and I had pretty much gone the whole day without talking to each other. I had just got done going for a run and I was in the process of cleaning my room when she called me. We exchanged pleasantries, followed by the inevitable questions.

before the transcription: note that I am an introverted individual who heals and thrives during time to myself, or, alone time. she is extremely extroverted, yet aware of this fact and worked with me to the best of her ability

Her: Have you been having actual alone time?

Me: Yes.

Her: I don't believe you.

And thus began our last argument. Like I said, I had gotten to the point where I could no longer control my anger and frustration, and things quickly escalated. It once again got to the point of me saying that I wanted out of the relationship, her pleading with me that it was all just a big misunderstanding, her crying and trying to explain herself - essentially our run of the mill confrontation. Of course, I was crying, frustrated, angry, and feeling utterly helpless. God, how could I be so weak to let someone across the country control my life like this. As things continued to develop, Easter dinner with my family was ready, yet I was stuck in my room, arguing. My brother, 18, came in and hugged me. He started crying. He told me that he hates to see me like this, and he told me that she wasn't worth the long nights.

I had never felt so shattered. My brother is quieter than I am - and it made me realize that I have been setting such a horrible example for him. I felt like a failure of an older brother. Relationships should NOT be like this, yet he has to hear me yelling all the time, and has to see me depressed. My mom and dad can't stand the sight either. They felt very sorry for me, and they wanted me out of the relationship more than anything, despite liking my ex as a person.

After many, and I mean many, failed break up attempts, I did something that I really, and I mean really, didn't want to resort to. I wrote her a break up text, sent it after about 30 minutes of hesitation, then swiftly blocked her everywhere I could.

Not long after, she contacted my mom and through my mom got to speak to me. We had a very long, drawn out, emotion fueled conversation that lasted till about 2am my time, 4am hers. During that conversation, we both spilled our guts out to each other. She told me things that made me feel like I was a very horrible person. She told me that she doesn't think she'll ever be able to move on. She told me that she has never felt so broken before, and it was because of the way I went about breaking up with her. I apologized for every argument that we had ever had, regardless of who was in the right, I cried my eyes out with my mom by my side, and eventually we hung up the phone.

Here's where things get tricky. At some point, she had pleaded with me to keep her unblocked at least on iMessage as a coping mechanism for her. I really didn't think it was a good idea, but of course me being a push over, I heard her plea and agreed, despite my parents advising me otherwise. Of course this meant that I had to tell my parents a bit of a white lie that she was blocked everywhere, which of course no one likes lying to their mama, but I did it anyways.

Now, the reason why I didn't end up blocking her all the way is because i'm absolutely terrified of what she might do to herself. She has had a history of depression and self harm in the past, and if the arguments and screaming weren't bad enough, this break up certainly didn't help either. She had once told me that if we broke up she would never kill herself, but then just last night completely shattered that by saying that if she were ever to kill herself, this breakup would be one of the reasons. I can't fucking handle the thought of having blood on my hands, reddit. I want to be optimistic about her getting help and moving on, despite her saying that she never will (truthfully I just think she's being dramatic) but there's this side of me that is scared of what will happen. I know that ultimately, if she were to ever do anything to herself, it wouldn't be my fault. If she was gunna harm herself then she was gunna harm herself regardless to if I came into her life or not - but that still doesn't help me to be any less scared, especially after what she told me last night.

Am I being manipulated? Have I been getting manipulated this entire time? She wants a super human amount of me and truthfully I feel like my caring nature is being exploited. I'm scared that this has turned into emotional dependency and I don't know what to do. Should I block her out of my life completely and never look back? Change my number and change my social medias? Or should I keep her unblocked and leave the possibility of becoming friends again open for the future? That's her goal with staying unblocked on iMessage is to leave a so called ""lifeline"" available for us to get back to being friends in the future. She promised me that she wouldn't try contacting me if I kept her unblocked but has already broken that promise by saying she ""can't do this"" and it hasn't even been 24 fucking hours.

I feel drained, reddit. I feel cold, and I feel like I have changed. I'm scared. Don't worry, I plan to see a therapist sometime this week or weekend. I just wanted some outside perspective. I apologize for any spelling or grammatical errors, and I'm sorry that this is an absolutely clusterfuck of a post. My mind is very jumbled right now so I hope you can understand. Thank you.

I  could probably have left the house to live with my dad, but the thing was that, even though everyone else believed me and CPS had been called multiple times, my sister didn't believe me when I told her, and my dad had never seen it coming.

I made a few calls and found out from a friend who is in the USAF that the outprocessing may have already begun but there is no date and is due to what he told me about job performance.

522,"Hello. I'm a 25 year old male and I've been just collapsing over the course of the last few months.  I'm a full time-student at a local technical college getting a liberal arts transfer degree.  I'm a returning student after screwing up when I was younger and dropping out of this same tech school at around 18 years old.  I'm in my last semester to get this degree with only a few weeks left and I'm behind in all my classes and my instructor's agreed to work with me but I am struggling to make ends meet. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also work part time for an airline as a gate agent in the same city. I used to love my job, but now it brings me so much anxiety that I have been calling in more frequently. The mix of falling behind in school and getting in trouble at work is causing me to be on the verge of losing everything. This job provides me flight benefits and I have really easy access to airline travel, but doing the actual job stresses me out so much. I never get to be in my own headspace because I'm always dealing with passengers or dealing with my coworkers. It's a pretty toxic gossipy environment, and while I don't participate in the office politics much, I'm certainly effected by it. Also, my current shift starts at 4:30 am. It is so draining to wake up and drive to a customer service job at 3:45 in the morning. I often end up finishing my shift at around 11 and then either going to class and mindlessly sitting through it because I'm so drained, or I just skip it and go home and do nothing.  In a few weeks my schedule changes to working at 12:30 pm and stopping at 7:00. So that would solve the getting up super early issue, but I still don't feel like it solves the problem that my job makes me unhappy. I don't ever feel like I get to be myself because I have to always put on this superficial customer service face.

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to teach English and Writing so I have been looking for opportunities at the school to tutor or really any employment at the school because that is where I want my priorities to lie. I want to travel the world sure, and my job provides that. But more than anything I want an education and start a career. However, I graduate in May( if I can get my shit together) and there aren't may opportunities since I won't be a student anymore. Also, my girlfriend and I want to relocate to Denver or Phoenix by the end of the year so I don't know if leaving my job and starting a new one is a good idea if I need to save money and then ultimately leave my job again. 

&amp;#x200B;

How bad would it be to find another job that will ultimately pay less?  The airline I work for pays pretty well for a part time job(I'm on a scaling pay scale right now and I'm right about $16/hr). It would be hard to find something else that pays like that and that I just want to work a bunch of hours at over the summer and fall. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my life is falling apart because I'm not doing well at my job anymore and I'm falling behind in school. Which I wouldn't say is a direct result of my job, but it certainly is a large factor.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just so sick of being a nobody and I feel like having a degree and a career path would help me get to where I actually want to be and I'm fucking it all up.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be helpful, I apologize for the novel.",23Apr2019,1
524,Ever since I entered high school I found it really difficult to make friends (my dumbass doesn’t speak until spoken to) and because of that during lunch I sit by myself (or when I’m sick of sitting by myself I go to the bathroom and stay there until lunch is over). I really miss sitting with friends and enjoying my lunch but most of my friends go to a different school and the other ones that do go to my school don’t have the same lunch period (or I feel like I’m bothering them when I ask to sit with them). Is there any way I can stop being such a pussy and make friends with people.,23Apr2019,1
525,"(Long)
I’m just gonna preface this by saying that I’m young, I’m dumb, and i know that people have bigger problems than what I’m dealing with rn. I’ve just never felt so helpless and lost in my life and if I can reach just one person with this post that would really make my night. Or my whole week.

So to start this off, I (M, 17) am about to finish senior year in June, and in August I’ll be 18 and I’ll be entering into a vocational school (aircraft mechanics). Now just based off that I might sound like a typical stressed out high schooler abt to enter the real world, but everything was going good for me until it wasn’t. But that’s life I guess.

A few months ago I had it good. I had a future naively planned with my girlfriend (F, 20) who is currently serving in the army, a school lined up for after high school, and a motivated and happy attitude about life in general. I was optimistic for high school to be over and to start living for myself. I had the next few years generally planned out and I wanted to see those plans through.

This last week was spring break. Instead of having a fun break I spent the week dealing with breaking up (but not really) with my girlfriend of almost two years, mourning the loss of my grandma, relapsing on drugs and balancing my academics with everything else.

Two months ago, on Valentine’s Day, my girlfriend was raped. It changed her, and she started cheating on me, which inevitably led to our breakup a day after her 20th birthday. To see her change so fast like that as a result of something neither of us could control or stop, it just fucking destroys me. We still have feelings for each other, and this weekend when she visited home from her duty station I saw her again. She kissed me and told me she still loved me and she cares and still wants everything we planned.  

While reeling over my breakup but not really, I was woken up 2am last Sunday to my mom crying horribly over the phone. Her mom, my grandma, had been shot dead. Me and my mom don’t have the best relationship but to hear her cry like that kept me up all night. She went back to her home country to be with family, leaving me and my dad in charge of my four brothers at home.

On top of all that personal shit I also have to worry about scholarships, my grades, and a senior thesis that apparently was written very well but got a failing grade because it didn’t comply to the formatting of the assignment or some bullshit. I’ve grown very disillusioned with how some subjects (specifically English) are taught which is a big reason I didn’t go to a four year. What sucks is after everything that happened Idek if I want the school or career path I chose, and it’s too late to apply anywhere else. And as an added bonus my grades tanked and I’m in danger of not graduating.

I used to party hard and do a shopping list of drugs during my sophomore/junior year (they kinda blur together). I swore off everything except weed and alcohol at the start of senior year, and I stopped going to parties, because high school parties are lowkey lame unless ur tryna get fucked up or fucked. I went so far as to block plugs and hoes as a favor to my girlfriend, which bit me in the ass because I couldn’t even have a meaningless rebound after the breakup. I was loyal to a fault lol

But over spring break the stress got to me. I started smoking weed like I used to, which is a lot. 4/20 being on a weekend didn’t help, it was fun but I was just worried about going down that road and doing harder shit like bars and tabs and pills again. But after seeing my girlfriend or whatever she is over the weekend, I fronted my boy 75$ for dabs and syrup which was an impulsive and stupid decision that I’m gonna spend the next few weeks literally paying for.

I just don’t know what I want anymore. I should be rebuilding myself but idk where to start. I know some of you might read this and see just another kid making stupid mistakes but I’ve never reached out to reddit and this is really a last resort for me. My family isn’t the easiest to talk to or deal with and I can’t talk to my girl anymore, my friends are all in the same boat with school and have their own shit personally.

I just really need someone right now. 
I would really appreciate it.",23Apr2019,1

529,"Not sure if this is the right sub so if it isn’t sorry in advance. 

I often have clients come over to my home so it’s important to keep the House way cleaner than I ever could on my own, so I have a housekeeper. She’s great. She’s been with us for 15 years. She has two kids, 7 and 10. 

I found out that if the kids were home sick from school she’d bring them to my house while she worked. I don’t want sick kids in my house, one of my kids was immunocompromised at that time too so it was of the utmost importance to keep the house germ free as possible. 

I told her if the kids were sick she should stay home with them and we’d still pay her as though she’d come in. It was fine, it didn’t happen more than two or three times a year. 

Now lately she’s been bringing them after school for a couple hours. She asked if she could bring them because she needed to come later in the day and didn’t have a childcare option. I said it was fine, I figured they were of an age where they could do homework or watch tv or whatever. 

I’ve found out she’s been letting them play with my own kids toys, and they’ve been breaking them and getting food on them (we don’t even let our own kids bring food into their rooms.) I was uncomfortable about this but I didn’t want to step on any toes so just let it go. Recently they got a giant smear of chocolate on my daughter’s favorite teddy bear her grandmother got her when she was born, and my daughter is understandably very broken up over it. I also discovered they’d given a couple of her dolls haircuts, and she was upset but because we put such an emphasis on sharing she hadn’t complained. 

I told her it was fine if her kids wanted to bring their own toys but from now on I wasn’t comfortable with them using my daughter’s stuff. 

We have a couple textbooks for my husband’s work and we recently found some sticky, kid size finger prints in them. These books are worth hundreds of dollars and they’re on a shelf my daughter would never touch because she thinks it’s boring. I found a chair pulled up to the shelf. It’s at a height that any adult could reach it so it was clearly her kids. 

I asked our housekeeper if her kids had been touching these books and she said they had. I asked her to not allow them to do that anymore and she sort of apologized but also followed up with “I just really don’t want them to sit around and watch tv for all those hours you know...” 

I wasn’t really sure what she was implying. But I just kind of made a mental note and let it go. 

So now this week I got home and walked in just in time to see her kids arguing with each other before one pushed the other down some stone steps. He now has a giant gash in his head and I’m terrified of them being seriously injured on my property. 

I’m at a loss of what to do here.

531,"I just watched the [The Brainwashing of My Dad](https://youtu.be/Qh3TeTxgNVo) for the first time. Not sure why it’s taken me so long, I thought I’ve seen just about every political documentary. I would have never imagined i would relate to this extent. I definitely feel that I’m not alone in my personally struggles. 

I live in East Texas, where with many people it’s an absolute sin to be anything other than die hard Republican. Luckily with the 2018 midterm elections, although the candidate I voted for didn’t win (now in the presidential race), I was definitely able to see that things are changing in my home state. 

Our families, some close friends, coworkers, etc have become so incredibly angry, forceful and belligerent it has become unbearable. The most disappointing part is what I perceive as ignorance in these people I’ve loved for so long. Even trying to discuss/debate the issues, questioning any “fact” they’ve seen on the news or social media turns them into the most evil humans. Some of these “facts” are so absurd, I would think anybody in their right mind would have to see the ridiculousness of what’s coming out of their mouth. Frankly, I’ve lost so much respect for many people that I looked up to most of my life. 

The quick answer is obviously, stand up for what you believe in, that’s the noble thing to do. What’s at risk though is being disowned by family, losing lifelong friends that are practically family and most importantly my job. 

My husband and I have had conversations about standing on the roof top, screaming it to the world, how liberating that would be. I know this is something we will do, getting closer with each day that passes but I’m absolutely terrified.

532,"Hi all,

I have been recently promoted at work and was disappointed to learn that I only received £500 p.a. more than my previous salary. It was significantly lower than I expected.

I have been approached by a much larger firm offering me my old job role with additional menial tasks as well as quite a lot of the tasks my new job entails as well. They are offering between £3,000-£6,000 more p.a than my new current salary. I assume because it is more of a hybrid role, this is why they are offering so much more.

My problem is - basically ever since I started at my current job I have worked hard to be promoted to where I am now and it would be a shame to lose the job title that I have wanted since the start of my career. I imagine it will probably take 1-2 years until I will be promoted to my dream job again if I do leave. I have however wanted to leave my current job for a while as they do not make me feel valued, however my initial plans were to just wait until I had enough experience and then find somewhere else.

Should I wait patiently for more experience in my current job role in order to potentially boost my salary and experience in the future? Or should I just take a step back for a year or so with more money straight off the bat and a potentially better working environment?

Thanks in advance!",23Apr2019,2

537,"Hello, this is my first post to this sub and it might be a long one. I’m also on mobile so I’ll do my best with formatting. 

For a little background: I just graduated from college December 2018, a whole semester early. I had a few job interviews but nothing stuck before I graduated. My uncle owns a small graphics business (6 employees) and wanted to venture into marketing and social media, which is what I studied in school. I’ve been here since January, trying to grow this part of the business.  I also just turned 22, if that’s important. It’s also important to note that I’ve had 3 internships in the marketing field, so I have some experience on my resume. 

So, why do I want to quit? I have been absolutely miserable since day 1, and I know I have only pushed this far because it’s my uncle who gave me the chance. The job has been way more sales than I was lead to believe, and no matter how hard I try in writing posts for our social media presence, I’m told it’s just not good with no other feedback. I’m consistently micromanaged, I am sharing an office with my uncle! I’m excluded from most company meetings and I’m not invited when they go out for fun things. I’m told to do something, and then asked  “why did you do that?” When I do what I was asked. I can never get any consistent feedback from my bosses (1 of which, is my uncle). 

So last week I had enough. Monday I gave my uncle a two week notice. It surprised him and he took it okay. I got a couple of underhanded comments but I knew I could make it through the 2-weeks. 

So if I already put in my 2-week notice, why am I writing here? Today my uncle took me to get coffee and wanted me to explain why I wanted to leave. I explained the best I could without burning and bridges. He said that this would be a huge wasted opportunity. If I stick this out I could have building a business from the ground up on my resume, if I leave I can’t even have this job on my resume. He has given me until tomorrow morning to reconsider. He hasn’t told anyone else yet. I think it’s important to note that he dis say that there will it be any hard feelings between us and we can keep our relationship as family, which is important to me. 

Tl;dr- I’m miserable at my job. The only reason I’ve stayed this long is that my uncle owns the business. He thinks that it’s a huge mistake if I leave, and I have until tomorrow to reconsider. Should I leave or stay?",23Apr2019,1

It's a high school relationship, but its not like she was my crush for two weeks and then we started dating, we have much longer history than that. I solved most of my issues thanks to her, realized many things and I am much happier than I ever was mostly due to her.

The thing is, being dependent on somebody to the point I cannot imagine my life without them is probably the scariest thing of all. I am afraid she might die or have something bad happen to her and I wouldnt be able to do anything about it is terrifying. I can get a panic attack if she's not responding for a longer period of time (I dont have to be in contact with her all the time and she's not exactly the best at responding, so if it's less than about 8 hours I am okay, if I know shes most likely sleeping its lomger) but if it's more I get really worried and like I said, I can gather so much anxiety it escalates in a full on panic attack. I never really cared about anyone in my life as I couldn't ever feel a lot of emotion. I wouldn't want any of those people to die, but I think I would get over it quickly, maybe too quickly.

I didn’t reply. She then texted me later that night “so you tell me to be more communicative and I am but then you flip out. Cool”

I am taking my phone calls in front of her now to calm her down. 

But this morning she texted me how she had a dream of me cheating on her with her friend that I was tutoring. Like idk anymore",23Apr2019,0
548,"So to put it concisely, I've attended college for 5 semesters pursuing a degree in Architectural Engineering, the first three semesters weren't so great, the last two I got A's and B's. I have earned 30 credit hours, and have a GPA of 1.86. I had to drop out due to financial reasons and not enjoying the major I had chosen. So I've had some months to myself and this is what I want to do next and is my plan for the next 4 yrs.   


So I do intend to go back to college, but not in 2019 instead I want to go back to college staring in Spring 2020. At the moment I want to get myself a Full-Time job, start earning money and saving up. I have the blessing of my parents and they have allowed me to stay with them during this process so a lot of the fees like shelter, food, travel aren't a burden on my head for the time being.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time period I want to do another thing as well, along with my job on the side I want start my own gaming blog and YouTube channel. The reason I want to do this is because the career I want to pursue is Video Game Journalism, in fact when I do go back to college that's the Major I want to pursue. I've been told that practice is very key to getting into the video game journalism industry and I think this will be a way for me to improve my writing skills to work in that industry. After I start my gaming blog and YouTube channel I do intend to after some months start to freelance and pitch feature article ideas to publications to gain more practice and experience. This is a way to start gaining experience and grow my portfolio for this career choice.

&amp;#x200B;

So its now nearing the end of 2019, I am interested in going back to college, but I don't want to go back to my 4yr college just yet. I intend to go to a local community college of mine to pursue an associates of arts in general studies with a suggested transfer pathway for English majors. This will allow me to attain many of the remaining core classes I need and also includes courses that the Journalism course plan has at the 4yr university I want to go to. I did some calculating and if do a spring, summer, and fall semester throughout 2020 at this community college I will be able to get the associates degree and be ready to transfer to the four year college.

&amp;#x200B;

So now from 2021 - 2022 I intend to go to a 4yr college and pursue a BA in Journalism, and the concentration I will be going into is ""Digital and Print Journalism."" I feel like this concentration will be the right fit for the career I want to go into. I did my calculations and I should be able to finish this program by the end of 2022 and if not then by the end of Spring Semester 2023.    


During this time when I go to both the colleges I intend to continue to have my job but instead of it being full time, I make it part time, and I also intend to continue my gaming blog and YouTube channel. My intended 4yr college also has internship opportunities for my major and I intend to take advantage of this that way I have more experience for my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

After I graduate I intend to start working in the video game journalism industry, and start to finally be in a place in life I will be happy about. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what are your thoughts? Anything you would change about this? Please give me the feedback, that way I can go through this process in the most efficient manner possible.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I really appreciate it! :D",23Apr2019,1
549,"Hey guys, so I have been in a long distance relationship with a guy, I am deeply in love with him, it almost feels like my heart is going to burst, its the only reason I decided to be in a long distance relationship. Yesterday, we started talking about something that happened in the past. We went travelling together, we were friends with benefits at the time. We decided to go and see a mutual friend. All day he made me feel like a third wheel, wouldn’t a knowledge me, he would walk next to her etc. Then that night after drinks, he asks me if I wanted to have a threesome and so I said no. We go to the club (it’s only us three) and they start dancing and making out or whatever, leaving me alone in a country I don’t know. I was hurt but at that point I wasn’t angry about it. He then comes back to me and tries to kiss me (still in the same club) so I kindly refuse and act normal, but at this point Im starting to get angry like are you seriously trying to kiss me after you JUST kissed another girl. We go back home, to make sure the girl understands that I have no problem with her, because she didn’t do anything wrong, I invite her up to our airbnb. I go to the kitchen and AGAIN they’re both there making out, I apologise for interrupting and leave. She later leaves the house, and then he tries to sleep with me and at that point I burst out and we get into a fight. We have been best friends for a long time and so he explains how he does this whenever he has feelings for someone because he freaks out, I trusted that he is a good person, and decided to forgive him. I still get flashbacks about that day, and thinking about it genuinely hurts. 

Yesterday we started talking about it again, and I completely broke down. From this story to my mental health issues to my upcoming exams, I was in shambles. I kept apologising to him that this is an issue when it shouldn’t be, like technically he didn’t do anything wrong as we weren’t dating, and I have a bad habit of apologising for my emotions. He kept saying that I shouldn’t make excuses for what he has done, and he said it makes him feel like shit, which made me feel horrible because I don’t want him to ever feel any negative emotion because of me. Anyways, he wouldn’t let me go to bed because I was sad and he didn’t want to leave me alone, but every time I would want to say something he would say come on sleep, go to bed, I have to wake up early tomorrow. He said he didn’t mean it like that (today) but anyways I muted the phone and I started talking to him (It was that bad). I felt sooo alone, and I just didn’t know what to do. We hang up, and today he says that he’s not like the other guys Ive dated, and when I think the worse of him, it hurts, which I totally understand but it just makes me feel like he doesn’t understand the intensity of yesterday’s breakdown. We barely talked today, and he haven’t even asked me how Im feeling. I apologised in the morning for the state I was in yesterday and he didn’t even reassure me that its okay to be a mess sometimes. 

I don’t know if I have unrealistic expectations of how people should treat other people, but I would have handled the situation way differently, and I wouldn’t have tried to make it about me. Even if I hated you, I would still check up and ask if you’re okay. I have been crying all day, and I just need someone to be there for me unconditionally, and I just can’t seem to find people that are willing to that for me. 

I know I should talk to him, and I will but right now I just can’t find the emotional strength to do that, and I need an outsiders advice. 

Any Advice?",23Apr2019,1

My friend had checked in for an examination and they kept him for a few days. While there before anything really happened they made him ""voluntarily"" take medications and said they probably wouldn't let him out if he didn't take them. They even tried to give him nicotine patches. 

There also wasnt really anyway to reach him. When I called the number he called from they sent me in circles which ended with me leaving a message and being told they'd give it to him.

552,"So there's this girl I like that I found on the internet. She's pretty famous and many people look up to her. Add the fact that she is also a weeb and pretty much gender-neutral, focusing on the masculine side. Although, one thing is certain that she never wants to show her face.

She's a hardcore kind of woman, having gone through sexual and physical torture to the point where her mind is above average. She even has split personalities, and there are many things that she's keeping secret from.

Now I know I should just not do anything at this point but I can't help it. I'm not gonna just accept and do nothing. I wanna help her have someone to trust. Because she said that she can't look for one.

I also have an amazing girlfriend who loves me and cares for me, and a loving and caring family, but even while having all that ive never really felt happy. The most i felt was relief, although ive had my happy moments, my life is pretty much just composed of sadness, all i can think about is negative things. Im very emotional about this because it hasnt always been like this for me, i used to be happy back when i wasnt doing as good, I talk to many people about this and almost all of them blame my personality, sometimes i question if its always gonna be like this, if itll better.

554,"Hi, I (M, 21) really like my best friend (F, 21). I don't want to get engaged with her (although I wouldn't mind if it happened), it's more like a brother-sister love, except that she's not my sister.

We've known each other for 5-6 years and talk about everything, from daily things to family problems.

She's been sexually active since a young age (like 14), had multiple relations, and had sex even out of relationship, just for the pleasure. Like she could do it with someone she knew 2 weeks ago if it is a cool guy.

On the other hand, I'm a virgin. Never slept with a girl. Had only one gf but it was a long distance relationship, so things were ""complicated"".

She knows my situation, but never done anything for this (and I'm not saying she has to).

I remember one time, when she was looking (kinda desperately) for someone to sleep with, I offered to, but she said that she couldn't, that she's afraid that things could change between us, and that she could never do it with me. I felt like shit.

I'm not good at aproaching girls, have no idea how to act when something sexually explicit begins and a disaster at picking hints.

Yes, I would like to sleep with her, and i'm kinda conviced that if the situation would allow it she'd do it, but I'm also afraid that it's my immagination.

Now, towards end of our first year of living together, she hates me and I don’t know what I did. She’s very religious and I’m not. She can be moody but I try to be patient with her. She can also be very negetive but I think that’s her anxiety so I try to understand as I have anxiety too. Anyways, I told her she’s being rude to our suitmates (from China) and she’s treating them as less than. Which she does. She only texts them to talk even though they speak English, she talks about them behind their back, she doesn’t even look at them. I’ve had to apologize on multiple occasions to them for her rude behavior which embarrassed me so bad. I feel like I’m her mother. I know I’m not the easiest to live with and I admit it. I have anxiety, I snore sometimes, and I don’t tolerate bullshit usually unless I just have to. She then told me last minute that she’s leaving the school which put me unable to get good roommates or even housing. I was very mad that she waited until the last minute to tell me she was leaving. She told me that it’s not her fault I didn’t get housing and she’s told me since the beginning she’s not staying. Which is a lie. Both her and her parents spoke to me that she’s staying. Her two faced personality has me reeling. I can’t tell if I’m the issue or I’m being manipulated into thinking that.

Brief overview of my application (please let me know if I left anything important out):
- overall GPA around 3.4 and perquisite GPA above 3.0
- Over 100 PT observation hours at inpatient and outpatient locations 
- GRE scores: 4-written, 148 quantitative, 147 verbal (I would have to retake for reapplication, this score is only valid for 2 years)
- July will be 2 years of work experience (in physician clinic with 2 surgeons, outreach to a local high school to cover practices and games, and administrator/instructor for an educational class about arthritis)

566,"I (20/f) am an introverted person. The majority of my few friends are introverts as well. 

Yet I seem to be the only one who struggles so incredibly much with connecting with other people. It's very hard for me to form a friendship even though I show a lot of openness and am genuinely friendly to everyone in my environment, doing favours, listening and helping out wherever I can.

I'm always super happy when I meet someone who seems to enjoy a conversation with me and we kind of seem to have a connection. Well, only seem. Because almost always, the connection fades away after some time because it just wasn't deep or imporant enough. 

My friends, even the introverted ones, don't seem to have this problem because they relatively often find people who are interested in them on a long term basis, they are still in contact with people they met months and years ago while I often only get a ""hi"" from the person I had a long conversation with yesterday. If I got to talk to anyone that is.

It happened more than once that I introduced someone new to a friend and they get more closer to the new person than I did and it kind of felt like some sort of betrayal, although it's not obviously.

I'm still happy about all the connections and friendships I have made, even though it's only a handful. 

And of course I don't want my friends to stop to get close to other people. It's nothing I have and want control over. 

I just want to find a way to deal with this feeling because it makes me feel sad and sometimes triggers depressive episodes, like I'm the one responsible for failed platonic relationships, like I'm never interesting enough to keep as a friend or simply contact. I don't think there is much I can change because relationships in general require both parties to be interested in each other, so I don't really know what to do or what to change.",23Apr2019,1
568,"Hi guys, I had a super scary moment today.  After waking up this morning while I was brushing my teeth, my ears started ringing and I felt (nauseous maybe?). All of a sudden, black blurry spots clouded my vision and I could not see at all for a full minute, full loss of vision with occasional light spots poking through.  I was terrified and immediately started panicking. I managed to calm myself down, find a way to splash water on my face, and as my vision returned (as I calmed) I laid down in my bed and it returned entirely, and the ringing stopped.

Relevant info-

\- I am a 29 year old, healthy woman

\- While I occasionally struggle with vertigo, it's usually managed with sleep, water, and listening to my body

\- I did drink some alcohol last night, but also drank water and drinking is not out of the norm for me

\- I am under an extreme amount of pressure at work - both with my current job and awaiting word on two possible second interviews for other companies, both of which are huge opportunities 

\- My personal life just took a big hit, as last week my boyfriend left me for his 22 yr old ex girlfriend. Needless to say I am carrying around a lot more anger than usual

I really, REALLY don't have time for this to be an issue, not to mention I can't afford to wrack up $1-2k in medical bills right now. I feel like it's stress related - but of course this is now causing me more stress. Should I just continue taking care of myself, or do I need to see a doctor?

569,"**Context:** My wife's father died this past Fall and his wife (her stepmother) is alone and in fair/middling health.  He and his wife had a relatively symbiotic relationship: Her memory was bad (likely early onset alzheimer's--she refused/es to be evaluated), and his body was bad (congestive heart failure and end stage renal disease). They made it work (he was the brain/memory and she was the body).

He had been a hoarder and we've spent the better part of the winter removing ~40 cubic meters of debris/trash from their home.  Now, my wife's stepmother has broken her hip.  With her poor memory, her meds/schedule are a constant concern.  She collects cats (3-5 indoor/outdoor cats) and feeds 10+ ferals from the neighborhood (that have destroyed the insulation in the crawlspace under the house).  She's comfortable in her small town (it's familiar), and won't consider a move. It's a small enough town not to have a suitable apartment complex. 

Most of our energy has gone into making the house as sanitary and livable as possible for her (cleaning, painting, repairs).  We set up as many bills for auto-pay as possible.  We do her weekly meds with her each weekend (We both work and can only make the ~90mile drive on weekends).  We're starting to get a handle on things..


**Request for Advice:** Suffice to say my wife is pretty stressed out by all of this.  She's been going to a counselor for a month and was given an ""assignment"" to identify some [""SMART Goals""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) for herself.  She asked me to help her in this, so I've suggested things like a weekly lunch date and dog walks after work--small stuff that can be cathartic and low impact.  She's an digital/graphic artist by training, so I even thought that maybe suggesting she take a summer class in another medium could be good.

I was 14 when I went out with this girl for about 9 months but I was always insecure about my looks then because I wasn’t the besttttt looking guy out there but she didn’t think the same way that I did luckily. However, when we broke up I was still suspicious about the reason why and if she had lied. 

Anyway, fast forward to about 2 months ago. During that one year period I had a big ass glow up (finally). I grew to 6’4 and just had a general facial glow up. However, so did my ex and I know as I still followed her. One day about two months ago, we started talking again because I asked her if she wanted to be friends (yes, I know the saying exes can’t be friends, but I tried anyway). 

This is when it started... We talked probably once every couple days but then conversations got more frequent to the point we talked with eachother over text every day without fail. One day, about a month later, we met and just walked around the park but then we were hungry so we went back to hers to get delivery. 

This is when the glow ups we both had come into play. By this time, you should probably know that when we were with eachother we were quite clearly getting feelings for one another. When I mentioned her glow up, she mentioned mine and said “I’m surprised you aren’t with someone because you are every girls type” and this got me feeling some sorta way because I never used to get those comments. Next thing you know we are making out while she is on top of me😂😂😂. 

Ever since that day we still feel the same way and talk the same way but it just eats at me that I went back with my ex. She is not a bad person at all but my friend said that exes are exes for a reason. So my question is... was this a mistake?

578,"There is a guy that I have known for a while that I am interested in having casual sex with. He is significantly older than me (I'm 24 and he's 45), but we get along really well. I consider him to be a good friend. Basically, I am moving out of state at the end of May, and so any chance that we might have in having casual sex is getting smaller and smaller as each day goes by. 


Should I be up front and direct with him and tell him what I want? To all of the guys out there that are attracted to women, I have heard that hetero men find it a turn off when women bluntly tell them that they want no-strings attached sex (that it takes away from the ""challenge"" and ""chase"" and makes them feel emasculated). Is this true?



The above might just be my own misunderstanding of men, but I will go into the situation a little further: 



He told me that he recently broke up with someone last week and confided in me about the break up. Although he seems pretty bummed out about it, he told me that he thought he wasn't super cut out for relationships and was considering just having casual sex with women for the time being. I told him that I had recently broke off a casual thing with a guy because the guy had wanted to get more serious and exclusive (not what I'm looking for). This basically turned into a conversation about how neither of us wanted to be in anything more serious than a sexual relationship. The conversation drifted elsewhere after that, but after a while he asked me when he would see me later that week, because he wanted to show me some writing that he had done. 



We haven't settled on when that will happen, but I am a bit at a loss on where to go from here. He has hinted in the past that he finds me attractive, and so there is a part of me that thinks he would be interested in having sex while maintaining our amiability. However, I used to be one of his students as a undergraduate, and he has always been conscientious of not coming across as a creepy, flirty professor to his female students. BUT, the person that he broke things off with recently was also a former student, and so I don't believe that he is completely against having a sexual relationship with someone who he used to teach. 



Basically it comes down to this: 



I'm worried that if I make my intentions to him clear, then it will come across as desperate or pathetic (not to mention that he has a strong advisory role in terms of my career and is the main person that I ask to write me letters of recommendation, so I definitely do not wan to burn that bridge and make him uncomfortable). But I also feel that he have transcended the student-professor relationship already (I haven't officially been his student for a year). He will certainly not be the first one to make a move unless I make it VERY obvious to him that I am interested in him. I will definitely regret it if nothing happens. 



Thoughts? 


Should I tell him or no? If I do tell him, HOW???

580,"In my school art class I have two people I am pretty good friends with. We share the same interests, and we all have fun talking in class. However for the past month they’ve talked to me less and less. I didn’t do anything to offend them or otherwise be rude, and we didn’t have a fight or anything. I’m okay having to make more of an effort in this friendship, but they’re barely even talking to me. When I do try to talk in their conversations, they change topics or stop talking altogether. They won’t even walk with me to our next class, which are right next to each other. I don’t what I did wrong. I’ve always been nice, and I even made them homemade pins from their favorite games for the holidays, even though they forgot to get me anything. I’ve also always tried to help if they’re having trouble with homework or having a bad day. Now though, they’re always canceling plans with me, and I even found out last weekend they went out with a bunch of other people without even inviting me. Should I keep making an effort, or give up? Also, since we sit at the same table, if I do give up what should I do instead? I don’t want to just sit at the table in silence while they have fun talking and ignoring me. Sorry if this is super long. 

Summary: Should I give up on friends in my class if I’m making all the effort in our friendship? If I should give up, how should I handle being at the same table with them because I don’t just want to be lonely for the rest of the year.",23Apr2019,1

583,"You might think I’m crazy. I guess I am a little on the crazy side, but this, I know is not me being crazy. I’ve been able to do this weird thing since I was little, but didn’t know what I was doing. Basically, I would sort of ‘tense’ my leg muscles without actually tensing them. It felt tingly and weird, and I would do it sort of often, but I didn’t think it had a purpose. 


Now I’ve had plenty of weird phases in life, like one phase where I thought I was a cat turned into a human (this was when I was little btw). Another phase where I thought I could control the weather (once again, I was young and dumb). I know those weren’t actually happening to me, but this thing that’s happening right now, I’m not sure if it’s fake this time. 


Now that weird tingling sensation I can create in my legs? That’s about to come into play. So I was afraid of severe weather. Absolutely terrified of it, When the clouds got dark and it started to thunder, my heart pounded almost as loud as the thunder. Now, it’s gotten better over the years, I’m only scared when the weather gets real bad or I’m outside in a thunderstorm. But back then, I was terrified, even of the rain. I wanted to find a way to make the weather calm down. I looked up simple spells to make it stop raining, and I practiced them, desperate to make the storms end. 


Eventually, I don’t know how I got the idea in my head to do this, but I started making my legs feel weird again while thinking real hard of the weather calming down, and it usually did just that. I’m pretty sure all of that was just a coincidence, but the discovery I made after that, I’m almost 100% sure it wasn’t.


So this time I was sitting in class, staring out the window like a bored preteen when I saw some birds on a power line. Once again, I don’t know where this idea came from, but I decided to get them to fly off the power line. Not by scaring them, but by controlling their mind, I guess. So, I did that whole tingly leg sensation, and thought real hard about one of them flying off the line while keeping my eyes on them. Eventually, it flew off. I did the same thing with the other birds, one by one, and they each flew off when I told them to.


I’ve used this ability quite a bit since then. I’ve made insects move in certain directions, I’ve made ants communicate with each other brushing their antennas. I’ve even used this ability to make insects crawl onto my hand when I laid it in front of them them, even flying insects.


I think I know what I’m doing when I use my abilities. I think I might have a special muscle/vein in my leg (possibly) where I get my abilities from. I draw some special energy from my legs and then look at an insect, thinking about what I want it to do, and wring my powers out through my brain, pushing it into the insects brain and making it do what I want it to do.


The only problem with my abilities, is that they’re very weak. I have periods where I can use my ability comfortably, and then after a while, it feels uncomfortable, like I’m straining to get the energy from my legs, like there’s barely any in there. Then I have to wait a while for it to come back.


I’ve tried to look up special abilities on a few subreddits, including this subreddit, to see if anyone else has this happening to them, but to no avail. I don’t know if what I’m experiencing is just that rare, or if everyone with special abilities is just hiding really well. I only know two people possibly experiencing this. I will not be going into detail about who they are, but I will say they are very close friends. 


One friend says they have the ability to read minds, but it’s very weak. They also say that recently they’ve discovered a new ability, which is controlling the volume of certain things, like music. I’m not sure if this is real, what they say they have, but I’m really hoping it is.


Another friend of mine had this ability where they could tell how good someone is in bed and their penis size, just by looking at them. They were correct about it 100% of the time. Then their ability evolved into something quite disturbing. They’d look at a missing kids poster, and they’d know if the kid was alive or not, and what happened to them. My friend couldn’t do anything to help them though. But they wanted to. Desperately.


I also have something else going on. I get a lot of deja vu. Even deja vu of deja vu. And, sometimes, I predict something before it happens. Like, it just pops into my head. One time I was sitting at recess at school, feeling kinda tired so I had my knees up to my chest, face buried in my knees. Suddenly something flashed in my head. My teacher walking up to me. Just moments after that, it happened. There are a few other instances of it that are less important.


I don’t know what’s going on here. This is all so confusing. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to strengthen my abilities. I don’t know if there’s anyone else beside me and two other people experiencing this. Not many people know about this. One of the two close friends knows about this, a family I met at a music festival know about this. An online friend knows about this. I think that’s about it, though. 


Is there anyone else out there experiencing something like this? If so, comment here saying so, and explaining what your ability is. If you feel comfortable. And does anybody have any tips for me to possibly strengthen my abilities? Btw I’m on the spectrum. I was diagnosed when I was seven. Not sure what use that info could be but it might be helpful.",23Apr2019,0
584,"I've been seeing this woman for almost two months. We get along really well, I love spending time with her, common interests, great romantic life, the whole nine yards. But there's one problem - she's extremely loud in public. I'm a pretty passionate person myself, but she's practically shouting whenever we're talking at restaurants, and it makes me withdraw into a bit of a shell out of embarrassment. She's noticed I've been embarrassed a few times when the conversation turns to more, uh, sensitive topics, and she just laughs it off by saying that she's an extrovert. It's getting to the point where I'm a little nervous every time we go to a restaurant, especially if it's on the quiet side, because I know we're going to get some looks from other patrons and they're going to hear at least half of our entire conversation in detail.

&amp;#x200B;

I've considered talking to her about it, but how do you ask someone to make a lifestyle change like this, especially after a relatively short amount of time together? I don't want to embarrass her by putting her on the spot in the moment, and I don't want her to think it's a huge problem that I'm dwelling on by talking to her about it when we're at home.

586,"I am a 15 year old girl, dating a 15 year old girl. I'm gay, she is bisexual. We've been dating for 1 and half year, and are really happy together. I'm am not yet out, but she is to her step mom and biological dad, her dad already didn't like me because I'm gay and overzealous, irrational and r****** (not a huge fan of that word). 
Her step mother thinks my mental illness is fake, and I do it for attention. 
I am diagnosed severe depression, severe anxiety and extreme stress disorder. I am not talking to a therapist or taking any medication due to my mother. However when I told her this (mental illness came up in a conversation) she seemed disgusted. I didn't think much of it and moved on. 

Fast forward a few months ago, around late February, early March. I had come over and helped set up for her dad's birthday party. We had gotten those little confetti popper guns, and gf, gf younger brother (13), and myself were messing around and shooting them. Now, we all make alot of dark jokes, it's normal for us when we are together. So I made a joke about shooting my self with the confetti gun, and going out like the Joker from DC stuff. It was a dumb joke and reminded me of him, so that how that happened. 
I understand that suicide jokes aren't the greatest thing to make, but it didn't seem like a big deal then.
Mid March rolls around, and GF is texting me super upset, I call her down and we talk over a call. She explains that her mother believes I'm abusive, controlling, manipulative, brainwashing and breaking down GFs common Sense, and self esteem. We talked about it, and she says she argued with her step mom, because I'm not abusive. I've never laid a hand on her, never scared her (other than harmless pranks, of course) never made her feel like she couldn't say no to me or not do something because if me. Her step mom claims I'm pulling her away from family, though the thing is, I'm always telling her to be with her family before me. My family and I aren't close, so I would never want to ruin a family bond like that. So I'm just confused and a bit distraught over this. 
Finally, this simmers down, but I'm scared. I'm terrified to be around this women, and this part of the family. I'm scared to even talk towards them. I don't know what I'm supposed to do about this, or how I'm supposed to react. 

So my question is, how do I proceed with this? I love her, and I know her family is of course a big thing., But I'm scared of that half of her family! Now she wants me to go there and talk with her step mom, but I don't think I can. I think I'd make everything worse, have a panic attack or probably both.

588,"So if you weren't aware, the Pixel 3 was released last year and my girlfriend and I bought new phones. I was able to find the terms of the promo here if you want them:

https://slickdeals.net/f/12115906-799-fi-credit-when-you-buy-2-pixel-3-3xl

TL;DR is that you essentially got service credit to the tune of $799 for buying two phones and activating them.

Now my girlfriend is the main account holder and I switched to Fi  in November to take advantage of this because I was getting a new phone anyway. Fi ended up adding $799 in service credit for both of us on the account. Giving us a total of $1600 in credit. 

We did not think this was correct and my girlfriend contacted them in December to ask about it. She was informed that it was indeed correct that both of us get a $799 credit for the promo. Awesome, we didn't expect that! Fast forward to the last couple of months and they took away my remaining credit of ~$630 without telling us. It has not been reinstated as we requested, even with the proof (screenshots) that she sent them indicating we were told it was correctly applied initially. They have informed us that they will not be reinstating the credit and offered a $10 service credit in place of this.

I am unsure how to proceed with this. Do we have any ground to stand on here? I know it was probably a mistake initially when they applied both credits but then a month later their service team wrote in a chat message that it was set up correctly so at this point I think it's on them. We did our diligence to inform them and allow them to fix it in December but they didn't.

Is there anything we can do on this or do we just say it was nice while it lasted? They haven't so far requested that we pay back the portion of my credit used if that's helpful. 

I'm just not sure where to go from here",23Apr2019,1
589,"I’ve known this girl for about a year now. When we first met I was going through a party phase and would party with her almost every night. Now, I’m definitely not that kind of person and tend to lay low. However, she still parties often. Which is whatever. I don’t mind that. 

This is kinda lengthy so there is a TL;DR at the bottom for y’all. 

But now that we don’t hangout like that, I’ve come to realize that she’s actually an awful person. When I invite her to lunch she shows up on Xanax and orders several glasses of wine and doesn’t stop talking about herself. She doesn’t listen to me or asks me how my day is,  it’s all about her and her life. Which...I guess is fine. I don’t know. 

She isn’t mean to me directly, but she tells me shit about every single person she knows, so I think it’s safe to assume she talks shit about me behind my back. Which like I said, whatever!!! I don’t care what others think of me, but I don’t want to be friends with someone who talks that way. 

She really doesn’t have any friends and at first I felt bad for her but now I’m staring to realize why. She’s a hot mess who’s self centered and gossips constantly. 

We’ve had a few arguments over these things. They never really get resolved maybe because I just forgive and forget and I’m not one to hold grudges. Maybe it’s because she will send me like 8 texts about how I’m a terrible person and why she has done nothing wrong (I don’t have time to read her texts and argue back. It’s worthless) She complains that other people say she has a drug problem and while I want to chime in and say that maybe she does...she also tells me how she hates when people try to give her advice. So I just keep my mouth shut. 

I just really think I’ve grown out of being friends with her, but she’s still asking me to hang out and go to dinner or something but I know that if we do meet up she’s either somehow intoxicated and/or talking shit the entire time. 

Now she’s asking me to go out to dinner with her tonight, and I really don’t know how to say NO. Lately I’ve just been making up excuses so she thinks that I’m truly just busy and it has nothing to do with her but I really just want to distance myself from her and move on with my life!!! What should I do, make some excuse again, tell her I don’t like her, just not respond? I don’t know. 

TL;DR: I’ve realized how awful this girl I’m friends with is. She’s selfish, she gossips, and she’s never sober. I just don’t want her in my life anymore, plain and simple. How do I go about distancing myself from her? Forever make up excuses as to why I can’t hangout? Tell her I’ve grown out of being her friend? Ghost her?",23Apr2019,2

The advice was ""Before going back to your ex, use at least a weekend to think about what caused the relationship to break up the last time, and what are the chances of that happening again""

Well, I fucked up. Because she is furious, says that I insulted her and made her feel stupid.

I am not even sure what has happened that made her so furious, my theory is that she did not think the whole ""going back for an ex"" thing thorough and now she is afraid that it'll break up again, or that she feels stupid because she didn't think it through and that is (apparently) my fault.

602,"After having to move from my apartment due to an abusive relationship I started sharing a house with a “friend” I had for about 10 years. Shortly after moving in she allowed 2 of her co workers to also move in, no big deal I said that was fine, it brought down my part of the rent. The 2 co workers were a young gay couple fresh out of high school. Things were ok for a couple weeks. After some time she regularly had a bunch of friends over who were all very loud and completely disrespectful to the fact she wasn’t the only one living there. One day apparently she told her current fuck boy it was ok to move into our basement. I was not informed of this at all. I come home to find a bunch of people I don’t know in my home in the basement moving the things I has stored down there out of there way. (They moved my things to a room that eventually got really wet and everything that was down there was ruined). After having to yell at them to leave because my roommate wasn’t even home. I went down to see what they had done. It looked like they were trying to make a stupid recording studio down there. But I also found a backpack. It was in my home so I went threw it knowing these guys were up to no good. In it I found an assortment of drugs and baggies and a scale. So I threw his bag into a pool of water and left that there. Pissed that these people had no problem bringing and leaving heavy amounts of drugs into my home. I told her about this and she didn’t care. More then likely because she was joining in on the fun.

They continue to refuse and are arguing with me at this point. I’m surrounded by about 5 Spanish guys I don’t know, at this point they’re yelling at me because I’m telling them to leave. I call my roommate and ask her to tell them to leave. She then informed me that this guys apparently moving in. I currently have her on the phone as they’re yelling at me. One of the boys that lives with us came down to see what all the yelling was about. Her fuck boy gets in this poor kids face and says you’re a faggot I’m moving in here because there needs to be a man in this house. And various other things. She herd all this on the phone and still said she didn’t care this guys moving in. So I said fine fuck this I’m moving out. I got my shit and moved out within the week. Also contacted the landlord and told him the situation and was told it was not and issue to move out early due to the situation. She dodge me lied to me and eventually changed her phone number because I wanted my deposit back since she now has 3 other deposits from other people. Her mother lied about the deposit saying I never gave it to her. She’s not worth my time for court so I’ll take that as a lesson learned. Am I wrong for moving out suddenly and leaving her to pay the last 4 months of the lease without me? Am I wrong for cleaning the toilets with there tooth brushes? Am I wrong for pissing in there face wash? Am I wrong for taking a shit on there porch? Am I wrong for rubbing raw meat all over there drug scales? I’m fuckin pissed.",23Apr2019,1

Being a friend, I just tell her I enjoy reading them. She claims to want honesty so I went that route this time. I told her it was too jumbled, no rhythm to the poem, and it wasn't her best. She exploded and said, ""I need to get new friends anyway."" I just shrugged and replied, ""Have fun searching. Take care.""

I have yet to have any friends (although most people don’t believe it, it’s true), and feel like I missed out on all of the Highschool events, clubs, and fun. I have the opportunity to go to a public high school and finish my senior year if I work hard to get the credits, and even if I don’t I will have the opportunity to take AP classes and tests. However, I should be graduating this year at 18, and if I go I’ll be 19, turning 20 a couple months after the school year ends. Is that too old for high school? Can I make up for some of the things I missed out on? Is it common to be 19 and still in HS? Thanks in advance.

Today I asked her whether it is okay if I go out for boardgames the evening before the day I promised to help, and sleep at the person who is hosting (we live too far away to come back at night). She got angry, saying that I always let her down and that I never help her. She ended it with ""Do what you want!"".

607,"Hi, I'll go into the full story and then the text I want to send to my friend. 

We had been friends for about a year and a half were thinking of moving in together next school year and it was going great. I have anxiety and depression and just started taking more medication for it. 

One night we were going out and I didnt mean to take it but my alarm went off at 8 and she was in the bathroom and I took it. I had drank on the medication before and blacked out but was fine, this was a bigger dosage though so I just hoped for the best cause there was nothing I could do. And then we went out I blacked out before leaving ended up in the drunk tank apparently fought 3 cops which is embarrassing cause I'm tiny and weak. My friend stopped talking to me I felt horrible I ended up suicidal and severely depressed it really affected my studies my work and literally my life. I have apologized multiple times but she never really responds. I understand that people deal with things differently and I tried to let her be and live her life, because I respect that and hope for the best for her. However even though I've gone through multiple counsellors i still am having major issues.

 I want to send a text asking to meet up and talk about this because honestly I'm a person who deals with things by talking and stuff, I understand she doesnt but I'm still occasionally suicidal about it and I just want to get out of this mind set. 

Do you think its appropriate for me to send a text?

610,"Neighborhood Dog: Floof (For privacy cuz u never know)

Background: I live in a quiet neighborhood, with shady trees and elderly neighbors. One night, my mom and I discovered a pretty chunky husky mix on our doorstep named Floof. Long story short, we fed her and now she visits a LOT (She went back to her owner after). 

The time I started worrying was when I had to walk out of the neighborhood. Another small thing about this neighborhood is that it is next to a busy road, and guess who came trotting up? Floof did. Not gonna lie, I love her but once I gave her a head pat, she started to follow me right up to the road. I actually had to yell at her to get away from there because I was so scared, especially since it isn't my dog. In the end, I had to legit ring the doorbell of a neighbor to ask them to hold her for me. 

Another separate story: I have an old cat that used to go outside. USED. The poor old man was outside when all of a sudden Floof appears. A little thing I didn't know about her was that she was a chaser, which was surprising because she is a big heckin chonk of a dog. I actually didn't know she came until my mom heard yowls coming from outside. Curious, I decided to follow her and found a bloody cat in a tree, with Floof near him.

The good news was Floof didn't attack him, but the bad news was his back leg got hurt bad due to the panic and had to be AMPUTATED (I have proof if anyone doesn't believe me of the leg). Of course, her owner and dog got off scot-free because my mom isn't the most confrontational person. Thankfully the cat is still alive and doing well (When you scratch him the nub shakes in happiness lol) but I am still concerned. 

My mom has recently tried involving the police, but of course they did nothing, so I'm taking this here. Floof is not vicious or anything, so I don't think it was her fault. For the most part I think the owner is because she is regularly sending her out into the neighborhood. I actually used to return her before eventually giving up and recently saw her not give a crap when my mom pointed out that Floof was sitting on the road. I need some advice, being a non-confrontational person too. I'm afraid of making people mad but also don't want the poor dog to be hit by a car. Any suggestions and questions are welcome as long as they are related!",23Apr2019,1

Overall I’m not great at making friends without other friends to introduce, and I’m nervous about feeling extremely lonely and falling into depression, as I hear many students do. I feel like I need to decide between a fun, easy, environment and one where I would likely do better academically and is better  financially, but I would only have one good friend going, and I’m not sure I would know what to do with myself.

I feel like a loser, I know what my Parents are going to say and you guys probably too. They always knew I wouldn't be able to pass and now I wasted all my life having nothing.

I find myself with less and less interest for one job in particular that the company already offered me the position for, I spoke with them this morning and asked for a few days to think it over (which the recruiter was short with me and sounded reluctant to do so but ultimately agreed to) and not even an hour after hanging up with them is when I received that second job offer (since I still have one interview left I did ask the second company for a few days to think about it and they were more than willing to let me deliberate).

624,"So my father still lives with me and my mom, yet I barely ever really talk to him. He isn’t very approachable and he naturally a very loud human so when he even slightly raises his voice he is basically yelling at you. He is also a very scary looking guy but he is pretty cool. We have very few things in common, we both like superheros and we talk about them sometimes. We watch the same shows like Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, and Legends of Tomorrow and others and we talk about them sometimes but other than that we have nothing in common. He is very artistic, I am not. I’m a techie and my dad was born and raised in the country, so naturally he isn’t interested in that stuff. I play video games a lot and he doesn’t really like it because I play video games instead of doing things outside, mostly because I have really bad allergies and in my eyes it’s not worth it. He is not very up to date with things like my mom is (my mom is kind of a meme lord). Also my dad is very limited because he is always hurting due to his very hard job (he does floors).

627,"Starting off with background info: I’ve been diagnosed with depression at an early age in my life (18 now but diagnosed at around 10 or so), generalized anxiety, and sometimes I feel like I’m on the spectrum. I’ve never really fit in anywhere, I found solace in being alone, yet I always strive to be more than I can. Another thing, I’m quite suicidal, never really done anything about it but it’s there. Just the fact I can end pain through death is chillingly alluring to me.
I’m everything but a sheltered child, even though I don’t fit in or socialize, I still have a group of friends that I talk to in-school but stay out of contact and at home when I’m out of school. I only ever go out for work, getting gas, or groceries. I’ve been drunk numerous times, high, etc. But I only really put my act together freshman year of high school when this girl from my homeroom actually seemed to show interest in me. Being the social outcast I was, i had planned to follow her around and “bump into her” throughout numerous different spots within school so I could get to know her better. I chickened out last minute and stuck to slowly getting to know her over four years through painfully slow but (at least in my opinion) meaningful chats that’ve always left me feeling happy.
Anyways, senior year (this year), my crush started opening up to me more, telling me about her life, her boyfriend (she’s been dating this guy for 2 years and there’s always a cyclical give and take, love-hate relationship thing going on between them)(he lives in Michigan which is more than a few states over from where I’m sending this).
Pretty soon, we discovered we had a lot of common interests, and i had more in common with her than her boyfriend. Exciting, but I made sure to keep my distance because I didn’t want to intrude, I wanted her to realize on her own that the love in that relationship was just recycled water.
Happily enough, our relationship has grown significantly over the past few months (she can’t drive so I drive her places), she told me she didn’t want me to feel like I was just being used but I laughed it off, saying i didn’t mind being her chauffeur.
Fast forward to last week, I felt something snap in her, she was fed up with her boyfriend, telling me she was planning on leaving him, so little things eventually add up I guess.
I’m happy as can be, telling her calmly that it’s ok, that she needs to think about what’s going to make her happy in the future and she started hanging out over at my house, even met with my family. There were confession messages and I love you’s (though looking back hers seemed forced, or spelled through slang (I wub u, &lt;3, stuff like that)).
So yesterday, we agreed to get some ice cream and play the new smash brothers game over at my house. She kept getting calls and texts from her boyfriend, aggressive texts, even calling her a whore telling her to “go ahead and f**k me”.
I stopped the game and wanted to know how she felt and she just said I don’t know, that’s her thing, which is adorable unless you need her to actually communicate.
Well, she wanted me to drive her home she was too upset I figured, but instead she had me pull over into a parking lot and climb in the backseat with her. Naturally, I did.
She rested her head on my lap, and I was in a state of bliss I’d never felt before, i stared at her, she stared at me. We talked about everything, we talked about nothing. Then she made the first move.
She was on a call but had my hand between her legs (yeah you know where this is going, yeah it went that far, a little further but not all the way).
She asked me if I wanted to go further, I had protection but I just wanted to know where she stood with her boyfriend before I actually showed her how much I loved her.
She even kissed me, but I restrained myself because I wanted to hear her have closure.

Nope, sudden mood shift, she says I kiss like a dead fish, and perhaps I do, but she said “I’ve made my decision based off this”
She started crying and asking me to drive her home, answering with a facade of cheerfulness rather than actually talking to me.
I drop her off at home, completely devastated that I had upset her, after all I just wanted her to be happy and be with me. She’s denied it being my fault, saying it’s all her fault. I didn’t want her to be upset so I just said it was only 40% her fault or something weird like that (get off my back i was taken aback by this all and didn’t want to let her take the fall).
She then said It was my own fault I couldn’t be with her because she doesn’t like being patient? I understood that but I didn’t want to start things without closure, and in the back of my car no less. 
Starting to be broken, I got mad and told her it was, in fact, her fault and that she didn’t give me any time to react to this all. She then made the point that it seemed to her that I didn’t actually love her because I wasn’t trying during the kisses.
She just continued pushing her point, driving that nail way too deep into the wood. I eventually just told her I was going to bed
I didn’t want to fight anymore, she meant everything to me, I seriously don’t have anything else, and she messaged all the girls who sorta liked me, pictures of us together. She even said she would say yes to going to prom with me if I asked her, I’ve never been to a school dance so I was far beyond ecstatic.
But now she’s getting back together with her boyfriend, saying that he’ll actually love her. Yet she “loves me too” and doesn’t want me to leave, wants me to be her best friend.

Bad things and worse people have an uncanny talent of walking into my life at just the right times to make me feel broken. I want to believe that she’s not a bad person, that I’m not just a stepping stone, but every time I talk to her now I just feel like I’m falling down a spiral staircase and she was the one who pushed me, locked eyes with me and everything.
Now she’s unhappy because I’m upset, she just asked me what was wrong right before I typed this life story, i just asked her why she wasn’t more clear with me about her relationship not truly having been ended. 

She just doesn’t know, and here I am, broken, contemplating painting my brains on the wall because I feel so barren.
I gave her my heart and my time and she threw them down those stairs with me. I feel used, I feel sick, I haven’t eaten since it happened.
I’m more worried about her going off, being with some other guy than I am about my own health I guess.
I’ve been hurt before, emotionally, more often physically. But I have NEVER felt this low in my entire life. I don’t know if I can carry on knowing she’s going to blame me for this, I don’t know how I can look her in the face and tell her everything is alright. I don’t know how to tell her that I want her the f**k out of my life even though I don’t actually mean it.
I wish I were dead, I don’t know what to do now, and I just feel so betrayed and lost.

I don’t want a pity party but I just need some advice, was I in the wrong? Should I have made a move on her? Because I don’t know if I should have or not, and I’m going to think that for the rest of my life, however long it may be.",23Apr2019,1

i thought i was getting okay at it.  
but no, yesterday i PRd and he 
said nothing to me, i guess all i 
am to everyone is just “&lt;SO&gt;’s 
girlfriend”. even though i’m not 
even a girl..

i don’t know how many times
i’ve asked my dad and stepmom 
to use the right pronouns. but 
no matter how much i correct 
them, they never do. i mentioned 
the name change thing to my 
dad and all he said was “well 
you’ll always be &lt;deadname&gt;  
to me”. i’m letting it slide for now, 
but once i go to college i really 
want to start having a backbone 
about being referred to properly, 
so i’m worried about then. god 
only knows how my grandparents 
will react. 

and then, to top it all off. after 
*2 damn years* of my birth control pills 
working flawlessly (minus the 
one time it was my fault/ i 
hadn’t been taking them), they 
messed up. and i don’t 
understand why. i started 
taking them at the same exact 
time every day since i started 
being sexually active, they should 
be working better now than 
ever.. yet here i am, body 
malfunctioning, hips in so much 
pain. 
what if the pills never work again? 
what if i’ll never go back to how

635,"Somebody for the love of all that is holy, help me please. This is a throwaway account, for obvious reasons. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost eight years. We've lived together for two. Lately, he has been lying to me. A. LOT. Not just about drinking, but we'll stick to one problem for now.

He has, what I consider, a drinking problem. On and off for our entire relationship, I've asked him to slow down on drinking. I have some major issues with drinking. When we first started dating, one of the first things I told him was I didn't drink, I'd never drink, and I have issues being with someone who drinks. He stopped drinking. I didn't ask him to, he made that choice himself. Eventually, he'd have a beer every now and then. It'd bother me, of course. Then, however, he became the guy that would have a few beers when he got home from work. Then he became the guy that would drink from the second he got home until he passed out from drinking too much. Then it was all weekend and right when he got home from work. I snapped because, like I said, he knew about the issues I struggle with. He made the choice at the beginning of our relationship to not drink, at least not around me. He decided to be the guy I wanted when we first started dating and once I was in love and it was too late to back out, he became this person.   


So this has been a cycle for the last few years. He will drink a bunch weekday/weekend, I'll ask him to only drink on the weekends. He started to drink on weekends only, but instead of a few, he downs as many as he can. Then I flip shit and say that's it's me or drinking. He got incredibly wasted at a family (his) get together drinking liquor in Feb. He treated me like shit, was acting like a complete douche, and was overall just drunk. It was so embarrassing. I left him there and cried all the way home.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to thirty minutes ago. I was putting some trash in the trash can outside  There's a beer can in the trash can. I call him (he's at work right now) and he says he must've picked it up from the ground and put it in there. He smelled like beer when he got home last night, but denied drinking. Okay, sure. I drop it. 

Then five minutes ago, I'm on my Kroger account. I saw some weird transactions and figured my little brother was using my alternate ID, so I kept scrolling through. Then I get to March and see there's a purchase containing vodka. I know it wasn't my brother because the entire purchase was cat food, cat litter, and vodka. This is a trip to the store I asked him to make. We have cats, my brother doesn't. He bought alcohol behind my back. So I keep scrolling and it happened earlier in the year too. He has straight lied to me. Like over the last few months, I'll ask if he's been drinking if he's acting weird or something. He always says no. So what the fuck.

636,"hello guys, nice to see y'all, how's it going everyone.

the thing is that, I'm 23, about to hit 24 this September, and i dont know how to move on...

I graduated from college last year and got my first full time job - a desk job - for 4 months, yes, only 4 months. i didn't realize how much I hate it until I got one. I just hate everything about it and wish myself would never go back again if nessary.

so I've switched to freelance since then, Ive got some projects to do, most are small projects.  It's been 4 months since then. At first I was excited cuz I could work at my home and still get paid. No boss, no pressure. (the paying is okay, no less and no more than my last job)

I still love freelance but now I'll be sitting in front of my computer and like ""that's it?"" I don't know why I still feel like missing something... 

""should I go out and fine a REAL job?"" - cuz not many people consider it as a REAL job.
""I'm almost 24,is it too young to do that?"" - gotta admit it's like staying in a comfort zone, it'd be suitable for 30+ old people I guess?

638,"**Back story**

* I'll call this friend **Albert** for privacy reasons. I'm currently in my last year in university and I befriended Albert during my freshman year in high school. I've never had many close friends before, but for Albert, he seemed like someone I really wanted to get close to. We have the same interests, but he dove more deeply into it than me and therefore came out to have more expertise in them and I sincerely envy that. I had so much respect for him, because given his complicated circumstances, he still tries his hardest to succeed. However, time and time again he tries to justify himself as ""not being a people person"". I've heard the saying ""not being a people person"" thrown around here and there but I'm not quite sure what that even means. Does it mean that he can't connect with people on a very basic level? on an emotional level? I'm assuming the latter because he makes friends just fine and hangs out regularly with them, but I never thought of going to him when I have an emotional issue and need someone to talk to. Something that has been hitting me in the back of my head is that even though I considered him a close friend, it didn't seem mutual for him because he wouldn't openly say it or ACT like it (but then I would think -- is this because of him being ""not a people person?""). This thought conflict happened when a few months ago, he came up to my city (we live in different cities -- around 2 hours apart) and we hung out. However, he was on his phone the whole time when we went out to eat. I asked him why don't you want to talk or hold some kind of conversation? His reason? Because it was routine. I was shocked. I didn't understand. Routine? I haven't seen him in more than a year. We barely hold conversations online (not like we used to during high school). How is any part of this, routine? This would be the starting point of when I started to feel iffy about whether or not this friendship is worthwhile. I would like to note: this friendship isn't a two-way street, it feels very much a one-way (for me), but he may disagree. Sure he reached out sometimes, but it seemed to be incredibly inconsistent and it would only have to be with some sort of co-existing reason. He primarily was going to go to a city next to mine because he ordered something and had to pick it up there. Then he realized that I was nearby and that we should hang out. But that was mainly it. The majority of the conversations we hold online would be initiated and carried through by me. It was to the point where whenever he would even bring up a topic to continue the conversation, I would be filled with glee.

**Problem**

* This was the breaking point for me. I was going to go over to his city to hang out with him. I made the plan ahead of time because I knew of his tight schedule and I specifically made sure to ask him to hang out on a date he said he usually wouldn't be busy and confirmed that he wouldn't be busy on that day. The day before I would drive down, I was trying to figure out what we should do so we were talking. He then proceeds to slyly insert that he was pretty much going to put a plan he made with his other friend **after mine.** I was furious. However, what made it burn more was that the plan he put ahead of mine? It was because this plan pertained to his interest more. I even asked him, which plan came ahead first. He would stall and stretch it out and he didn't even give a definite answer but the act of stalling told me all I needed to know. Now, I'm not sure what the opinion of the mass is on this subject (whether or not putting plans that were made ahead of time **behind** a plan that was made after it is okay), but for me, I didn't like it. What I saw it as, was him not respecting my efforts to plan with him to hang out purely because I wanted to hang out with him and in turn disrespect toward me. At this point, him ""not being a people person"" was far beyond my acceptance. It's conflicting because I would often think: am I being too sensitive toward this subject? Then I would think, no, I took a lot into consideration to ensure that the day of the hangout wouldn't be inconvenient for him, yet he still placed a plan he made after with someone else, ahead of ours. I told him it was very rude, and that I hope he knew what he did. Then I stopped talking as he very pathetically tries to re-ignite the conversation by asking me something totally irrelevant. Then the conversation dies.

**Needing advice here**

* So through a group chat that I'm in with him and another old friend, he mentions that he got accepted into the university I'm currently in (he's currently in community college trying to transfer to a 4 year university). It's so conflicting. In the past, I wished he would transfer to the university I'm in because we could hang out and I can show him around. We even talked about it here and there before. However, at our current standing, it's hard to. I would feel defeated if I had to initiate a conversation to patch up a friendship ruined by his hands. I have thought about the option of just talking to him and seeing if he felt regretful of anything or if I should just not. However, I have the mindset of: if someone can do something once and does do it, they can do it again. I'm not trying to get into a situation where I patch the friendship up but in the future, he does the same thing that destroys the friendship and chalks it up to ""not being a people person"". What I really believe he means by ""not being a people person"" is probably being just empty minded because he does come off more like that (I mean this genuinely rather than an insult toward him and he and a few other friends close to him than me confirmed it). What should I do?

639,"Hello. Me and my ex broke up three years ago on bad terms. Over the course of the last three years, he has made multiple posts about me which I have ignored. He has been careful not to use my name on them but he has a public account and all of his followers are people I know and people that know we dated. I have been ignoring his posts over the last few years.

HOWEVER, we made amends a few months ago. Then, suddenly without warning, he re-blocked me on everything and then made the worst post of them all. He called me abusive and manipulative and said that I abused him and put him down for two years. Unfortunately, again, he was careful not to use my name.

I have told him to take the posts down and in response he blocked me on everything. I am extremely upset, because in reality he was abusive to me. He sexually assaulted me. He threatened suicide when I told him I couldn't help him with all of his mental health problems.

I know there is probably nothing I can do except ignore him, but I am afraid he is going to continue to make these false posts about me, ruining my reputation with the countless people I know that follow him. I have asked our mutual friend to try to talk to him about it but he did not want to get involved.

I have already reported the posts and have gotten my friends to report them as well.

640,"There is this girl I have a huge crush on. We were friends 2 years ago when I worked at this donut shop. We were really close but not too close cause she had a boyfriend at the time. I wanted to let her know that I liked her and cared about her but not too much because I didn't want to look like a creep trying to hit on a girl in a long term relationship.  

Then when Comic Con rolled around she asked for my number and if I wanted to hang out with her but I lied and said yes even though I was working at Comic Con  (It was the only way I could get tickets) and there was no way I could commit. I didn't want to disappoint her and I was embarrassed to tell her that I couldn't get tickets and working as a vendor was the only way I could get in. She came to comic con with her BF (She never told me he was coming) and good call by her in hindsight. I kind felt like she was rubbing my face in it.

Then I quit my job at the place where we used to work and we kept in touch on and off til one day she stopped returning my calls/texts. Logic dictates she lost her phone and got a new one. But then she dropped me as a friend on PlayStation Network, And I tried to hit her up on Facebook and she denied my friend request. I didn't know what I did to make her ghost me. I never tried to go see her in person cause I wasn't at a good place in my life at the time. The new job I quit the old one for didn't pan out, I gained weight so I didn't look my best, so I was even more embarrassed to see her.

So Fast forward to now. She got a promotion, she apparently broke up with her BF, she is single now. I feel anxious to see her now that I'm doing better but....I don't know.

Sometimes he seems great. Really happy, affectionate, and the perfect person in the world to me. Other times he’s miserable, hates the world, and cannot imagine going on living. 

I’ve had to take his guns away before. Ive reported him to his therapist. I have a plan of action when he’s at his worst to contact her, 911, or take him to the emergency room. 

It’s gotten worse, and while our lives are great right now and continue to improve, his depression gets worse. How spells become more intense and last longer. They’re also more sporadic. 

I feel like I’m doing everything I can. When he tells me how he can’t imagine going on with a straight face, I break down... I can’t handle seeing him like this.

I am not a US residence and my English is so bad. So, please read with patience because i need some help guys. 

A man who is friend to my father from several years have to give money to us from the past 2 years. It's agriculture profit money. He didn't gave 2017 year profit money and 2018 year and he never visited our home in last 16 months! 2017 profit will come to hand in  2018 feb and 2018's profit in 2019. Whenever i call to him he tells lies everytime. He never says that he won't give money but he escapes everytime with lies. Whenever i go to his house he will be outside 90 percent of the time. My dad unable to do anything he urges for money on phone with that man but he everytime tell lies to my father. He talks to my father such a way like my father won't listen to me and my mom words. My dad trusts him so much. But i know sometimes i observed my father that he knows what type of person the man is, so my father thinks being still kindness to him he thinks this man will give money one day. 

This man is busy with some land issues like he has to sell it for money, so he only comes to his home at night time. I went alone to his home night time several times on walk like i have to go through a open graveyard to reach his home. There will be no street lights god! I so many times felt why us why? Why so many bad things to my family. 

My parents whole life ended with so many struggles so much of pain so many bad issues. My parents were so good charactered. So many family neighbors did bad things to my parents even before i was born. There is no single bad thing about my parents but my dad never listens to my mom when it comes to anything! Like he thinks we don't know anything as My mom was pretty much from a village she never went to school in her life like her dad thought it's not a good idea for girl to study outside in cities or anywhere because of bad men. Like old days guys. My mom born in 60's and i am a latecomer i born in 20's.

Since last year i took small responsibilities sometimes big one's too and i don't listen to my dad as it's just a waste of time. But i have to say before that and even now I never cared about my agricultural land like i don't know how to maintain and process things in agriculture. Also because my mind is so much like kid. I am just a very young adult. The thing is I fear responsibilities. But i do take responsibilities because i have to, but with a feary mindset i mean i can't do anything without nervousness. But whenever i see my mom crying i feel so bad like i am unable to do anything. But i try as much as possible and my mind is always filled with fear, anger and sadness even though i went to do what i has to do like this man has to give money to us and i took my parents shouted at them to listen me once for all and we all went to his home. But he's not there that day so i stopped taking my parents with me and i started to go lonely to his house even though my parents don't like, me visiting his home. 

There is only 2 or 4 days this man was actually there in his home and what happened those days were he tells everything that nothing was wrong with him. He acts like a good man. I shouted at him he said that he'll give money the next day but that didn't happened after that i met him in his house some other day but he tried to take things under his control by acting like a good guy. There were so many times i said to come to my home, we'll talk, but he escaped everytime to visit my home. Then some day i took him in my neighbor's bike without saying the reason and i took him to my home. My mom is so good women such that she cooked lunch for him and i got disgusted as hell seeing my mom doing that thing then i asked him what you did with our money. He told the truth he said he spent money on some house lands my parents talked every struggle with financial issues later then I dropped him home and i gently told him don't hurt us anymore especially my parents

After 2 months this year in 2019 he gave 2017's year 50percent of money in Feb month and its the same month he has to give last year 2018 money he said he will give the remaining 50 percent of 2017 year profit and also 2018 profit money the next day but he didn't gave. I Waited for days but he never came i thought going to his home will make things worse like he don't like me from the beginning like i am only the person that demads our money. This man gets angry everytime i ask. But he acts like a good guy. 

and this day i just felt so much anger and few hours back i went to his home again on walk, he's not there waited for hour i just came outside and i luckily seen him. I said to come to my home he said he will with in a 30min but i know he's lying. I talked every facts he did to us and he just went away with anger. After that i came home he called me he said he'll come tomorrow and talked again like a good man like he never did anything wrong.

649,"First of all if your reading this thank you, for even giving a shit. Sometimes it's just nice to be heard. 

I'm young I'm about to graduate high school. 2 years ago, I moved to a new school left an entire school of bullies(literally almost all of the school) behind and a small group of friends. Majority I dont talk to at all anymore. I did hang out with a large group for about a year and half from that old school. I never made friends at the new school besides one person.

This one person, was a girl. She hit on me, and we hung out weekly and talked alot. While she had a boyfriend. We got along amazing. Her boyfriend was controlling, and manipulative to her. But that doesnt make what she did right. But we were best friends for the longest time. And then one day I caught her talking to a bunch of other guys real hoe like and called her out and we weren't friends anymore after that. Then a 2 months pass and she comes up to me at school, and flirts with me and hooks me and right away we kicked off. She broke up with her boyfriend that same week and the next week we hooked up. And we've been on and off to this day. Shes never left me for another guy, and as far as I know she hasn't cheated on me as far as I know. Were together pretty frequently. 

Now, I put all my effort, money, stress into her and left everything behind my family, my friends. Everything. Now I smoke weed(Dab pens) daily, vape or smoke cigarillos daily( cant go without it), sometimes I go weeks without taking showers or brushing my teeth. I'm just always stressed out, I cant remember the last time I sat down and was able to just relax without a worry in the world. I lost all my friends they dotn want anything to do with me anymore cause I'm not the same anymore. My family, still cares about me but is always hurt that I'm never ever around. My parents are divorced I'll go months without going to my dad's, and sometimes I'll ignore his phone calls cause I'm too high to answer or I'm with her.

Idk what to do anymore, im on the brink with her shes pushed my limits and I'm pretty sure she doesnt wanna be with me anymore. I have no friend to go to. My family, isnt crazy supportive with that stuff my mom just says talk to your therapist bout it next time. I'm about to graduate, I lost all my friends,I'm about to lose this girl and I know it I just dotn trust her anymore, I have a very good job already in the trades and the only thing still in my life that I'm passionate about is my car and I cant do very much with my broke ass.

We didn’t really speak at all after that. He then unfollowed me on instagram which sadly enough made me so bitter and I unfollowed him back. Two months later he started following me again. I was done with him, I hated having that on/off contact waiting for him to text but he never would so I blocked him on snap and didn’t follow him back.

My family however immigrated and money has been a huge issue. My dad is a mentally unstable alcoholic and is forcing me to go to college. I understand he technically can't but the only reason I'm having doubts is because of the fact that he's an abusive asshole (called the cops on him many times from abusing my mom) and the one time i brought up me joining the army he snapped and went into a fit of rage.

I don't wanna leave my mother behind like that but part of me feels like I need to do what i feel like needs to be done.

I have only a month left before i graduate. Since my parents don't think of me as an adult with choices to make and instead as a bank who will support them in the future i planned on getting up and leaving in the middle of the night.

I'm content. I have everything I need I suppose, but it does get awfully lonely. What social interaction I do get comes from the internet and engaging with people on the internet, though I don't know if you can consider that ""social interaction"". I'm on good terms with my co-workers, but we're just co-workers. I don't hang out with any of them outside of work. I have very particular hobbies that I feel not many people around me are interested in, specifically anime. It's hard to find people in their 20's in my town that like anime. I don't bother with social networking because I don't know anyone.

I suppose I should be thankful I can come onto some websites like Reddit and at let discuss or interact with others, even if it's through a screen. I am worried that my social skills will keep deteriorating at this point. Even now I get some mild anxiety when I have to leave my apartment to go somewhere aside from work. I don't like being out in public or talking with strangers. It's not that I think they'll hurt me, but it's like part of me doesn't want to talk with anyone and yet I do. It's all quite confusing.

660,"My contract for a place I worked at over the past year or so asked me if I would be staying to work with them a few weeks back, and I original said yes. This is a part-time job for the summer and it wasn't ideal, but I didn't think I would have any other opportunities. I didn't sign a contract or anything, it was more or less just discussed. They also never clarified how many hours I would be working. 

I applied for a full-time position a month back and after an interview, I got an offer last week. Not only does this position offer more money, it's way more related to what I want to do with my future career, so I couldn't turn it down. However, I panicked and told my current employer that I couldn't keep working because I may have to return to my hometown for personal reasons. I think I was just scared about the confrontation. 

The old employer was very understanding when I told them, but now I'm very paranoid about running into them around the city I live in. I'm really angry at myself for lying, and I'm paranoid that they're somehow going to get in touch with the new employer (even though the two aren't really related at all, but if HR does some digging, they can probably see that I'll be starting at the new place).

I have a meeting with the old employer on Thursday just to wrap up and debrief, and I have a feeling they they're going to ask me to keep working once I supposedly get back to my hometown. How should I handle this?

And on the off chance that I do run into someone from the old job in the next few weeks, what should I do or say?

Get her talking and you don’t have to work for at least an hour. 5) sorry for not using indents or paragraphs, mobile user.

I genuinely hate the job as I am constantly comparing my job to the ease of the kennel techs job for the same pay grade, what should I do? —————— When I applied I applied for kennel tech. (K) thought I would be a better fit as receptionist. Which is fine, I said I would try it and give it my best and honest shot. And was open with her and asked if I could be changed to a tech in the future if it didn’t work out. Instead of answering she blew it off so I assumed it was a case of “either you want what I am giving you or I just won’t hire you” situation. No big deal. However in finding out what being the receptionist is, I hate it. The job that was explained to me is as such but while also basically being a kennel tech’s jockey, picking up what they don’t catch, taking the brunt of angry customers if the techs did something AND still picking up poop. None of these I have an issue with however let’s read off the $9 per hour kennel techs jobs; clean, take dogs out to group play, play with individual dogs, cuddle old dogs, sign sheets saying you did so, and feed. . . Now let’s read off the $9 per hour receptionist job; check in and out guests, ensure all vaccines are up to date, run them from the lobby to the potty runs, inventory dogs items, ensure all paperwork regarding aggression, general info, allergies, and meds are correct. Count pills if needed, create poop charts (for the techs to sign if a dog pooped or not) take the brunt of any and all customer complaints, handle the phone, handle emails, upselling, and being a general maid for the lobby, parking lot, and “what ever the kennel techs miss” also hosting “tours” around the resort to show customers pricing, details, and sizing of our facility. . . ————— I wouldn’t be mad about being $9 an hour if the shitty kennel techs were paid $8.50 or anything less than I. Not because I ‘deserve better’ but simply because my job is significantly more stressful and demanding. ———- to top it off the lead kennel techs are lazy and since they are behind a large impenetrable fence all day they sit in the group yard on their phones. Especially (C) who is a fat Hispanic girl who loves riding horses (this is relevant) she is besties with the manager (K) and always goes into the office for “private meetings” which are (from what I’ve overheard as the office is literally connected to the lobby) about *horses* (C) and (K) will spend an hour a day in a meeting about fucking *horses* whilst being on shift in a dog kennel. Other new people have also complained that senior staff are always on their phone or are just lazy leaving all the work to the new kennel techs. Today I brought a dog to group (which I am NOT required to do) and (C) proceeded to yell at me over dozens of dogs barking, to which I could not hear. God forbid she get up from the agility equipment, walk over, and receive the dog. She then motioned for me to just “push the dog through the crowd of excited dogs and lock the door” ———- I don’t even know if I should bother bringing these things up to (K) since these senior staff are so close to the manager. (K) is extremely easy to take advantage of.

She said “I can either tell it to you or give you a peice of paper” the paper was two pages and there were four steps. Phone number (optional) email, and card info. Plus info on pricing and what the customer gets back. She turned two pages into fourth five minutes. Halfway through by the way she began to talk something about how cute one of our regular dogs are and how well it plays with others I don’t know I toned her out as it was information NOT.

Obviously, I knew that didn't make sense and wasn't the case. I'm 17 years old, and not a full grown adult. I don't know what I can and can not do.

676,"  

So I’m looking for advice on a kind of in depth situation so excuse my ton of detail. 

My wife went to school to be a teacher. After a couple rough years, she decided it’s not something she wants to do as a career and so quit and is now trying to figure things out. My wife is super creative but not very focused. She is very intuition and emotion based and does not understand following some streams of logic when her intuition says otherwise. This is much more than the standard man vs women difference. 

We moved across the country to try living somewhere different (California to Tennessee) and I got a job at a college processing financial aid. It pays about $50k a year so not too shabby, but it is damn boring (This will matter later). My wife got a job as a baker at Panera temporarily and after about 9 months she quit (before having another job lined up). Luckily she was able to find a job quickly that paid $33k a year in a phone sales position. I told her to take an extra few weeks to find a few other options, but she liked the company so took the job right away. I knew she would hate the job and was right. Within 2-3 weeks it was all complaining and hating her job. Complaining got worse and worse and even though she was doing pretty well at the job, she quit about 2 weeks ago after working there only 5 months. 

Neither of us are the kind of people who are satisfied just having a regular job. We are always pursuing passions and hobbies or trying to make money on the side. Our ideal situation would be making money from home or through some time of personal venture. Even if we made less money that way, being our own boss is definitely the dream. I’ve always been involved in things like that. In high school I made money on the side selling snacks out of my backpack (until the school shut me down), I’ve started an illegal snake breeding business, sold skin care, done a few MLMs, sold cable services door to door as an independent contractor, had a small car detailing business, etc etc. 

Our recent venture is one that I love but has a very small chance of succeeding. That being the case, I would do it even if it made no money because I enjoy it so much. I started a Youtube channel and began to grow that prior to moving to live streaming on twitch. I don’t have a large following, but made maybe $300 in about 9 months on youtube and got around 2-300,000 views. My wife and I have been doing twitch together a year and a half and brought in maybe $1500-2000 in the last year. On my channel, I play games during the week and once a week interview local musicians or artists for a live podcast and livestream the occasional podcast ran concert. My wife does some games but mostly performance streams. She sings, dances, reads story books aloud while acting as the characters and other things along those lines. She has always wanted to be an actress or some type of performer but never really pursued it. 

This is the main reason she quit her job. She decided she no longer wanted to do jobs that she hated and so just up and quit. She is going to try to become an actress full time. I did not agree with this decision and tried for weeks to persuade her otherwise, but she quit anyways. She says that when she gets off work she has no energy to work on her passions. She doesn’t understand the need to do whatever it takes because she grew up with money. Her bachelor’s degree was covered by her grandparents, she got a brand new car bought for her when she turned 18, etc. I on the other had grew up with parents in and out of prison for selling drugs. I was poor and often had to fend for myself. 

She is terrible with money so I’m in charge of it now for the most part, but between our student loans and other debt, we’ve got about $110k in debt. She had to pay for her masters degree herself and racked up some credit card debt before meeting me, so about $68k is hers from before we were married. $33k is my student loans and the rest we got together. We no longer use debt for anything and with both of us working, I was able to save up about $1500ish a month to pay off debt. It would be a long process but we were moving in the right direction. I want to get a house eventually, save money, be stable, but also work on our passions and work towards being our own bosses. Since I’m the planner of the relationship, I made an entire plan for us that would get us most of those things within a few years. 

I was also saving up money to go to a coding boot camp. I’ve always been techy and know a bit of coding (Very little) and had a friend go through this school and get a job within a month after that paid $75k a year and they had no coding experience beforehand. So I figured with us both working, continuing to pursue twitch streaming on the side, me learning coding and her just working a generic job so she can work on things she loves on the side until something grows, we would be good to go. But with her quitting her job no matter what I say, I now feel stuck. 

She is trying to work flexible jobs like lyft/uber and grocery delivery type gigs so that she can really pursue acting, but they just don’t make enough money and put way too much wear and tear on the car that we cannot afford to fix now if something goes wrong. She has no plan on how to achieve what she wants and no idea how to make a plan, but refuses to get a regular job and has no idea how long this will take, it could be forever. She also won’t listen if I try to help her make a plan. 

My income alone will cover gas/food/bills and a little bit of savings, but that’s it. I’m tired of living poor like I grew up and with us finally being on the right track, this change is really effecting me. I hate my job but now have to stay regardless because I’m the only source of income. Can’t afford to save for coding school now (though I am learning online). I still have twitch which is what I currently enjoy most in life, but that isn’t realistically going to make any real money anytime soon (If ever). So now I feel stuck and as if she is just looking out for herself and making selfish decisions that hurt me. I’m not prone to depression, but these last few weeks have been super hard. 

And to top it all off, we are going on vacation to Hawaii for a week for a wedding. Luckily, it’s already all paid for and I’ve got a bit set aside for us to spend there, but I’ve got enough paid days off to cover it and she was supposed to as well, but now she doesn’t because she quit with no plan and 3 weeks before we left. 

Trying to get her to change her mind or actions is damn near impossible and for the time being, there is nothing I can do about it. So I’m looking for advice on what actions I should take or any advice really on the situation before I feel like I’m about to lose my mind. Work sucks even more and I’m tired of feeling terrible. That being said, if I needed to, I’d work here for the rest of my life and hate it just to make sure that my wife is taken care of, but obviously that isn’t what I want. 

P.S. I love my wife and no matter what will never leave her, so I’m just taking that off the table as possible advice right now. 

So any help or thoughts are appreciated.",23Apr2019,1
677,"Alright so I recently got out a long-ish toxic relationship and it really made me realize how much I need to work to better myself in many ways. Most of all though, I want to find out how to be comfortable with being alone. 

I figured that now that I'm single, this is a great opportunity to work on this.

Anyways, whenever I'm alone, I always feel the need to text/be talking to someone in order to feel like I have some worth. It's a terribly limiting aspect of myself to be completely honest. 

It has also lead me to becoming somewhat clingy (although I have improved IMMENSELY from when I was younger). This clinginess often drives people away, which is the opposite of what I want.

Okay, so last year I ended up needing an operation which left me with an open wound, during my recovery I met a girl who took care of my wound every now and then. We kind of clicked, but since I was her patient I wasn't sure if I should ask her out. At the end of my wound treatment she messaged me that she had found me on Tinder (she had my number because I was her patient). We started talking and soon went on a date. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything seemed to be going quite decent, I still had to adjust because it had been quite a while since my last relationship which caused some minor arguments, but nothing to serious. However, after about a month things started to change, it became harder and harder to communicate with her, and I couldn't figure out why. She had mentioned that she had some issues, so I assumed that she was just having a difficult time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then the shitstorm happened. She has multiple patients in my neighborhood, and previously I would often meet her during her work while walking my dog, and we would chat. So the last 2 weeks we hadn't gone out, and now while walking my dog I see a car stopping, and presumably her entering the house of one of her patients. I was absolutely shocked, I then asked her later that night if someone drove her around. She lied and told me that it wasn't her and only her father would occasionally drive her around.   


So the next day she messages me making up excuses as to why our relationship wasn't going to work. This is the part where I fucked up. I was confused and determined. She soon revealed that she had a long distance relationship with someone, and that he treated her badly and she had become depressed. She told me that I brought happiness into her life and that I showed her what life could be like.  


I should have ended it right there, but I was blinded by love. So I said that I didn't care that she had a boyfriend, and that I would be ok with it if she would end the relationship. Soon after everything seemed to be going quite great. We became really close and I started to really like her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until the first sunday of February. She had been away the weekend, not quite responding and when I asked her how her weekend was, she told me that she went to the movies with her boyfriend. I couldn't believe what I just read and I immediately closed my phone and went for a long walk. The next day I told her that I would not be continuing our relationship until she ended her relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now you might wonder, why on earth didn't I just block her right there and then and move on? I don't know, I was just too overwhelmed and blinded by the connection I felt with her. I talked with her every now and then, and valentines day came. She asked if we could talk somewhere, but if I didn't want to she would understand. I agreed and we met up at a local restaurant. She became really touchy and I had a hard time standing my ground. After our chat she talked about how she wanted to be intimate with me, but couldn't because I forbid it. I stood my ground and told her that she knows what she has to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, she did not. Because guess what, the very next sunday (about 3 days later) that same car I told about earlier parked near one of her patients houses and she exits the car. So I walk up to her, and ask her who is driving. She tells me its 'just a friend' and enters the house. So I walk up to the car (parked about 20m away) and there is the man, the myth, the legend. And guess what, he had no clue either that she had been dating me.

&amp;#x200B;

Well I guess she has her way with words, because I still have no clue how he did not end his relationship with her right then and there. I'll skip the next few weeks, and fast forward to about 3 weeks ago. She finally got a psychologist for her issues (long queue) and talked about how everything would become better. I told her that if she ended the relationship and would finish her treatment we could then maybe try again (shouldn't have done that, I know). I asked if she could give me an update on how it went. Well I got the update, 3 weeks later, saying that she needed time for herself, but that she felt better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't care that much anymore, and wished her good fortune the coming weeks. I thought maybe she and her BF finally broke up. Wrong again! Guess what, I found out that she's going to Italy with her boyfriend in June.

&amp;#x200B;

I literally don't know what to do at this point. I am beyond mad. I have thought about just blocking her but I don't feel like it's the appropriate response in this situation. She had been really mad during our break that I was often online on WhatsApp and would ask if I had found a new girl, but I just don't think I can jump in another relationship just to make her jealous, it feels like a shitty thing to do and just wrong. I don't even know if I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's bad but something in me wants some form of vengeance/revenge, I know I should just move one but I just can't.

680,"It's always been clear that I have a very addictive personality. It's not that I lack judgment or will power or anything else as I've been able to quit multiple addictions. I just keep falling into a new and worse addictions afterwards.


When I was young I'd get addicted to video games and play non-stop if I got the chance to. I was addicted to soda and would feel physically ill if I didn't get my sugar kick. 


When I got to high school I got addicted to cigarettes but eventually quit when I got diagnosed with asthma. Instead, I started doing snus (mouth tobacco) to get my nicotine kick. Till this day, I still take snus.


For years, I smoked weed daily, but managed to quit as I felt it ruined my personality and my performance in school.


Instead, I started doing cocaine on a weekly basis in the beginning of 2017. I was broke, my health was terrible, I felt terrible, I craved coke daily and I almost dropped out of my education.


I decided to quit from the start of 2019 and have managed to stay away from coke since. However, I've found myself replacing my coke habit with excessive drinking. I now drink myself to sleep almost every night and find myself constantly craving alcohol.

681,"Hey all,

A few months ago I started applying for new jobs because I want more money. My current company won't pay me as much. The amount I can walk straight into at a new place, it'll take me around 3 years to try and get that here. Living in London, I need more money to live comfortably.

I've been applying and I'm quite far down the process however this last month has been insane. Since I have been doing well in my interview, weirdly I've been smashing it at my current job. Right now I'm in the position where I absolutely love my team and what I do. We work really hard, mainly because there isn't enough people, and also because we love what we do.

However if I accept the new job, I will feel like it'll be a huge kick in the teeth for a lot of people who have taught me so much, I have had so much fun with, and who have been able to enjoy their work more also now that I can take a bit of weight off their shoulders.

I know, bottom line when it comes to the CEO is that I'm just a number and they'll say ""bye bye"" if I try and act up, but I can't help feeling guilty that I'm betraying my team, and after all the love they've shown me, I'm throwing it back in their face.

686,"Hi, sorry for any errors. 

So I’m a 20 year old guy (21 tomorrow) and I’m still yet to even experience my first kiss, It does feel quite embarrassing. I’m still terrified of being intimate with anyone even the girl I’m currently in love with (about 3 years of having feelings for her) 

I have been sexually assaulted before, once to the point of attempted rape. I kept this all to myself and tried to deal with these issues alone for about 4 years before I opened up to people close me. I was making progress and was able to hug someone for the first time in years without my anxiety spiking though the roof. I feel pretty pathetic to be proud of a hug. 

This was set back when last month the same person as before tried to once again force themselves into me. I’m now torn between wanting to feel connected to someone and terrified of it. I can’t talk about this to Many people because I’ve isolated myself off. I only really have the girl I love who is currently seeing someone so I can’t really discuss with her about sexual things. And my best mate who struggles to understand it properly. I tried with a few other friends but I was only met with “but was she hot?” Questions. 

My question is how can I start to try and move past this?",23Apr2019,1
687,"So, in the last week of March I spent the majority of my savings (well, what remained of my savings after I had to buy a new car a few months ago) in order to get myself out of a toxic living situation. I now live with my boyfriend in his house and have promised to contribute $650-$750 a month for the mortgage and utilities (I already paid for the month of April). 

Unfortunately, just a few days after wiping out my bank account, my bf and I became victims of a mass layoff by our seemingly suicidal employer.

My boyfriend has a sizable amount in savings which he can support himself on for like a year. I on the other hand can maaaybe make my $1600 last 6 weeks. I refuse to ask him for money or fail to pay ""rent"" and while obviously he knows I'm not in a good financial situation, he doesn't know exactly how dire it is. I don't want to tell him because he will insist on buying me things, or won't accept my rent even though he's just as unemployed as I am. 

Other financial potentially relevant info: I have no student loans or car loan, and have 2 credit cards with no outstanding balances and $2000 limits. I also apparently have a credit score over 700. So aside from the ""literally zero money"" thing, my financial situation is fairly decent.

I applied for unemployment, but won't be seeing any of that for like 2 more weeks, and even so it's only $1200/month for ~3 months. And of course I'm applying for jobs like crazy, though unfortunately driving around the city talking to recruiters and going to interviews/networking things really eats up my gas which is $$.

I have a B.S. degree in cyber security, tons of certificates to back it up (still current on those), and with over 5 years of experience in IT. I work as IT support for the largest company (aside from a hospital) in my city and there is literally no higher that I can go in my current position. I am making $40k/yr with yearly raises of about 5-6%.

Don't get me wrong, my manager, coworkers, etc. are all great. I enjoy my work, even if it is not security related, but I feel like I could be doing so much more with the knowledge that I have. About half of my coworkers are close to retirement, but have been here for well over 20 years. They tell me that the stuff they worked on 20 years ago is almost exactly the same as what they do today, meaning that they have not moved anywhere either.

694,"For some context: I've been dating my gf since late 2015, and its a long distance relationship we've known each other personally since middle school though. 

Anyways, lately our relationship has been draining for me. I feel that she's not there for me emotionally, and lately when she asks for food for money it kinda ticks me off. Reasons it ticks me off is because she has a full time job, she never offers to pay me back/pays for much for me unless its my birthday, and I can at least get a thank you like her spending time with me or drawing me a picture(It doesn't have to be absolutely fancy). 

I believe my final straw with her asking me for money was in February when I didn't have a job. I really wasn't trying to spend money since I didn't have an income. That evening she was feeling all sad and shit and telling me she was also hungry. So I decided to give her money. Here's the kicker: she insisted that she had to get TWO items from the menu even though before hand she was like ""I could never do that to you"". I feel that if she claimed that she felt she couldn't make me spend $22 dollars solely on her but then order two items it wasn't that genuine. 

Somethings to consider: she lives with her parents and her dad ""manages"" her paychecks. Meaning, that he puts a chunk of it to her savings. However, I don't know what her wage is or what she spends it on otherwise. Also to be fair I rarely do ask for payments in return: however I asked once she claimed she didn't have money. Then around valentines day she claimed she didn't have money either and would pay it later. Which I kept having to remind/bug her for it. 

Is she a mooch or am I in the wrong?",23Apr2019,2
695,"Hey guys! So basically I'm about to go to my dream school for a BFA in acting and one thing that caused me a few issues this year was people letting me know in one of my theatre groups I tend to brag a bit without noticing. It wasn't an issue earlier in the year but as I got very busy and caught up with doing so many shows/school work/ work I stopped thinking about it and unconsciously just found that  I had a tendency to in conversation not think about who I was around and talk about the things I got going on which came across to certain people as bragging/ being egotistical (roles I got, my job, college acceptances). I think it has a lot to do with my passion, I'm very very passionate about theatre and I just get so excited and want to share with others, but I unconsciously just tell a lot of people and it just doesn't always come across right. Luckily I've been more careful recently in my friend group but it was a major reason I had to leave my school's theatre department, as I tended to boast and people disliked me and started bullying me and leaving me out of things making it a very toxic environment. I'm in the clear with my friends now and I've talked to them and told them I'm working on it and I never had ill-intentions so I feel pretty good there.

However as I'm going to college in the fall, my BFA class is only 16 people and I'm in a GC with them and everyone seems so cool and passionate and I'm so so so so excited to meet them and train but I'm a little worried I will start bragging and people will dislike me for my years there.

699,"Here's the whole story.

I matched with this girl (23 I'm also 23) on hinge and we had so much in common it was crazy. We talked for a few days, then scheduled to meet up after work. We both had a great time, got some drinks and food and left around 9 or 10. We talked more over text and planned to meet next week but over the weekend she said she wanted to go for a hike and asked if I wanted to go. Of course I did and went. We had a good time. Kissed and continued to hang out for the next 3 weeks twice a week. She seemed really into me texting me all the time (honestly a little too much it wasnt sustainable). One day after work she got some drinks with coworkers she even asked me to pick her up and I agreed and we spent the night at her place. We only made out bc she was kinda tipsy and I didn't want to go any farther but we cuddled and stuff too. Although we really only made out and cuddled a couple times over the time we hung out. I thought it was weird but she seemed very independent and not the type of girl to cuddle and shit a lot. So I didn't think much of it. Also she flaked on me a few times bc she's going through some health problems right now. I've actually been through the exact same health issues so it wasn't a big deal and she always planned to hang out again when that happened.

 Now last week we planned to meet up on Tuesday after work. She told me around noon she was gonna get a drink with coworkers again and I said that was fine. She kept texting me she was gonna get one more until she didn't shown up until 830. I was a little upset but drove her home at 10. We talked about next time how she should sleep over if I told her in advance. We had planned to hang out Friday again and go to this Brewery we had really wanted to go to. She said again a coworkers was leaving the office and she needed to get 1 drink before meeting me. I said thats okay. Friday morning she saw the Brewery was closed. I asked if she wanted to go somewhere else and she said she was just gonna hang with coworkers now. She didn't text me all day now and only responded at midnight when she got home. Again a little upsetting but oh well. She then only texted me 2 or 3 times a day Saturday and Sunday which was weird compared to how much she normally was. Now I Had plans for Sunday but they fell through so I asked if she wanted to do something active. She said she had plans but probably wasnt going to do them. So Sunday rolls around and she's taking hours to respond and I feel like a little bitch reminding her to hang out so I never do. I asked her what she was doing and she said she didn't do her plans and is running errands. Monday morning comes and she's still not texting me at all. Monday afternoon I text her, ""you seemed busy yesterday and not that into hanging out over the past few days so let me know if you wanna do something this week."" She responds a couple hours later, ""sorry I've been super busy not checking my phone, I haven't been feeling good and I'm anxious for my doctors appointment on Friday."" I respond, ""im sorry I hope the doctor can help you."" I also say"" I've been through that stuff and I like you and would like to help you if you want."" and of course I have been through those issues so I was just being genuine. Now it's Tuesday and she still hasn't responded to me asking if she needed help. This is strange considering how much she used to text me and the past week of events. 

So long story but I'm wondering your thoughts. Is she really feeling sick? I think she is sick but that didn't stop her previously from seeing me. Do you think she's seeing someone else and doesn't want to say that to me? Do you think she just doesn't like me now? 

Also what should I do? Just wait until Friday and ask how her appointment is? Or text or call her before. I'm really lost and it feels like she's just ghosting me after a month of hanging out. 

Tl;dr Date for a month. Hang out twice a week. Seems like everything is going well then she starts flaking last week then responds to text slowly over weekend now isn't responding. Is it she actually sick like she says she is or doesn't like me anymore?",23Apr2019,1

So on Easter sunday, I met up with a guy that I met on Tinder. It wasn't a date and there was no romance involved. We just wanted to hang out together for a bit. I had a really nice time. I'm usually worried about me boring people so I do pay attention to how they might be feeling during their time with me but honestly, he seemed to be having a good time too.

Since that day, he hasn't said a word to me and we used to talk pretty frequently. I send him a message on the same day simply thanking him for a nice time. He hasn't even looked at the message despite appearing online on social media several times. It's really playing on my mind so I want to just find out what's wrong. If it was something I said or did. It's really bothering me.

Is it best that I just forget about him or should I ask what's up?",23Apr2019,1

However, I'm just sick and tired of college. The constant study, exams, reading, reading and more god damn reading. I'm sick of it. I need a break from education.

I'm taking a gap year to figure out what I want to do in life but to be completely honest, I just don't know what to do. I don't think I'll be going back to university after my Gap year. I've made sure to stay very busy in my Gap year, plenty of work and internships.

I got an individual plan elsewhere. The oral surgeon I saw was in network with my employer dental insurance. The surgeon's office tried running the claim at least partially through my medical insurance to see if they would cover any, and they did, but only about 6 months after. My dental insurance estimated I would need to pay about $550 out of pocket after they paid their portion-I had used none of my $1000 max and I had almost $200 in rollover benefits. 

Now I have repeatedly gotten statements once a month from the surgeon's office with $0 paid. I call each time, talk to the same lady, and write down whatever she says...waiting for whatever reason for the insurance to get back to her.

I got my 10th statement today and the bill amount has finally gone down, but only to $1600. It says there is a disallowance from my dental insurance. How can this be? I was covered at the time of service so how could these numbers be so far off?",23Apr2019,1
724,"Bit of background: I was a straight A student for most of my life, graduated top three in my class, did tons of extracurricular activities to a decent level ( swimming, almost junior nationals), and then ended up at a pretty high ranking college with a full ride. Ended up with pretty much straight A's in my first year in college as well. 

I swam for a good 10 years before college, and twice, my parents limited me the amount of swimming practice I could go to for SAT school and just college preparation in general. If I recall, it was sophomore year and I was actually at my fastest point, improving at a rapid rate. It was to the point I was beating my best times at practice off a push against a wall compared to a dive, with rest, and with a good swimsuit. I was never that fast again. 

So I quit swimming in college and joined dance. Managed to go through first year with pretty much solid grades despite my heavy involvement in a new activity. Second year, I managed to get into a competitive dance team, and it made me really excited. My grades fluctuated due to the lack of sleep, unexpected number of hours, and my general lack of preparation for this type of activity. In high school, the latest I slept was 2, and all of my activities were in the day or evening. Dance practice in college are always at night, and they sometimes end around 1 to 4 A.M., depending on how close we are to competition. 

I got into academic probation due to my grades. My parents told me to quit the team immediately, but I got really upset about this, telling them I don't want to. I know it was part of the cause of my grades, but I was upset. It would be the third time they removed me from something I loved to do when I was rapidly improving. I thought I just needed time and was willing to give it my 100%. My parents disagreed and told me to quit regardless. 

Where I'm at now: I still dance. I don't talk to my parents about it. I don't seek any kind of advice or really talk to them much about my life anymore. I cruise through college with low grades, just passing and getting the occasional B or A just because the class was rather easy. But I can't bring myself to care. I came to college thinking I could be a med school student aiming for around a 3.8 GPA, and it's my fourth year now, and I'm just like...well I'm obviously not getting med school haha. But I don't even aim for anything other than to graduate and I have no future plans post-college. I know it's going to fuck me over, but I just can't really find the motivation to push forward.

At first you could label her as a typical nerd, no interest in fashion, never wearing makeup, hair often greasy, she even rarely shaves her legs. I’m pretty sure she never even kissed a boy, her mind is so occupied with studying that she’s thousands of miles away from that “achievement”.

MY SITUATION RN :

In the past few months i ve found myself getting addicted to internet. From the time i when i wake up in the morning ( or whenever) to the time i go to sleep, i m just hooked on to my mobile/laptop/desktop. I m not entirely wasting my time on internet, on a good day i spend 50% my time learning something useful for me (like investing in stocks / learning about web design / Networking / Security etc) and rest of the days just passes by watching YouTube, Netflix, playing online games, browsing SM (NOT DOING ANYTHING PRODUCTIVE). Also because of me being so addicted to the internet all the time has really impacted on my social life, i ve almost no social life, i ve a few friends in my neighborhood with whom i hangout like once a week and that's all, other than that i live with my parents and i only talk to them at the dinner table and that's also very minimal conversation ( i ve my own room upstairs).


THE PROBLEM :

Now all these combined has really impacted on my studies aswell, i ve flunked in my college in my 2nd year (i am a electronics engg undergraduate student), and every time i try to study for an exam, I just cannot resist the temptation of being on the internet. I really wanna come out of this hole that i am in rn ( living with my parents)  and that will only happen when i pass my exams/ finish my degree and then get out!

but as i said it has become really difficult for me to concentrate for anything longer than half an hour, my study habits are completely messed up rn.

i hope some of you guys can give some advices on how i can deal with this.


Thanks for taking time out to read this!

and Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

741,"For starters, my boyfriend and I have a wonderful relationship. We've lived together almost a year, and have been through a lot of tough shit together. Our communication is also great, as it's something we practice and work on constantly. 

Recently, I've started receiving better and new treatment for my asthma. For the last 3 years, I've had to stop doing everything I loved because my health was so bad. As a result, I gained a LOT of weight and became severely depressed. I've finally decided it's time for me to change things. 

About a week ago, I went inline skating for the first time in YEARS. It's something I used to be extremely good at, and it was my escape from everything bad in the world, and also a great source of exercise. I haven't been able to do it at all up until last week because my health was so terrible. However, being able to go just made the world seem so much better. I started having more hope for the future and my health, I was so proud of myself for getting some exercise and having fun. It was all around an amazing experience. 

I've been wanting to go back to the rink (I can't afford a pair of my own skates yet) ever since then, and my boyfriend and I decided that we'd go today, on our day off. It would be a fun date, and also a good excuse to get out of the house and take our minds off of everything else. 

Well, today is here, and I've been ready to go all morning. My boyfriend, however hasn't gotten any good sleep in 2 weeks because of his anxiety, so he's constantly exhausted, no matter what meds he takes or what he tries to do to calm down and relax. 

I knew this, so throughout the day I've been asking him and making sure he DEFINITELY wants to go with me, because he seems exhausted, and I wouldn't be offended at all if he just wanted to stay home. He kept assuring me he was going to go with me because A. He wants to spend the time together and B. His anxiety would go through the roof, and he wouldn't get any sleep at all even if I did go without him, because he'd be worrying about me. 

I understood, and figured okay, I've asked 5 or 6 times, and he's had the same answer the whole time. I'll wake him up from his nap at the right time, so we can get there when the rink opens. 

I woke him up, and he just was exhausted out of his mind, shaky, barely coherent, and extremely jumpy as he gets when his anxiety is really bad. I felt terrible for waking him, as that was the little sleep he'd been able to get all weekend, and I told him this. He told me he was tired, but I've been looking forward to it all week, and he wants me to go have fun, so he started getting ready. 

Well, I felt those words were extremely difficult for him to say, and it took every ounce of strength in him to get out of bed and get dressed. He looked terrible and exhausted, and it made me feel extremely guilty as a result. 

So, I sat him down and explained. ""Listen, I'm gonna start this off by saying I really want to go to this. It helps with my depression, and the exercise is good for me in every other way. I'll be really bummed out if I can't go. BUT, you are insisting you want to go with me, even though everything else tells me you really don't want to. I also know you need to get some sleep, because you haven't gotten any at all. If I absolutely have to stay home, I will. It'll be extremely difficult for me, because I have been looking forward to this, but for the sake of your health and sleep, I'll do it. I know I can't go by myself, because you'd be on edge the whole time and not sleep anyway, so I need a clear answer, because at this point it's up to you. Whether I go or not depends on your mental state. You've been telling me you're going to come, but now you can barely get out of bed and walk properly due to your exhaustion. So just tell me now, are we going or are we not?""

He looks extremely guilty, and tells me he's exhausted, and really can't bring himself to go, and profusely apologies for fucking this up for me. I tell him I understand, and I'll stay home with him. 

He's asleep now, and I'm so glad. I just want him to be happy. However, now I want to cry. I've really been looking forward to this, and because he's assured me all day that we'll be going, my hopes were up. I'm finally getting back on track with my exercise (or at least trying to) but now I can't because his anxiety prevents me from being able to do something that makes me happy. 

Basically, my question is, how do I deal with this? It's selfish to put him through all this, but he told me before he went back to sleep that was he was doing was just as selfish, and I agree with it. Do I just go, because this is what I REALLY want, and risk fucking up his entire night, with him constantly thinking I might be dead, or do I suck it up and stay home, and just hope that next time we're a little more prepared?

I just don't know how long I can go on like this. I'm going crazy staying at home, he knows it too, and this is my last opportunity to do something I really love for the next week or two. I know it sounds stupid, but imagine 3 years of minimal exertion, sitting at home ALL DAY, and just going to work and back. I'm going fucking nuts and I need the escape. 

I'm sorry for the long post, but this is really bothering me. The place closes in 2 hours, and I still really want to go, but I know how bad I'll affect my boyfriend if I do. How do I even deal with this? Am I doing the right thing? How do I help him while still taking care of myself?",23Apr2019,1

this way is so shitty and it makes me angry and i feel completely mistreated. because he technically said nothing bad, i can't go to HR or go to anybody. but this is shitty and he put me in this position by not giving me the proper resources beforehand to do the job and setting clear timelines for it. 

i never post on any forum or any website but this really makes me angry to the point i feel i might do something horrific to him

•Low self esteem
•Self hate(Personality &amp; looks)
•Thinks everybody hates me(mostly girls)
•Masturbate to girls showing their midriff
•Don’t want to be old
•Hate certain people(old,ugly)
•Rage &amp; Sadness feeling
•Used to diagnose myself
•I don’t know if when I walk I have to always move my arms out A lot
•Lost interest in things
•No motivation to do anything
•Trouble Making/keeping eye contact with people*
•Feel little to no sympathy for others who get hurt(aka it doesn’t shock or get my attention,it’s like I’m used to seeing it)

746,"I'm a quiet person, suffer from social anxiety so struggled to mix with other people. Also worked in quite a toxic environment where I felt bullied by a number of people. I still stuck at this job for years though. I pretended name calling was just banter and never confronted it.

In one team meeting I asked if someone could cover something when I was on holiday. Nobody replied so I just shrugged.  Then someone else asked the same thing and one person offered to cover.

A lady commented that I'd got a better response than me (I was hosting the meeting). He then remarked ""yeah, people like me"".  I didn't know how to respond, I said nothing. Someone else did the offer to cover my shift.

I've held on that event for some time, don't even work there anymore, it was incredibly humiliating for me especially as I have insecurities about just that thing.

I've gone months without brushing my teeth, showering only about once a week, never washing my face, leaving the house, watching what I eat, or exercising in any way. I really need to change. The hardest part will be the showering. I always make excuses to not shower, and I end up going until i absolutely need it because of my hair, usually a week or more. I don't know how I'm going to force myself to do that. 

My ultimate goal is to eventually get to a point where I'm doing all of the following: showering every day, brushing my teeth twice a day, washing my face every day, hanging out with friends at least a few times a week, dieting, and working out 3 to 4 times a week.

751,"So there's this girl, let's call her M. 
She's in the class one year below me so I saw her everyday for a year. She was actually my ""godchild"" (the place where I studied makes first year students chose their 2nd year ""godparent"" to introduce them to the city and the school, I'm french so i don't know if there is word for that). 

Anyway in the beginning M and I were just friends and I was really ok with that. But as time passed I started thinking about her all the time. She's really flirtatious so I fell under her charm. She started dating some other guy and it didn't go anywhere. 
We began to get really close and I kept thinking about her more and more, she was even in my fucking dreams. Anyway since we told each other just about everything I started to feel shitty about not telling how I felt for her. 
So i did... And that's when things started to go south..
At first it was what you'd expect : 
M said she was a bit lost and although she really liked me she wasn't ready or interested in a relationship (idk if that's true or if she didn't want to hurt me but I honestly don't care) and we ended up saying ""let's stay friends"" , I thought ""well fuck it at least she's a great friend and now we're even closer"" and that's where I fucked up because I thought that meant I could tell her anything and I started to feel a bit blue because of all this shit and she was kinda mad that I made her feel responsible (that's the last I thing I wanted).
After months of fighting and making up we finally reached a stable friendship (although I still liked her) and I dated another girl for a while.
We reached the end of the semester and the first year students had the kind idea to make a video to thank my class for the year they spent with us. The last person to speak in the video was M : she thanked me for being a great ""godparent"" and I was the only individual in the class to be named by anyone in the video, I wanted to ball my fucking heart out but kept it together and hugged her and thanked her for being great too.
This is where I'm at now : school is over, I'm in an internship in another city but keep dreaming about her (not in a sexual or love relation way, just hugs and for some reason ""everything is gonna be ok"" is what we tell each other in those dreams) and I'll be back in that city next year so she'll still be in my life and we're really friends. We text from time to time but I avoid it because it just brings me back and I won't ghost her because I'm not a dick. Please help me reddit, i need to get over her

PS: I'm trying to date other girls and exercise to keep my mind off of her but as cliche as that sounds I've never felt this way for anyone before. And I know it's not good to dwell on it but I wouldn't come to you if I didn't need advice because I'm pretty hopeless.

They told me to find a driver and explain it to them. So i did. The man took the packages and they stopped.

Basically, I told my boyfriend (and some other friends) that I had this ""mysterious"" ex-boyfriend who was abusive.

I don't really know why I did it. I made up lies and covered it up with more lies and we haven't talked about it in about a year (when our relationship started) but I don't really know what to do.

Do I tell him the truth? Do I explain to him what was going on? How would I even begin to explain this?

764,"I need to change. The way my life is.....it’s impacting my professional development, and not in a good way. 

I’ve come to realize that....I’m sleeping too much and I’m lacking motivation, and when I do have that motivation it drains as soon as my brain starts thinking “ugh, it’s too much work.”   I do not WANT to be that way. I want to be more responsible...hell I know I can be responsible, but as soon as I arrive from college, my body disconnects from everything and falls asleep immediately my body touches a sofa. 

I’ll explain. 

I suffer from insomnia, a really bad case of insomnia and ADHD which, unfortunately is untreated. My mother doesn’t believe in ADHD nor psychologist so it’s kind of difficult right now. Regarding my insomnia issue I’ve told my mom and dad, but they don’t want to take me to a doctor because..well...they say it’s because I am not sleeping. Well duh, I cannot sleep. It’s not because I stay up all night on the phone and computer but because I’m struggling with sleep. I don’t feel “sleep” I lock my electronics away in a drawer and go to bed.  I stay there waiting desperately for sleep to claim me, but it doesn’t. It does like....an hour after I need to go to college. 

College starts at 7 o’clock...in the morning. I have to wake up at 6 am, and I end up sleeping at 4:55 am... 

I even started taking sleeping pills but it ain’t working. For me....sleeping at night is a privilege cuz it’s something that I rarely have. 

I reckon it’s the damn ADHD.

But that shouldn’t be an excuse, for I should be able to perform like a normal human being...wake up, go to college, work....etc...


But you know what pains me? What makes me feel so undeserved? 


In Mid January an acquaintance of mine, who is a fashion designer, was looking for interns. I told her I was interested but I had no experience in the fashion world and that I wanted to learn (I wanna be a fashion designer) she told me that there was no issue and even offered herself to become my fashion design teacher, she is teaching me ALL.  

I am wasting it...I’m wasting that opportunity. I go there two days every week, but due with my damn sleeping issues I always end up falling asleep after college and when it’s time to go....it’s late cuz not even the damn alarm can wake me. 

Yes, I do go to the internship. But like...one week and then the second week I end up asleep, the next week I go... and so on. 

The designer told me that I needed to be more responsible and I sure as hell agree with her. We spoke on the phone today. Asked me if Inas really interested in this internship because it doesn’t look like I’m taking it seriously....I am. Hell, the internship is the only thing keeping me sane from that hellhole of a college that I am in!  I hate it....It’s also been giving me issues with my self esteem...I will transfer to another college....but I am afraid that my credits won’t transfer. That’s my fear cuz I don’t want to be in the air and be like “I haven’t graduated yet”. I feel stuck, I am stuck.

I promised the designer that I’ll change because I really like going there but I have been having issues with myself that I’m battling daily, but I will change. I told her I’ll go this Friday and from now on... I won’t skip. She told me she was going to give me an opportunity. I was relieved. 

But I feel like I don’t deserve it. I mean, this....this is huge....getting an internship (where I live) it’s difficult. There are people that would die to get one and here I am wastin it.... 

I can’t waste it but I do FEEL SAD and I want to cry. This is my first time in an internship....I’m 20 years old...I need to keep up my game, dammit.

768,"So to keep a long story short, became friends with a girl who has turrets because I was one of the few people who wouldnt make fun of her disorder. Her mom also plays video games.

Fast forward a few weeks, my friend just moved out of her moms house and into her boyfriends house, which is a few states away. 

Fast forward another few weeks, and we’re chilling in discord playing some games when her mom joins the game server we’re in and tries to talk to my friend. Says “Hey (insert name). I miss you very much!”

I immediately noticed that something was wrong and my friend didnt want to reply to her mom. So couple minutes pass and her mom is still sending messages over game chat, trying to get a conversation going with her daughter.

Finally I ask what’s going on and my friend tells me that she and her mom had a fight a few weeks ago and her mom started calling her a whore, slut, etc...

I then tell her that her mom definitely didnt mean the things she said and has probably been trying to apologize to you. My friend then says that she knows and loves her mom, but that she always calls her nasty names and then apologizes immediately afterwords and shes just tired of it and wants her out of her life.

I then say ok, but it’s better to respond to her than to just keep ignoring her. So eventually, she says “I miss you too in game chat”.

That immediately triggers more messages from her mom. “Honey why have you been ignoring my texts and calls for weeks” “please let me talk to you”.

My friend then removes her mom from her friends list and leaves the game. **This is when her mom starts reaching out to me via private messaging**

She starts going on and on about how she keeps ignoring her and she doesnt know what she did. Not wanting to ignore the mom, but not wanting to get stuck in the middle of this, I say “idk what’s going on between you two but she loves you and is just frustrated rn and doesnt want to talk”

That triggers “She’s frustrated with me? All I did was ask for her to send a photo of herself to me and she goes crazy about how her boyfriend understands her and I dont and that shes never going to come back home to see me again”

This back and forth chat goes on for 30 mins, all the while I’m still in discord with my friend. Btw the mom is texting my friend and telling her “Liam (me) is telling me blah blah blah” and I’m literally just trying to comfort both of them since they brought me into this.

Finally after the mom tells me that she doesnt like how her daughter is being rude and ignoring her, I say “Look idk what’s going on between you two, but all children say mean stuff to their parents when they are angry and I’m sure she’ll contact you when she’s ready to.

They honestly are like the best friends I will ever have, since we’ve known each other since pretty young.

I was thinking I really wanted to visit them over the summer for like 2 weeks or something, so I would fly there myself. They told me they wanted to visit me as well over the summer, so I was under the impression we would be “even”. However, things have changed and now they are saying they are planning on winter break. Now, we are in high school still, and I know that their school usually only allows like a week off for break, and it’s the time of Christmas so I highly doubt they’ll come here for the holiday. I just feel like it’s pretty one sided on my end. Lately also, our group chat that we’ve talked in has been dying down, and they don’t really reply as well to me.

771,"(See TL;DR at the bottom if you like.)  To expand on the title: I \[25F\] started a new job last week, and at first everything was perfect.  My boss \[76M\] adored me from the interview; he literally asked me what salary I couldn't refuse, and he gave me that.  He's old enough to be my grandfather, and at first he did act like a grandfather.  He seemed concerned with my well-being (when I mentioned I had a doctor's appointment this week, he offered to drive me, and it took a LOT to convince him that I'm capable of driving myself!) and he'd make comments like ""I should have him on speed dial"" in case I ever got in a bad spot (because we were trading stories about stupid things that had happened to us in the past).  Plus, this guy lets me take time off whenever I want, and he approves my time card, so when he tells me to leave the office at 1pm and says I can write a full 8 hours on my time card...I can!  It's really rad.

However.  From the beginning (and it's only been A WEEK, for god's sake) he's been...uh...""complimentary.""  He'd mention that I looked great, or he'd whistle and say ""wow"" when I walked into his office in the morning.  He'd say that if I were his daughter he'd want to put me in the nunnery, that I wear the ""perfect"" perfume, etc. etc. etc.  This slowly escalated to him saying things like ""God, don't ever give me a drink and ask me if I want to play, because I wouldn't be able to resist"" and ""I'm jealous of your boyfriend"" and ""imagine if HR ever walked in and we were rolling around the carpet.""  Keep in mind that I don't think I did anything (and I mean *any*thing!!) to encourage him to have such a sexual view of me.  I dress conservatively at work, and while I try to be friendly to everyone, I never (NEVER EVER EVER) would intentionally send hit-on-me signals to a 76-year-old man!!  What makes matters worse is that, from day one, he's made constant comments about how ""understanding"" I am, how I ""have a great sense of humor"" and ""don't get offended over every little thing.""  He constantly contrasts me to a former employee, Mary, who reported him to HR many times.  He makes it seem like we're in an exclusive, laid-back club, and it makes me feel...god, I hate to admit it...it makes me feel *guilty* for even thinking about reporting him to HR; it'd be like I was violating our trust.

Plus, just today he said that he'll be recommending me for a promotion within a few months.  And he's told me straight up that this is his ""last job,"" as in he wants to retire when he's done with this company.  I'm poised to become his replacement, which would be a really great career move, and I don't think I'll have to tolerate him much longer, and right now I have this great gig where I can set my own hours and fuck off at work (i.e., listen to him reminisce about his youth), and all I have to do is smile and ignore his creepiness and I get paid for it!  Another consideration is that he's supposed to be my mentor, and I'm worried that if I reported him and he got fired, my position would be eliminated, or that the company might see me as a troublemaker who forced them to get rid of someone with 40+ years of valuable experience.  But I feel really scummy about accepting his harassment.  Also...today he progressed to touching me.  It wasn't much (at one point, he put his hand on mine and stroked my thumb, and at another, he put his hand on my back to guide me (I guess??) out of his office)--but knowing him, these touches will keep escalating.  On the other hand, I keep reminding myself that he could literally die any day!!  He's in terrible health!!  Maybe I should just give the old geezer a break and let him fantasize about me...?

But, yeah.  Wtf do I do?

TL;DR my super-super-super old boss makes sexually explicit comments to me often and has started ""innocently"" (but, okay, it doesn't feel like he's acting very innocently) touching me.  Is it wrong that I'm trying to ignore his behavior, if only for the sake of my career and my cushy work life?

So I'm new to reddit and decided to post this story and ask for advice because at this point, I don't have anyone else I feel like I can ask.

So my mom has been with her boyfriend for about 6 years at this point. She's been with a few guys ever since my father passed away in 9/11, and at first I had little issue with it. It wasn't until she met someone, who we'll call John, that I began to voice my feelings. John is the kind of guy that sits around and says ""make me a sandwich"" and ""women belong in the kitchen"" and likes to act like he does a lot for the ""family"" so he should be treated respectfully. For the majority of the 6 years he's been with my mom, he was emotionally abusive. He and my mom would get into arguments frequently, and he'd threaten to break up with her many times because he didn't get his way. John also got drunk basically every night and was rarely seen not drinking beer, and he also smoked quite a lot. When drunk, he did and said a lot of awful stuff and then the next morning, he'd claim to have forgotten or apologized for his behavior the night before, setting all sickly sweet and kissing up to my mom for the next few hours. Then he'd get grumpy again and return to his ways. My mother frequently covered up his behavior with tons of excuses, including his mother's death, his ""uncontrollable"" alcohol addiction, and anything else she could think up.

Now to move on to how his behavior personally affected me, and then I'll get to the specific question at the end. Keep in mind all of these parts to the story are generally out of order.

Around the time that I first met him, he saw one of my bras lying in the hallway and commented on the size of it, saying he'd ""never seen any bra that small before"". Keep in mind I was around 12 or 13 at the time and was in about 7th grade. I was very embarrassed by the comment and took my bra and stormed off into my room. I told my mom about it and she simply laughed and waved me off. Whatever. I moved on.

Frequently throughout the years I knew him, he would comment on the size of my \*ss and make fun of me for it. At first it just seemed like fun and games but eventually it got to the point where I noted that the discomfort I felt from it was definitely not simple fun. I told him to stop saying it, and he just laughed and asked me what the issue with it was and that he was just joking around. Eventually it got to the point where my brother joined in, and I gained self-consciousness whenever my butt was mentioned. Again, my mom continuously waved it off and I was made to feel like I was just being sensitive. This continued for years, even after having expressed my discomfort, almost in tears. This lasted the entire 6 years I knew him.

At one point this guy even saw me naked. Albeit I was partially at fault as I'd walked nude from my studio to my room (they were right across from each other so I saw no issue in the moment). He was walking up the stairs and when he turned back to look towards my room, he caught me naked. I sort of paused for a second and fear and embarrassment took over me. When I realized that he was not going to stop staring, I rushed into my room and slammed the door shut. I did not mention this to anyone because the embarrassment was too great. 

Around the time that I'd gotten into high school, there was a time where I realized a lot of my clothing went missing. I was frantic and my mom always blamed me for simply misplacing things. After this went on for a while and I was convinced I was just forgetful, some of my new clothing (that I'd just bought that day) went missing. I was extremely upset and checked everywhere I could have possibly left it. It was a bunch of bras. A bit of time went past and I was thoroughly confused on what could have happened to my clothing. Soon after, I was looking under my brother's bed for something (I don't remember what it was) and what I saw shocked me. Underneath my brother's bed was a bunch of my missing clothing. I said nothing and ran upstairs to tell my mother what was going on. She told John and John decided to go downstairs to talk to him with me following behind. Once John saw the clothes, he sent me upstairs and told me to close the door behind me and not listen in on the conversation. After a while, I went to listen from the top of the staircase and heard my brother and John laughing and the silent hum of their conversation. When John came back upstairs, he brought me my clothes and told me to not talk about it to anyone and to just forget it happened. I was embarrassed anyway and said nothing, so I kept quiet.

I also remember instances where John would point out my nightwear, that I wore around the house due to discomfort with normal clothing if I was just relaxing in my own house. John started to comment on how the night dress I wore showed my chest on the sides. These comments made me very uncomfortable, but I ignored it, even when my mom pointed it out herself. Eventually I did swap it out for different nightwear after weeks of the comments. 

One thing John loved to do was give everyone in my family back massages. To my brother, my mom, and even me. For the most part, it was completely normal. Since I was in my high school years, my self-image was a huge issue and I often confided in my mom and John about my lack of confidence (this is important). I don't know how much time passed since I'd talked to John about it. It was a while for sure. One night, John was drunk and came into my room to give me a back massage, like he'd done some other nights. But this time, while I was laying on my stomach, he began to massage further downwards. At this point he wasn't really massaging my back but not so obviously fondling my butt. My body stiffened and I asked him why he was going that low and that I didn't really like it, and he said it was just because it was part of my back and therefore there were muscles he was massaging to help relax me. I was freaked out and very confused so I...let it happen. While this was happening, he said ""I find you very attractive"". At the time, I was mostly confused and mildly uncomfortable, but I couldn't register what was going on. It was like I started to dissociate from the situation. The next day, I told my mom what happened and again she laughed and waved me off. She said she'd talk to John about it. Albeit, she did talk to him about it, but she came back to me with the excuse that ""he was drunk and didn't word it properly. He was just trying to address your lack of self-confidence"". I didn't know what to think, and didn't press the issue.

From then on I rejected any back massages from him and said I was just going straight to bed. One night soon after making this clear, I closed my door tight and went to bed for the night. I don't know how much time had passed, but later that night I was awaken by the sound of John coming in my room and sort of lumbering about. After a bit where I could sense his presence in the room and feel his eyes looking at me, I felt his hand begin to rub my back and soon fondled my butt again. I was very groggy and definitely still half-asleep, so I felt no energy to push him away and remind him against that I didn't want that. Before I could even convince myself to push him away, I'd fallen asleep and the next thing I remember is waking up the following morning.

As I type this, I just remembered that many times before and after this incident, he told me to put my arms above my head while he was giving me a back massage so my muscles would be more relaxed and so he could more easily access my back (he didn't want me putting my arms by my side). I thought nothing of it, but being extremely sensitive on my sides, I was very extremely aware of his hands getting WAY too close to my breasts while massaging me. Many times I felt his hands running over my ""side-boob"" (this is what I call it so you get the idea). I tried many times to change my position in order to hide that part of my body and my body always got extremely tense during this. No matter what I did, I couldn't keep him from touching that part of my body.

One time during my 13th birthday, I got home on the bus and expected to greet my family. Instead, I greeted John and his friend. My mother and brother apparently went to the next town over in order to go shopping (this later proved true of course). Soon after I got home, I was just chatting with John and his friend in front of the fireplace in the lounging area just next to the kitchen. John was very obviously drunk and I was, per usual, uncomfortable with this. I don't remember what led up to this, if anything even did trigger it. But what I clearly remember is John insulting me (I don't remember exactly what) and then him commenting on my hair and how he'd love to grab me by my hair and rip it all out. The tone he used and his expression terrified me, and his friend had to take me out of the room while he tried to calm John down and tell him that it wasn't okay to say that. I don't exactly remember what exactly happened after that - all I know is that wasn't the end of the insults, though it calmed down after a while. When my family came back, I didn't tell my mom as I was trying to keep a good mood in spirit of my birthday. I don't remember if I ever did tell her. Even if I did, I think I'd have gotten the usual response of ""he's drunk and he'll be normal in the  morning just ignore him"". 

So after having explained all of that, it's time for my actual question.

I've tried for years to convince my mom that this is abuse and isn't normal, and explain to her how it affected me. I tried to convince her that he really was a pervert and that I wasn't overreacting. But even now after she broke up with him (recently too but they still ""talk"") she still refuses to acknowledge that he was a disgusting pervert. To this day I am still unsure of myself.

Is what happened to me actually abuse? Is it sexual abuse? Is this sexual harassment? I just really want answers and to know if I have been overreacting. I'm tired of always thinking about it and thinking that maybe, just maybe, I'm the one in the wrong. Am I just overreacting? What do you think of this whole story? Is this normal or just a misunderstanding on my part? Any thoughts I can get on this would be extremely helpful. Thank you for listening.",23Apr2019,2
775,"I am a grad student and one of my lab mates speaks over me constantly. This started occurring regularly when she became a student in the grad section of the class where I am the only teaching assistant. 

They started helping out after I expressed difficulty in balancing being a TA, my grad duties, and my personal life since I was doing a lot but said I would manage. I expressed this as a colleague but it transformed into something else. 

The instructor is another graduate student and assumed they would ask my lab mate to help out without consulting me. I would be fine if it weren’t for being disrespected in front of students. 

My colleague talk over me when I’m talking to students or the instructor and is often asked to do TA duties when I am already showing up to do things and I am often not told. Whenever the instructor, my lab mate, and myself are speaking to students, I am ignored and I feel my opinion is not valued, so I say nothing. 

I am also ignored by my advisor and they are prioritized. This may be due to me always teaching and generally having more teaching duties than my colleagues. Teaching has made it difficult to even do things I want and NEED to do to graduate. I haven’t had a chance to read, write, or plan my research because I’m focusing on class and being a TA. 

It feels like I’m just viewed as an idiot and we are both adults which makes this hard to approach. I have been . Am I overreacting? Is this inappropriate? How the hell do I even bring up this topic when I am depressed, worn down by teaching, and feeling unvalued by and undeserving of my lab and department?",23Apr2019,1
776,"This probably isn't as serious as some of the others, but I really need help as I'm at my breaking point, all of my old friends have left and I suppose I just don't know what to do.

777,"I feel a lot of pressure to succeed and become financially independent because of my father (who is a mechanical engineer), but I just feel so hopeless because I don't know what to do unless if it's STEM, which I doubt I could make it in, because doing advanced math equations isn't for me. 

I also don't see a future in the arts program I'm graduating from.

These past couple of months I've done some deeper thinking, and have come to the conclusion that I am slower, and sadly to say, dumber than the average person. 

I want to start taking advanced math classes to get into business university next year (due to mostly parental pressure and keeping up the appearance that I'm doing something useful that will contribute to my future), but I am scared I will need extra tutoring as math isn't my strongest suit. 

I'm scared that the tutoring won't be enough and that I'll fail the advanced math classes (Algebra and Calculus) because I took the lowest levels of math in high school, and always got 50-60's.

In fact, I am also scared of failing in life because I'm not good at anything and being of lower intelligence will make me live a below-average life and get a lot of non-stop scrutiny from my parents. 

Some clues

1) I've never been good at math or science, and have gotten below average grades in general throughout my academic career so far. 

2) I have had several friends throughout my life call me slow in conversations in a non-sarcastic manner and they would compare me to London Tipton from the Suite Life on Deck. This slowness causes people to seem annoyed with me.

3) (The biggest one) My brother has a learning disability. Since I was young, I have been overhearing my parents talk about how his teachers want to place him in special-ed class made for slower kids/the ones with learning disabilities but they don't want him to go there. It's been an ongoing thing ever since my parents noticed he couldn't speak and was mute, until he was literally 6 years old. My mom yells at him all the time for forgetting things he just learned, and to study harder.

4) My mom might have below-average intelligence. She never had a real job (she also has a bad temper and doesn't get along with people in general) and got lucky by marrying my father. I've witnessed my parents getting into several fighs because she has trouble understanding something my father is explaining to her in depth, and he needs to constantly repeat himself, and she tries to brush it off by telling him to stop speaking.

5) I took 2 coding classes. HTML was bearable since I googled everything I didn't know how to do, but in Javascript, I constantly badgered the teacher and felt so dumb and slow compared to everyone else. I had to constantly apologize for being dense.

6) I was in a Graphic Design program for a semester 2 years ago, but was one of the first to drop out because I couldn't keep up quickly enough on how to use the computer programs (eg: InDesign, Illustrator) to complete assignments to precisely replicate a poster the teacher made first. 

7) I worked at a furniture store last summer for a month. There were in depth steps on how to process certain orders and it was hard to keep up, and my boss would constantly write out the steps, and made a comment on how everyone has 'different learning styles'.

The only good thing people say about me is that I know how to dress nice and put on makeup, but even then, I'm almost completely useless and dumb. 

Once people discover how dumb I actually am, I feel like they've already secretly judged me as useless, and have placed me on a lower pedestal in their mind.",23Apr2019,3

786,"Hi all -- I have come here looking for general advice as I'm not sure what my options are and I can't afford to lose my job.  I am a cashier at Whole Foods and there is a customer (older maybe like in his 50's white male) who works across the street who continues to troll/ harass me (and another coworker). He waits till other customers and employees aren't around, and while I am checking him out he will say something terrible, and then he will quickly dart back across the parking lot to get back to his job. I don't know why he chooses to harass us two other than my coworker has a Beto and a few lgbtq pins on her work apron and we are friends. Basically he says things like ""I don't know if I have enough money to pay for this (3 dollar taco) because of all the money I've been donating to hate groups"" and ""Oh you have to work today too (MLK day)? Everyone is off celebrating day of the n\*\*\*\*.""  Both myself and my co-worker are white women and he never will go into an aisle where the cashiers are POC. I know he has told my coworker that he ""meditates to the mantra build the wall"". 

Management knows about this but all they ever say is ""Call us when he is in the building so we can identify him"" By the time I call however he is usually gone. After an incident today my manager again told me the same thing but I feel like they aren't doing enough. He is intentionally trolling in a way so that only I can hear what he says and then he's gone. They have security cameras so they should be able to identify him that way. Today I became so upset I had to step away from my register and wait until I was calm to return to work.  I am so angry that I want to contact his workplace but I'm honestly afraid the bullying could escalate and he could come after me if I were to instigate him.

Ignore spelling or grammar, English is first language, but am just bad 


In our friend group, the main circle is three girls three guys, I have know them all since freshman year, and each of them has had a thing, at one point or another, for the other two guys. This year they sort of became douches so logically I was now the best potential date. This of course thrilled me, because I’ve liked (girls name) since I met her. So I told her how I felt, she was super excited and told me about how she had liked me since then too, but never said anything cuz I’m shy as hell. Right after this (literally hours later) her other friends decided it would be a great time to tell her that they liked me too, and now it’s a fustercluck of all them not wanting to do anything because then feelings would get hurt and sorta tear apart the group, so what do?

789,"So, my girlfriend (21F) and I (20M) have been together for six months now (Yay!), but I feel like there is some strain on our relationship.  You see, we both work and go to school, so our schedules have not really lined up well over the last few months.  She will be taking summer classes over the summer, and I will be working full-time at my job (we are both in college, by the way).  On top of that, she has been going through a lot f stuff lately, as her mental health isn't in the greatest of places right now.  She has been working on it and seeing a therapist, which is great, and I am proud of her for it, but I was contemplating whether or not to propose a breakup.    


Now, when I say that, please take a look at my reasoning first (some people are touchy when it comes to mental health.  I can totally understand that).  It isn't because I don't want to be with someone who has mental health problems.  I understand that everyone carries some form of problem or baggage with them in this life.  I have other people in my life that have mental health problems, and love them no less for the problems they may have.  Heck, I too, also carry some form of baggage with me as well (I am an insomniac).  Don't get me wrong, I still love her deeply, as we were friends for five years before we started dating. We met back in high school and stayed friends after we both graduated.  Surely, there is still a bond there. My concern, however, is that I am putting a strain on her and her mental health because of our relationship.  I don't want to cause an extra burden on her, and hold our relationship at the cost of her mental health or well-being.    


At the same time, I don't wish to harm or hurt her, because at the end of the day, I still think that she is an amazing and wonderful human being and I love her dearly.  I just don't know what I should do in this situation, as I am torn.  I believe greatly in self-care being a person's top priority, but I also believe in trying to make things work between people. I don't want to lose her, either. What would you all recommend that I should do? Please do be sure to give your reasoning as well.  Thank you so much, Friends!  :)

As an additional note, I thought I would include this as well, deeming it as an important bit of information.  I have not suggested that we breakup or anything like that yet.  I have been unsure about it, and haven't taken any real steps about, due to the lack of knowing what I should do.

794,"Sorry this is so long, x-post to relationships

I [30F] have known my friend Amy [30F] since kindergarten and we became close friends in 6th grade. Over the years I've become fairly close with her family as well, including her mom, dad, stepmom, 2 brothers and their wives, and even her grandparents. My mom died 5 years ago, and although I had usually been invited to their family get togethers, they really made an extra effort to reach out to me after her death. I appreciate them so much for that as I'm an only child and don't have a relationship with my dad.

However, since about late high school and especially into our early 20s, Amy and I have grown apart. She was always known amongst our friends as ""spacey Amy"" because she was so forgetful and flakey. Amy and I both had/have depression and the first sign of hers flaring up is be being MIA. I remember having to tell our mutual friends all sorts of stupid excuses when Amy would be out of contact for days or weeks, or cancel plans last minute. I know it really hurt our friends feelings and I definitely resented her for letting me deal with the fallout. Eventually people would stop reaching out to her and Amy would kind of be lost as to why. When I tried to explain, she showed remorse but would fall back into her ways pretty quickly. Throughout our whole friendship, Amy has been an unreliable friend to me as well. It has worsened through our twenties, some of the things being more hurtful than others. I also think we've just genuinely grow apart as people, so on the rare occasion we do talk, I don't know how to relate to her. But we don't really talk. I stopped initiating plans years ago. I'll text a few times a year but she either doesn't respond or won't for days. She has maintained other, new friendships during this time.

This all came to a head last year. Amy, one of her sisters in law and I were all about to turn 30 and our birthdays are pretty close together. Amy had suggested the whole family and I go to Vegas to celebrate. Her dad and stepmom love Vegas so they agreed and very generously paid for everyone's rooms and airfare. I couldn't believe it! We had a meeting where everyone agreed to dates and got all the info, etc.

A couple of weeks later, Amy texted me saying something like ""omg I did something so dumb"". Not unusual. Amy has made a lot of stupid, dangerous driving mistakes, slept through important events, almost lost her birth certificate on a school trip (don't ask why she brought it), etc. She goes on to tell me that she accidentally booked a trip to Japan (with other friends) when we were supposed to go to Vegas. I rolled my eyes and thought about all the money she would be losing by having to cancel an expensive international flight. But she explains more that, although she feels bad, she isn't going to cancel, and that she hopes I'm not mad, and that she wants me to still go on the trip. She says her family wants me to go to. Soon I'm getting texts from them asking me not to cancel because they want me there anyway. They say the understood if I felt uncomfortable though. I was really pissed. I love her family but knew it'd be weird without her there. I did want to cancel but I felt pressured and didn't want her dad and stepmom to have two wasted flights, etc. now.

I ended up going, and it was okay. Her family was really sweet about including me but I mostly felt like a third wheel to her brothers and their wives or a 9th wheel to the whole family. Her stepmom confessed that she thought maybe Amy had bailed on purpose. I don't know what to think.

The trip was in August of last year. I debated about talking to Amy about how hurt I was but never did. We haven't been truly close in a decade. She can also be very emotional when confronted and I was almost scared it'd send her into a tailspin. Plus, what did I expect? She hadn't changed in years. We don't even hang out outside of family events.

I've tried to let it go, but after seeing her and the family for Easter on Sunday, I realized it still really bothers me. I'm not really sure how to articulate it, but it feels like she's ""getting away with it"" if that makes sense. Should I try talking to her, or is it pointless? Has too much time passed? And if I should talk to her, what is the best way to explain how I feel? I know her family was pretty upset with her as well (and she routinely flakes on them with other stuff). I don't think I should bring that aspect into it, though I do hurt for them. Amy has ditched her dad on father's dad before :(

TL;DR My longtime absentee flake of a friend pulled the ultimate flake move and I never addressed it, but it still bothers me. I don't think she will ever change so I'm unsure if addressing it will accomplish anything.",23Apr2019,1
795,"so.. I feel like a huge fucking idiot right now, but please bear with me. So I wanted to take my little sister to a wizard of oz themed ballet this Saturday and I saw someone on FB on the event page wrote out that they had 2 tickets to resell and to just PM them, so I did. I expected this to go smoothly. Firstly, she asks if PayPal will work well enough and I said yes as I use it all the time. Then she backpedals and says that she can't sign in to it, and asks if I could just send an amazon egift card for the right amount. at this point I was starting to feel sketch, but I gave in. Then she tells me that it's going to charge her $20 to change the name on the tickets(???) and I was super annoyed but I went ahead and sent her another $20. She then proceeds to not send me the tickets right away, and I'm furious at this point, but I had to focus on getting to my job and working said job so I had to put it in the back of my mind. I asked her during my shift (about 30 minutes later) about sending them to my email I provided for the second time, and she told me she was too busy! After I went through all the trouble of sending her payment?

Anyway, I'm not done yet. A few hours pass, (this started at about 9 am this morning since I ghosted her about it last night) and she messages me about an hour ago telling me there's yet *another* issue. Her husband is, apparently, angry with her that she's trying to resell them for $40 when he paid $80, and I've already spend $60 total including that bogus fee (which is what the event page is already selling them for when I tried it last night). I'm super upset right now, and she keeps telling me she's honest and that I should be understanding, but now I just want my damn money back. What should I do? Do you think my bank will laugh in my face if I try to explain the situation?",23Apr2019,1
796,"I'm a web developer. There's still so much for me to learn, especially since I'm switching gears and changing my tech stack. Basically I'll be starting over again, but it shouldn't take me that long considering I'm not a total noob and know my way around things.

I've entertained going back to school. It would be the 'safe' route. However, I'm also working a full time job now.  I work nights from 10pm - 7am. I've googled and searched for a similar website, but none exist. This idea in my head won't stop eating away at me. Even if I were to go back to school, something keeps wondering where my idea fits into all of this.

My options are either work and go to school, or work and work on business.",23Apr2019,1
798,"So my husband has pretty much always snored for the duration of our relationship. It hasn't been an issue because I just use earplugs. However, our little one will be making his entrance into the world any day now. I'm worried how I'm going to be able to block out the snoring, but still be able to hear the baby. Hubby swears he'll hear the baby and wake me up (we plan on exclusively breastfeeding), but my husband is a notoriously heavy sleeper. Once when I forgot my earplugs, I screamed into his ear to get him to roll over (he snores worst on his back), and he did not wake up.
I know a lot of you are probably going to say he should see a sleep specialist, however, that is not an option for us. Hubby has a sensory disorder that would make it impossible for him to be able to sleep with a CPAP. He cannot feel constricted in any way, or his brain goes into overload.
I suppose a good option would be to just sleep in separate rooms, but our apartment is very tiny and we don't have that luxury. We have been looking into two bedrooms in the area, but they're at least $200 more than what we are paying now. Plus with the deposits, first/last month's rent, etc., it will require some saving. It will be doable, we're going to make sure he has his own room by the time he's two, it's just not a possibility right now.
So, does anyone have any ideas how to block out the snoring, but still know when baby needs attention? Also, a new concern has just come into realization, what if baby can't even sleep through it?

800,"I tend to ramble and overexplain, so I'll leave a TL;DR at the bottom of this post. Also, sorry if this is better suited to another sub - I'm just looking for someone better suited at handling tricky situations to help me out with this.

Okay, this title sounds harsh, but allow me to explain. I have a housemate who is very talkative. Once I get talking to him, he can go on for at least an hour. This wouldn't be much of a problem were it not for the time he chooses to chat to me.

I have a similar routine most days: I go to uni, I come home and cook with my other housemate at around 5/6pm, we sit and watch netflix together while we eat, and then later in the evening until I go to bed is what I consider my 'alone time' when I just want to unwind and do my own thing. Especially when it gets to like 10.30/11, I really just want to be settling down and getting ready to go to sleep. However, this is the exact time my housemate knocks on my door to talk to me. It's always between about 10 and 11 at night. And it's not like he gets home that late; he's usually in for hours beforehand.

It's not that I don't want to talk to him *per se*, it's more that I don't want to spend over an hour of my alone time - when I'm tired and would rather be in bed - talking to him about nothing in particular. It's nice that he wants to chat with me, but I would be much happier doing so when I'm downstairs earlier in the evening. That's when I spend time with my other housemate, but (being an introvert) she knows that afterwards I need time to myself to recharge.

I've tried giving him hints. I've tried ignoring him when he knocks, but he literally incessantly wraps against my door and bangs against my walls until I can no longer feasibly say ""I was asleep"" or ""I had my headphones on so I didn't hear you."" Today he came to my room at 10.30 and spent three straight minutes banging on my door until I answered it. He then said he just came to chat, so I told him to make it quick because I was going to bed soon. He invited himself into my room and didn't leave until 11.30. When I answer the door, I try to lean around the door so he has no room to walk in, but he pushes his way into my room anyway. I've tried ending the conversation at a natural juncture but he just says something else and drags me into the conversation again. I've tried yawning, I've tried checking my phone, I've tried everything but he will not take the hint.

Today I told him that if he wants to chat to me I'd rather he do it earlier on because I'm aiming to go to sleep earlier this term, but I don't think he's going to stick with it and I'm very averse to saying anything that might make the other person uncomfortable. So, I'd be too awkward to tell him to his face that I don't want to talk right now or whatever. This is really starting to get to me. He just doesn't seem to be able to take social cues at all. How do I communicate to him that I just don't want to have a long conversation with him right when I'm winding down at the end of the day? How do I keep our conversations as short as possible without offending him? I need help...

TL;DR: my housemate likes to have long chats with me, but he always chooses the very end of the day to do it when I just want to be alone. How do I get him to realise that I don't want to talk to him at that time without offending him?",23Apr2019,1
801,"So this story has been going on for a while. It involves a guy i know from high school. He is currently in the military training camp. I havent seen him in person in years maybe since graduation and i graduated back in 2017. It was not only till  a year later we started talking that we got sexual. Im not a man of labels so i dont really think im bi or pan but i prefer people for their personality but of course were all human so looks sometimes do help. I always had the smallest crush on him, he was one of those guys who hangs out with ass holes but you know outside from the group hes really smart and funny and that just always made him that much more attractive. That next year 2018 i messaged him and i decided to tell him my attraction towards him as there is nothing to lose since he was going to military training and im in UNI we wouldnt run into each other if by chance it got awkward. He said he was surprised as i thought but he said he didnt care. After this is when it all started, i started to send him nudes and videos (with his consent ) and he said he really liked them but he never wanted to send any back and at first i didnt mind but slowly it started to feel like i was being used until he said he wanted to do something when he comes back so of course i was excited but those days came and went and nothing (during this time frame he sent me some nudes back) so i decided to stop talking to him fast forward a year and a half later to yesterday i swipe up on one his snap chat stories and we chat for a bit and he tells me hes coming back this summer so we can meet up and have fun. So we start talking and he says he misses me and all this to me so im swooned over so quickly so we proceed to do the usual i send pics and he sends one but he still cant get past this not being able to send.. so am i being used a curiosity test? what should i do ive told him how i feel but he says he doesnt know... he said he doesnt regret anything he just doesnt feel comfortable sending pics to a guy? which confuses me cause how does he not have a problem of me being a guy? or am i being selfish and asking for too much?  also sorry for the improper sentences and stuff just kinda wanna get it out",23Apr2019,1
802,"So  my parents are hispanic and I'm their only daughter and the oldest, big problem right there. So I'm 22 about to be 23 in 3 months and want to move out with my bf. We are both recent college graduates and my bf has a job that requires him to relocate to another state. I want to join him so that we can both share the experience and I can find a job in the new state. The problem is my family holds latino traditionalists views meaning that the daughter cannot move out of the house until she is married. My bf and I both think that is too much pressure and we aren't ready for that type of commitment yet. I have tried to talk about this topic of moving out with them but they are adamant about me getting married before moving out with a guy. Mind you, I have been together with my bf since 2008. They say that just because we live in the United States doesn't mean that I'm going to forget about their culture. What can I say to convince them that I want to experience living on my own without being disrespectful to them? pls help",23Apr2019,0
803,"Hi everyone. I recently found my friend’s Reddit account (I am absolutely certain it is them) and have read some worrying things on there. I already know that they have mental health issues and are seeing a therapist for them, albeit irregularly, and I know that they have a support system in place.


However, from reading the posts it seems like they are feeling way worse than they are letting on and that they aren’t telling their family or therapist everything that’s happening. In fact, they’ve told me that they feel like they can’t tell their therapist everything, which I’m sure is not helping.


I understand that recovery is a long and difficult process but I am still incredibly worried for my friend. I would like to talk to them and show them that I’m here for them but I don’t want to let them know that I’ve found their account because it seems to be an outlet for their feelings. How do I help them without letting them know what I’ve found? And what should I do as a whole to help them through recovery? I’m feeling a bit lost and useless right now.

The story:
There are these kids in my history class that just wont shut up. I've told them way too many times to count because I'm an idiot. Eventually I started ""disrupting the class"" so the teacher said she would do something about it. Lo and behold, she doesn't do a single thing. My mom already emailed the person who helps with my IEP or something about this and nothing has been done yet. Just today, the history teacher says that now I have 2 warnings before I either receive a yellow card (which is detention) or go to another classroom, as well as the people who are annoying me.

Hobby-wise I like practising acoustic guitar, though I'm a total beginner/noob.

Also, I've asked my relatives and friends if they think I'm ugly and they said ""no"" (they said I look okay).

Maybe they're lying just to make me feel better about myself.

Honestly, I'm not sure what I need to do to attract girls.

I don't really know how other guys do it, I admit I'm jealous of them.

Do you guys recommend making a habit of going to a gym, then approach girls not at the gym ?

A few years ago I became friends with this person at school and we became supper close and I told her stuff and she basically almost blackmailed me and it was over all the part of my life I most regret.

Than after a year I broke off the friendship. 2 years later (few months ago) I don’t like holding grudges so I asked if she wanted to be friends again and I said yes. Few weeks later she tells me she likes me as more than a friend. I kinda do too. Few more weeks now we’re dating. I haven’t actually been able to see her for a while however as I live out of town and have been busy. I currently regret the choice of saying yes to being her boyfriend.
