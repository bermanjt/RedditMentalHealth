0,"Title pretty much says it all. I don't think I'm overly anti-social, it's just after a day of school I would rather cuddle up in bed and take a nice nap rather than go out and do things. My parents however love forcing me out. They put me into anything and everything, and I end up having to do 5-6 things a week. I try to tell them I'd rather not do some of these things, but they just get more and more aggressive each time I tell them this.

For instance, I told them that I didn't enjoy doing something I signed up for 4 years ago and that they've kept me in. My mother sat me down and talked to me about how this shows that I drop out of something once I don't get enjoyment out of it, and that I will probably apply this to marriage and end up having a divorce.

How do I convince them that I need some free time sometimes? Am I even right here? Or is this normal and I'm just over reacting?",28Sep2019,2

2,"25 year old male. I have health anxiety issues. A month ago I started to feel out of it and like I’m floating and nothing is real. I was calm for the first couple days until day 5 I noticed it wasn’t going away. I’m freaked out by CJD from Chronic Wasting from infected deer cause I hunt in an area where there are deer who have it even though it’s low. 

I went to doctor and got MRI on head and he gave me alprazolam. I’ve been taking it for a week now and taking about four to five .5mg pills a day. 

I now am worried more cause when I wake up I don’t know if my altered state of mind is from something going on actually in my head or if it’s the constant use and hangover effect from the drug? And then i get anxious and take more pills again an hour after I wake up. 

I saw my doctor today to go over my results and I have white matter in my brain which they don’t know it what’s causing it. Doctor said it possibly from playing 10 years of tackle football but I’m freaked out about CJD from infected CWD deer. Also I have a 8mm cyst in my pineal region of brain. 

How do I get off the alprazolam rollercoaster? I can’t tell if my symptoms are persisting anymore or if it’s the side effects of the drug? Symptoms have been same for past month.",28Sep2019,2
4,"Forgive me if I'm not asking exactly for myself here. 

My girlfriend has a (frankly, really shitty) job that requires her to transport people with mental disabilities in her (own, personal) vehicle. The company requires that she carries 100/300/100 insurance. They do not reimburse her for her insurance and due to an accident in March, they're raising her rates to almost 400 a month. 

We've been considering simply going below what the company mandates to save money (she basically makes poverty level wages anyway) but I feel like that opens her up to serious legal problems. 

Obviously we need to find a cheaper provider but I was wondering if anyone had any advice on where to look for a cheaper provider that will get this coverage she needs for her job.

He asked do I make you nervous, I replied a little. He said I noticed you blush whenever you have to talk to me or stop by my desk and he was smiling the whole time. I just kind of joked saying something about he is just that scary and we continued on. I don’t know what to do I don’t want things to get awkward this is an amazing job and he has been great for my career.

If i felt i could tear it out, i would. Even if it bled or hurt i would just tear it out. There are ugly scars all over my body.

I havent been able to breathe out of my right nostril for a year now. I always knew there was something swollen and i saw a doctor and got medication but nothing helped.

I recently began to just tear out the flesh inside until it would let me breathe. It doesnt hurt even if it bleeds and i keep doing it. I dont know if i should mention this to my psychiatrist/counseler or if its something i should just deal eith. Even though i fully know what im doing is wrong i cant help it. Its like an addiction; i have to do it. i HAVE to. I cant tell mt parents and only my sister knows about the mutilation ive done to the inside of my nose.

18,"Hey y'all. I've got a question for what you guys would do, were you in my position.

I'm a 23 year old woman. Back when I was eighteen, I graduated high school and went on to university, because that's what people do these days. I did one semester, got good grades, and actually had a pretty good time all around, but I wasn't particularly invested, so I dropped out, packed my bag, and got on a bus to see where I would end up. My parents (rightly) weren't so sure about this whole thing, but I paid my own way and didn't really need much support, so there was nothing they could do to stop me.

Normally this kind of story ends in either prostitution or McDonald's middle management (I know the line is thin, but I'm told it exists), but I was lucky. I drifted for a couple years, picking up new skills and meeting new people and working a variety of low-paying but interesting jobs. Then, through a combination of a decent brain, a trustworthy face, a few unorthodox skills, and an insane amount of dumb luck, I ended up with a job that I absolutely love and pays more than enough for a young single gal. My parents and relatives know the (very heavily edited) basics of this. They are glad I'm happy even if they don't understand the path I took to get there.

There's a lot I haven't told them though. For reasons I can't quite articulate, I don't like people knowing about what I'm up to until I've already accomplished it. Even once I've accomplished it, I prefer to hoard that for myself and a few of my closest friends rather than telling people. Facebook is pretty much my greatest nemesis - how am I supposed to surprise people at my ten year reunion if Aunt Bertha keeps talking about me online? So, long story short - I've been working on getting my degree piecemeal through an online university (a legit one - don't worry) since I was nineteen. One co-worker knows because I ran into him at an exam invigilation we both attended, but that's it. I'm about halfway through my last course. I'll be done in about three months.

I have this giant file of photocopies of my assignments. My master plan was to just pack these up in a box or really huge envelope or something and send it to my parents along with a copy of my diploma and let them figure it out for themselves. Then, earlier today, they came to visit me. I took them out to dinner, and they were talking about my siblings, who are both finishing their education - a bachelor's degree and teacher's college - and I had this almost uncontrollable urge to tell my parents that I'm also almost done. Look at me too, mom!

They're here for two more days, and I'm worried I'm going to crack and spill the beans. I need advice - do I keep this up? Do I give in and just tell them? If so, how do I slip it into conversation - I'm not used to telling people about what I'm up to! I can't turn back time, but if you were a parent, how would you want to be told about this? Or do I just go through with what I originally planned? It seemed so logical at the time, but now I'm worried I'm being a dick. If you think I should wait - how do I stop myself from just blurting it out?

TL:DR: Spent almost four years getting my degree and never told my parents; now have a borderline uncontrollable urge to tell them, ruining my plan to just send them a box with my diploma and all my essays.

20,"So I have a little brother. He’s seven years old. From the time he was able to show an interest in media such as television, it’s been very clear that more girl themed things seem to appeal to him.

I know he’s still young and I don’t want to force him into being someone he’s not but it’s hard to watch him grow up so differently. He’s somewhat spoiled so it’s hard for me to get him outside of his comfort zone.

I tried to show him these “boy” things I grew up on like cars and motorcycles, dinosaurs, superheroes. Cliche boy stuff. But he just like fantasy Disney tales. Disney princesses to be specific.

He hates video games with any sort of violence. Whenever he plays a video game, he always plays as a girl. His personality and everything. He doesn’t even eat meat! He’s like a natural vegetarian and doesn’t even know it.

I know the most reasonable explanation would be to accept it but it’s so hard when I see the effect it has on his life. In school, with family and with friends he wishes to make.

29,"
I'm part of a big family and I live with my 3 brothers.  We're super tight and I have no issues with them.  I also have 3 stepsisters in my dad side that we don't talk to for family reasons.   One of my step sisters is what I have an issue with.  When I was a toddler, she lied about my parents being physically abusive to my 2 other brothers (3rd one wasn't born at the time), which cause child services to come and take us from our parents.  My parents were jailed and had to pay to get us back from foster care.   

She was just a rebellious child and idk what made her lie.  She lied about ridiculous things my parents have never done anything n my lifetime and abuse that should have left physical scarring but no scars were found.  Nonetheless she was a child and female, as well so ofc the police and child services sided with her.  She didn't go to foster care with my brothers and i.  I don't know anything about her, even her appearance. 

Ironically, foster care is where I experienced physical abuse as a child and that scarred me for a while.  Even after I returned to my parents,. I refused to communicate with them because I was afraid of adults.  I did break out of that phase slowly and I can say I am a sociable person, but very selectively.

So fast forward about 15-16 years, I'm 18 years old and my eldest brother recently saw my stepsister and two half sisters. ( Step sister is the one who lied, half sister didn't. Using two terms to differentiate them).  So he told me had a conversation with them and he gave them his number.  They texted rarely but there was a line of communication.  He did stop talking eventually but I didn't like it at all, for reasons stated earlier. 

I didn't really care at time about if he talked to my stepsister but now that I gave it more thought I really don't know want any connection with her.  That also means no one I know can have connection with her.  I don't want anything to do with her, she seems manipulative and just a terrible person.  I don't even say I have 3 sisters when people ask me, that's how much she isn't a part of my life.  She made her decision when she lied to the police, and she doesn't deserve a second chance.  

For me, that means absolutely zero connection with her. So in the case she finds my eldest brother or any of my other brothers, and they do want to keep a relationship with her or my half sisters(because they talk to my stepsister), would I be wrong for saying I can't be their 'brother""anymore and it's either her or me?

My reason for this is because obviously I don't like her, and I don't want anyone I know having any connection with her because she is going to have some type of indirect connection to me.    Not that my bros have been wanting to.  Just if the situation ever arises.",28Sep2019,1

I have absolutely no idea how to make friends at school. What makes it worse is that it is a charter school, which has a pretty different social dynamic than public schools(I know this because I’ve been to three of them, but I will elaborate on that in a minute) First, some background:

I’m generally known as the “smart” kid. My grades are always straight A’s, and I generally know the answers in class. This isn’t to brag, I’m just good at school. But I don’t think that I’m really more intelligent than other people, I think I just put a little more effort in. I don’t think I’m better than anyone or anything, but people constantly refer to me as the smart person, and it’s incredibly isolating. The only time people talk to me is when they need help with something.

I’ve always been treated as more or less as an adult in my family. People would explain things to me if I asked them, and I’ve always been respected, and I’m very lucky for that. Most of my conversations are about things kids my age don’t normally talk about: my mom and I talk about politics, my dad and I talk about computers, my uncle and I talk about jobs and career prospects, and I talk to my aunt a lot too. So I have pretty good social skills with adults. It’s the same thing with my teachers. I’ve always been interested in speaking with them, and learning about their insight. One of my former teachers and I have a standing lunch date every time i visit the state that I moved away from.

Which brings me to my next point, I moved about a year ago from Florida to North Carolina (very rural North Carolina ). I didn’t have friends at my school last year either, and that really sucked when my whole grade was only 14 people.

It was a charter school. The thing about charter schools is that they are significantly smaller, and people generally stay in them for a long time. That school and the one I was in Florida were k-8, and the school I’m in right now is k-12. Social groups are usually very big and overlapping, and have been solidified by time. My grade is around 50 kids this year, everyone knows everyone else, and everyone has friends groups. There aren’t really cliques either or popular kids either.

Breaking into the circles is SO HARD. In any given class, everyone already knows each other, sits next to their own friends, and only really talks to them. I’ve tried making comments about the class etc to people is to next to, but nothing comes of it. And it is not that I don't try. For example, today in my English class we split into small groups to discuss and fill out a worksheet about an article that we read. My group included some people that I have noticed are very social. So, I tried to make conversation with them. I tried to point something funny out in the magazine the article, one person needed help phrasing something etc. I tried to be involved where I could, but they made it pretty clear that they weren't really interested in talking to me. They weren't rude or anything, but they didn't really engage with me.

Not only that, I don’t understand what they are even talking to each other about. It’s usually Snapchat or memes. Once I was in a class where everyone was literally just walking around and saying “sksksksk” to each other cracking up about it. Like, how do you even respond to that?

I KNOW someone is going to say it. Join a club. I’m in both band and robotics. Very niche interests and still I find myself without friends, because it’s the same situation as o mentioned earlier.

So PLEASE, can I have some advice on making friends?",28Sep2019,13

54,"Recently had flare up for the first time, usually it gets hot hurts a bit then it's done after a nap. This time it was bad, my ENT recommended I have surgery to get it removed as is if it continues it would be bad news. Mentioned how it's a simple procedure.

However, he did say as I'm black there's a greater risk of keloid than other races and they don't know why, I checked around and seems it true. He mentioned it would require plastic surgery and other treatments to remove it if it occurs.

Can any anyone let me know how the procedure is, the length and recovery period? 

How noticeable is it after plastic surgery?

Any one who's ever gotten keloid from this surgery how intrusive is it? Is it painful? Does it affect your everyday life? If you've had the surgery to get it corrected how was it after and did it occur again?

Anyone ever had serious complications from the surgery?",28Sep2019,1

57,"Hi reddit

I went to a party with a couple of friends 3 days ago. Everything was going perfectly, I was getting closer to my crush (who's also part of the group of friends) and everyone was enjoying the night out.  But then a friend of mine offered me some MDMA and I accepted it. It wasn't my first time taking some, but it was my first time such a high dose. After taking it I had a total blackout. 

Today was the first time I met up with some friends who were present and they explained me everything that happened after taking the MDMA. I became waaay too close and pushy with my crush and tried to make out with her even though she pushed me back a couple of times. They told me that she's scared of me now (something I fully understand), but don't want to lose her because that girl is also my best friend. 

I don't know how I'm suposed to fix this, should I try to contact her? What should I tell her?",28Sep2019,3
58,"So the last few years, i’ve gotten in a lot of legal trouble. I live in florida and it’s wild out here, people always rob you and try to fight you so i’ve gotten involved in that a few times and have caught some charges. All of my charges will be wiped off my record when im 19 as long as I don’t get into anymore trouble or else they will become a felony. 

The past few years i really had no goals. I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life and i’ve been really depressed and i really wanted to die and i didn’t care what happened to me. If i spent the rest of my life in prison or not i didn’t seem to care. But recently, i’ve gotten out of that state. I’ve found something I want to follow and achieve in my life, and if i get anymore charges i won’t be able to do so. I figured if i stayed at my current state and didn’t follow my ambition i was going to end up killing myself due to how unhappy i am or i’ll end up in prison eventually. looking at it now, i really chose that i wanted to live and be happy than to be miserable and die. 

I dropped all of my friends who live that gang life style and have been keeping to myself and have completely quit doing illegal and all bad activities because i had an ambition i wanted to protect and i wouldn’t let that be taken away from me.

So today, I was at school and some kid robbed me. I normally would’ve fought back, but i didn’t. i just say there and let him take whatever he wanted. I couldn’t fight him because i had to protect my ambition and i would’ve gone to jail and lost everything i want in my life. i let him rob me and he stole almost $150 of my stuff. If i did anything, I would’ve gone to jail because this happened at a high school and if i fought him i would go to jail immediately.

I don’t really know if i did the right thing. I took an L so i can achieve my goals and follow my ambition, but i let someone walk over me and have their way with me and i feel really weak.

Do you think i did the right thing getting robbed and not defending myself so I can achieve my dreams?",28Sep2019,1

64,"My bf and i work at a very popular coffee shop. A lot of shit has happened and we have no idea what to do, i've gotten advice before but it seems nothing is happening. So i'm gonna sum up the story and add the recent events that had happen EVEN SOME FROM TODAY (so angry and frustrated) 

Bf and i tell the manager we are dating. It's allowed. We both keep it professional no other employee is uncomfortable working with us. We dont even kiss infron of them when we are off. One shift that is a closer with my bf starts harassing me and threatening my job. Saying things like ""if you and your bf keep going down this road you'll be fired or transferred"". Then told me i was transferring. The manager didnt have any clue. This shift would text my bf late at night asking him to come over because his fiancé is asleep. Or ""i got permission from my fiancé inm coming over"" without even asking my bf. He's called my bf cute on several occassions, tried touching his hair and hugging him. He kept my bf till 12 pm at work for closing. Closing is done by 10pm. My bf was uncomfortable and HATED going to work. 

My manager went to my bf about having me transferred. He and i both knew that shift got in her ear and reported everything. Oh did you know my tires were slashed on the job site?! And the only employee that knows what my car looks like is that shift. He even told another employee ""does she know i'm cute enough to steal him away from her?""

This manager told us ""ive worked at 10 different stores and never had a case of sexual harassment so idk what steps to take"" wtf? Are you stupid?! The policy is a ZERO TOLERANCE. Even if the employee hasnt touched him or anything IF HE FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE ITS HARASSMENT! She tried doing the ""well you're still getting transferred but if you (my bf) want to be scheduled at different times then we can do that."" No what the fuck? We both asked to be transferred to different stores. Lmao we ended up at the same fucking closer to where we live. Lmao i was getting transferred because of our relationship 🤦🏻‍♀️.  

We wrote our reports and sent them to her. She lost them the same day. How do you lose an email immediately?! Oh yeah and the day after we made the report, she told us ""you wont have to work with him."" Guess who i had to work with? I sucked it up even though i was on the brink of a panic attack for 4 hours. I ran out if there after i clocked out and cried outside in an alley, texted the manager who left me on fucking read. This shift then went to slander me in a note that he left on the managers desk saying I walked off the job. 

It's been 2 months. We were told we would get an update 2 weeks ago. We messaged the manager and she left us on read. Then called us a few days later to meet up. Guess what happened today? This fucking creepy asshole walks into our new store happy as fuck. I ran in the back because i was on the regisyer and told my new manager who actually cared and tried comforting me. Oh let me also bring up, i was told multiple times this case has nothing to do with me and it's my bf's problem so i shouldnt be calling the manager asking or getting updates for him. This fucking bitch i'm so done. 

This guy even texted my bf a ""thumbs up"" when my tires were slashed. Then a ""can we talk there seems to me a misunderstanding this is so unfair"" then when one of our other coworkers had to cover there for 2 weeks, he said on the last day this shift tells him ""dont believe anything that kid says he's a liar"". We have texts, we have so much fucking proof. We are literally standing beside ourselves dealing with this. Our new store is hard to work at and we got less hours when we were transferring. We were being fucking punished for reporting something. Im so over this. We have to wait till the case is closed to talk to our attorney, we have to call the state at this point and i have to look up how to file a restraining order. All because some incompetent manager doesnt know what ZERO TOLERANCE means and didnt want to fire him. What the fuck do i do?",28Sep2019,2

I’m never going to leave him and I will always love him. Help I don’t want him to leave me. Basically what happened (before we were dating) was there was a group of people running a meme page, and they had an email that they gave me to make a new account for them. The email didn’t work and it was so long ago I don’t remember exactly what happened, anyway I just left it and one of the people from the group messaged me. There was nothing going on between us. I just became his sort of therapist. He had bad mental health issues and he would talk to me about it. I was just there to listen. When me and my bf started dating, I stopped texting him. One day I was at the mall with my friend and my bf. 9 hours ago this dude sent me a snap. I didn’t open it or reply to it. I let my boyfriend look through my phone cuz I have nothing to hide. And my friend let’s call her k was like oh that’s not a good idea. So she goes through my phone and see this snap from the dude. So I explain who it is and everything. And my bf thinks I’m cheating. He always brings this up and says that “I replied to it” even though I know I didn’t. I blocked the person. My bf is not believing this story. I know the truth and I tell him the truth. He says that he trusts me when I know he doesn’t. My family has been cheated on before and cheating is a horrible thing, and I know I would never do that. I am so in love with my bf and we’re gonna be together forever. But I don’t like that he doesn’t trust me. I just want him to know that I love him and I’ll love him forever and I would never wanna do anything bad to hurt him. I would never cheat.

71,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons...

Some backstory:
I had my last day at work a few days ago where I transitioned into a new position within the same company. It’s been a thing that my boss is extremely unprofessional and talks shit about literally everyone. To each other. We all know this because some of us are friends and we all talk. 

When I left, he (boss) has been talking to my past coworkers and telling them things like I have a huge record at HR and basically shitting on me entirely. He also has refused to give me credit for any of my work because he doesn’t like me (this is a different issue). 

So, the atmosphere he has created is extremely unprofessional. People cuss, they make jokes, everyone does it. I understand that does not make it okay in the workplace. 

IF I were to go to HR and ask them about this seemingly large file on me that my previous boss is telling everyone I have, what are ways this could come back on me? Am I able to speak to an HR person to get advice on how to proceed or does that automatically make it reportable? 

I left because he is completely crazy, screams at people, talks shit left and right, and was an asshole to the point of me deciding it was an unhappy work environment. I want to go to HR because I don’t think he should continue getting away with these things without consequences. I feel like I would be standing up for myself and everyone he’s done this to. 

My question that I need advice on is should I? Why or why not?

I'm struggling everyday with thoughts of how my ex convinced me I'm crazy and can't support myself, while he was seeing another woman. I think of his words everyday and cannot focus on school. How do I move on from it?

I have never posted here before, I am sorry if I'm breaking rules. Please be kind because I'm desperate for help with this. 

I started dating my ex 1.5 yrs ago. We actually got back together after a long break. I felt that he was right for me and I made a mistake for leaving him (similar feelings persist). 

After a while I realized there were girls things in his home. I kept trying to talk to him about it and he chalked it up to he just has a roommate to help him with his kid. Later I found her name on a letter, it was his ex girlfriend. He denied it being her for months until finally last November he moved. He said she would be gone once he moved. I did some digging to find the answer myself and it was her. My heart was broken. They own the new house together. 

He continued to say she was leaving and only there to help him. At this point I wanted to talk to her. I went to bed every night wondering what was going on, as I was told one thing, that he loved me, but left alone every night bc I wasn't allowed over when she and his kid were home. 

I was crushed for so long but held on because he made me believe I'm insane and paranoid. Everything was in my head. He would ghost me whenever I brought up that Im upset that I can't see him when she is home. Told me I need psychological help and, by the things he was telling me I actually believed him, that I'm crazy and he's doing me a favor by being the only one who could love me. Also would bring up how I can't support myself with my job and that I need him. He told me his ""roommate"" would call the cops on me if I tried to contact her to get the truth. So I never was able to ask her what's going on. 

I should note he had studied social engineering.. ""people hacking"" for his work. 

Now, it's been a couple weeks since I broke it off. The last time we spoke he again told me it is my fault. I don't  know how I can get past it, bc my view of myself has drastically changed. I cry everyday. I'm in college and sometimes I have to walk out of classes because I feel so incredibly hurt by the ordeal. I have been having nightmares about him and his roommate.

82,"So after growing up poor as a kid and constantly jumping apartment to apartment to eventually living with our grandparents, I told myself I would save enough that I'd never have to live in an apartment, I'd buy my own home. Well luckily back in 2012 I was able to buy my own home. It took a lot of work, as soon as I got a job at 17 I paid $300 a month for room and board, and on top of that save enough for a down payment. I only mention this because I don't want people to immediately think my parents must have spoiled me in order for me to get a home at a young age. I took care of myself as well as my ill-grandparents whom we lived with until their passing. I've always been incredibly self-reliant.

So come 2012 I finally save enough to buy a home. I was so proud of myself, a nice house with a huge yard, 4 bedrooms, basement, detachable garage, it was mine. Not even two months after, my Older brother and my mother asked to move in with me. Them being family, and all I have, of course I said yes. Plus hey, they paid rent so more money for me to do projects on the house. 

Well fast forward to now, my brother got married and moved out, however my mother still lives with me and she also adopted this all White German Shepherd (named Ziggy Stardust because of his two different colored eyes) who has severe PTSD. We adopted him from Georgia where instead of his puppies taking a beating for the things puppies do, his owner gave him all of it instead. He is the most lovable and playful dog in the world, and I love him so much. We trained him pretty well, but he's also a bit of a free thinker and incredibly smart. He also doesn't trust strangers. It take A LOT of time in order for him to feel comfortable with someone, like it would have to take a couple days of just ignoring each other so he knows he can relax. In the meantime however he is incredibly protective of my mother and I now. He will actually get in between me and other family members, even to go as far as trying to herd me to back into the house. He also flashes his teeth and is incredibly intimidating, however he doesn't have it in him to bite, I am aware it is still a risk and always still a possibility so we do everything we can to do introductions in a safe, calming, and neutral environment. Trying to move him somewhere, even if it was at my brothers for a day, his PTSD is going to kick in and he'll become incredibly stressed because it would be a new environment and I wouldn't be there. Also yes, my dog is closer to me than my mother.

Now my mom is disabled, she can take care of herself and fully functioning, but after receiving a Lymphadenectomy in both of her arms, she is incredibly limited to anything that is physical. I love my mom, but her personality type is overbearing, over-dramatic, destructive and it drives me insane. She complains all the time. I actually counted and 9 days in a row the first thing she would say to me in the morning would be a complaint about something so tiny, like about a post on Facebook. Personal space is also serious issue, I bought this house with my hard earned money and pretty much threw away my 20's for it, but now it feels like a prison. I'm at the point where I have all this space but I lock myself in my office as soon as I get out of work. I sometimes just work OT so I don't even need to go home. I will say I am currently waiting to hear some quotes from contractors to build a guest house so we can finally be apart but close by if there's an emergency.

Well to the point, I would love to throw a huge party with my friends from work. Not like a wine and cheese party, but like a loud music, drinking, marijuana(legal in my state) kind of party. The only issue is I have 0 idea how to get them both out of the house. I could get her a hotel for the night, but the dog I don't know. I could keep him locked in a room, but I think the loudness of it all is going overwhelm him greatly. I honestly don't know what to do, but I haven't felt like a homeowner since I let my family move in. I've never had company over yet and would LOVE to finally host something after 7 years.

tl;dr: Owned a home for 7 years, mother asked to move in when I bought it and reluctantly said yes. She has a PTSD stricken dog who can get aggressive and she to is also functionally disabled. I want to throw a huge party with friends at work and need to find a way to get them both out for at least a night so I can feel like I own a home and not a room.",28Sep2019,1
85,"My boyfriend and I dated around 15 years ago, I was into him more than he was into me and I was his first girlfriend. 

At Christmas I bought him what I felt was an appropriate gift for how long we'd been together; a bottle of jack, 2 CD's and music book for his favourite songwriter, maybe also a flask...he got me a CD, not even a good CD, he'd also just wrapped a load of wrapping around it to make it look like it was something more so it was an incredibly awkward exchange. 

I've never been good at judging appropriate gifts.

It's no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.""*

We reconnected a year ago and have been dating 2-3 months now - this time around I think he's more into me than I'm into him, but that doesn't translate to a thoughtful or significant gift. To make things more difficult we're both poor but I'm especially struggling financially right now, plus his birthday is two weeks before Christmas - twice the gifts! 

Can you see why I'm a little anxious about getting him a gift? 

Christmas is a while away but I've no idea what to get him - he's a barman, he's a musician, he's a language nerd (Spanish particularly) - it's mainly an issue with the ""*commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship""*, I don't want a repeat of the cringe gift exchange experience all those years ago. How do I determine an appropriate gift?",28Sep2019,1

87,"So I just got out of a pretty good relationship that was over a year and a half and it was really hard on me when things split off. But now I’ve gotten in another relationship 2 months after the breakup and I kinda hate myself. I don’t feel happy about anything with it really. Plus, don’t judge me, it’s an ex. I don’t know what to do. I feel like an idiot and it feels like a rebound relationship that I’m in with my ex and so many people tell me to not go back to an ex and then there’s some that say do what makes you happy. But I’m not sure if I am happy. Like should I drop the ball and split from this current one and go solo to figure out who I am? Or don’t? I’d hate to feel like an ass and quit on my ex so suddenly. It just feels wrong to do that. Help would be appreciated. I’m just so lost",28Sep2019,1

I’m terrible at talking in person and every time I see her, I just get so nervous and I can’t figure out a way to get the correct words out to ask her out for a coffee. I always feel scared that she’ll say no and the people in line behind me will laugh at me. I know it’s stupid but sometimes I’ll buy groceries less often and go to the store more often. I don’t know if that’s weird, or creepy. I work at a Tim Hortons nearby (down the street practically) and I’m wondering is that cool to ask her out for a coffee? I see her come in all the time for a coffee but I do the baking so I don’t actually get to talk to her often. There’s a place that sells sweets nearby that offers coffee in the morning. Would that be a better place to go? I just want to start talking to her and getting to know her because there’s never enough time in the small conversations we get to have. I don’t know what to stop doing when I get to the till. I just panic like “oh, I’m already here” and I find myself looking down because I get too shy to look at her.

92,"Ok so in 3rd grade, this boy and I were like really good friends. One day he confessed to me that he liked me but I just brushed it off even though I secretly had a crush on him too at the time. In fact, I think he was my first crush? However, we weren’t in the same class for the next few years until 7th grade where we were forced to sit next to each other in Spanish class. We talked and he eventually just randomly asked if I remembered how we were in the same class in 3rd grade. We talked a little more about it but that was pretty much the extent to our conversations. However, I still sorta had a crush on him at the time. Fast forward to high school where we had a history class together. Keep in mind, we hadn’t talked in like a few years so when he just randomly asked me how I’m doing out of the total blue, I was completely confused and just said good and didn’t continue the conversation. This happened a good couple of times lmao. I guess i just felt awkward with him being the awkward teenager I was (and still am). Maybe also awkward with the fact that I had once had a crush on him.... then now I see him in the hallway and we sometimes make eye contact but we don’t say hi to each other but i guess i still can’t keep him off of my mind? Like I’m VERY aware that I’m passing by him and it’s not like he’s another guy passing by me. Like just yesterday he had sat at the table next to me in the library and i felt conscious that he was there. And then today he sat at the table behind me and i felt conscious once again haha.... i don’t have feelings for him anymore since we literally don’t talk, but i feel like an awkward tension if that makes sense? You know how there’s like a saying that you never forget your first love? Is that saying kind of like this but instead I can’t forget my first crush (cuz I never loved him lol)?

Basically, Norman likes Michelle and has liked her since like the 5th grade. We’re seniors in high school now and he still likes her. Many people know that Norman likes Michelle, including Michelle herself, but Norman doesn’t know that she knows.

What happened was that my friend Andrew brought up something about Norman liking someone, and I slipped up and said that I already knew that Norman liked Michelle. He asked me how I knew (especially because Norman and I aren’t very close) and I said that Michelle told me cuz she knows about him liking her. He didn’t know that she knew and now I’m worried that he might tell Norman about it since him and Norman are close.

Am i overthinking all of this? I’m really close to Michelle and I only told Andrew because I trust him and I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, but knowing how close him and Norman are makes me wonder if he might tell Norman about what I told him. When I told Andrew about this, he said this is “hardcore stuff” so now I’m worried about how Norman would react if he found out.",28Sep2019,1

me and my ex boyfriend met in late january, started dating at the end of march. we were really great together, no problems. after three months, we broke up. it was hard on me but we stayed friends, as he was just in a bad place. he had an awful week and let the hurt effect everything, and ended up relying too much on me for happiness. we took some time apart, but started hanging out regularly again. 

now here’s the bad part. 

we started hooking up, not just hanging out, having sex then leaving. we’re really close, he’s my best friend. but we sleep together and for a little bit this caused some problems w emotions but we both came to terms w the fact that this is the only thing that will work for us right now. he’s very busy, and i’ve been very depressed. i don’t want a relationship because i don’t want to rely on them then have nothing if they leave. we are not exclusive, but we tell each other if we’ve slept w someone new. no names, just so the other person can get tested and feel secure. anyway, he met this girl. they hung out a few times and he likes her a little, but told me he doesn’t see it going anywhere. he can’t handle a relationship right now either. i’ve had trouble trusting him due to things in the past, but we got through them and i trust him now. he called her and talked to her about it, she was very cool about it all. she’s super nice and said being friends was fine with her. they’ve never done anything, no kissing etc

my problem is, when i heard ab her i got really jealous. i’ve been going back and forth in my head trying to figure out why. am i still in love with him ? or is it bc i’m at a bad place and he’s my only friend ? or could it be bc i’m jealous that he has opportunities to be in a relationship and i don’t. i don’t know what to do. i want him in my life, but i couldn’t handle it if he had a girlfriend. i know he would see me less, and talk to me less. i don’t think he’s going to get a girlfriend anytime soon, but when he does he’ll be gone. i don’t want that. should i just drop him now ? or see what happens ? i know this is all pretty messy. but he means the world to me and idk what i’d do with out him, and not only does he say those same things to me, he proves it. i just need help getting past this and figuring everything out.",28Sep2019,1

The people in my dorm suite as well as the rest of the people in my “section” as they’re called are pretty nice and sociable.  Initially I tried hanging out with them.  They’re fairly nice, and open and don’t really mind me hanging out with them but I just feel like I didn’t fit in very well with them so I’ve been hanging out with them less and less.  They’re all very sociable and for the most part I enjoy hanging out with them, but I feel like I rarely talk in the group (I’m more introverted I guess) so I’m just sitting there most of the time.

Everytime I saw her, I would wave hi and walk to her and ask her about her day and small talk. I asked if she'd like to be study partners and work on projects together and she said, ""yeah."" Just recently before class she went to make a phone call and I could overhear her entire 
conversation in the hallway.

He’s not violent or anything, but it’s disgusting how he slurs and hiccups and just *acts*. I don’t know what to do about it. 

It’s really getting out of control. Or rather, it’s always been out of control, but I guess I just realized how out of control it is now. 

He comes home, practically raids the fridge and pantry every night, eating sloppily smacking and slurping and chomping really loudly, with a beer in his hand. 

He tries to make conversation with me but I can barely stand to look at him. I just make small gestures instead of answering. 

My mom told me that he hates how I treat him. I’ve lost almost all respect I had for him. He made a deal with my little sister and I that he would stop drinking, but a month and a half later, and nothings changed. No amount of tears or begging will make him stop. 

He tells me I’m disrespectful towards him, but even when he’s sober, it just disgusts me. *He’s* the one ruining the relationship. When I try to tell him that it’s because of his drinking, he responds with “you’re mad about *that*??” or “If you knew half the stress I was under..” I understand he has a lot on his hands, but so do I. He tells me I’m lazy and don’t understand what he does, but I get up, go to marching band before school, go through the day, then go to practice for two hours, and some days I go to church until 8.

For the past few days, I have wanted to be alone, away from people, without having to socialize, I have felt sad, and I have felt exhausted. I haven’t wanted to talk to anyone, not even my friends. I am an introvert but I think this is much worse than normal. I have been feeling exhausted even though I’m getting the same amount of sleep as any other day. I have also been feeling sad. The other day, I was walking home from school and started crying for no reason, and my eyes have filled with tears in random parts of the day. Nothing bad has been happening so I don’t understand what is going on. There could be a chance it is stress, but school has been relatively easy lately.

118,Okay so here’s the thing. My boyfriend has recently been hanging out with this girl who he used to be with. They weren’t ever officially dating but they were definitely more than friends. We’ve been together over a year and I actually used to be friends with the girl and we met through her but her and I slowly grew apart. Recently she and him linked back up and started hanging out. Neither of them invite me and I know they wouldn’t do anything now bc she knows I’m still around and I know he would never do anything but it still makes me upset and I feel really weird when they are hanging out. I’ve talked to him about how I’m uncomfortable with it but he says it makes him feel as though I don’t trust him. I do trust him though I’m not sure why I get so worked up. I’m trying to get better at being okay with it but it’s really hard. Am I being crazy about the situation? How should I handle this?,28Sep2019,5

However, it doesn't look like she is in any of my classess, so I'm not too sure how to get to know her? I was wondering, what could I do to approach her or try to know her better and see where it goes?

Also, since we have mutuals, would it be weird for me to follow her on insta?",28Sep2019,1
120,"Hey so, it's been a crazy ass day. TL:DR and my actual question at the bottom. 

This random cat got into my house through our dog door and was pretty chill at first. I got the owners number from the tag and put it outside. once I got near the exit the cat freaked out and scratched the shit out of me. Got it out of the house, went to the urgent care just in case. Filled out the animal bite/scratch paperwork and all that. 

Well, the cat kept coming back. The owner came over and tried to get his cat but the cat scratched the shit out of him too. the cat jumped the fence and the owner told me to just call animal control. Well, Animal control never answered me after three calls and never called back after I left a message. 

I eventually tried to trap the cat, and nearly did but it got out of the cat carrier at the last second. I had to fight with the cat again and got scratched up good again trying to restrain the cat ( total of like 30 scratches at this point). got the cat restrained under some blankets and tried to call animal control again. Well, I guess there were closed?!? (Animal control closes?!?!?!?!??!?!?!) so we called the police and we were told THAT THEY WOULD NOT HELP US, AND WE NEEDED TO CALL A 24 HOUR VET. WTF. 

Got in contact with the owner and he came by and together we were able to get the cat wrapped up in like 4 blankets and put into a box and he took the cat from there. 

That's all taken care of, im taking care of my wounds and watching for infection and all that. I'm assuming the cat will go into a 10 day watch to watch for signs of rabies (though I was assured that would be virtually impossible) 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my question: Is there a way I can lodge a formal complaint against my local police department? I was attacked in my own home by a wild animal and they told me to call a local vet. They can sit there and speed trap all fucking day and extort me and others for money but when I AM ATTACKED IN MY OWN FREAKING HOUSE they do nothing. What are my options?",28Sep2019,0

123,"Long post, so kudos to those who read this and actually have insight after all this.

Little back story, grew up in a very social life. Had great friends, and great fun. Partied it up, dated, traveled with friends, you name it. Always someone to talk to along the way.

Cue working in the oilfield, which I've done since 2007 now. Working half the year, 14 days off and 14 days on at first. Eventually to become 28 on/28 off as it is now. It can be hard for a variety of reasons. But it's granted me a great life that I'm very proud of, and Ive had some amazing experiences from it. 

Cue the ex wife. Blasts into my life, things escalate quick. We're heavily integrated into each other's friend circles pretty quick, and socializing and having lots of fun. As years go by though. Ended up pregnant, eventually insecurities on her behalf started coming out and we started backing off on the socializing. Friends of ours started fading off. I had to start cutting out some friends for her, and then some for my own reasons as it was time for us to really start growing up. Remaining friend circles became very small and have stayed that way. But at the time, it was okay. We had each other and our little family and that was all we needed. She didn't work for most of the relationship, but started to in the last few years.

Time passes in the relationship(10 years), she gets lonely, invites others to fulfill her loneliness, and I find out. Tried to make it work, failed, kept getting hurt. Game over, get out.

About a year passes afterwards where I'm focusing on myself and my kids. When I'm home, I have my kids. I stayed kinda in a bubble and that's where I wanted to be. It was good. Healed my emotional pain, grew myself, learned a lot. Never really felt lonely during this time because it was such a busy time of rebuilding my life, strengthening my bonds with my children and reassuring them that things would be fine, and finding myself again. Finally decided it was time to get out and make some friends. Tried finding new groups. Tried inviting a few old friends to reconnect that seemed like they'd gotten their lives back on track, but mostly it fizzled out or I quickly realized they weren't people I wanted around. Many people flaked. It was all pretty short-lived TBH. I stopped trying to find friends when one of them, female, ended up unexpectedly becoming someone of interest quickly and we started getting intimate and dating. Same relationship I'm in now. 

Now. Here's where the loneliness starts to come in, and here's where it gets confusing and difficult for me. So, the girlfriend and I live about a half hour apart. She has two kids and she works a lot. I'm home every other month and we plan our time to maximize what we get together. She just can't be there every evening, which is something I've had to adjust to (remember, it's been a decade of ONE person. Anyone I date will take getting used to) The time we spend together is generally amazing. It's tough sometimes but it works, I have no complaints. I feel like my issue doesn't stem from her or the relationship at all.

What I've realized, though, is that in this new phase of my life that is so vastly different than my old phase.... I'm alone sometimes and I dread every second of it. It's just me and my youngest daughter alone a lot. I love our time together and dread when they're both with their mom for their visit. I'm without the kids sometimes during their visit days(next year they'll BOTH be in school, and I'll be alone all day mon-fri til 330. I'm dreading it badly) and I'm often without the girlfriend around. In this idle time, my stress and anxiety shoots through the roof because I'm alone, don't want to be, don't really have anyone to go to, I don't know HOW to be alone, and yet need to learn how so that I can function better as an adult. I dread everything about it. Call it a crisis, idk haha.

And herein lies the problem. I wish to learn how to be able to be alone. I can't watch TV, or sit at the computer or behind my phone, or do an activity and feel content. If I have laborious projects, I really enjoy myself. But that only comes around so often. I kinda have nobody to go to except my girlfriend and my family for conversation. I just sit in silence in these times, because everything just feels so......empty to me without someone around. I absolutely don't enjoy my hobbies for some reason unless I'm sharing them with others. However, at the same time I'm realizing that I really need to learn how to spend my time alone partaking in the things I enjoy because this is sometimes just part of life too.

I went to see a therapist for a little while. The result was extremely discouraging. She flat out told me that given my situation, and what's going on, and that it was all so foreign and conflicting to her, she didn't know how to help me. Which I could tell through her facial expressions the past few sessions....she was a bit puzzled what to say. And blatantly told me that coming to her wasn't a good usage of my time, and that I shouldn't book another appointment with her. I paid someone to tell me not to come back. 

Now bear in mind, through ALL of this, I'm traveling every other month across the planet. I don't know if that plays a role in this, but I suspect so. I'm sure there's lots of pertinent details I'm missing, and am happy to answer any questions. But I'm kinda at a loss on what to do. I feel like the solution might be something so simple, but I've made a mountain out of this molehill in my mind and can't find my way to the bottom of it.


TL;DR feel lonely sometimes, don't know how to be alone. Need to learn how to be alone, but need to not feel lonely. I'm crazy, I know.",28Sep2019,1

127,"
I’m a junior in college and I still have no friends. I go to a large university and have had no luck finding any friends, not even acquaintances really.
For background, I started out at this school my freshman year and had a miserable time, and ended up transferring to a very small school my sophomore year. It was okay there, I made a couple “friends” but they ended up stop talking to me and legit told me they didn’t want to hang out with me anymore. So I ended up leaving that school, took a semester off, and now I’m back at my first school (the large one) since it’s a good school and I hoped things would go differently.

Well, they haven’t. It’s halfway through the semester and I have got no friends. I have joined so many clubs. Two clubs relating to my major, an anime club, a paranormal club, and a fashion club. None of these people I have connected with at all. I know how to talk to people, I’m not shy. It just SUCKS because all of these people who are new and came to the clubs alone too are all friends now and have hung out together. I talk to them at the club but they all started to hang out outside of the club. I even have asked them if they wanted to go to a club event with me or grab dinner after the club and no one has ever said yes.

Even in my classes I try. My one class we were assigned groups for a project we have to work on all semester, and before our first exam I just asked hey anyone want to study? Just small casual things to start out. One of them said yes and to meet them at the library, and they never showed up. Never answered my wya texts or anything and the next day at class didn’t mentioned it.

Like I don’t get it. I’m just not a person that can easily make connections with people for some reason. I’m honestly not sure why? Like I can talk to people and be fun but no one ever likes me? I am just stuck. I feel like I’ll never make any friends at this point. I’ve never had true friends in high school, just people I sat at lunch with, never hung out outside of school. So it just sucks to have this feeling that I’m going to be friendless my whole life and theres nothing I can do to change that. I have tired every single thing people have suggested on “how to make friends in college” threads. Join clubs, actually talk to people, don’t be needy, etc. but none of it has worked.

I was just hoping anyone had some life changing advice that would help me find at least one person that I can become friends with.

TLDR: I’m a junior in college that has tried absolutely everything to make friends and none of it has worked, so I’m feeling very hopeless. Any advice?",28Sep2019,1

The group was known mainly as ""those assholes"" which I was fine with it, it's sorta what guided me to who I am today. At the time I was this edgy little shit, long hair that covered my face, sweater even in the summer, the works.

I left for about 6 months about a year ago and things have been a little off since I came back. People are in different relationships, everyone even acts differently. Some shitty drama happened and the group even split off some of members and replaced them with some other kids I've never met before. So it was a bit jarring to say the least

But as of recently, even if some of us did have our differences, I was being shit on more than usual. I'm not one to hold a grudge and I feel I do make mistakes as we all often do. But even so, I don't see why they need to up and just insult me. For example we were talking about the football game that was tonight and I was saying I couldn't go because broke boy, and it was just 2-3 people saying ""maybe you shouldn't anyways"" an I was sorta taken back. Like there wasn't anything to sanction this to my knowledge. A little uncalled for but whatever, I didn't let it get to me.

Then, one of my closest friends whose split from the group due to drama, was hanging out for the first time in a while, I told her what I was feeling at the time as it was a whole ""well shit, I don't think they like me very much...""

They remain extremely good friends. My mother is a psychiatrist, which is a hard job and my dad was a stay at home dad (I was living at his house), doing little stuff to get money. So having reversed roles, my mother was giving alimony to my dad (I won’t give the details, but it was a pretty big amount). This amount was set by a lawyer, considering my mom was making a lot of money as a psychiatrist. This was supposed to be a good thing for both, as it was a way to keep more money in the family. Their contract also included many other parts that I don’t understand, made to fructify both of their money for shared futur. My mother never really understood how to manage her money, and with her intense job she was happy to have my father take care of that for her. So my dad was taking care of me, managing his money and my mother’s money, investing, giving her advice for her job, and in the last 3 years he was her « secretary », organizing her agenda and all the paperwork,talking to her clients, etc. I don’t think my mom would have been able to do her job without my father’s help.

For the 8 years following the divorce, both my parents stayed celibate, and I think my mom was still in love with my dad all this time. 2 years ago, my dad dated another man, and my mom reacted badly, saying he abandoned her and things like that. My dad has always been very clear that they were just friends and they wouldn’t get back together. The conflict didn’t last, since his boyfriend broke up shortly after. (My mother had no reason to be jealous anymore) 

 But summer 2018, my dad met his new boyfriend while he was traveling, and brang him back to our house for the summer, so I could meet him and all. About 2-3 weeks after he met the guy, my mom met her new boyfriend online. A few weeks later, she decided to go see a lawyer, and send a letter to my dad saying she wanted to stop their contract, accusing him of taking her money. My dad was insulted that she would throw away what they built together over all those years, and that she would do something like this without talking to him, which resulted in the end of their friendship. 

Soon after that, my dad sold our house and moved to Mexico with his boyfriend (I wasn’t living in the family house anymore). Even though my dad was kind of controlling when I was younger (controlling toward my mother and me but not abusive in any way), I’ve always been closer to him, since he raised me more and we’re more alike, so I really miss him. Meanwhile, my mom lives only 1h30 from me but im not very close to her, not because she’s a bad person or mother, on the contrary, but we’re just unable to bond for some reason. My mother’s boyfriend (who I don’t like and don’t trust) wrote to my dad, saying extremely mean things and threatening him (he’s also openly homophobe in those correspondences). My mother is also saying she’s doesn’t have anymore money, and stopped working due to anxiety. 

I am aware that my dad may have taken advantage of the situation he was in with my mother, but who doesn’t? And as he (and our family) says, he found ways to pay back my mother and fructify our family’s money. 

It’s been a year since their fight begun, and I still can’t figure out who to trust... is my dad a bad person and actually stole money from my mother or is it my mother that reacted with jealousy and can’t understand her finances, while being influenced by her boyfriend? 

I have a tendency to trust my father, so is my bestfriend (who knows both my parents since we’re 5) but my boyfriend can’t believe my mother would do all this if it wasn’t true, and I get his point. 

 It stresses me and affects my relation with both of them, I would love if you took the time to tell me what you think of this story, or maybe give me some advice! 

Thank you for reading all of this and I’m sorry if I wasn’t so clear, my first language is french. :)",28Sep2019,2

So i had been dating this girl for about 2 years and everything was good for the start but she started flirting with other guys, and when i told her i didnt like it she said she would stop but i caught her several times flirting with guys when she thought i wasnt there, i then found out she sent nudes to 11 different guys while we were dating and when i confronted her about it she denied it even when i had proof i decided to stay with her (apparently im too nice when it comes to giving people second chances) then she started to flirt with my best friend who immediately told me and blocked her but i told him to keep going but not to flirt just to see what happened (its dishonest ik but i couldnt help it) and within 5 mins of them talking she sent him nudes and told him not to tell me, but once again i stayed with her because i didnt want to be alone, and recently i had been having nightmares and waking up in a cold sweat wondering why i wasnt good enough so i decided to break it off, she went off saying that it was all my fault that she cheated and how she loves me so much that i should reconsider my decision and i kind of feel like shit and want to reconsider it, so i guess i was just kind of asking it i made the right decision and what to do now to get over it",28Sep2019,1

164,"I feel like a clown for even being in this position. Why? Because I'm too emotional for my own liking

So here's the overall gist of the situation. I'm in my early 20s, he's in his early 30s. He claims that every girlfriend he's had was a result of her asking him out first. I believe it. He seems to be competent but also a little passive at work (female colleagues manage to get him to do a lot more than he has to sometimes). So, yes, I ended up telling him that I liked him after getting impatient. I already felt that he liked me because of him being helpful, blushing whenever I said something nice, being a good listener, attentive/remembering everything I say and caring. He told me he likes me too, but that he wants me to think things through first (because life stages, experience, age gap, commitment stuff (he seems to want it to work longterm), quality time need differences). He also said that he'll be fine being my friend and that he wants to get to know me more and for me to get to know him more. He seems to be worried I have the wrong idea of him and that I'll get disappointed, etc.

And the thing is, my concerns aren't with the age stuff or his love for spending his free time at home. I know that my concern lies with the communication and quality time issue. He's a busy man *and* also needs a lot less quality time to be happy. In fact, he seems to be happy to see me after I haven't seen him in two weeks etc. Whereas, whilst I'm happy too, I feel more reserved because the lack of communication over text makes me feel like he isn't interested in me at all. He made it clear that he isn't a texter, and that he doesn't text his bestest longterm friends, and prefers in-person communication. He is great in person, but there's not enough time. How do I reconcile with this? How can I reassure myself of his interest (if he has any)?

I value independence and want to move out in the future. 

I’m a senior in high school and it’s time to look at unis. The programs in my city aren’t as good as the ones outside the city. So this seemed like a good opportunity to not only live alone, but to also get into a promising program. 

The problem is my parents. They hate the idea of me moving out. My sister moved out when she got a new position for a job, and my parents reacted negatively (though she is moving back next year)

But this issue is also deep rooted in the culture I come from. Girls are supposed to move out only when they get married, but it’s more acceptable for guys to leave prior. So my parents never anticipated us daughters leaving. Another issue is that mothers in my culture have the sole life purpose of raising their kids. So when taking care of a child is all the meaning in your life, you’ll suffer when they leave. 

My mother suffered the most. Since I was the only child at home to see it, I know how she’ll break when I leave. 

It is my dream to move out and I’ve day live abroad for a while since I never travelled growing up. My parents know I want to move out and react negatively. My sister is also very much against me moving out because she doesn’t like living alone and doesn’t want me to go through the same. 

I feel like if I wasn’t from my culture or had parents with this mindset, I wouldn’t have to go through this. All my years of hope for the future of moving out were crushed in the span of a few weeks. 

With this situation, what do you think I should do? Should I seriously apply for a university that’s outside of the city or should I stay at home with my parents?",28Sep2019,1

Her exact words were: “You and your dad are scheming a plan to make my life miserable,”
I told her that it’s ridiculous, that we’re not little jealous kids, and. since I’m very busy with school (I’m a senior in HS) and that my dad has his own life, and that  I have a life of my  own life to care that much about hers.
She says that it’s suspicious that my relationship with my dad has improved.
It’s so RIDICULOUS. Like, I genuinely laughed when she said that. I just stepped out of the car and said “I don’t have time for this. I’m going to class”. And went to school.

I find myself talking and just think- stop, stop, stop! No more talking! I need it to be quiet, this person hates me now. I talk so much! 

Even when everything is silent and I’m not in a conversation, I say something. I hate noise and talking. But I also hate silence. I have a cousin(a distant cousin who probably hardly realizes I even exist) that I keep texting for some reason. Funny joke? I send it to them. Dog picture? I send it to them. What I fucking had for dinner? Send it. But I hate this! I try so hard to think before I speak. Talking ALWAYS gives me a headache. I have the attention span of a puppy at a parade. Why? And after talking is done and I’m alone, I always- ALWAYS try and remember what I said. If I can remember, I replay it in my head and think how much better I could said it. Whether it was appropriate. Whether it was relevant. Whether the person cares. If I shouldn’t have said it in the first place. If I can’t remember, I keep trying till I do.

192,"My girlfriend was not born in the best of circumstances. Her “mother” abuses her physically and mentally consistently. Her “mother” tells her she’s ugly and a bitch. For the majority of the time that we spent together my girlfriend was marked up with bruises. It pained me to see her hurt everyday. I wanted to take action but she made me promise I wouldn’t. My girlfriend also has health related problems. She has rheumatoid arthritis and raynauds. On top of that she didn’t particularly eat much or try to be healthy before me.  I’m an aspiring physical therapist so I am a firm believer that a sound body can help with a sound mind. I do my best to make her happy whenever the chance I get. I wish I could take her out of the house she is living in because from what I’ve seen is that her siblings don’t try to help her situation. She’s the middle child so her younger sister is a snot nose brat and her older brother is only looking out for himself and seen as the golden child. We’ve been together since the beginning of last summer in New York. However, we both knew going into this that I was going to be attending college in Florida in the fall for the next 2 years or so. I’ve been working hard the past few years to get myself out of the “Cold” as I put it. The “Cold” would refer to the weather but also the people(snakes) and the job I was working wasn’t for me. Always felt like I belonged somewhere else all the way from the beginning of high school thru my years in community college. So I wasn’t gonna drop my dream at attending a school in Florida for a girl I just met. Anyways it’s now the end of September and she’s visiting me in October but it like her life just keeps going to shit. So she gets into a car accident. (she wasn’t driving her friend was) The incoming driver totaled their car and caused my girlfriend to get an ambulance and go to the hospital. She finds out that she needs surgery at some point within the year for her spine. As she was in the hospital her “mother” was telling her to “get up” that she’s faking. Upset at her for calling an ambulance and making a mess of things. Now when’s she allowed to go back home you would think a mother would let her daughter just try to recover from the traumatic near death experience but no she’s put to do chores all around the house. Fyi her “mom” doesn’t have a job and her father is always at work as a pharmacist in the city. I just don’t understand why this happens to her. I try to tell her to stand up for herself but she afraid of confrontation. I think it has to do with all the years of this happening to her. She says it wasn’t always this way her “mother” started to change when my girlfriend was diagnosed with all the different ailments. Whenever I stepped foot in that house I always felt like uneasy around her “mom” that she was putting on a show. That whatever she said to me wasn’t genuine. So this has been very difficult for me because I don’t know what to do. Another big question is if I love her? Am I just doing this because of a savior complex and she’s the damsel in distress idk.  I care about her a lot she did something that stood out to me in the beginning of relationship. She trusted me even tho this other individual who I had a thing with slandered my name. I didn’t know what I was getting myself into but I’m trying hard to be her rock because she deserves to be happy. She’s very sweet and anybody who I ever ran into that spoke about her would say the same. She doesn’t deserve such a cruel “mother”. Now over the past week she’s developing severe psoriasis all over her body. Ok so this is where the (“mother”) quotation marks can be explained. From what she’s told me is that she doesn’t think her “mother” is really her mom. She has a godmother that lives like an hour or so away from her that she’s not aloud to see by her “mother’s” wishes. However, she secretly makes a trip here and there to visit her because she honestly believes that she’s her real mother because she looks like her from her hair to nose and she has all the same aliments rheumatoid arthritis and raynauds. Her godmother also treats her like her own and gives her advice on anything she asks. Now I asked her why doesn’t she live her. It’s because her godmother doesn’t look financially stable enough to take care of her. So today she tells me she spoke to her godmother about the psoriasis that it looks the same as hers that it’ll take over her body if she doesn’t treat it soon and it’ll burn and etc. Her appointment to see the doctor was today but the doctor didn’t show and had to reschedule for the end of October and basing off what her godmother says. She needs to act fast to treat this. I’m just all the out her trying to get good grades, land a job, go to the gym and have a bit of fun. I have not cheated if anyone thinks that. Yes I’ve looked at the girls here but I’m doing my best to be faithful. I don’t want that to be on my conscious for the rest of my life.

193,hey so i’ve never really used reddit you til my boyfriend told me about it. he told me to come on here when i feel upset and if I ever need advice I can ask anyone on here so here I go. i’m just going to get straight to the point I have a white christian boyfriend(of 2 years) and i’m brown and muslim I can’t be dating him because it’s against my religion and culture or whatever I told my parents about him a couple times but they got very upset wm and told me to find someone else but I can’t I genuinely love this man I’m not too close to my family because when I was younger my 2 older brothers molested me and I hadn’t told anyone but my bf and he helped me tell my parents. when I finally got the guts to tell my parents... they told me to forget about it but you can’t it makes me so sad at times to think about what they did to me and i’m honestly so tired of venting about it to my boyfriend and to his best friend oh well so that happened and then this summer my 2 younger brothers decided to go on my macbook and snoop through the convo with my bf and I and ended up seeing pics and videos I would never want anyone to see they invaded my privacy I tried forgiving them but long story short I ended up finding out that my youngest brother had been going through the pics and videos my bf and I shared for an entire week maybe longer? (btw I have 4 brothers) so anyways I ended up finding out about how the 2 younger ones went through my laptop and honestly I felt so sad and just felt like my life was over I felt so violated because I showed the most love to my youngest one. recently the brother younger than me (not the youngest) stopped talking to me I dont know why but it’s not my fault it makes me really sad but I can’t do anything about it once he stopped talking to me I tried putting in effort to start convos but he was just rude so we’ve stopped talking no hi bye nothing!! my youngest one on the other I messaged him telling him I don’t want to speak to him anymore. honestly i’m just really sad and I dont know what to do anymore I can’t even tell my parents about how my younger bros saw pics and videos of me because 1. they would say move on and that they’re my bros and that fam is everything 2. they would cuss me out. i’m balling my eyes out at the moment and tbh I cry almost every other night because of what my family has done to me and because I dont know how my parents are going to accept my boyfriend i thought maybe when i’m done uni i’ll just tell my parents i’m leaving them (I told my parents i’m leaving and never coming back once and they got really sad) but I was thinking i’d maybe just leave when i’m done uni and go live a happy life w him and his family.,28Sep2019,1
194,"I recently moved from San Diego to Utah for college. I heard horror stories of how cheaply babysitters and nannies are paid in Utah, but I wouldn’t know since I took a break from babysitting during the first weeks of college.

In San Diego, I worked 40+ hours some weeks and I gained dozens of references. I took babysitting courses, child development college classes, and CPR/First Aid training to be a competent sitter. My employers would recommend me to their friends and I gained a good reputation, so I typically got paid an average of $13-$15 (minimum wage was $11.50 then $12)

I saw an ad from a mom looking for a babysitter for her 4-year-old son. She said that hours weren’t consistent (some days might be 3 hours, some days might be 8+ hours due to her and her husband’s schedule). 

So I responded to the ad and shared my experience as a babysitter. She asked for my rates. I know that I don’t have a reputation here as a good sitter yet, so I tell her that I would charge her minimum wage ($7.25).

She sent me another message saying, “Well how much will you charge for a day like tomorrow?” (she needs a sitter from 3pm to 1am) “Keep in mind that he’ll be asleep from 7pm til we get home.”

I’m barely okay with being paid minimum wage for babysitting. I thought that if I asked for minimum wage and was paid minimum wage for the entire time I was there, then it would make up for not being paid minimum wage, if that makes sense. 

Should I explain to her that even after a kid goes to sleep, I typically clean up any messes made (like toys or dishes we used)? Which may not take a lot of time, but then I also have to be present and prepared to be active, and I like to check to make sure the child is still sleeping, especially since I don’t know if her child will have difficulty sleeping without his mom’s presence or if he’ll wake up. Should I clarify that I would be more than happy to basically be a housekeeper, meal planner, etc while she’s working and her kid is sleeping?

I really try to get involved with the kid’s development. With 4-5 year olds specifically, I’ve done important activities like memorizing mommy and daddy’s names and address, learning time, and taking care of their smaller needs like properly brushing teeth. I’ve taken kids on fun activities, like to the beach or the library. I don’t want to brag to this mom, but should I let her know how invested I would be in her kid’s well-being and that I’m worth paying minimum wage?

Or am I being too selfish and proud?",28Sep2019,29
195,"Put this in offmychest but I need advice and don’t think it actually posted

I’ve put off making this sort of post for a while, as I know there are a sea of other people needing support. But I’m not strong enough to face the cards that life has dealt me. Want to preface this by saying I do see a counsellor and am on antidepressants. I have been in regular counselling since I was about 13/14, I’m now 18. Been on antidepressants for about a year and a half. But I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety since I was around 8 (at least, I can’t really remember how I felt before then) I attempted suicide for the first time earlier in the year (it’d been a long time coming, self harmed prior to this), and a couple of months later lost one of my friends to suicide. I stopped talking to my dad early in the year (he wasn’t responsive to me trying to tell him about how I had felt hurt by him for years, so I put up that boundary) but messaged him to say happy father’s day after my sister made me feel guilty for not talking to him. I have had chronic pain since I was in year 9, it comes and goes but it is hellish. One of my good friends recently attempted suicide, and is struggling with her mental health (She has a child so that puts another layer of pressure on her) , two of my friends are addicts, one is addicted to ice, and the other is an alcoholic. They have both gone off the rails in the last month or so, I’ve been doing my absolute best to be here for them and try to make them see that things need to change. My mate who is addicted to ice just flat out says that it’s ‘too late for him to change’ has robbed at least a couple of people (that i know of. Don’t know specifics) finally got notified that he has a court hearing next month but he says he won’t go. He’s a beautiful person when he’s clean, I just want my friend back. Similar situation with my friend who’s addicted to alcohol, he was sober for quite a while but he’s just gone overboard with drinking again, and the other day he called me while he was drinking and had taken dxm. This was a couple of hours before one of my other friends had to call an ambulance for him as he overdosed. I’ve never felt so useless in my life. My words don’t do much in this situation. My heartache doesn’t mean shit. It’s not about me, but at the same time it hurts me to no end to see them hurt themselves like this. I’m so sick of this life. I lost my virginity recently to a guy I’d only known for like a week or two prior. It was a good experience for me, but a couple of weeks later he says he just wants to be friends and I’m more hurt than I thought I’d be. My virginity was not something I thought was special, however I was starting to try and open up myself to him emotionally. Something I struggle with. Now last night I went clubbing with two of my girl friends who are engaged. Apparently it was supposed to be a date with me. So I went along with it. I feel emotionally spent. I want to die.

200,"So I have had a crush on this boy for about six months now. We are both in our latter years of high school and last year there was lots of obvious flirtation/banter between us, and I would often catch him staring at me across the hall or classroom, and when I did, he wouldn’t look away or hide his face; he would just hold my gaze and smile (this information isn’t really relevant, it’s just part of why I like him so much.) And I *do* like him; And I really, really do. He’s smart, strange, funny, and being around him just puts me in a good mod, not to mention he’s cute as hell. So I told him as much. He answered that he liked me too, and suggested a date, which I, of course, agreed to. We went out, and though conversation flowed easily and we both had a good time, for some reason, that sense of flirtation/tension that had hung between us for the past six months just… wasn’t there. It felt like hanging out with a very good friend, which, while pleasant, left me feeling like I had messed up somehow. I have never been on a date before and can’t help but feel that I did something wrong to create this, though I don’t know what. 

Fast forward to the day after, and we have made no plans for a second date and he did not acknowledge me when I walked by him in the hallway. So my question is: did I really fuck everything up with one date? I can’t believe that he would decide, after six months of getting to know me, to change his mind, especially because he isn’t capricious like that. But if not that, then what? Is he just nervous/waiting for me the next move? Did I make some awful faux pas that I don’t know about? I just *don’t know* and it’s driving me crazy because I really enjoy being with him and would like to move our friendship to something more, and now I have all weekend to stew over it and think and rethink everything I said and did.",28Sep2019,2

So I’ve gotten some phone calls from my boss that I have been saying mean things or saying that I have been spreading things around. Which has not been the case the first phone call I kept quiet and didn’t say much. But the second call I basically let it all out that I never said anything negative from the start. 

The original phone call my boss called me about was that I was talking bad about the main manager and someone heard and told my boss. So she called me and said that it isn’t ok and I agreed. I didn’t defend myself the first time since I wanted to get the feedback and move on. 

Then today she called me again and said that someone told her I was walking around telling people someone tattletaled on me. Which then I defended myself and said I was talking with someone and apologizing to them since they were near by when the original conversation was happening. 

My boss has been out the last few days so it’s weird getting calls when she is suppose to be out but it makes me feel like I have a target on my back. 

My boss said I just needed to stop talking to people and not saying things because people keep misunderstanding me. 

What do I do to just push this behind me and keep focusing on work? Should I talk more about with my boss to really speak my mind or is this something to just let blow over? Should I talk through this with HR to figure out what to do (not to eat anyone out but to just figure out what to do)?

206,"So I went to pick up my sister at her job and I parked at the back which is quite usual (it’s night time btw). I didn’t fully park. I just stepped on the brakes while I waited with my headlights on. Then another car came and parked in front of me so we were facing each other but not quite close to each other. 

Then he turned off his car and blinked his headlights at me which I found strange so I ignored it. I think he did it twice or thrice before my sister came and once after she came. She commented on it and told me she didn’t know him which made my blood run cold so we quickly left. As we were driving away, she asked if I flashed my headlights at him and I said no. She then said it’s good because apparently, some gang members usually do that as some kind of test. If you blink back, they’ll follow you home and murder you to be initiated into their gangs.

208,"So there’s this guy in my grade, who has apparently had a HUGE crush on me since last year. He’s such a sweet and amazing boy but I don’t want to date him.

He asked me out to homecoming in the best way anyone could (in my opinion) and he knew that. He made me a long poem that described how much he liked me and how amazing he thought I was. I really liked it because it showed he genuinely cared and wasn’t trying to have a fake relationship. Of course, I said yes, because it’s just something you can’t say no to. 

He’s asked me about dating and what our “status” is. He asked if anything he said or did made me uncomfortable and to tell him if it ever did. He always compliments and treats me like a queen. He says he wants to treat me right and that I deserve the world. We text all the time.

The problem is, I’m not ready to be in a relationship. I don’t have the same feelings for him even though he makes me happy. I send him hearts and call him sweet things back but I don’t feel much real emotion behind them.

I feel so pressured to date him. I don’t want to break his heart. I know what it feels like. It happened to me this summer. There was also a situation with one of my closet’s friends dad’s that involved all of us and exploitation of our bodies. He was a pedophile and had filmed us in bathrooms, etc. That might be one of my issues too.

209,"Hi, I'm 15 and I'm (a *closeted*) gay. And let's just say I have a small method of getting other guys to uh... ""crush on me"" in school I guess. And I do this simply by just brushing against them in a kind of sensual manner, whether it be, getting our feet to touch under the desks, or on the bus moving my leg into there's slowly, etc. And if they return it, I know I've got them hooked (Jesus, I've gotten like 5 dudes from that). But, I digress. So there's this guy I like, and when I hang out with friends sometimes he gets invited over too. He also comes to Six Flags with me and my friends sometimes. Although we know little about each other, as I followed my heart I knew he was the one I really wanted. We sat next to each other on the bus, we didn't talk the entire time but I used the method and he returned it. So he's into me, but we still don't talk much and I don't want to move too quickly.

211,"Throwaway account because I really don't want people talking about this to me on my actual account. 

Basically, I'm extremely depressed. And I always feel as if I'm constantly making something worse. And I feel like that's happening because when I was younger, I used to fake my happiness and positivity, just so I can see others be happy at the expense of my own. But I stopped doing that. And ever since then. I've been feeling emotionally worse everyday throughout the years. I'm literally to to the point where I don't even suicide will work anymore. So I don't even have the motivation to try anymore times than I already have. I just live day by day as if something is going to go wrong. And that's exactly what happens. Even when I'm not thinking about it, something goes completely wrong and it ends up causing a bunch of arguments and drama between people.

So I officially decided I was just going to lie to everyone I personally know, just so i can make them happy. Just so I can see them smile. That's all I want. Even if it means lying to them just to do it. And I know how to make it convincing. So nobody is really going to find out. Nobody really knows me that personally. My mom can't name my top 5 favorite fruits even if I talk about them all the time. And I don't even have anyone who would consider me a ""close friend"" even if I consider them one. So nobody really paid attention to me enough to know that I'm obviously lying. 

Is that a bad idea? Should I really just hide everything I ever go through just so people can be happy? Because I feel that is the best way of making sure nothing goes wrong between anybody else. The best way of making sure I don't cause anymore problems.",28Sep2019,0

213,"Title says it. I'm living with my parents, a 15 year old older sister, and Brother X, 8 years old and Brother Z, 10. I'm here to look for some advice as well as let off some steam cuz this is starting to stress me out and I'm really pissed of at my brothers but I don't know what to do. My brothers and my sister just had a big fight at the dining table which I don't really know about cuz I've been studying. I'll just list the ""personality traits"" of my family members and ask for help

Sister-shes a big hypocrite, like she can complain about man-spreading but take up 2 seats for her bag. She's also the most extra person, and needs to have a say in everything. For example I got locked out of my house yesterday, cuz I forgot my keys. My mom told me to go to BP library, which is near my house, but my friends were at JW library, so I went there. The journey from my house to JW library takes an hour, and I got my mom to fetch me which brought her into a major jam. The whole time, she keeps talking about why I have to go all the way to JW library when she herself sometimes travels for 2 hours to go to a mall with her friends. 
Brother X- he's largely ok, but he's extremely self-centred and he cries and whines when he doesn't get his way. Also he isint willing to put down a fight and keeps talking back and arguing until someone gets hurt. Usually he argues with brother Z until he gets fed up and beats my brother X. 

Brother Z- the most problematic person I have ever met. He's extremely unstable, easily influenced by people he thinks are ""cool"" ie Jake paul, morgz, James charles. For some reason he's bloody two faced, one moment he's the amazing, nice, kind, helpful brother every kid deserves next moment he's a mother fucking dickhead who exerts his dominance on his younger brother and uses his weight and size to beat up others and victimises himself. He's also pretty self-centred. He's recently going through a weeb-Indian phase. He's interested in Indian culture, which is perfectly fine no hate at all but sometimes he insists on watching Indian shows with no subtitles(we're chinese) and refuses to let us watch the headlines or any show we like. He's also extremely addicted to watching YouTube, have no sense of monetary value(he randomly spends his money as and when he likes and doesn't save them) to the point where my parents confiscate his phone and he once manipulated Brother X into begging my parents to let him go home from school instead of childcare so that he could use brother X phone to watch YouTube. He's also very attention Seeking and purposely burps and farts in your face. 

Father- he's mostly great and all, good at DIY, good at teaching us but his temper flares up and when it does everything ends up in tears and screams. As of now he's screaming his head off because my siblings are fighting cuz brother z decided to burp which my sister thinks is disgusting (it really is tho) and brother x agrees and they fight and my father is so damn stressed out he's screaming his head off. 

My mother is... Interesting to say the least. She extremely paranoid, like there was once she left me at home for 3 hours and she kept making me take videos of what I'm doing to ensure I'm studying and playing the piano instead of playing games. Shes also really fake, like when she talks to you she encourages you about your dreams, but behind your back she's silently cursing and swearing and giving her opinions on what you should do or not do. She also is kinda inconsiderate? And sometimes she purposely screws up someone's life because she's not happy. Once, at the mall someone parked their car really close the the second lot; nearly half the wheel was in the other lot. So she decided to park her car at an angle where the car couldn't move until her car wasn't there, and the driver of the car was? An 18 year old who just got his license and isint terrific at parking. 

So I really don't know what to do right now, I'm just staying in my room avoiding all the mess(knowing my sister she'll probably scream her heads off at me for chewing my food. literally, she's chased me away many times for that) but this is kinda getting old, I'm 14 and there's no way I want to live among this garbage and wait for my siblings to mature up, or until I have enough money and of legal age to buy my own house/rent. This shit is bloody stressful I'm just trying to study in my room and there my family is screaming their heads off. Several neighbours have come over to check on what's going on but my mother just puts on a fake smile and says everything is OK. Thanks for reading till here, I need a place to steam off. What should I do from here? Talking to them is... Nearly impossible cuz I've tried before and they don't want to listen. My mother will question this and question that and drill me till I give up and my father will say some stuff about how difficult it is to raise 4 kids in a 3 story house.",28Sep2019,1

220,"I'm a senior in college. I'm a fifth year senior and if this semester went smooth, I'm due to graduate in December. But this semester is driving me to a ledge.

To start I'm enrolled in a senior seminar class. It focuses on every student in the class writing a 20pg research paper. Then putting on a presentation in front of a panel of professors. Now if the paper was the oy thing for this class then it wouldn't be that bad. But we also have large assignments due in this class, every other week. An example is we had to gather 50 sources related to our topic then write a paragraph on each source. That was due on the fourth week of classes.

Next i'm taking a voice and diction class. It is basically an acting class that focuses on verbal performance. Thia class is so out my comfort zone like i literally almost cry walking into this class. It's so much making weird noises, doing yoga in front of the other people in the class, and studying the way you pronounce words. The class is so outside my comfort zone, causes me actual distress, but I have to take it as part of my curriculum. The class is full of actors and i just feel like shit whenever the professor calls on me to complete a section of work in front of the whole class.also if i skip a class my grade drops half a letter grade.

I'm taking philosophical ethical response. And literally i just can't do philosophy it wrecks my brain so for the first week of class I skipped the class. I intended to drudge in during the second week, but here I am 40 days in and I haven't stepped foot in the class. If this was one of my other classes It wouldnt be as bad. But this guy gives writing assignments everyday. Everyday a notification hits my phone letting me know a writing assignment has been posted. Now every day im suppose to have the glass I lay in bed unwilling to face the fact im a month and a half late to class.this is also apart of my curriculum and can't graduate without it.

On top of all this i have two other classes Spanish and Environmental science which just give work regularly.i also have a 10hr a week job at my school. 

Outside of class I suffer from bad anxiety Nd depression and no this isn't  me self diagnosing myself. I take doctor prescribed medication and see a counselor every 2 weeks. I just moved out the part of my life where I was suicidal.i've even been getting periodic anxiety attacks as of late.

I literally dont know what to do I'm in a constant state of stress and everytime i try to get to work my brain overloads and shuts down and i just lay on my floor.

I started having panic attacks at 14 and they were very frequent. I'd say at least 2-3 times a week. I got better at managing them for some time and maybe last year I only had 3 at the most. Well I'm starting to have really bad panic attacks again. I dont smoke pot anymore. I dont drink. I wont drink caffeine at all. I try to abstain from any substance cause it gives me panic attacks. Hell, even ibuprofen will give me one.

My guess is that I recently had a major surgery and I've been bedridden for the past 3 weeks. I've had over 20 panic attacks so far and I dont know what to do. I was not a big fan of medication. I've tried every SSRI except prozac and they made me feel worst honestly. At this point I dont know what to so and need some advice.",28Sep2019,1

225,"I’ve had this “friend” for a long time (3 years). I wanted him to be my friend throughout those 3 years but he has always wanted more and has been very vocal about it. Keep in mind that I have been VERY vocal about only wanting a friendship and that I don’t want to be with him romantically throughout those 3 years also. He persisted on his own knowing all of this information. I cut off all forms of communication with him a few months ago because I knew it wasn’t healthy for me but especially not healthy for him. I know this is very very very stupid of me to ask but It something that has been bothering me and I need to get it off my chest because all of my friends don’t like him so their opinions are bias.

I do still love him, just not in the way that he wanted me to. But I also feel like it would be a nice gesture. I want it to show that even if I can't be with him I still care and I still think about him. He was very kind and loving to me, I can say that even when he had nothing he tried to give me everything which still makes me cry when I think about it.

228,"[https://confidentman.net/family/10-signs-family-crazy-making](https://confidentman.net/family/10-signs-family-crazy-making)

That perfectly describes my family.

I've been back with my family since December, and told them multiple times about the problems I see. They don't want to change. Yes, I get that I can't change them, I just thought that any reasonable person would notice the huge number of confrontations and get the hint after ALMOST A FUCKING YEAR.

First off, my younger sister. My first younger brother (17) bullies her relentlessly. He torments her. I tell him to stop constantly, to leave her alone, but he does it anyway. Worst of all, he says that I am causing problems. My older sister says that I need to mind my own business, that that's ""Just how he is."" I really hate it, because my younger sis (10) screams and cries but my brother refuses to leave her alone. He doesn't hit her or anything, but he won't stop teasing her. She cries and screams and I just can't take it every single fucking day.

&amp;#x200B;

He also doesn't leave me alone. I tell him to stop, but he does it anyway. He doesn't respect me. YES&lt; I FUCKING KNOW HOW THAT SOUNDS, And NO, I am not one of those people that demands respect! He disrespects me on a daily basis just because he can. Yeah, I could see it as just whatever, but then he bothers me. I say, ""Do you need something?"" He says no. I say, ""Okay, if you don't need something, leave me alone."" But he keeps bothering me, so he must want *something.* I am perfectly willing to give him my attention, but the way he is asking for it is NOT OKAY. I would not demand respect, ever, but he keeps demanding my attention!! What can I do but lay down ground rules? What the fuck am I supposed to do when he doesn't want to communicate AT ALL?

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I talk to him about any of this, he ignores me until I get so frustrated I lose my temper. I know it's not right, but he's been doing this for months! And he won't leave my sister alone! She already has enough problems and he just keeps bullying her! Whenever I finally get him to actually talk, he gets this tone of voice like when I was 13 and thought I knew everything. He clearly doesn't mean it when he says, ""I realize what I've been doing isn't right."" I know he doesn't give a fuck because if he did, he would mention THE MONTHS HE'S BEEN DOING THIS INSTEAD OF THE ONE TIME EARLIER TODAY!!!!!! He hides his mistakes by bringing up mine or acting sophisticated, and I fucking hate it. He's got no right to act sophisticated with all the shit he puts my entire family through. He's a fucking idiot, and isn't willing to learn or even acknowledge how fucking annoying he is, that he is a problem to others.

&amp;#x200B;

My oldest sister (24?) isn't any better. She creates issues for my younger sister to punish her for, and doesn't see it. Every time I tried to tell her, she says that she is the adult, and my younger sister is the child. Oh fuck, glad you cleared that up. Honestly, I couldn't fucking tell with how childish she is! It's like, raise PEOPLE, NOT CHILDREN. Don't raise cowards, raiase brave people.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever my younger sister is upset, I always try to tell her that she doesn't need to react so strongly. I'm not trying to make her emotionless or invalidate her emotions, I'm just trying to teach her control. My older sister responds to this by saying, ""She can feel how she wants."" What the fuck is that supposed to mean? So when she's hitting me because she doesn't yet know how to deal with her feelings, I can't hold her responsible because that's just how she feels? What the fuck?

&amp;#x200B;

My other older (21/22) sister yells ALL THE TIME even when the conversation is only mildly confrontational. I've asked her several times to bring her voice tone down so that we're on the same fucking level, but she just says, ""This is my voice."" Oh wow, didn't know that. No fucking clue that was your voice. Honestly, it sounded more like a fucking fire alarm. I can't communicate with her because she always talks down to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've resorted to physically harming my brother. I've called all of them names because it really seems like they have something wrong with them that disables them from seeing how their behavior affects others. Dad talks to brother all the time, but brother just uses a fucking sarcastic voice and denies everything. Course, he doesn't directly say, ""No I don't do that."" He isn't fucking brave enough. Instead,  he says, ""Oh wow! I do that? Wow I didn't know that."" Fucking coward can't admit it either way. No fucking spine.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone tells me that ***I am the problem***. Yeah, no shit. I am the problem and the solution. They need to quit their shit and leave me alone. They need to leave my little sister alone, or we're all going to have problems. I would love to have peace in this house, but I have just one simple rule that seems to prevent that from happening: Respect the boundaries of others. Shit. That's where I've been screwing up, obviously. Like I said, I have been physically communicating with my brother, since that's the only thing he seems to understand. I don't like doing that. I really don't. That's what I need the most help with. I just want them to open their eyes and see that they are actually bothering me and breaking my boundaries and that I want them to fucking stop. I want them to stop. I want them to leave me alone. I don't go out of my way to bother them unless they are bothering myself or my sister, but they just want me to bend over and take it up the ass just because they feel like I'm in the wrong, and I'm sick of it. I don't know what to do. I would like to move out and get my own place, but my dad takes half my fucking paycheck and it's taking forever to save up. What the fuck do I do?!?!?",28Sep2019,25
229,"Ok so hear me out. I'm 13, in 8th grade. There's a girl I really like and I want to show her how I really feel, whether that be upfront or by giving a few subtle hints that she would probably catch. I really really like her and I love making her laugh and hanging out with her. I talk to her fairly often as she is in my homeroom and in my Phys Ed class. I'm able to make her laugh fairly often which is my favorite thing to do. I'm a very talkative person in general, and is almost never afraid or nervous to speak. This is different; I get really nervous and shy when it comes to me and girls I like. I'm good talking with them normally but I feel like if I tell them, or drop hints of some sort, and it doesn't work out then it'll be really awkward after.

230,"Pretty simple question. Started getting emails earlier this week that someone else had logged into one of my social media accounts suspiciously and it had been locked. Then I started getting other emails from other accounts, ranging from social media to gaming to standard Microsoft accounts. Many of these accounts foolishly shared credentials, but at least one had a different primary email. One notification email was kind enough to indicate the IP was from Vietnam, but in a world of VPNs that's not super helpful. The attacker has not reached out to any contacts on my social media or attempted to complete any transactions on any marketplaces.

We've all bought items from dozens of different online marketplaces at this point. It would be impossible to remember every page that might be a risk. How can I best protect my privacy going forward? Whats the worst case follow-up the attacker might hit me with? Does this sound more like my machine is infected, a site I signed up for had a security breach and log-in credentials for many clients were dumped online, or is it just my personal NSA agent getting sloppy? Nobody is close enough to me to be privy to these credentials so its not an inside job. Thanks for any insight you all might be able to provide.",28Sep2019,2
231,"This is a current situation and I need a quick answer as to what to do.


My boyfriend has diabetes. He has a constant glucose monitor that is linked to an app that sends me (as well as people like his mother and father) notifications about his blood sugar. 

He is currently 2 hours away from me while I’m away at college and he is at home. I just got a notification that his blood sugar is LOW like too low for him to be sleeping and not take some sugar. (If he’s low while sleeping he’ll keep on sleeping as his blood sugar is dropping until it gets to the point he can slip into a coma).

So I tried calling him to get him to wake up and drink some juice and etc to get his number up. 

He isn’t picking up as he’s sleeps like he’s dead to the world. I’m alittle concerned as I’m watching his number drop.

His parents are divorced and he is currently at his fathers house, his father whom also sleeps like he’s dead to the world and through the notifications the app sends to our phones about his son’s blood sugar.

His mother, while her son is not sleeping at her house, turns off the sound alarms that the app does just so she can sleep through the night. She turns them on when he’s at her house so she can get up in the middle of the night to care for him if need be.

It’s currently 1:40 in the morning and his number is dropping still and I’m contemplating calling his mother who lives 5 minutes away from her ex-husband to do something to check on her son. Whether it be calling her ex, going there, etc. 

What should I do?",28Sep2019,2

238,"So before I start the story I need to state something.
I’m not against all touch. There are times when I’m okay with touch but most of the time I dislike it and will begin to wriggle of writhe my way out of hugs, back rubs, arm holding etc. This is so severe/important to me that I violently pushed a teacher when she wrapped her arm around me (that was five or six years ago)
Situation 1: My Aunt wants to me to hug her every time she leaves from a gathering. I will settle for a fist bump or a high five but I will refuse a hug. Our exchanges usually go “Can I have a hug?” “No, is it okay if I give you a fist bump instead?” And then she will sigh and act defeated, clearly in an attempt to guilt me into hugging her. It never works. I have made my boundaries very clear and now a days she will still ask but won’t be as adamant. This only recently changed after she forced me into a hug while I was getting into the car.
Situation 2: My brothers’ girlfriends’ mom is very touchy feely. I have made clear to her that I don’t like physical touch the majority of the time. It only came up when she rubbed my back and my body moved very quickly without my control to get away. I told her my boundaries and later the same day she grabbed my shoulder. I asked her again not to touch me and she said sorry. The last time we met she rubbed my back again and I froze up in an effort to not punch her in the face. She commented saying I was making progress. I said nothing and stood there uncomfortably.
Whenever this happens people look at me like I’m some kind of monster for not liking touch? If it’s someone I care and they ask for physical contact I might say yes, I might not. It depends on how I’m feeling. I personally feel that people should respect my boundaries.",28Sep2019,2

243,"WARNING: Long post ahead.

Important background info: I have a substance abuse problem that I've been dealing with for about a year but it hasn't gotten in the way of my commitments/priorities until about a week ago.

Me and my best friend met each other at our place of work about 8 months ago.  She started there about a month after I did.  The people at our job aren't always very friendly to new people because new employees tend to not last very long becausd of what we do.  Because of this, we did not know any of them and did not make much conversation until we started talking to each other.  Turns out, we ended forming a very strong connection with each other.  We've only known each other for 8 months and it feels like I've know her for years.  Eventually we moved in with each other after searching for places for a long time. 

Living with her has been awesome until about a week ago.  I do have a substance abuse problem and she is aware of it.  She doesn't like when I'm on said substance around her which is fair so I don't use/be under the influence around her.  She will indulge with me every once in awhile but she is only an occasional user.  She had recently bought a relatively large amount of substance and weighed it up one morning to see that there was missing that she did not do and immediately assumed it was me which is fair.  She does not trust me because I am an addict and she has lived with one (her brother) her whole life so she is very familiar with how an addict thinks.  The severity of my addiction is not relevant to the post but she knows me very well and has good reason to not trust me.  

Anyway, I did not take anything from her and never would even if I was desperate.  She is the most important person to me and I have not cared for a person more in my entire life than I do for her.  She is everything to me.  She is someone I can see myself marrying.  Our connection is special and it is obvious to both of us so we both hold each other in a special place.  

I told her that I did not take anything.  I told her I'm not expecting her to believe me and she honestly has no reason to.  I am and have been telling her the truth, though.  She still does not believe me and I'm starting to think she never will.  I've told her that I'm even okay with her hating me just as long that she eventually believes me when I tell her that I did not steal from her.  She won't talk to me unless it is one word responses or yelling.  

The situation is rough because she is so important to me.  I feel like I'm losing her and do not know what to do.",28Sep2019,2

246,"There are a couple of layers to this and this only just happened tonight. I’ll start from the very beginning. 
So I’m a new transfer student at a pretty small school and I’ve moved into a fairly big apartment near campus with 4 other people. I know 2 of my roommates from a high school program, so we have a pretty solid relationship. My other two roommates, on the other hand, I don’t know as well. 
Keep in mind that these 4 roommates have been living in our apartment since June and I moved into the extra bedroom earlier this month. Everything had been smooth sailing at the beginning, I was hanging out with my roommates and their group of friends that live in our town over the summer. The town that we live in is pretty rural and was a culture shock for me, since I’ve been living in the city for awhile. I guess the small town vibe has been reflected in the way that these group of people carry themselves? There’s a lot of homophobic and racist comments, despite all of us being POC and myself being bisexual. 
This is especially true with one of my roommates, who made a comment about my body recently. The topic was about Kim Kardashian or plastic surgery or something, and I said that I would never get plastic surgery. Without skipping a beat, my roommate said “Not to sound like a douchebag, but your body is kind of lacking.” Obviously because it came out of nowhere and I’m not used to the way he carries himself, I let it slide. Keep in mind, this is the same man that has told me to “shut the fuck up” casually in the middle of a conversation, which also caught me off guard and I couldn’t respond. I’ve also given him rides to places since he doesn’t have a car, given him free food, my netflix, hulu, and let him use my ps4. I can’t think of a time when he’s ever given anything to me. I’m not even dating this man, and would never even consider it. 
So tonight, I decided to confront him about the disrespect he’s shown me. I basically told him that I was uncomfortable about the comments he’s made about my body and the time he told me to shut the fuck up. All he had to say was “I’m sorry. Is that all?” and then continued to finish watching his show on my TV. I could tell that I made him a bit uncomfortable. I just really don’t know what to do at this point. I know he’s the type to bring it up to our group of friends and call me a bitch for standing up for myself. I have a lease in this apartment with them until June 2020.

Now a month in and I’m still avoiding conversations with everyone partly out of social nerve and partly because  likeminded individuals who share my interests are a very endangered , dare i say extinct species.

Now you’re going to say “ya thats because you don’t try to talk to people”, well I disagree.  I know exactly how pretentious this sounds, but no one I’ve met is at my level into my field where we can collaborate or even speak candidly.

She,I and her sister (all in our 20's) been living together for half a year now.More and more I find them snapping at me for things that are considered normal where I'm from,like not being quiet in the house,not using a dipper instead of toilet paper in the bathroom or saving food and taking cheaper options.Other examples include giving me that ""up-and-down look"" when I express something either religious or patriotic.They've even given me crap for making choices that are more utilitarian because they believe it's ugly and we can afford better.

Her sister (and at some times,her brother,when he would visit) would even pick on me,commenting every time I do something she wouldn't do herself or if I don't do it the way she would that it's weird.Her tone and approach is also undeniably rude.It's honestly like dealing with a mean 11 year old.I daresay insecurities that I haven't had since the 5th grade have resurfaced primarily because of the sister.

I've spent a lot of time with different crowds of people,rich,poor, local,foreign,conservative,liberal,whatever.So I certainly believe that there's a better way to say what she wants but instead,she continues to use that condescending closed-minded approach.

When I try to bring it up with my girl,she explains it in such a way that it feels like she's saying that because they grew up sheltered,they have a right to be annoyed with me.I'm hoping that's not her point but from the way she worded it,that's the message that was relayed.She also explicitly said that they do that because they're comfortable with me and that people who don't point out what they find strange are not comfortable enough,claiming that it's an American thing. Again,I did grow up and worked with other Americans so I know they don't have the same tone and approach.

I'm getting pretty sick of not feeling respected in my own house,and I'd be lying if I said I didn't consider leaving because of it.How then should I bring this up?

**TLDR:*****My girlfriend's family needs to respect the fact that they and I have excruciatingly different backgrounds and upbringings and act like mature fucking adults.How*** ***do I bring this up to them as a whole without blowing up at them and possibly making things worse and moving out of my own house?***",28Sep2019,1

My family and my daughter love me no matter what and that’s all I want in my life right now. I have full custody of my daughter. I am pretty close to my ex’s mom and she likes to see my daughter at least once a month. It hurts to talk to her because it reminds me of my ex since it’s his mom. I will still let her see my daughter but I want minimal contact for awhile. All I want to focus on is my daughter, mom, brother, and grandpa. I want to go to work and then go home and be with them. The most I have gone without talking to my ex is three days and the most I have deleted my social media was I believe two days. A few people know where I live which worries me from my escape from everybody. I’m sorry if this is completely jumbled or if I sound like a crazy person which I probably am considering I just pretended to be my ex’s new girlfriends baby’s father and made a complete fool out of myself trying to trick him into being mad at her and trying to make her be jealous of him and I.

259,"I need a part time job for university right now all I have available is something that is 1 hour away walking. 30 mins on the bus. 20 mins to cycle. 

If I get the month bus pass I won’t have any money left to eat food. It’s okay though bc I did stock up on foods that won’t go out of date. So I could do that. Besides I need to lose some weight. 

The second option is to bike it but I feel like that could be more dangerous since bikes in my area are valuable and I’ll have my phone on display on the bike bc I need a satnav and cycling in the dark (someone who is very inexperienced in cycling sounds dangerous and I don’t want to get hit off my bike)

So if I walk an hour it seems like an okay option. I will finish work at 10pm. So I’ll only be walking until 11pm.

He claims that she went to the same elementary school as us, but despite being my age, I have no recollection of her.  My brother and I live in southwestern Ontario, Canada, and she ""is going to university in California to become a nurse.""  He claims that her parents live in a city close to us, and that she used to live in our hometown.  My brother also tends to blurt stuff out, then try to play it off as a joke, and yesterday he blurted out, ""She sends me some money.""

My friends from freshman year ditched me pretty much, which sucks but I don’t really care for them that much. I do have one friend who I’m extremely close with but we don’t really hang out we’re just really good study buddies. 

I did have a lot of friends in high school and those guys and girls were my jam. Now though, we’re barely in touch. These are people I thought I would literally die for, but now it takes like 3 days to get a response to a simple “Hey how are you doing?” text or like 2 weeks to open a Snapchat just to have them not respond. All of my high school friends are have solid college friend groups and have frankly forgotten about me so I really have no one to talk to. 

Also I haven’t dated anyone since high school. I had a nice relationship in high school but I have yet to really hit it off with another girl here and want to get back into dating. 

I feel extremely lonely and don’t have really anyone to talk to. Everyone that I seem to get close with eventually pushes me away. My personality has gone from outgoing and sociable to really shy and awkward.

He is not ugly but he blames my mom for his big lips and teeth (we're Asian btw) and his teacher at school and tuition teacher tells us that he goes to the bathroom for a long time and doesn't come out.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So for anyone reading this, you have probably seen something similar be posted on here not too long ago. I'm starting to wonder why I'm even asking anymore when this person has probably forgotten about me by now because a week has gone past but I'm still thinking about the entire thing so I want to make a final decision really. I only got a few comments on my last posts, which I appreciate but I think they didn't help me just because I hadn't explained the situation properly. I guess I gave a basic explanation but without any backstory.

So I met someone on makenewfriends here on reddit and we clicked really well. We just seemed to have a lot in common Its just sad to go from getting notifications of someone wanting to talk to you to nothing again so I guess that's why I'm still thinking about it because I know how rare it is to be able to click with someone on the internet. It's just about how a conversation can be natural like never before and how you can never get it back that get's me sad. We talked for one day-ish on reddit and it was the first time someone wasn't giving low-effort responses. Most of the time in my inbox I would get 'hey' or something like that which wouldn't go anywhere.

So we moved to snapchat after that day because he said he wouldn't be on reddit as often to respond because he wouldn't get notifications so I installed snapchat because I didn't have social media. We talked on snapchat too, I honestly thought I had met someone that could be long-term, he even said he was looking for a something long-term in his initial post. Its rare also that someone says that and you feel it could actually happen but then again, I don't know if I'm taking this too seriously. We talked on snapchat for about 2 days and I just looked forward to talking to him in the afternoons because we would just ask each other questions and talked for 4 hours each night.  He seemed to know a lot about my little country, whereas most people don't know a lot. I didn't think it would end again.

He told me one day that he got a call that a relative was not doing well, so I told him that he should take a break to cope with whatever's happening however he just continued talking to me which I didn't think was the best idea because after all someone would have to process what happened.  He had said he had an eating disorder and then started saying that when he was little, he used to see things. This creeped me out so I just didn't reply for a while, I just get scared really easily. I was trying my best though to not get scared even though I was, and asked him what he was even scared of and he said monsters. So call me childish but I got even more scared when he said that. I tried to convince him that stuff like that doesn't exist but he kept saying he was scared for even bringing the conversation up himself.

He apologised for scaring me and said I should just forget he said anything, which was difficult because everything had changed. I don't even know why, but I was really scared from the entire situation so I deleted him, which was a quick decision for me. I keep trying to think about whether I overreacted, whether I lost someone that maybe said something on a day he wasn't feeling well, someone that may have problems. I don't know, I just keep thinking of my regrets still even after a week went by. He didn't add me back, but I'm predicting that's because he thought he had scared me already.

Now that he's gone, I just feel really alone which sounds really stupid but I do. So I keep having anxiety about whether I should just add him again for the past few days and tell him I'm sorry for deleting him and to just forget what happened he said, however I just don't know if I can deal with the rejection and I know I don't want to say sorry, because I was truly scared. Please someone, I know you don't have the entire story but I tried to include everything. Give me a way to deal with this if you can. I keep thinking I wont find someone I liked talking to as much. Or is this just going to cause me more anxiety if I do add him back?

The should I, should I not scenario is just making me feel even worse.

As I said, this is the last time I'm posting about this and I'm sorry for posting 2 times.",28Sep2019,1
287,"I met this guy online months ago and we’ve only been dating for a month and a half now. As you probably assumed, we’re in a long distance relationship. The distance is not that far though. We both live in Europe and I’m hoping to fly over there to meet him this winter. 

He’s been the best thing that has happened to my life. A lot of people tell me that I’m too naive and I shouldn’t be this attracted to him because I never met him in real life but I video chat with him everyday. And it just feels like I’ve met him already. There’s a lot I can say about him, how genuine and kind he is. How he’s the only one who I actually felt like he loves me back. However, I’m just going to get straight to the point.

My parents emotionally abuse me. This lead to me having a lot of mental problems that I don’t want to talk about here but the point is, they’re the main source of my sadness. Because of them, I get aggressive with my boyfriend sometimes and make him cry. I get angry at little things. I feel like I won’t be able to make him happy or give him the happiness he deserves. 

I sometimes think: If he meets someone irl that could make him happier and is more emotionally stable than me, I feel like I’d give him up. But I don’t want to have these thoughts because I love him so much and I’d rather fix myself and make him happy by my own.

It’s just hard when you’re in such an environment. My parents aren’t necessarily bad people. They have their goods and bads, just like everyone. When they’re good, they can be the most loving parents ever. When they’re not, they can be the worst pieces of shit. 

I probably am not clear on what kind of advice I’m seeking for but to put it short, how do I stop having thoughts about breaking up with my boyfriend for his own sake?

No. Don’t ever speak about my mom like that to me.” She continued with, “Girl she looked like it.” Then, “Ok.”

298,"TW: Suicidal feelings, loneliness

Basically title.

I moved away from my hometown and family, to live in my partners hometown, so they could their job. I got a job in the same place and... I am miserable.

I dislike the job, work is boring, boss is an ass, but I can’t find anything paying better, and I took the job to help them pay bills, so I’m stuck.

I miss my family. I had a close relationship with my family (partner does not) and I miss them. Badly. My grandad died of cancer last year and I regret not being around more for his final days. My dog died recently, again, I regret not being around for his final days. I still haven’t visited home since my dogs death, and part of me hasn’t accepted it yet.

I have no friends here, my friends are back in my hometown.

My partner doesn’t seem to fully comprehend how sad I am as a result of this situation. I feel stuck, alone, at my worst times I think of committing suicide. They won’t humour us moving to my hometown because of money. Whenever I try to talk about it it turns into a fight, so i’ve given up trying.

I just want to just pack my bags and go, move back in with my parents and start rebuilding my life, but I have a rent contract, we have a joint account, I feel like I’m tied here.

I feel like I have nobody to turn to, and nobody I can talk about my feelings to, so I’ve come here for advice and to get some of this off my chest. 

What should I do?",28Sep2019,1
300,"So a bit of background information. I meet my friend in 2009 and we chat on discord a lot. One important thing to note is we do not know each other in real life, however we have seen each other over the phone and are very good friends.   


Today I got onto discord and he messaged me asking for thirty dollars without being specific about why he'd need it. Which I see it like this, he has the option to get a job but does not want to yet he whines like a baby about having nothing to do or how he is bored with gaming.   


I told him no despite the fact that we are close. He previously mentioned making about fifteen dollars a week selling baked goods (Brownies and what not.. No pot brownie jokes please) so no idea why he doesn't save his money. I personally think that is a slight lie about making fifteen a week.  


 He became a bit pushy about it so I post a screenshot of my account balance which has nineteen cents and I explained what a overdraft charge is. He just said ""okokokok"" and seemed unhappy. After that he proceeded to ignore my dms for roughly fifteen minutes. Am I looking to much into this?

311,"Sorry in advance if this is rambly/not the right sub but we're really looking for advice on what to do.

The background is my girlfriend has started working at a dentists office as a receptionist. The man has autism but is very good at his job and extremely friendly and kind, especially with money. The man is in his 60's and has a mother with dementia in her 90's who he's paying a lot of money for the care she needs to be kept at home and out of a care home. 

The main carer for his mother is a woman who form what I've heard seems to be milking the man for all he has. Things like demanding higher pay for herself or she'll drop everything and leave. Demanding to be paid off the books. Demanding to get allowances for lunch, her car being serviced and her hair to be done. Most of this is what my GF has relayed to me via his panicked ramblings in work. Over all this aspect seems to stress him out the least overall as he seems to just go with it.

The main issue is the carers daughters are both working in the reception along with my girlfriend and this is where it gets particularly dodgy. One of them is 20 and has been working there part time since she was 16. Completely on the books, pays tax no problem there, except for the fact that she works for a fraction of the hours my GF works and gets the same per week. Like, literally she works maybe 10 hours a week and is taking home the same as if she was working 40. But whatever she's been there longer than my GF so no alarm bells go off there and my GF doesn't mind about other peoples pay etc.

The sister on the other hand was put through college to be a dental hygienist by the dentist. I'm not sure of the specifics around this but at first myself and my GF put it off as family friends and he had the money to do it. However she now refuses to work there saying it's too messy and if she was seen working there her hygienist title could be revoked? (not sure of the specifics of that either but it's something along those lines). But the girl still is being paid by the dentist the same as my GF who is working fulltime hours.

So we've kinda known this for the past few months and put it down to the fact that because the dentist and this family have been so intertwined for so long because of his mothers illness and them working at the office they're like family. However recently it's gotten a little sinister and we're beginning to suspect that maybe they're taking advantage of the man.

Both the dentist and my GF live in the same town, so naturally some mornings when it's raining the dentist would offer a ride into work. He has done the same for the two girls and their mother every morning for the past few years even with them living in separate areas and it taking close to an hour to collect all of them each morning. Again we put this down to family friends etc. But since he started doing it for my GF every now and again the entire mood of the office has shifted. 

Texts that my GF has been shown like ""Why are you bringing her to work"" and ""Stop letting her in your car"" have sprung up and even when both the dentist and my Gf have gone to the bank during the day the dentist has gotten increasingly aggressive calls from one or both of the girls saying ""you better not have brought her for lunch"" (which he does for them daily, my GF tends to avoid it as she doesn't want to take advantage).

The thing that made me write this post though is the most recent set of text messages the dentist got from the older sister (the one that doesn't even work at the office but is still being paid fulltime hours off the books, so basically no tax). It said something along the lines of ""don't you lie to us we know you bought GF (insert beauty product here) We have people watching you don't think you can lie to us don't ever do that again"".

(The beauty product was something my GF bought for herself and posted to her instagram story just so you know).

The dentist has been increasingly more and more distressed by the whole situation and has been telling my GF everything that been said by both the sisters and the mother in relation to what he can and can't do. They wont let him work Wednesday afternoons because they need a lift to wherever. Their mother is constantly threatening to leave his mother at the drop of a hat if he doesn't pay her more or doesn't give her and the daughters the extra allowances like getting hair done and the same pay as my GF.

TL;DR My GF works for a dentist with autism. The dentists mother has dementia and is in her 90's and her carer is threatening to leave if  her and her daughters who work at the dentists dental office doesn't get constant pay increases outrageous perks and they have the dentist paranoid and extremely distressed on a daily basis. One daughter refuses to work there at all and is demanding fulltime pay (off the books) and the other works very few hours and is doing the same. This has been going on for years.

Any and all advice for my GF is greatly appreciated!",28Sep2019,32
312,"First post ever on reddit. Please be gentle.

I'm almost 20, disabled, have been through a tonne of trauma and abuse, most of which has been from my parents. My partner is 38 and lives in another state. I know how that looks to everyone. But it's not like that.

Due to the trauma I experienced, I was forced to mature much faster than your average person. My partner went through long periods of depression and was cheated on which meant that he never married or bought a house, etc. Things that my parents really value.

My parents are trying to force me to leave my partner purely because of the age gap. They also mention the fact that he doesn't have a house, but houses here are around $800K to a million dollars and the average wage is $55K - $75K and you need at least 20% to put down a deposit. I respect their opinions but I don't want to leave someone who loves me and cares about me just because my abusive parents say so. I feel so miserable and I don't know what to do. My partner plans to move to my city next year or 2021 and we would like to get engaged and married &amp; have a family. 😭",28Sep2019,1
313,"I was approached by a close family members fiancée over a month ago, she said her parents were looking for staff for their hospitality business, and she knew I was experienced and temporarily out of work while my usual employer is closed for renovations.

After contacting her parents, and telling them I’m looking for weekday work, I was given weekend work with the promise of future weekdays. I realised it was all I was going to get for now, and changed plans over the next month, including setting aside an event I had planned for my husband. In a month, I was given 5 shifts, each totalling between 4-7 hours; the 7 hr one was without a break (which is illegal, but not unheard of in the industry). 

Now, I’m in a country that pays hospitality staff hourly, and doesn’t receive tips. Even though the shifts over 5 hrs showed a 30 minute unpaid break that I did not take, I decided to let it slide as it was basically family.

Last week, my fourth week there, I had been promised my wages would go into my bank account...I hadn’t yet received pay for any of the work I had done. I was also told I may get 2 shifts this week, so be ready. Come Wednesday, no wages were paid, and as I have a family to feed, I sent a text politely questioning when I’d see the money. I heard nothing. I sent an email the next day...nothing. 

So basically, I’ve been paid exactly zero dollars for any of the work. After the text and email questioning it, the shifts never eventuated. I have already decided not to work there again until I receive all my wages, but I’m upset that I’ve basically been taken advantage of. I also haven’t yet signed the employment contract, which is a legal requirement, so technically the government isn’t even aware I’m working there. I kept getting told “I haven’t had time to print it up, it will be ready next time”. 

I don’t want to have to bring the law into it, the wedding is early next year and I don’t want to create a problem within the family. I also really like them as people, and know there has been some family struggles recently.

315,"Before I begin, I've considered going to a therapist in the past but was always too intimidated by the idea that someone else would analyse my thoughts in depth and possibly bring up facts that I subconsciously knew but was in denial of.

Anyway, I have very poor self-esteem and confidence issues that I've had for a majority of my life as well as some pretty bad abandonment issues as I believe that most of my friends will walk away from me once they've inevitably grown tired of me. Thus, I usually take the blame for most fights or clashes I've had with friends and assumed that I was just a boring and uninteresting burden of a person whenever I fell out with people I once considered close.

For the most part, this level of self-depreciation and feelings of inadequacy have remained pretty consistent in severity. There are some days where it gets pretty bad and I feel tired and unwanted the whole day and there are some days where I feel a lot better about myself and forget about my low self worth and just have fun. 

But recently these feelings have been getting stronger and I feel constantly frustrated at myself for not being able to live up to my own expectations and feeling like a burden to those around me. However, the main problem I'm facing is that this frustration slowly turned into anger and now even the smallest matters set me off. I often feel personally attacked by small remarks or jokes that had no harmful intent behind them and find myself brooding on them for days. For example, a friend of mine made a joke asking if I had abandonment issues and whilst I had laughed it off, inside I felt anger and betrayal as whilst I knew she didn't mean anything by it, a part of me believed she had purposefully belittled/mocked my insecurity and I couldn't stop thinking about it for hours afterwards.

I've also become quite an angry person. I snap at people quite often now and I can definitely tell that the tone of my voice and the things I say have become more vicious and hurtful. 

I feel absolutely awful.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm currently preparing for my final high school examinations and right now I think the best thing I can do is just cut off contact from everyone so that I don't hurt their feelings or clash with them and end up saying something I can't take back.

338,"I moved to Germany two years ago to live with my now husband. It was a huge sacrifice for me, but one of us had to move and he was in the better position finacially and just generally. I don't regret moving because our life and our relationship together is amazing and really keeps me going, but I have struggled a lot personally since I have moved here.


The past two years have been rough. This post would get too long if I explain every detail, but I will try to quickly sum up the events. When I first moved here, I knew the basics and could do basic tasks like shopping, etc. I contacted four different language schools to better my German and they all didn't work out for different reasons. Two never contacted me back, one said they had no room for me, and the teacher of another got sick with cancer. I was pretty bummed about this and started teaching myself. Not soon after that, I was a victim of revenge porn. This brought me to one of the lowest points I've ever been to in my life. I contacted police, but they didn't do anything. I think they just didn't want to deal with my case because the events took place in multiple countries, making it sort of complicated. Not soon after that, my husband got extremely sick and was on bedrest for 4 months straight. Had to call an ambulance at some point because I thought he broke his neck when he passed out in the bathroom. Now I'm hyper aware and have to ask my husband if hes ok if he takes too long in the bathroom.  The excitment of a new country also wore off at some point and I find myself very homesick often. Another thing I have been dealing with is my parents guilt tripping me about moving this whole time and refusing to come to my wedding, which is somehow also my fault. I have always struggled with anxiety and depression, and of course the last years have not been easy on that either. I know all these details are not important to the main point, but I guess it's somehow theraputic to type out.


So, all of these things, amongst others, have made it hard for me to be able to sit down and focus on my task of learning German the past two years. I am not trying to excuse myself, but it's just hard to do a hard thing when you feel like your life is crumbling around you. My ability to learn has fluctuated the past two years and sometimes I really started to progress and sometimes I didn't study a single thing for over a week. 


I am finally starting to do better and life is starting to calm down a bit, but now I face the problem of people asking me why I'm not fluent after two years. I understand that it seems arrogant and stupid, especially with the reputation English speakers have, but I'm really not trying to avoid learning German and it makes me really upset when people imply that. I don't know what to say when they ask. I also get really upset and emotional whenever someone asks in an accusatory way, because it reminds me of all the shit that has just gone on since I've been here.


So I guess my question is, what should I tell people when they ask why I don't speak better German? I hate that I don't speak German and I am extremely disappointed in myself, but I have done and am doing the best I can so far.",28Sep2019,3
340,"I’m a (20F) french student who isn’t sure about what she wants. 
I always liked art and liked to draw. Last year I really got into drawing and my main goal was to become a tattoo artist. I feel like tattooing is a good way of earning money out of my art. However, this month, I started to question my choices : Do I REALLY want to become a tattoo artist?  I don’t know if I would « fit » in the tattoo world. All of the tattoo artists look very confident in themselves, are super social and don’t look like they care about what other people think about them. I’m the opposite, not confident, a little shy with new people, and what people think of me has a big impact on me. Idk, they all look so cool, I don’t think I’m cool enough.
I also don’t know if I’ll be able to draw all my life. Maybe I’ll get tired of it? Right now, I don’t know if I still draw because I’m used to it or because I love it. 
Another important thing: I’m a sociology student. My studies could allow me to become a social worker, which is something I’d like to do. But I also feel like I would be wasting my life if I chosed this path, I would live an average life. If I became a tattoo artist, maybe my life would be more interesting.

344,"Backstory: 
I've been at the house for about 1 year, 8 months. I am the head tenant, I am the only one on the lease because of the revolving door of tenants here we all just sort of gave up on keeping the lease updated, real estate agents &amp; owner included, it seems that as long as the rent is paid the owner is happy. It's a shakey situation because since I am the only one on the lease I am vulnerable to be paying the whole rent if the other 2 split, I also have half of the original bond im my name, the other half was ejected by a former tenant. They have assured me they are staying until the lease runs out in January and I believe them because they are honest, decent (to an extent) guys and arent the type to lie. They pull their weight and pay the rent &amp; other bills on time so it's not an issue. I am leaving once this lease ends in January to live alone as I've been share housing for 7 years and very over living with other people. The other 2 guys have spoken about extending for another 6 months max, if that happens I don't know nor do I care. I've been living with 1 of the lads for almost a year, lets call him Carl. The other one, Phil, moved in March.
/end backstory

Now phil and carl have become pretty good mates since phil moved in. It was carl who helped me search for another tenant and invited him in, showed him the house, etc.
I was never really good mates with carl but we got along fine and have always been civil and respectful towards each other, I do like him, not sure if he really likes me but seems to, hard to tell with him. Phil on the other hand, I didn't really like him from the get go, got a vibe from him I didn't particularly like, maybe it's just because we're so different, maybe it's because I believe he has an attitude problem, chip on his shoulder and is a rude, disrespectful little cock.

I've heard him multiple times say shitty things behind my back. He overreacts over small things, seems petty &amp; passive aggressive at times. It's making things awkward around the house. Just now, as he, carl, one of their mates and their girlfriends were coming up the stairs after drinking I hear someone say (I think it was carl) ""is Oneofakindof home"" then I clearly hear Phil say ""fuck 'im"". That's what triggered me to make this post. It's little things like that which I keep hearing and it's making me want to slap the shit out the guy and teach him some manners. It's making me angry and resentful towards phil and if it keeps happening it's going to result in a fight, one I will definitely win.

I would rather not leave the house on bad terms and burn possible bridges. Nor do I actually want this to get physical. I'm not sure what to do about this.",28Sep2019,1
346,"First time poster here, please bear with me as I try to get the details out and follow the rules,   Recently I undertook a remodel of my home and have spent the past few months working with numerous contractors and their employees.  Everyone has done a great job, been nice, professional and at times even fun to work with in what is normally a stressful time.  Three days ago, I hired X to come in do some final work that was needed as the project wraps up.  X came, was very nice, did a great job, though the interaction was a little odd as he insisted on picking me up multiple times and “cracking my back”.  Ok I thought, odd, not asked for but having followed his online feeds I know he’s a super friendly guy so I let it go.  The following evening X texts me to say “hi”, did I like seeing him? He then proceeds to tell me he’s eating dinner alone, can I join him?  Next he sends me his location information which reflects that he about 2 miles from my home.  Knowing from his feeds that X is a family man and lives over 30 miles from me, I ask why he’s dining alone. He then tells me he had estimates on my side of town, even drove by my house today. Now I’m a little creeped out.  X then asks if I liked it when he cracked my back and offers to come over and give me massage under the premise of helping me sleep.  Seriously, I have no idea where any of this came from and I immediately text him back saying NO - HARD PASS!  I then remind him he’s married and ask him not to contact me further.  He starts texting again the next day. I block his number, block his pages, etc.,   My concerns now are that  1) X knows where I live?.2) does X use his business to try to make inappropriate contact with other women?  3) X clearly portrays himself as a loving husband/father, self promoting his business and working hard, which was part of the reason I hired him - he seemed like a nice family man. Do I have an obligation to let others know about his inappropriate contact outside of hours? This man is going into peoples homes, sometimes single women like myself. If I do so, I am sure there will be an impact on his family who are innocent in this.  I really just need advice on how to proceed.  Thank you!",28Sep2019,1

She was what I was looking for in a girl's personality. She was quiet, smart, a reader, and a musician. We hit it off and quickly became good friends and ever since we were getting closer and closer together. One day though a freshman girl I didn't know (we are juniors currently) suddenly started sitting with us in lunch. I thought nothing of it and thought it was one of her band friends. Later on next Friday I didn't go to school because of some car trouble and figured it was the best time to see where I stood with her. I texted her and she replied back with, ""I still only see you as a friend. I can't see it any differently. I kept on meaning to tell you over the week but then I either forgot or it just wasn't the right time. I'm going to homecoming with Emily, she asked me last Friday and I just liked her...""

357,"I don't really know where or how to fully ask this. And if I'm just being an asshole, I would like to know too. But I'll start by describing a situation I currently am worried about, and a little about me. 

First off, I'm a worrier - I worry a lot. Mainly about my family, I think it stems from having issues due to me losing my father at a young age, although, I don't know for sure. I'm in my early twenties, and I think the worry I have can get in the way of me living a happy life, I sometimes just break down when nobody is around. And it also gets in the way of me doing work, which isn't ok. I have a job that requires me to be on the ball and I really don't want to lose my job as it's such a crazy job that many would call a dream job. Including me. 


So here is the newest situation that I have real issues accepting and not getting worried about:

My sister is a few years older than me, has one child and is just always in drama. The man she has a child with used to beat her up, which was already enough to worry me. Now she is seeing a man who in the past has raped her. It's both the fact that she sees him, but that she's also allowing her daughter to be around him. Her daughter doesn't like him. I've tried to explain many times how she should be very careful having people around her daughter, she won't even let the thought of anything happening cross her mind and just dismisses everything you say. The last guy she was with she met at a hostel (she was a cleaner there) and he clearly had mental issues, which she didn't notice for around a month, we (other family members) noticed right away. I struggle with the thought of something happening to my niece. It really saddens and angers me that she thinks this is ok. The other day there was a family dinner and she said he'd be going. I didn't go. I'm not a violent person at all, I didn't go because I don't feel like I could've been strong enough to hold back the thought of what he has and could do whilst being around him, and thus breaking down. I sat at home and basically chewed my nails, in front of my work that needed to be done.

She sometimes has very sexual conversations with me and has asked if I masturbate and can ejaculate. I confronted her this morning, catching her fucking masturbating to me while sleeping, and she says “oh I was just turning the fan off, its been on all night”, whilst completely fucking naked. 🤔 She has never raped me or done anything to sexual to me, but she has gently groped my buttocks and *tickled me &lt;—???*

I have never caught her watching porn, but i I’ve caught her masturbating, to what? Only god knows at this point. I *have* caught my grandfather watching porn of adults who look eerily similar to children... so I presume this runs in the family. My parents are divorced and she has never been able to make a marriage last. Im afraid I will turn into one of those- “things” as a result of my environment, and by things, I mean a pedophile. My neighbors are also pedophiles and they actually, literally, not jokingly **rape** their kids. I have decided not to get involved with them.

But now I have no idea what to include in my work or what the school really want. I was searching for someone who got into that school and see their portfolios or something for inspiration or for how to make good work for talent exams, but there were no results. They want around 10-15 pieces of work to send but I don't know what kinds of pieces! Artwork? One book of portfolio counts as one piece of work? Or one page of portfolio book?

Is even okay to include work my Comic/storyboard books (with deep thoughts and heart) I worked for myself in free time? Because my books are very chaotic and I have terrible handwriting and people, who don't know my handwriting will not have any idea what characters are saying.

And then some animations. I actually have some works of animation but I would like to do also make some new ones but now, I'm getting zero of good ideas what character to make for animation what should character do in that sort animation and what art style, to interest jury.

I have experience with animation in some way but I'm not proffesional. I did'nt make so many animations in last year. I did only one because I had to prepare and suceed in Highschool final exams called ^(Matura.) Then I had summer job one month in supper holidays and then one month I was lazy.

371,"I'm across the country right now on vacation and on the first day my mom told me very cavalierly, while we were swimming, that my dad isn't my biological dad, and they used donor sperm for me and my little brother. I was in such incredible shock that at first I laughed hysterically  because it's so difficult to wrap your mind around something like that. My dad was laying on shore, and  She didn't even tell my dad she was going to tell me, so he was just as caught off guard when we got back to the beach. 

I should note, I have 4 older sisters ( 3 from my dad's prev marriage and 1 from my mom's), and a little brother who I thought was my only full bio sibling. None of my siblings know about this yet. For now, its Just my parents, my mom's mom, and my aunts from my mom's side.

Now, I don't doubt that my dad is still my dad, siblings still siblings, or that I'm loved or wanted and all that, but when you hear this kind of thing about yourself at 37 years old,  your mind starts to  reel--you begin to reevaluate every relationship, family member, memory, health concern etc. 

For instance, 3 of my sisters on my dad's side aren't biologically sister's at all. The one brother I had that I thought was fully biological isn't. Half of my health history, that of which is very important to me as I'd recently been seeing numerous doctors to figure out some health issues I'd been having, is no longer relevant!! Half my genetic makeup and health history is a complete mystery! It's a mind fuck!!! 

Again, I don't doubt or question that my dad is still my dad, siblings still siblings, blah blah blah, but the part thats killing me is that my family is acting like this is nooooooooo big deal. I got emotional and cried soon after she told me  because this is a huge piece of information to learn and process about oneself, and they kept telling me things like, ""this doesn't change anything,"" ""you should feel good knowing that we wanted you so bad that we did this"" ""your dad is still your dad,"" without even thinking to ASK ME how I felt. Not one time in 4 days!!!!  After about 5 mins after learning about it,  they changed the subject and started talking about birds, the sailboats on the water, how nice of a day it was, all while tears are streaming down my face as I'm trying to process the gravity of the information I just learned about myself. 

After we left the beach, I was crying in the backseat while my dad talked about sailing, and my mom stared at her phone and tried to show me memes on fb. They even ""joked"" that I should ""get over it""  2 hrs after finding out! Neither of them even hugged me as I sat next to them and sobbed. 

I feel like my reality has been turned inside out, and not one person in family even asked me how I'm feeling or  hugged me, or told me that my feelings are normal, understandable, valid. Even later while  I was sobbing in the same room as them.  That's the part that makes this so painful. Not the fact that I came from a donor. 

I have no family support here, and they're all acting like nothing major just happened for me. I feel like my insides are being ripped out, my life is turned upside down, and I have so many questions! 

Is this why I'm so different than my family? Why I don't look like my family? Why I'm the only artist and musician in my family, why I've always felt so alone and different and misunderstood?? And i can't help but wonder about the donor! Is he an artist? Do we look alike? Do I have siblings?? I likely DO,   and could likely have a LOT of them!! Are they artists or musicians like me? Do we have similar mannerisms,  similar ways of thinking, do THEY have the empathy and compassion that my family is severly lacking,  etc.?

This is the craziest thing to have happened to me--it still feels like I'm talking about someone elses life. And the hardest, most painful part of it all, is the ASTOUNDING lack of empathy and understanding about how I feel. Actually, the complete lack of ANYONE even thinking to ASK how I feel. Even o e time. 

This is the lonliest I've ever felt-- to do this while I'm away from any of my support systems at home, and on the first day of vacation,  and to not know a single person in life that can relate to this  (until we tell my brother)  is just so .....isolating. I'm so emotionally exhausted, drained, and sleep deprived.  I feel like I've been standing in the middle of the room screaming and crying, while they stare at their phones or the tv and hope I'll just get over it because they're uncomfortable and ""don't know what to say.""

372,"I've known who I thought was my best friend since 2015, as we've went to the same schools since. For the first 2 or 3 years I was excited, I had never had a best friend that really shared all of my interests, perfect really. I was under the illusion that he was my best friend until recently. Around May of this year. 

How frequently do you talk to your best friend? Not like playing together, but just texting, or calling, or hanging out just because? I can't think of a single time he has texted me saying ""whats up"". I guess I've realized I've probably *never* been texted by someone just because. Generally I think I'm pretty likable, I try to be friendly and self aware, I like making people laugh and I think I can crack jokes pretty easily. And yet, I don't seem worth his time.
I know it sounds petty being mad about not getting attention, but it hurts. 

We've started forming a little friend group for a couple years now,   comprised of two or three others, and I'm starting to realize that the two new additions to our group are getting everything I've wanted from my best friend. Invitations, chatting, group chats (in which I'm in one of), and playing games. It's crushing. 

It's gotten to the point where I'll learn that my supposed best friend is going on vacation by an offhanded comment by one of our friends. I've expressed my distress over feeling left out multiple times, but nothing has changed. I would say my biggest detriment to the group overall is my anxiety. My anxiety attacks have caused me to not want to do certain things before. I realized last year that the reason for my lack of invitation may be their expectation for me to flake, or drop out. 

So, at the start of last school year, I started going to every single event I was invited to. The few I was invited to, at least. Nothing has changed. 

My attempts to bring up my concerns fall on deaf ears. I get responses like ""well dude if you wanna come then ask"". *Then why wasn't I invited in the first place?* *Why is it such a fucking burden to talk to someone and ask how they are doing?*

It's so goddamn frustrating.",28Sep2019,3

We made a deal that if she cuts smoking I will help pay rent. I paid and then I catch her smoking on her friend's instagram. I called her out on it and now I want to dispute against her in Paypal because she manipulated me to get it. I don't even know if she's real to me.

375,"So I am making pretty decent money right now, but my job will be ending in the next couple months. I'm hoping to find a job to work from remotely or possibly start doing some app development.

I'm single with no pets which leaves my housing options wide open. I'm not prissy or need to have fancy decor, just wifi, a fridge, and a bathroom(outhouse or solar composting totally acceptable). I've got a few ways I can cook electrically(pizazz! woohoo!). I could probably even improvise showers if I needed to(outdoor shower or maybe a gym?). Oh, and I hate the winter, so some place in the south. Small towns ok as I don't plan on socializing, just buckling down and trying to spend as little money as possible while I figure out how to make money off the internet. Obviously, if there's things like a stove and shower it would be nice, but not essential. I know it will be tough to find, but I'd like to try and keep my spending on rent and utilities to around $300-400/month.

I just started looking into a few ideas I've had... Small town hotels, campgrounds, etc.

377,"As I'm writing this I'm realise that it's very hard to put this into a logical and comprehensible post, and for this I apologise. I just hope that it conveys the situation as transparently as possible. 

 My girlfriend lives at home with her mum and her younger sister. She is 18 and her sister is around 15/16 roughly. Her home is a mess, her mum is basically a hoarder. Their home is a three bedroom bungalow, one bedroom is full of her mum's stuff (stacked to the ceiling) and so she shared a bed with her mum. She is embarrassed to the point that when I managed to persuade her into letting me see her home she cried, despite futile efforts of cleaning the house her mum and sister quickly return it to how it was before. She can't do anything without throwing away some of her mum's belongings of which her mum refused to do. 

Her mum also has heart problems, having multiple heart attacks and so she doesn't work. Because of this their only income is from child benefits from government and some money from her father who is mostly out of the picture. This all contributes to stress in the household and often results in arguments. In which her mum will lose her temper and usually take it out on my girlfriend. Saying things along the lines of ""I know you hate me."" ""If you hate me so much just leave"" ""I feel like you're painting me into a corner here"" ""you never listen to me"" ""you always interupt me"" ""why don't you ever consider my feelings"" ""all you do is lay down  you never help"" etc etc I could go on forever.  in the past she's blamed my gf for them living in poverty and the house being a mess as well as blaming gf for all of her heart problems too, so that's a thing. 

However, shes also really controlling. Demanding that she is honest with her about really personal, private things like her sex life and what she's done with boys.  Of course gf lies about what she's done out of fear that her mum will judge and despise her for it. 

I suppose the point being, my gf feels used, like it's all her fault and I just ant her to be happy and somewhere where she feels safe. 

I'm sure I'm missing important things so I may come back and edit more information into this but for now I think this is enough.

378,"Hello,

I am a student and I have a small problem. My best friend and I have been friends for 2 years. During summer, a lot has happened and I need some advice. It all started when I started talking to a girl who was going to the same school as us. At first, we were both hyped about her. Right now she is one of my best friends. During summer, my friend had to do a summer job at a place for 1 week. A guy, also from my school had to do that as well and they started becoming friends. What I didn’t know, is that the girl I was talking to had a conflict with that guy. So my best friend started hating her. Then school started, I was sitting next to my best friend. The problem is that he was acting like a whole other person. The guy my best friend met and the girl I was talking to attended the same classes. So my best friend was all attached to the guy he met at his summer job, and he started leaving me behind. He also kept annoying me about the fact that I was friends with the girl. The bell rang, and the first thing my best friend does is walk to the other guy. He was acting all tough and like he was some troublemaker. Just so he could make people think that he was cool. He’s nothing like that at all. He was always that innocent friend who never did something wrong. So he abandoned me. I was all alone at school and had no one there for me. You can tell how hard it was for me. The one who picked me up from the dark feelings was the girl, whom I talked to in the summer. I hung out with her a lot after that, along with her friends. We grew really close to each other now. Here’s the thing, my best friend has talked bad behind my back ever since I started hanging out with other friends. He told a lot of people, including my old classmates that I left him, so the reason he hung out with the guy from the summer job was because “I left him”. Nothing of that is true at all. His reason for not being with me was because I was with my other friends. The thing is, nothing makes sense what he says. He’s the one that doesn’t like the girl, so he doesn’t want to be with us. That’s why he abandoned me. I talked to him about everything, that it’s not I who left him, but he was. I explained how I felt, what I did and what the situation really was. He apologized to me, and I thought we would be best friends again. That’s not the case, he kept talking bad about me to others. Saying he was the one that came to me to apologize, that he was the one that came to me after “I left him”. People started believing it. All his lies were believed, until my friends stood up against it and told the truth. Against my face, he was my best friend. But behind my back, he was the devil himself. I can never forgive him for that. People also started getting mad at him for his actions. That made me happy, but it’s not enough. My best friend told the guy from the summer job the lies, but he never believed them. So he came to me and told me everything my best friend said behind my back. It was until then that I knew my best friend wasn’t my best friend anymore. It’s been weeks since it started, but he still acts like my best friend but talks bad about me. I don’t want this to happen anymore. I’m fed up with this shit. I want to end this once and for all. I’m done with people playing with my feelings. I’m done with fake friends who acted like the good, but were the bad. I don’t know what to do so I came here. 

So please tell me, what do I do?",28Sep2019,1

385,"Hello, so i am a 21M student and entrepreneur. Very ambitious and working towards  creating success life, (financially and other areas of life as well). Since i was young i liked challenging myself. Creating business making money and being creative with it.

So I have a friend who's also a bit like me. He is hustling and he says i was one of the people who inspired him. So lately, this friend of mine let's call him Rick. Rick found a way to make a huge amount of money. We're talking almost 6 figures per month. Which is levels higher than where I am. And he offers me to get involved in it. I don't want to get into details but i'm basically not going to do any work. And i'm gonna get huge amounts of money, at first I was so excited this is going to get me to another level in my life.

But then a thought started coming to me. I wasn't doing all this just for the money. I love this and take pride in it. I believe that happiness lies in the journey not the end goal. Taking this money means I can no longer take pride in it. I will take my life to a new level but i'm always gonna have to say it's thanks to him not due to my own effort.

It's getting confusing for me. I don't know what to do. Any advice ?",28Sep2019,0

So, my therapist has been doing emdr with me lately and I feel like its helped me to open up quite a bit. I've only done two sessions of it so far.

I've had a problem with this in the past and I work really hard to try and keep a polished and professional tone with people at work. Essentially, I've just been really blunt and come off rude and offended them. It's like I got annoyed and my annoyance came out before I could stop it and respond politely. I feel like I should be able to have better control over this and I think I've been doing pretty well for a good while. I'm not sure why I seem to be having this problem again here recently.

397,"I'm a grad student but I'll call it work for simplicity. 

Im trying to finish my masters early so I'm burning the candle at both ends putting in a lot of late hours and long days in the lab. At night it's just me and the maintenance staff. 

I'm a woman and this is another woman so it's harder for me to figure out what's going on. I made the mistake of being too friendly at first and she glommed onto me and now I basically look over my shoulder all day thinking please please don't strike up buddy buddy small talk with me while I'm focusing. If I mess up this experiment I don't get to leave. She knows this, too. She stands by my desk and makes small talk. Sits next to me chit chatting when I'm in the biosafety cabinet working with human pathogens. She talks to me across the lab when she's changing the trash can but I can't hear her because the vents are loud in the hood so I have to be like ""I can't hear you"" which makes her come closer....aaaahhhhh

I see her looking up and eagerly looking for me. She smiles and says hi when I'm within 10 feet of her. She will strike up random conversations asking me what I'm doing. I used to tell her because I thought of it as science outreach and a good opportunity to practice explaining my research. Now she always asks. I made a pot joke once and she laughed way too raucously and now she thinks we are bffs. One really bizarre thing she did... I was cleaning out 2 years worth of student files from teaching and discarded a lot of papers with Staples in them. To recycle them I would have needed to pull out the staples but I didn't have time so just threw them away. She REACHED INTO THE TRASH 6 HOURS LATER and brought me my stack of papers and asked if I really meant to throw them away. Fucking YES THAT'S WHY THEY WERE IN THE TRASH. Was that just an excuse to talk to me? When I explained myself she then RE EXPLAINED that she wondered if I really meant to throw them away or if I should be shredding them or recycling. Like, fuck, I don't care. Stop talking to me.

Every day she asks me in her deep southern drawl, ""ya gonna go home at a decent time today miss [my name].?"" No. No I'm not. This is research. It ain't 9 to 5. 

She is in her 40s and I'm 38 so we are close in age but she looks and acts way way older than me. She is a very masculine woman, lonely, caring for her terminally ill husband who is 25 years older than her. So I get it. She probably wants friends. That's why I was friendly at first. I have had trauma in life too and I know what loneliness and illness is like.

But I don't want to be that person to her right now. Let it be someone else. I'm here only one more month and then I'm out of this bullshit town. I need desperately to get a lot of work done and not feel like some old redneck has a crush on me. If she was a man that's what this would feel like. But she's married and female. Is she closeted gay and I'm a secret crush? What is this?

Turns out the wife of my previous DM was hired as manager (my current district manager and previous DM know each other which is how this lady was hired on). One of my coworkers/friend is currently training the new chic and apparently my name came up in conversation. And somehow this girl knew about my previous work history and how I left the other company on bad terms (I'm guessing my old DM recognized my name and got to talking). The new chic tried engaging the person training her - a person whom I've become good friends with - in juicy gossip. My coworker/friend shut her down and told her that she didn't want to hear any of it, and that if I've made mistakes in the past, I'm definitely a trust worthy and competent worker now. I have a feeling my bad history will eventually come out, therefore jeopardizing the management position I applied for. My question is.. How should I navigate this situation without dismantling all the hard work I've put into my current job?

He’s nothing like that at all. He was always that innocent friend who never did something wrong. So he abandoned me. I was all alone at school and had no one there for me. You can tell how hard it was for me. The one who picked me up from the dark feelings was the girl, whom I talked to in the summer. I hung out with her a lot after that, along with her friends. We grew really close to each other now. Here’s the thing, my best friend has talked bad behind my back ever since I started hanging out with other friends. He told a lot of people, including my old classmates that I left him, so the reason he hung out with the guy from the summer job was because “I left him”. Nothing of that is true at all. His reason for not being with me was because I was with my other friends. The thing is, nothing makes sense what he says. He’s the one that doesn’t like the girl, so he doesn’t want to be with us. That’s why he abandoned me. I talked to him about everything, that it’s not I who left him, but he was. I explained how I felt, what I did and what the situation really was. He apologized to me, and I thought we would be best friends again. That’s not the case, he kept talking bad about me to others. Saying he was the one that came to me to apologize, that he was the one that came to me after “I left him”. People started believing it. All his lies were believed, until my friends stood up against it and told the truth. Against my face, he was my best friend. But behind my back, he was the devil himself. I can never forgive him for that. People also started getting mad at him for his actions. That made me happy, but it’s not enough. My best friend told the guy from the summer job the lies, but he never believed them. So he came to me and told me everything my best friend said behind my back. It was until then that I knew my best friend wasn’t my best friend anymore. It’s been weeks since it started, but he still acts like my best friend but talks bad about me. I don’t want this to happen anymore. I’m fed up with this shit. I want to end this once and for all. I’m done with people playing with my feelings. I’m done with fake friends who acted like the good, but were the bad. I don’t know what to do so I came here. 

So please tell me, what do I do?",28Sep2019,1

Here's the problems I've already noticed for starters my management and coworkers. My manager during orientation was blatantly trashing on her workers it just came off terrible. Now for my coworkers ive noticed that they're not willing to help each other and just look out for themselves. They help me when I ask but Im new so kinda expect them to however when i see somebody struggling with something they kinda ignore each other.  Another problem is the PAY im only getting $10 an hour and getting about 35 hours a week with that daily 45min drive and taxes that's nowhere near sustainable. Lastly Im having a hard to coping to the mentality having to deal with civilians, like i said im just now getting out of the military after 6 years. Im having patience problems when it comes to people becoming irrational over the smallest problems.

420,"Hello everyone,

I am dealing with the father of my kids right now. We have both made mistakes. He was abusive in every sense of the word to me when we were together and as a result, I did something stupid. I was talking with another guy in a different country just to feel like someone cared about me. We had known each other for 2 years. I had met him before when he was visiting the US. Anyway, my ex found out and assaulted me. He basically beat the shit out of me. As a result, I ran away to Europe for a month. I have acknowledged it was stupid of me to do and I regret it every day of my life.

Here we are a year later and he wants me to sign papers to change our son’s last name from mine to his. I am hesitant because he wasn’t around for our son’s pregnancy (he actually accused me of cheating and saying he wasn’t his when he was). When I said this to him, he hit back with me running away for a month. This man tells me I am a terrible mother and that our kids should not love me like they do. What should I do? Should I just sign the papers and have his last name changed? I feel like if I do, he will use that as a chance to try to take them away permanently. We have shared custody.",28Sep2019,2

426,"Grab some popcorn, this is gonna be a doozie. I’ve been with my husband for 6 years, married for 2. I understand that every person has a different opinion on things based on their own experiences, how they grew up, train of thought etc. He has always had a very strong personality, and very strong opinions. Through the years I have learned to pick and choose my battles with him because it just isn’t worth it to me to fight about silly things.
However, through the years, I’ve begun to feel more like I’m a inconvenience rather than a partner. I’ve been shoved in my sleep because my snoring was annoying him. He’ll swear up and down he did not shove me but nudged me, but he snores WAY louder than I do and I have never tried to wake him in fear of him natural reacting by hitting me (he’s warned me that can happen without him even realizing what’s happening) or i just go sleep on the couch. 
I have been told in arguments that I’m not entitled to shit, including how I feel. I have never believed that my feelings are always correct, but i do believe I’m allowed to feel a certain way.
I feel like when he feels he’s not getting enough attention, he pokes at me, he’s smashed food in my face while I’m eating and things of that nature that he thinks is hilarious, but I warn him if this behavior continues, I’m gonna get angry, and then I’m an asshole when finally lose it.
When I was shoved in my sleep, I was notably upset the following day, but we had plans to go out with friends so I wasn’t trying to argue in public. According to him I was a being a bitch, and if I was going to be mad at him, he was going to make it worth his while. When we were out he spoke about sexual things we’ve done and details about my past that I’m not necessarily ashamed of, but used them in a negative manner to get a rise out of me, and I was still the asshole for ignoring him all night in an effort to not get into a fight in public with our friends around.
I literally have a million stories like these, I’m so tired y’all. He will not go to therapy, I’ve read a thousand books on communication in marriage, and honestly I don’t even want to spend time with him because he doesn’t make me feel good anymore.

Turns out she ended up getting a boyfriend when I thought things were going well. Her and a guy I y thought was my friend were assigned to the same group for 2 months at school which meant that they saw each other every day for 8 hours for this period. Now they talk because they seem closer where before I don’t think she liked him. 

I’m so jealous it’s killing me inside but I’ve already stopped caring as much as I’ve been realizing there are other woman out there who might be better for me. Still though, I like interacting with her group of friends but sometimes I feel like whatever friendship or whatever you want to call what is between us, is very one aided and she doesn’t care. 

If I don’t act or do something about this then maybe I’ll regret it for the rest of my life, but I don’t know what or if there is anything I can do.

429,"In my freshman year of college, I convinced my mom to stop tracking me via Find my Friends because she was taking it really seriously — if I’d so much as go off campus or not show up in the vicinity of the church during church time, she’d text/call me asking what was going on. It was getting really out of hand and I put my foot down.

My brother, who’s now a sophomore in college (I’m a senior), is still being tracked, and is irritated that I’m not being tracked. My mom wants to get me on the tracking app again so he’ll stop complaining. She says she feels she still needs to track him, at least for this year.

Despite my mom’s checking the tracking app constantly when I was a freshman and certainly when my brother was, she claims she’s “changed” (her words) and that she would only check “once a week”.

I object primarily out of a matter of principle, but also because my girlfriend lives several states away and I sometimes go to visit her there. My mom gets very angry when I leave school to do that, so it’s easier to just not tell her.

She also said that she “doesn’t feel [she] should have to pay for my phone plan if she doesn’t have the option to track my phone”. I’m applying to doctoral programs and I can’t work this semester to pay for it myself, though I could next semester.

430,"My roommate and I got into a minor argument on Monday about some scented product in the apartment. I get scent-triggered migraines and this particular scent was starting to bother me, so I'd asked what it was. As far as we can tell, it might be her hair product, which she said is the only thing that works for her hair type so I'd just have to live with it. And I do feel like an asshole for not being able to handle scents, but I'd really love to not get migraines. She suggested I move out, I said no. We texted a bit more on Monday- she said a friend of hers is coming over, she ordered a less-scented hair product to try. I last saw or heard from her on Wednesday when she answered a text I sent about there being a package for her and she left with her backpack on. I never ask her where she's going, with who, how long, etc. But she's not answered a single text I've sent on Thursday (these were warning her I was sick and telling her I'd paid my half of rent), Friday (she has a package and I put it on the table), and yesterday (telling her I have a teleconference call in the morning that's really important). I've also not seen any indications around the apartment that she's been here. There's no trash in the bin that's not mine, the bath mat isn't wet at weird times when she tends to shower, etc. I have no other way to contact her except her phone. I don't have her one and only friend's number. I think she might be with him, but I have no way to know. 

It's not unusual for me to not see her for a couple days because we have totally different schedules, but there being no indications she's here and not answering any texts is really weird for her.

434,"My (ex)boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 and a half years now on and off, and about a week ago we broke up because he found out i had cheated on him with some guy we both knew. Weve broken up before over some fucked up shit ive done and we still got back together because he kept giving me chances to redeem myself and i always took these chances for granted. 

Basically it was my birthday and he visited me in school (because he doesnt go to the same school as i do anymore and has actually moved countries) and got me starbucks and was so cute about it. Later that night i went out to a friends house where i celebrated my birthday with my friends but didnt invite him because thats the kind of fucked up shit i do. He texted me while i was out and told me he found out about everything and as soon as i saw the text i immediately went into panick mode, i start hyperventilating, grabbed my stuff and left the house and walked for about 5 minutes, stopped in the middle of the street and cried because i knew how bad i had fucked up. I didnt answer his calls or texts in the moment because i was panicking i didnt know what to do or what to say or where to even begin. 

I have a horrible habit of lying about everything. I try not to but in moments like this it just gets worse and i lie and lie and lie. I went back home the same night and finally answered his calls only to hear his completely and utterly shattered voice while he was talking to me. My first instinct was to blame it all on him which i know is the worst possible thing to do but again i literally can not control what comes out of my mouth sometimes and i seriously need a lesson on honesty. We talked for a while and deep inside i could just feel my entire body melt away into nothing listening to him have a complete mental breakdown and crying. Mind you he barely and rarely ever cries unless he cant take it anymore. I was the cause of all of this. Ruining him and giving him trust issues and changing his whole perspective on me. I am not the type of girl to cheat and when i love, i love with my all, and now he thinks of me as the dirtiest person in the world because of what i did to him and i dont blame him. But i literally love this man with all my heart and soul and would do anything for him. 

I know there is no possible way of us getting back together especially now that hes moved countries but i just cant stand the thought of losing someone i consider family. He has already lost completely if not all feelings for me and views me as just his ex who cheated on him. We talk almost everyday, because hes literally the sweetest person in the world and wants to “be here for me” even though hes the one hurting. I absolutely will kill for this dude and he still treats me like an important person in his life. I just want to make things right between us at least.

440,"Hello everyone. I’m 17 years old (turning 18 soon) and for quite a long time I’ve been underweight. Most recently I’ve weighed myself to be 20 lbs underweight. My diet has been pretty poor as well apart from what I’m eating at dinner. For instance I hardly eat any fruit apart from the odd banana every now and then but I know that 5 a day is a thing. Once every fortnight or so we get strawberries in and I might have like 5 at the most. That is nearly the most fruit I eat.

How much protein do you think someone my age would need a day? Because I get hardly any of that as well. I have steaks every now and then but that’s about it. I am obviously getting protein from the other stuff I eat in a day but just in smaller amounts.

In general I just don’t eat enough and never have. I feel really lost as to where I should begin.

444,"Hello everybody,

I'm in my thirties and soon to move back in with my parents. I've had multiple chronic illnesses for a long time but it got worse several months ago, and it's not really feasible for me to continue working and living alone right now. I'm closer to my parents than most people in their thirties, and I appreciate the fact that they're there and supportive. However, they translate their worry about my health into wanting to micromanage all aspects of my life. Even before having moved in, I find that our conversations increasingly take the form of them telling me to do something and then acting like I'm being incredibly unreasonable by not doing it. They worry about my diet (which is fine) so tell me to shop and the better grocery store that's farther away, even though I'm trying to minimize energy use. They then proceed to ask where I've been shopping and what I've been eating every day and berate me for not doing what they said earlier, down to me having to argue with them about what kind of coffee I'm drinking. They tell me to shave and get a haircut because I'm flying soon and they think I'll get stopped and interrogated, even though I've flown in and out of America probably 40 times and that has never happened. 

If I express any resistance to what they're saying they adopt a really serious expression and tell me that they worry about me.

I've also been dealing with multiple health issues for years during which time they were constantly telling me that I should just get over it push myself more, so I have built up resentment from that.  Now they actually decide to believe me, their anxiety manifests in these really controlling ways which make me dread our communication. 

I've already made some major logistic decisions about the next 6 months or so of my life where I considered alleviating their anxiety over what's good for me. This is hard for me and it's hard for them, and I do appreciate that they're there for me and willing pay for medical appointments etc. However I'm also feeling really apprehensive about moving in with them and basically signing up for being treated like a child for the foreseeable future. I could conceivably cobble together a life of working part time online and live in the country my family is from (which is extremely cheap), but again I'm worried that this would increase my parents' anxiety. 

Contrary to how this sounds, I do have a generally good relationship with my parents. They are getting older and I worry about their mental and physical health, and I don't like causing them anxiety. In a way I'm handling my health issues psychologically better than they are, probably because I've known that they're serious much longer than they have. However I'm still feeling apprehensive about losing all independence and constantly being treated like a child in my mid thirties. And I feel this situation building up where them worrying about me should automatically translate into allowing them full control of what I'm doing at any given time. How should I deal with this?",28Sep2019,1

So I agree to return the ring get a gift voucher so we can get a new ring. 

Two months down the line she hasn’t been able to decide on a ring, and for a litany of reasons I think we’re going to break up. Pretty shit.

Anyway I still have the voucher which expires in a month. As you might expect for an engagement ring it’s a substantial amount of money. The store is a small jewellery boutique, not a big brand at all so I think I’d have trouble selling it.

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do with the voucher to get all or most of the money back?",28Sep2019,3

450,"So as the title suggests, my sister is going through a rough patch in her life right now. She is actively going to therapy for it. Anyways, this weekend, we took our annual vacation to Hollywood, CA to go to HHN (HHN is a Halloween Haunt event for those that don’t know.) We asked beforehand if she wanted to go this year and she said no, which was odd, but we were okay if she wanted to stay behind. The day before we leave she decides she wants to go. Fine. That’s great, the more the merrier. Well last night, we finally get there and she kind of just shuts down. We have about 10 family members in our party and not a single one could get through to her. We tried talking to her, making jokes with her, We offered her alcohol and food.. nothing worked. Now this may sound selfish, (and it kind of is.. I look forward to the event months before it actually opens..) but honestly, she is being such a killjoy and she is ruining everyone’s time. I’ve never had to deal with depression first hand, so I was wonder if anyone has any advice to help me get her through this? Or how to tell her to stop being such a killjoy when everyone else is trying to have a good time?",28Sep2019,3

i live in a student hostel in Germany and want to make my walls more beautiful. I came up with the idea to create a giant (1x3 meter) wallpaper. I want to merge many printed pictures of the same image into one large wallpaper. Therefore i need an image of about 12000x36000 pixels when printing at 300 DPI.

452,I'm going through depression for over a year now. Nothing has helped. My epilepsy medication apparently contributes to this but the Irish health system is so fucked that the anti depressants they give out actually can cause depression as a side effect which is just fucked up. My house feels like purgatory and I feel like I'm going mentally insane. I feel so lonely all the time and I feel like I'm a burden on others. 2 months ago I was raped and decided not to press charges because the guard I spoke to said to me that the Irish justice system is so fucked that even if the guy went to jail it would probably take 2 to 3 years of court and misery and that I should only do it if I had the mental energy which I obviously didnt. The guy has 2 daughters as well and still lives in the same town. Sometimes I see him out for a pint and he's smiling. And I think why the fuck aren't I the one out for a pint smiling. Why the fuck do you get to smile you piece of shit. I'm writing this post because today is just the fucking worst and I feel like getting it all out to a community otherwise I have no idea what I will do. I don't know what kind of advice you guys can give me but anything will help. Thanks for reading this.,28Sep2019,1

455,"I’m currently a senior in college. I’m pursuing premed, I plan to go to a premed 12 month program for grad school before applying to medical school for the first time (essentially a gap year). 

I must say I’ve always had a stressful and strained relationship with my parents. They gave me a privileged life immigrating here from Mexico where there lives were much less than what mine was, for sure. I feel like I owe them my life for it truly. I realize how fortunate I am.

They’ve owned a farming business since I was 11. They’ve had me work ever since I was 11 in the fields and at the markets we owned to sell our produce. I was really never allowed to be home very much to not be lazy. They’ve instilled work ethic in me for sure but I resented it. It made me resent working, makes me feel like I never want to work again for the rest of my life and nearly made me resent my parents for working me so hard growing up. I was never really paid what I’ve worked because I worked 7 days a week for them, no matter what. 

Listen, I get it. They’re paying me by providing me food, a house, most anything I ever needed, nearly anything I wanted. But I was sheltered. All I did was go to work, to school, and go home. I took accelerated and AP courses growing up so I always tried to work myself harder academically too to prepare myself for college.

At 12, I was sexually assaulted by a neighbor. My mom knew, all she did was confront the guy one time. Never spoke about it again until this past month (I’m now 21). Brushed the whole thing under the rug, never got me help to deal with it, never guided me through it. Just got angry when I dealt with it by isolating myself and by anger towards adults, her, my dad, everyone.

I grew up very angry, very under appreciated, very stressed. I graduated with a 4.2 but in college, I am maintaining a 3.3 GPA. Too low for med school rn. I worked 7 days a week as a biochemistry major which REALLY affected my grades my first 3 years in college. I fought with my parents so much to let me focus on school. We’d fight, I’d cry, I’d beg, I’d rebel to focus on school because school was by future. They understood that but I still did everything they wanted (resentfully) because English isn’t they’re 1st language which means they needed help with literally so much and like I’ve said before, I feel like I owed them everything. 

I have no way to deal with my temperament. I am aware of how I am, but my father is the exact same way. He is an angry, stressful-minded, impatient man. He is nice when he wants to be but it’s not very often. I don’t know if I grew up to be this way because he’s like this or because of the constant stress I’ve been under. I’m having a hard time trying to steer away from becoming this way. I don’t want my temperament to be so short-circuited. I want a less stressful, happier, loving life. It’s so hard still living with my family because they do plan to help pay for my college and potentially med school. 

So to come back down to what I need advice on... because I still have to live under their roof, what can I do to help me not be so angry and irritable all of the damn time? I hate it. I frustrate myself because I’ve been under pressure academically and in my home my whole life. Stress never escapes me and I deal with my own demons I can’t leave in the past. My dad has chronic depression and major anxiety (both diagnosed). I’m currently diagnosed with anxiety but life is getting harder to deal with and as I grow older in my household, life getting harder to deal with in general. Maybe I needed to vent but I’m not sure how to deal with anything right now. I’m frustrated and angry. Everyone angers me. I’m not a super nice person anymore. Maybe I never was.

457,"Hi!

I'm soon turning 18 and that means that I should throw a big party. I used to hang out with my cousin , but here are the reasons why I don't want to invite my cousin:

He often mocks me, makes fun of me, my interests, my friends and my music, talking to him is like talking to an emotionless brick wall, he never starts a conversation with me on any subject, everytime I achieve something and tell it to someone near him he tells them how he did it better/how my achievement is insignificant, he can't take a joke (whenever someone jokes about him just a little bit he becomes enraged, even to the point of physical aggression), and he pretty much raped me when I was ~9 and he ~11.

It wouldn't have been a problem for me to decide if he didn't live nextdoor to my father where I was going to host the party, if I wouldn't have attended his 18th birthday (considered a bit rude) and if my father (who likes him (maybe even more than me) because my cousin helps on the farm a bit) wouldn't have said that I can't host the party at his place if I don't invite my cousin.

Should I:

A) Invite my cousin and host the party at my father's place

B) Don't invite my cousin and try again to persuade my father to let me host at his place (it's much bigger than my mom's house, also not as strict)

C) Don't invite my cousin and host it at my mom's place (again, smaller than my dad's place, my family would have to move to my grandparents for a night)

So basically in the final year of high school we hold a prom usually at a hotel. (rooms of 2 if u see where I'm going) and back in January my Gf (of a year) and I got a room together. We broke up back in May this year (let's call my ex May) . However she said we could stay in together because we were still on good terms with each other.

Some time after I hook up with another girl,let her be called April. We rly liked each other but a good friend of mine liked her a lot (let him be Tony) . And since I was just planning to mess with her, I decided to end it to not hurt Tony. I told her straight my reasoning, because she was a friend of Tony too. We kinda difted apart after. 

Yesterday. A month before our prom, my best friend (Zak) calls me. And says he's gonna spend the night with May. Because he's my best friend and May is my ex now, there's rly nothing I could say. May and Zak have always been close but since they are childhood friends and neighbors, but I never thought of it to that extent. I tried getting April with me, but she still thinks it's a bad idea because of Tony. And Tony doesn't even talk to me anymore. I feel like I shouldnt even show up anymore. Most of my friends side with May and I've been pretty alone.

Talking to her looked like talking to wall, she didn't texed me like she used to. Then when I was away for a week and got a little bit drink with friends and texed and got informations from me that I like her more than a friend. She wanted to talk about it but when i came back home she didn't have time for that. So i confronted her via text. (I got some info that she said that I did't had chance with her the her friends and stuff) She said that she messed up, but she wanted to be friends with me. 

Fastfoward a few days we went on a walk. I heard some things that I didn't like. Fe while all of this was going on she found a guys that she cared about and he cared about her, they were talking 4 times a day for a week, but then it died out. She told me before that she isn't ready for a relationship since she ened one a few months back (like 3-4 a this point). Ah and btw her last 2year long relationship started in like 2 days. She met a guy and was with him two days after. 

And again, I confronted her about it, but then she got mad at me that I hołd her accautable for everything she does and I'm egoist and stuff.

When I write everything I can see that she isn't any good for me but hell, my hearth still hurts way too much for something like this. I can't sleep at night. Every second I feel that I'm worst than someone else who just has this something that girl like her likes.

Here’s the issue: over this summer, my mother has acted verbally abusive, and negative in general. And because of that we haven’t been getting along. I feel like I always have to tiptoe around her and I’m tired of that. It’s taken a toll on my happiness and that’s not how I want to live as a grown woman. 

I was on board at first with moving, but the recent situation with my mother had reignited a dream I’ve always had about living on my own in the city. Now, the only thing is, I really don’t have friends here. My closest friend lives across the country and my social circle from college basically started excluding me during the last semester and so I’m done with them. Besides, over half of them no longer live in the state anyway. The one friend I do have up here, I’m really not that close to. I’m also not very close to any family around here either.

470,"Hi, first post. 

I work in a retail environment with a small chain of command. I've been working at this place for right at a year, and at this point I have been there the longest out of anybody that works there except for the five managers. I understand how the business is supposed to run, and I believe I'm capable of the responsibility of being an assistant manager.

The amount of people in charge stays pretty consistent. There are four assistant managers and one general manager. One AM's spot opened up about a month ago. The person leaving their position was just moving to another spot within the same business. I was not chosen to take that person's spot, and was not even asked if it was an opportunity I would be interested in. It was given to someone who had been there /just/ long enough to complete the probationary period (3 months). This person has management experience and a college degree, things I currently do not have, so I understood and brushed it off my shoulder. 

However, more recently, another AM's spot has opened up. This time, the position was given to somebody who has only completed half of the probationary period. I know that they have a college degree, but I don't know if they have management experience. This time around is really bothering me because of the fact they haven't completed the probationary period. Logically, I feel like I would have been the obvious pick for this spot.

Both times this has happened, I haven't been told why I wasn't chosen for either position, nor have I been asked if I'd be interested in taking it. I also haven't asked my general manager, who's responsible for the promotions, why I haven't been at least considered. I guess I'm just afraid of the answer, but I have expressed interest in moving up and taking in more responsibilities.

My question to you, reddit, is should I ask what's going on? And should I start looking for employment elsewhere? I feel like I'm reading too much into it, but I could be wrong. Either way, it's making me feel stagnate and inadequate. My boyfriend has told me I should ask about the situation, and maybe even go see HR. I'm friends with both people who got promoted over me, and I don't want to cause any problems, but I feel like I at least deserve an explanation because I do work really hard.

I've lived in Florida for over 10 years and have wanted to leave for probably the past 6 years. I grew up in NC and miss the mountains and seasons. Anyways, my brother lives in Denver and after a lot of thought I've decided Im going to move.  I would have waited longer to tell my friends, but there where several reasons why I had to tell them early. For one I'm in a band with some of them. They will need to replace me. Also they where about to ask like $900 from each of us for gear. I need that money for moving cost. And finally I may be too busy to do some gigs. Also, another reason is that a group of friends wondered If I wanted to move in with them. It felt really awkward keeping my decision to move a secret, so I finally just told them several weeks ago. It sucks, because know I have 5-6months of them trying to convince me not  to move. I know Im lucky to have friends who care, but I have to deal with ""where going to miss you"" for the next 5 months! They are actively trying to convince me to stay. They are going to wait till the last minute to replace me in the band, hoping I'll stay. They are religious so they told me they are praying I'll stay. One of them was listing several place that I could apply to for work after college, in an attempt to get me to think about getting a job in town and staying.   


Know I'm worried they will start trying to get me interviews at places in attempt to get me to land a job here. I not actively looking for work in town purposefully, but If Im offered something really good It would be hard to say no. My friends knowing this are going to try to convince me to apply or interview for jobs. BTW, there isnt much job opportunity where I live and most classmates I talk to plan on moving north or south.   


I'm dead set on moving, so this is becoming a real pain to deal with. I know I'm blessed to have friends who care so much, but they are making me feel guilty for leaving. I got a whole other 5 months of this....

It's just about how a conversation can be natural like never before and how you can never get it back that get's me sad. We talked for one day-ish on reddit and it was the first time someone wasn't giving low-effort responses. Most of the time in my inbox I would get 'hey' or something like that which wouldn't go anywhere.

So we moved to snapchat after that day because he said he wouldn't be on reddit as often to respond because he wouldn't get notifications so I installed snapchat because I didn't have social media. We talked on snapchat too, I honestly thought I had met someone that could be long-term, he even said he was looking for a something long-term in his initial post. Its rare also that someone says that and you feel it could actually happen but then again, I don't know if I'm taking this too seriously. We talked on snapchat for about 2 days and I just looked forward to talking to him in the afternoons because we would just ask each other questions and talked for 4 hours each night.  He seemed to know a lot about my little country, whereas most people don't know a lot. I didn't think it would end again.

He told me one day that he got a call that a relative was not doing well, so I told him that he should take a break to cope with whatever's happening however he just continued talking to me which I didn't think was the best idea because after all someone would have to process what happened.  He had said he had an eating disorder and then started saying that when he was little, he used to see things. This creeped me out so I just didn't reply for a while, I just get scared really easily. I was trying my best though to not get scared even though I was, and asked him what he was even scared of and he said monsters. So call me childish but I got even more scared when he said that. I tried to convince him that stuff like that doesn't exist but he kept saying he was scared for even bringing the conversation up himself.

He apologised for scaring me and said I should just forget he said anything, which was difficult because everything had changed. I don't even know why, but I was really scared from the entire situation so I deleted him, which was a quick decision for me. I keep trying to think about whether I overreacted, whether I lost someone that maybe said something on a day he wasn't feeling well, someone that may have problems. I don't know, I just keep thinking of my regrets still even after a week went by. He didn't add me back, but I'm predicting that's because he thought he had scared me already.

Now that he's gone, I just feel really alone which sounds really stupid but I do. So I keep having anxiety about whether I should just add him again for the past few days and tell him I'm sorry for deleting him and to just forget what happened he said, however I just don't know if I can deal with the rejection and I know I don't want to say sorry, because I was truly scared. Please someone, I know you don't have the entire story but I tried to include everything. Give me a way to deal with this if you can. I keep thinking I wont find someone I liked talking to as much. Or is this just going to cause me more anxiety if I do add him back?

The should I, should I not scenario is just making me feel even worse.

As I said, this is the last time I'm posting about this and I'm sorry for posting 2 times.",28Sep2019,0
478,"Hello redditors,
So, my boyfriend (M18) and I (F18) started having sex recently, we usually use condoms. I was gonna start my birth control but before I started, we were really horny and had unprotected sex. He didn't cum me but I had to get an emergency pill just in case. So, my ovulation isn't due for another 4 days but I'm on my fertile week.

479,"So I’m in my first year at uni and I’m not really sure what major I should pick (undeclared as of now). I’ve always wanted to do something in IT, so I narrowed down my options to engineering (EE or CPE) and comp sci. The first year courses for all of these majors are the same at my uni and I’m in them right now.

In high school I didn’t give 100% effort but I managed to be a bit above average. I remember taking an intro comp sci class and I sucked at it. But like I said I didn’t really try so I’m wondering if I should give it another go in college? On the other hand, I’ve always excelled at math (calc 1 &amp; 2, physics) so it would make more sense to work towards my strengths right?

486,"Hi everyone, so I made a huge mistake at work, and I've been having panic attacks for two days now from stress. 

Long story short - I work in HR and I completely forgot to get back to a candidate with feedback in 2 months (I know it's bad and I take full responsibility). Yesterday the candidate wrote a horrible review about our company on a public company review platform mentioning how a recruiter never got back to them. The CEO forwarded me this review on Friday night, and now I'm really stressed and I can't sleep. First question is - is this mistake too horrible or did something similar happen to anyone else? 

I'm not worried about loosing my job since I resigned a few weeks ago to start a new job next month. Second question - do you think my current employer will call my new employer to bash me because of my mistake?

489,"I have been suffering with generalized anxiety and panic disorder for years now. My panic attacks don't happen quite that much but my anxiety is almost always there. My psychiatrists always prescribe me anti psychotics or anti depressants but those make me feel more trapped and never help. I had a panic attack yesterday and it was BAD. I genuinely thought I was going to die and I almost told my parents to take me to the hospital. My heart felt it was going to give out and I was extremely nauseous and I had a burning pain in my stomach. I felt scared, sad, and angry. I took the seroquel I take at night to go to sleep but it didn't calm me down much at all as it made my heart race faster but I finally managed to go to sleep. After 3 hours I wake up and I have another panic attack. My thoughts are all over the place and I can't control them. I'm so jittery I can't really calm down so after 2 hours of being up I fall asleep again and again I wake up with anxiety for no reason. This has been going on for almost a week now but the stomach pain was probably due to me not eating enough because again my anxiety kill my appetite. I feel my psychiatrists don't take me seriously enough I would really like to give temazepam a try and when I mean try I don't mean like take it everyday no, I definitely would only take it when I am having panic attacks.

I am 30 years old and I am thinking about quitting my job.... from 2007 to 2009 I went to college and then dropped out I was working towards a liberal arts degree political science to be exact ....I then joined the military did that for a couple of years and then have been a loan officer for the last 5 years.
I only make about $60,000 which obviously isn't high but that is not my main issue... my issue is I do not like the customer service function of my job at all I don't like having to deal with the public all day everyday and it makes me incredibly unhappy.

So I'm thinking about quitting my job and going back to school... since it's been about 11 years since I went to college I don't know if any of my credits would transfer... I'm thinking about going to an online school like ASU but I'm not too sure about that either... I do have my full GI Bill intact so that would pay for 36 months of school which would cover my degree and I am lucky enough to have a spouse who makes a very good income so I don't need to work financially if I decide to go back to.

I have concerns that maybe this is foolish or not worth it in the long run.... there are so many types of degrees as far as Tech is concerned, computer science software engineering information technology etc... like a lot of other people I'm not very good at math so I think that's the part that scares me the most is that I quit my job and then at the end of the day I can't finish school again.

If I should quit... do I start at a brick and mortar school? Community college then transfer.. unsure of the path to take.
Any advice would really help.

500,"Ever since I was 8 years old I have wanted to be a vegetarian. This began from a school trip I went to that involved us learning about where our food comes from. I learned the process of meat from the animal to our plates. I ended up going home extremely upset because I did not agree with how animals were treated. My mother, smartly, thought it was a phase I would grow out of. Just like most kids go through phases of being interested in something, hell I still do that at 17. My mother thought that if I still wanted to commit to the lifestyle within the next few years then she would let. She did this as she was worried I wouldn't gain my proteins, vitamins etc. Thank God she did that. At roughly 11 years old I still wanted to stop eating animals, and then I found pescatarianism. If you don't know what it is, it is basically a vegetarian that eats fish. I know, I know. Fish are still animals. Personally, I view them slightly differently to the likes of cow or pig. So my mother let me do it and I stuck by it willingly. The past few years I haven't even been able to touch the packets of meat that the rest of the household eats. 

&amp;#x200B;

6 years and a bit from the introduction of the lifestyle I have stuck by my beliefs. Unfortunately, I am extremely pale, suspicion of a lack of vitamin B12/low blood pressure/iron and feeling a constant daze as well as sometimes having a sick-y feeling in my mouth. I am now debating whether I should begin eating meat again. Doing this I am worried about it being too late to gain back my skin colour (I have always been relatively pale but now I feel like it's affecting me), vitamins and protein. I have heard cases of people coming out of the vegetarian way and becoming sick as their body is so used to not have meats within their body. I am somewhat worried about it.

&amp;#x200B;

This though about stopping is also encouraged by the recent studies that have been conducted where it is better for the environment to eat insects. Studies that vegetarianism isn't safe for the body. The stereotypical vegetarian is pale and it isn't false. Every vegetarian you see (at least I have seen) is pale. It's becoming dangerous, to my belief. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to go against my beliefs of giving animals their life to live instead of slaughtering them. I'm worried that the person I am now today will change. It sounds silly but it does make me paranoid. I feel that it is too late and no point with starting to eat red meat and poultry again because I am 17 and not growing as much anymore. I used to be the tallest in my friendship group as well as almost the tallest in the school, although since the inauguration of pesctatarianism (let alone vegetarianism) I haven't grown much at all, at most a mere 3-4 inches in 6 and a bit years. Now, everyone is pretty much taller than me and my suspicions fall upon my lifestyle.

&amp;#x200B;

For the ex-vegetarians or pesctarians, or even vegans. How did you overcome your beliefs and lifestyle to thus live a healthy life?

502,"So my mom has always been very critical/ abusive towards me. Recently, I went to therapy for a year and a half to heal from the mental impact of growing up with her. 

I’ve been doing great in school ever since the therapy. Great grades, joining clubs, and now I’m the Vice President of a club. 

I’m currently attending a political conference in Michigan. So I sent a picture to my family group message “the food at this conference is great” 

No response. 

Next day, I get a response in the group from my mom 

The response was an article about the effects of THC on the brain, she sent that knowing damn well that I used to smoke  

Instead of replying to my picture from the conference and saying good job, or wow that looks great, that’s what she sent

Now, I excused myself from the conference and went up to my hotel room because my heart is racing. I feel like I’m going to start shaking. I am just so upset. I couldn’t even finish my food. 

My mom hasn’t called me in months. Ever since she started to see I’m doing well she started to cut me off and stopped speaking to me. It’s just starting to hurt me a lot. Does anyone have any advice for me to recollect myself so I can go back downstairs to this conference with a clear mind?

512,"(WARNING-LONG) A little breakdown, I'm 16(F) and an emancipated minor living in Arizona. I have a job that primarily are people half my age. My job is a pretty good distance from my apartment building, but it's not too long to not walk. I also don't speak to anyone outside of my work. 

The man in question is cool, but a pretty weird guy. I'll call him J. I've never had a reason to feel necessarily unsafe around J until these past few weeks. I've been noticing him a lot more around my complex, stores, places I normally frequent. This isn't a big deal of course, but it gets weirder. I get home pretty late one night, and I start to notice J following in the distance. The moment I saw him I got a really odd, sinister vibe. It was just the two of us on the street, and there were no streetlights. I decided my best option was to keep walking. When I turn the corner, he's a lot closer than before. I started walking faster, but not making it too obvious. The horrible feeling returned, so when I turned the corner, I don't know why, but I just ran. I literally didn't have to turn around to hear him sprinting behind me. A little bit of a dumb move on my part, but the path he was following me was one that led straight to where I lived. I wasn't thinking and was in tears by the time I got back to my house. 

Throughout this past 2 weeks, I've noticed him not even trying to hide it anymore. Wherever I go, he's right there. Sometimes he puts a cast on and even tries to strike up a conversation about his multiple injuries on one specific arm, yet he doesn't wear the cast at work. I don't know anything about this man, not even his last name. I genuinely wish this was fake, but I even have evidence of him standing outside of the complex. He's everywhere I go. I even see him in different cars, and even taking photos of me.

515,"Hello! It's been four years since I've created him. For the sake of this background info, I'll call him Jess.

I grew up socially awkward and kind of an outcast. So one day, I decided to daydream a character from a popular media as one of my close friend. I'd sit in class staring out the window and into the forest daydreaming about our adventures. However, I suddenly moved and when I did, the character from the popular media started slowly evolving. He became my distant cousin. I pretended to be Jess and made up multiple social media accounts. He talked to my online friend and caused drama for me and them. He caused us all to split up. As I moved on, he started to evolve into my best friend and we became not related. He completely has a different personality from the character from a popular media. I made him a background story and where he came from. I gave him his own personality and flaws. Everything else developed on its own. Such as his struggles and his feelings. I occasionally have him talk to my new friends. Now the big issue is, I lie about his existence. I'd tell them that we talk at night and would describe things as if everything was real. Whenever I write a personal paper for my class, I'd write about him and all our adventures or I'll write about his struggles.

His existence is perfect. He has good looks, money, brains and athletic; however, his personality is just the shitiest personality ever. He is very two faced and doesn't seem to care about people except for his friends (yes, I made him friends too. VERY DETAILED FRIENDS). He would shit talk anyone he could and he would sleep with any woman. He would cause trouble and get suspended from school and etc. He's currently 20 right now and in contrast I'm 18.

I lied way too much about him and everything is thoroughly planned out. I've tangled myself up in that lie, and everyday I hope that lie would become reality.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't just end there, I aslo talk about him to my real life friends and classmates. I also talk to him in my mind. Whenever I would be upset or struggling, he would suddenly call me by my pet name and comfort me. (I never like opening up about my feelings towards anyone. Not even my family.) I'd talk to him unconsciously in my head and tell him how I felt. I would imagine scenarios with him. I would reminiscence our non-existent made up childhood. The scary part is, everything feels real. Whenever we talk in my head, I would feel sad if he insulted me or if we get into arguments. Whenever I remember a made up memory of him and me (and other made up people) I would feel emotions such as happiness, fear, guilt, and etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest part is probably when I feel like I'm tired of just breathing, he would always talk to me and remind me that it's okay to rest. That if I died, he would die too. It scares me that he would die too, so I would immediately try my best to calm down and avoid making impulsive decisions. He would always be there when I'm having mental break downs and would stay by my side no matter what. When I'd get into arguments with my mom and she gets verbal and occasionally physical, Jess stays by my side and would comfort me and remind me that the two of us will one day run away. 

&amp;#x200B;

During my birthdays, I tend to feel down and just tired. He'd always be there to greet me and just thank me living and congratulates me for getting this far in life. Whenever I'd feel suicidal, he'd be saying: You've survive this far, you can go further. 

He'd also say a lot of encouraging things to me. Whenever I'm scared to try something new, he'd say: You might like it, and you'll regret it later. Whenever I'm about to cry in public out of frustration, he'd say: Hold it in, you can cry later and I'll be with you.

520,"Me and my ex gf were together for a year and broke up about 2 months ago. We broke up simply because the relationship couldn't work anymore. So the last time we talked as a couple I made sure I was being mature and wished her good luck and happiness in the future. As in I wrote her a small paragraph. However, she didn't do the same for me as all she said was ""thank u, u too"". This left me quite upset and bitter as I thought I deserved more than that. I'd say we knew that it was going to happen weeks before it actually did. So after we broke up we didn't speak for about a month or so, however in that time she was posting on social media like nothing ever happened. It felt like she didn't grieve our relationship at all. This hurt me quite a lot because it felt like she was over me pretty much straight away. At that point I kept catching myself checking social media so many times just to see whether she posted or liked any posts or anything. I don't know why because it only made me anxious and upset. This got to the point where I decided that this was very unhealthy for me and I unfollowed her on instagram and unfriended her on facebook without notifying her. To be honest that felt so relieving. However a few hours after that she messaged me asking if that means that I don't want to be friends anymore. Yet again I was back to feeling upset and anxious. We talked about what happened and I decided that I'm going to try and stay friends with her. I thought I was over the fact that she wasn't particularly nice when we broke up and I thought I was able to be her friend. But the first time I saw her in college I saw all the changes she went through and then I felt uneasy and anxious. But I still went ahead and tried being friends, however every time I talk to her, see her in real life or see her post on social media I have this angry and anxious feeling. I believe that this is because of the fact that she never gave me closure to make it easier for me to come to terms with our relationship being over. I messaged her again last night explaining how I felt and she did say that she understands if I don't want to be friends. And I think that's what I'm going to do. What i don't know though is how will I ever be able to get over her and over these feelings when I regularly see her in college?

527,"this is a throwaway account because I don’t want any of my friends to see. I’m 17, and my parents have always been separated. I have two homes, six hours apart. I’m having trouble deciding where to stay. The older I’ve gotten the harder it gets. In my mom’s home it’s very clean, everything works fine, and we have lots of food. I also have a stepfather and two half siblings. But I have no freedoms. My mom has issues with anger that have admittedly gotten better over the last year, but are still there. I was in the hospital at almost exactly this time last year, and soon after she kicked me out... on thanksgiving day. I was 16 and she told me to go live with my dad because she couldn’t handle my mental health problems anymore. She stripped me of my phone (which was a birthday present that I had to do chores everyday after school to keep) and laptop (that I got for homeschool after the hospital incident and had to do numerous different chores each week to keep) so that I couldn’t have any communication with anyone. I was scared of her for a long time, even before this incident. But she can provide for me better than my father. I moved back in with her in June, and just came back to visit my dad in early September. Since I finished high school early, as soon as I come back from my dads I am being pushed to get a job and start college. My mom wants to buy me a car as soon as I get my license and have me pay for the insurance. It would be nice to have a clean home environment but the people in my moms home are less emotionally stable. The quality of life is worse, but the cleanliness and the $$$ is much better. Six figure income. At my dads, we make little money. We have no A/C... we have 3 window units, one in my room, the living room, my dads room. But the house is humid everywhere else because we live in a large two story house. We also have no oven. We have a stovetop, microwave, and toaster over. My dad buys me mainly fruits, snacks, and ready made foods like rice-a-roni, mini pizzas, veggie burgers and oatmeal. So that is a con. Also, my grandmother lives with us. She always has, since I was little. But my grandma has a bit of a hoarding problem. It’s nothing like the tv show hoarders, but we live in a 5 bedroom house, and 3 of those bedrooms she has turned into her own storage rooms. Our living room, dining room, and kitchen are unenjoyable because they’re full of her junk. And it’s not even valuable stuff. All our important things are old and junky also. She sleeps on the couch, by choice. She is very kind and I love her but she can’t let anything go. Anyways.... my dads house isn’t as clean and we have few appliances that work. Our house is in need of numerous repairs I haven’t mentioned. My dad and grandma get touchy when I bring up anything about the house, I think it’s a sore subject. My dad just tells me I have to accept it. But I have freedom, and I feel no pressure. My mental health is better. My mom wants me to live with her, and my dad wants me to live with him. So the thing is, do I choose cleanliness or do I choose [somewhat] happiness? I’m getting so old I think this is the last time I’ll be able to choose",28Sep2019,1

534,"Hey, so my girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years almost 4.

When I met her she was a Tumblr girl but she was 15 at the time and I was 16 so I gave her the benefit of the doubt, yanno, young and stupid.

Over the few years we have fun making fun of “normal people”

People that try way to hard in life to be “cool” or making fun of people younger or older than us for doing stupid “cringy” things.

The floss, fortnite in general. Tik Toc, horrible memes like catch me outside girl, Lil Nas old town road. Yanno the normal stuff that’s obviously horrible and it’s hard to believe it trends.

Anyways so it all starts 2 and a half years ago when I noticed she was getting a little TOO into Instagram. At the time I actually quit it because it was getting horrible and I noticed she started liking it more! I thought nothing of it... a shitty community to me might be something she likes, no big deal.

A little after I find reddit and really like it. I don’t really tell her about the app as I wasn’t crazy into reddit until a year later.

Anyways a year goes by, Tik Tok comes out and THANKFULLY we both hate it. Vine was way better, look at all this cringe, blah blah blah, the usual fuck normies stuff.

But at this time I notice she’s getting really into Instagram, Snapchat and weird channels like BuzzFeed on YouTube.

She’d tell me to fake reactions and do cringy stuff on her Snapchat stories, etc.

I notice she’s becoming a little normie-ish but oh well she can like what she likes.

I did attempt to make her switch sides tho.

“Hey have you heard of Reddit” I asked her.

*She then* **ROLLS HER EYES**

“Yeah, I used it a little and it was garbage”

MY HEART BROKE

“WHAT DO YOU MEAN GARBAGE?”

I try explaining to her that the HUNDREDS of meme pages she follows on Instagram just steal from Twitter and R E D D I T, duh.

She wasn’t having any of it.

I try showing her all the cute dog pages (she likes dogs) and she still wasn’t having it.

How could she not like all the vast and great communities? This app is literally for everyone!

ANYWAYS. A few months goes by. She does some more borderline normie stuff (listening to Spanish music she doesn’t understand, posts a lot of stuff on VSCO, sending me memes that are like 2 or 3 months old, etc.)

I even caught her listening to Lil Nas’ new album!

ANYWAYS TODAY SHES DONE IT.

She turned 19 last week so you’d think it’s time to stop the weird normie shit now and grow up...

GUESS WHAT SHE DOES?

SHE SEND ME A TIK TOK.

I’m like “okay... it wasn’t even funny at all but maybe she just wanted to send it to me...”

THEN SHE SENDS ANOTHER!

AND THIS IS WHEN I REALIZE IT SAYS “*her name* is using TikTok. Join us now!”

SHE DOWNLOADED THE WHOLE ASS APP, AND ACTUALLY LIKES IT!

Have I lost her?

Is it time to throw away our promise rings and just give up in life?

Is it time for me to move to another country?

536,"Need some advice on how to deal with a particular issue I’m having. A little background about myself, I’ve got hired a part time position (3 days a week) for a new customer service job taking food orders for different fast food companies.  So basically my first week at the job I had taken some calls while my trainer was listening in on the same line. Had a customer who seemed pretty on edge and in a “rush” as well. Her accent was thick so it was hard to understand what she wanted ordered plus she spoke really fast to make it worse. Although I tried my best I still stumbled a lot as I was nervous and it was my 3rd day at the job. 

Anyways moving on from there today (7th day on the job) I was still in training and happened to take more calls. Only this time my trainer had run out to go the washroom and lone behold I encounter the same customer as before. She explained that she had 2 separate orders to place. I proceeded to take her 1st order and again had issues so I told her to repeat numbers multiple times as I was losing track for what she was saying. She started to moan and say “I don’t have all day” I replied by saying “sorry ma’am I’m still training” and she said “I know you have been since 3 weeks ago”. After this there was no issues in the rest of her order and before she left I told her “thank you for your patience, have a nice day” and she seemed happier at the end maybe because I picked it up towards the end of the order but idk. Remember this was only the first order and she had hung up like she was finished. But she would call back 5 min later and this time my trainer (not knowing what happened) would speak to her, she took her order in half the time I did which was kind of disheartening. But what crushed any confidence I had was that this customer lady told my trainer “wow you’re really fast thank you” at the end of the call while I was on the other line listening. 

My only issue is that she practically meant I should be more competent at the job because it’s been “3 weeks” but in reality Im part time and have barely worked a full 7 days so far. On top of that training consists of 100’s of other things, sure if I was taking orders for 7 days straight I would be more proficient but I’ve only taken about 40 min worth of calls so far. I just don’t know if I’m the one In the wrong here or it’s vice versa, my coworkers told me to not worry about it as this customer has always been like that. I know I will encounter her as a customer again, how should I approach them ? I don’t want to be her punching bag during my time at this job lol",28Sep2019,1
537,"I finished secondary school this year and I’m at college now doing an apprenticeship. At school I never had lots of friends just a few. Since then tho I haven’t talked to them much as we’d never really talk out side of school. The college I’m at now I can’t make friends as they’re all chavs. I’m into old music and that (like rock and a lot of metal) so it’s hard for me to be friends friends with people with similar tastes as me. This also greatly impacts on intimate relationships as well (mainly cause music is a big cornerstone of my life and I play guitar but no one really listens to the music I do therefor my guitar playing pisses them off).

538,"Okay so i'm 17 and so is my boyfriend. He's always been an oddball, but recently a few things have made me wonder. For example, he is a film student and has decided to make his project (each project is done individually in the class, so the idea and production is all his) about a pedophile. Or, 'about a nonce' as he put it. He hasent shown me the screenplay yet (he's only just started the project) however. This is a serious project so I know he hasent done it for a laugh.

 I then started to notice that he watches a lot of sadistic things online and in movie form (I havent been snooping, he hasent hidden any of this information). And I mean really hardcore sadistic stuff, such as supposed snuff etc. 

I then, earlier today, I watched as he microwaved a live fly. Just casually as I was making us tea, he watched it fly into the microwave, slammed the door and set the timer.

539,"I was working at a restaurant , throughout my last week I got into a small verbal altercation with two of the host. Me being the mature person I am I apologized and washed my hands with the situation keep this in mind. 
One of my managers was a very aggressive person , whenever she spoke to me she came off very demanding and accusing no matter what the situation. She always made my anxiety flare up immensely which caused a lot of over explaining when i made a mistake. The issue is that they never asked me if I did this thing or if i knew how , it was always an accusation. I was thinking about quitting for a long ass time but I never took it serious until I had another job opportunity. I thought we would be okay but they started doing petty little things to mess with me, things that might be minor to you but actually affect my whole work mood and environment. I expressed this to her and thought everything was fine between us as she explained that she can be hostile at times due to her Jamaican background. I thanked her for her time and listening , after that I was never on the schedule with her for a good three weeks. So instead of my usual 4 shift I was now working 11 AM shifts which she wasn’t around for. They started by changing my schedule, I was due at work at 5 or so I thought. My schedule suddenly said 4 and I was baffled , after that they were after me all day. They threw out my lemonade claiming we can’t drink at the host stand and had a nasty attitude. I was texting my mum ( I shouldn’t have been texting I know) but the restaurant was super empty so I didn’t think it was that serious. When an hour or so passed I was in the workers hutch ( like a place where we can do things without getting in trouble drinking , eating etc.) I was leaning on a wall and she just came at me with all she had , I got angry and lost it. I kept it professional but let out my anger. After that I went to the back to get something and she saw me. After I came back she went to send me home so I quit. 

I’m very close to one of my co workers so she texted me asking what’s up. Apparently my co workers feel I quit because they were still mad at me and I apologized though I did it more for clarification, I’m not angry all the time I just had a lot on my shoulders that day. Way too much for me to handle , this experience makes me feel being the bigger person never really works out. It kind of bothers me , am I wrong ?

She's a nice girl in a real life, but on messenger, every time I talk to her, it puts me in a negative state of mind. I met her on a dating app but we chose a platonic friendship route.  I def feel like she has too much baggage to even be close someone I'd consider being in a relationship with.

I don't mind a bit of honest conversation about life struggles, but I feel like its all she ever talks about and its from a really helpless, ""debbie downer"" perspective .

545,"Hi everyone. This is a classic mother/son relationship rift for this community I suppose, but right this situation I'm going through is very critical and I just really want some third party opinions on it (that isnt some psychiatrist or councilor that I want to meet face to face)
Background (this is pretty important I think): I am a fifteen Asian teenager and my mom is an overworked single parent. My mom went through a divorce due to having a father that overworked her, which led to arguments and they left when I was four. My dad went back to China and my mom stayed in Texas. I was sent to live with my grandma for half of my life in China and went back to love with my mom, which brings me to the present. 
I'm going through all the normal stages of puberty, but due to me being a second generation I have a lot of conflicting views with my mom, and we sometimes fight. The biggest issue is that she can't handle me emotionally and her anger issues, and she does agree. The biggest issue she has with me is about my negligence, which I agree as well. I think I am getting better (but I may be having a biased way of thought) but I still frequently forget or be late, in which my mom will lose control of her cool and begin to harshly criticise me (she had called me a pig, trash, etc and said that was a compliment sometimes) and will then inquire about if I don't agree with her, then I should just move out even though we both know that I can do no such thing. Currently, I am trying to temper my anger whenever she says these things (like not saying anything), but she almost always says something that will tip me over my edge. Sometimes I completely lose it and just jump out of her car whenever she says ""get out"" or something, and then she will drive off and I will meander around until she comes back to pick me up (or I will just find my way back home if it isn't too far away). Now, I know my mom dosen't mean anything harmful and she still loves me, but sometimes I don't think she is aware of how she emotionally hurts me when she does that. 

I have had suicidal thoughts, but I know I am to cowardly to pull off anything off like that. 

When I try to call suicide hotline, talk to my counselor, etc., she will think I am reporting her (due to me accidentally summoning social service workers when I was in 5th grade) and will think I don't care for her. 

Please, I just hope to have some advice. I know that I am at some fault too, but I just want some third party advice.

550,"So I know absolutely nothing about phones or plans or the like, and I kind of want to get some basic smartphone to help me learn as I go. I mean *really* basic, something I'm not afraid to lose or upgrade that I can still toy with and learn what I use and what I want in future devices. As far as phone plans go, I really don't expect to use it outside emergencies and the rare call from the boss, so basic prepaid plans seems the way to go. I'm thinking getting a $60 Blu Advance off Amazon and wiring it up to Red Pocket's $5/mo plan. It'd be a smartphone, it's got android, the plan gets me 100m/100t/100mb a month, which I'd be surprised if I exceeded. I think it'd suit my needs well enough, but I don't know. What do you guys think?

Also, a couple additional questions:
 1) I guess I've gotta choose a network? GSM seems better, so it's between AT&amp;T and T-Mobile's. If location matters, I live outside Portland, OR.
 2) Incoming calls use up minutes, right? So how do you keep the regular scammers and cold callers from eating up your plan?
 3) This one's really dumb, but: Smartphones connect to wifi, right? Like, if I'm at home or the library, I can browse online, use apps, whatever, without using data? Do you need anything to do that?

551,"In 2015, I had to attend probation meetings because I was charged with ""malicious destruction of property.""

I didn't commit the crime. I accidentally left a lit cigarette on the ground in my bedroom and that started a small fire (which I promptly extinguished). Nonetheless, since I didn't want my parents knowing I smoked cigarettes (they are VERY conservative), I told the firefighters, when they arrived, that a candle started the fire. They saw no evidence of a candle and so they charged me with arson, which later got dropped to malicious destruction of property in a plea bargain. (I took the plea bargain because my lawyer told me I had a 50/50 chance of going to jail for 6 months).

Anyway, at one of the probation meetings, my probation officer told me that there is something wrong with me and that that is why I am not married.

Totally inappropriate. I'd like to know what to do about her comment. If she said that to me, imagine what she is saying to other people who must see her. I feel like this needs to be reported.

552,"So me and this kid were pretty good friends, I’ll call him AJ. I was scrolling through some music subreddits and there’s one where people can share their own songs.  

I was on it for a while and at one point I clicked on a post that linked to the guys SoundCloud and it sounded exactly like AJ. I thought it was an ok song or whatever and went back to the subreddit. The username for the redditor was the name of my friend. So if his real name was AJ the username would be AJ with his middle and last initial and some numbers. 

I went back to SoundCloud link and he had like 5 or 6 songs up and they all sounded like him. The bio on SoundCloud had the name of the city we’re from, and all the song thumbnails were memes that were exactly AJ’s type of humor. One of the songs was even a remix of one of his favorite artists that he’d been posting about on his social media at the time. 

So I’m fairly convinced this is him, and I text him asking if it was. He said it wasn’t, and I said ok. I was thinking it was but if he was denying it I wasn’t gonna push him about it. I also sent the link to one our mutual friends, who I’ll call Jack and said doesn’t this sound like AJ. He said yeah and noticed the same things about the bio I did and referred to above in this post. 

Then I guess Jack messaged AJ the link also and asked him (I didn’t tell him to), and after that AJ immediately deleted the SoundCloud. A little bit later Jack sent me a message that was a screenshot of AJ telling him that I must’ve been snooping intentionally on his Reddit account. I know AJ also told at least 2 other people, who knows how many others. I felt bad that he felt he was being intruded upon but it was honestly a coincidence I found it. 

Later that day I texted him that I saw the message and apologized that it bothered him, but tried to assure him I wasn’t creeping or anything like that. He never responded. This was all 2.5 weeks ago. 

At this point we play fantasy sports together and we have a group chat with a bunch of people and I can tell he’s still very mad about it. It may just be my social anxiety but I feel like he told more than those two people which is bothering me. On top of that it sucks to seemingly have lost a friend over what amounts to a misunderstanding. I’d totally have moved on if I really was creeping on his account or whatever but I honestly wasn’t and I’m not sure what to do. 

Basically I want advice on whether or not I should move on, and tips on doing that. Or if I should try to salvage something from this friendship and if so how.",28Sep2019,3

We FaceTimed 2 nights ago til we Had to get ready for school at 6AM. Earlier in the call she tell me she feels as though our relationship is “habitual”. I didn’t know how to respond at the time so I stayed silent, but the first thing that came to mind was that she she was getting bored, she felt as though we were talking to each other not because we liked it, but because it just became like that or she’s expecting more from me that Im not providing. 
Finally before we come off of the call she tells me that she really appreciates me. I didn’t say it back in the instance because all honesty I was 99% asleep, but as I realized what happened and she ended the call, I called her back and told her instantly because she needed to hear it. 
Now today is her birthday, I wasn’t able to FT her last night to stay up till her birthday because right as she asked she fell asleep and the call didn’t happen.

So I'm a 16 M, and my home life is miserable, and has been for as long as I can remember. Parents are abusive and narcissistic, siblings don't care or don't even bother helping each other out, its like a dog-eat-dog world in my house, and I just can't handle it anymore, I have bruises and burns and scars all over my body due to abuse, so does my siblings, we barely get any food, and life is just hell. I need to get away from this toxic life and make something of myself AWAY from them. So here's my question.

What legal documents or any paperwork do I need to run away, without ever having to contact my family again for said documents? I am a refugee from Syria, so my birth certificate is in Arabic, and I don't know where I can get another copy from. I'm currently in school and will go back to school for my GED once I turn 18 while I'm with a family friend that decided to take me in and raise me till I am 18. I turn 18 in a year and 3 months. If I ask my counselor at school to give me all my documents or a copy of them that was given to the school for enrolling me, such as a copy of BC in english, my medical records, etc etc, will they give it to me? If my school cannot provide that for me, is there anywhere I can go or do to get a copy of all my important documents after I'm an adult so that I don't have to ever contact my family again?

556,"I'm a female, late 20s and trying to date. 

I've taken lately to having more fun with tinder's help.  

I definitely like the last guy i went out with and had such a genuine connection and his communication skills are so on point.

We matched, talked a bit, I gave him my number and we got way more personal and friendly and we definitely have the same hobbies and interests. One night while both drinking at our homes we got very flirty and figured out we are definitely into the same kinks, which not everyone is into. 

This past week I tried to invite him out but he worked a long day. We just kept texting and he was like you're too good to be true and I was like I doubt it 🤷🏻‍♀️. Eventually he was like so where are you?? So I picked a hole in the wall bar that was quiet to meet at. The bartender was friendly and gave us some free drinks and we just talked. We ended up leaving at 2am when she did last call and talked in the parking lot. I jokingly asked where his dog was because he said he usually took him everywhere. He was like he is at home. Want to meet him?? And was like sure and he kissed me a few times and I followed him home. We got there, I met the pets and we talked a bit and he was like I'd feel more comfortable with you staying here because it's an hour drive home for you and I was just like sure okay. We ended up sleeping together and it was really nice because we both knew what the other wanted and how. 

In the morning I left and he jokingly was like thanks for not being pyscho and I was like thanks for not murdering me. We talked somewhat normally Thursday, friday we both had busy days but I asked if he would ever be up for something with my friends because it was something he mentioned wanting to try and my friends and I do it frequently. He was excited and was like yeah that'll be fun!!! 

I haven't heard much since. I'm hoping he's busy with work. 

But a part of me gets the feeling that he was like well that was fun, bye. (I get that its tinder but he's definitely mentioned he is the type to date and not have hook ups - in fact he mentioned I was his first tinder experience)

It's happened before with guys I've made awesome connections with and it flowed so naturally on dates then out of no where it's like ""you're amazing and all..."" 

Sometimes I sleep with them and sometimes I don't. 

I come from a military background and know i can be intense at times and I try to scale it back. I end up attracting military guys sometimes and they love that I can dish it back and hold my own with them but still be caring and sweet.  

How do I find a happy medium for my personality and such?! I'm so so so tired of this happening to the point I give up dating for months at a time.

558,"Hi...

I'll try to keep things short but there's a lot of background...TL;DR is at the bottom

I (F23) met this guy (M24) almost 3 years ago online. We were just friends for about 1  (almost 2) years, then we started to develop feelings for each other and now we have been in a LDR ever since. Unfortunately, we've both agreed that we will probably not get married as we think very differently when it comes to religion. He doesn't believe in God, whereas I do. Both of our parents would not approve. Without giving too much detail but in our cultures, our relationship is technically taboo. We will probably have to break up soon but it's really hard, so for now, we're just going with the flow. (I will probably ask a question later down the line how to break this off without so much pain!) He lives in NY. He is my first love. 

Here's where my best friend/college roommate (F24) comes in. She moved to NYC about a year ago. We have been friends since the 8th grade and I don't see us not being friends any time soon. I have not told her about this guy for several reasons, 1) The guy and I are ""taboo"" 2) I just don't want ANYONE to know about this relationship. If anyone in my family or family friends found out I could be in huge trouble. 3) My friend is also very skeptical of online romances. 

I am coming to NYC for my birthday. I have a list of people I definitely want to see my Bestie and my BF being the top of the list. I have visited NYC before and saw both of them before. I spent 1/2 of a day and a night with my BF (that was the first time I saw him in person) then the rest of the 3 days I hung out with my bestie. My BF was totally understanding, though he wished he could have spent more time with me. This time around he asked if he could spend more time with me this time. I am arriving a Thursday and leaving a Monday morning. I booked a hotel for 2 nights so we can spend time together. My parents think I'm doing this as a back up because, at the time, my Bestie was thinking about moving. I said I wanted to book something for sure in case, my Bestie ends having roommates, then I would not stay with her. My roommate has decided to not move just yet and now is asking me to try to cancel my hotel and just stay with her. She also keeps trying to book tickets for us to see a concert that Friday night (as a bday present) but I was planning on spending Friday with my BF. How do I redirect plans without mentioning my BF? Do you think I should just give up on that second night with my BF to spend time with my Bestie? 

TL;DR:

My bestie and my LDR BF both live in NYC. I don't want to tell my bestie about this BF for important reasons. BF and I are supposed to spend Thu-Fri together, while my bestie gets Sat-Mon with me. Bestie keeps trying to get me to cancel my Hotel for Thu-Fri and make plans on Fri night. How can I redirect plans without mentioning my BF. Should I cancel Friday night with BF to avoid conflict?

Lately I have been overworked and underpaid , I know aren't we all.
My boss keeps promising that the 14th of November I will get the position I want, but I'm skeptical knowing our company.
The stress has been mounting together with financial rough times it has been an issue.
Me and my wife fight constantly , not physical because I would never harm a woman unless there was no other choice.
I even started wearing a galaxy fit to keep an eye on my heart rate and stress and the results are alarming.
I need to find a way to release some stress.
I had to quit my gaming clan because I couldn't be the leader my fireteam needed me to be anymore.
I don't have the time to go to the range anymore.
So my bow is just collecting dust.
I used to release my stress by either finding a local girl or a desert queen and release it like that.
Or failing to do so I would walk around till someone started trouble with me and release it with a fight.
But about 8 years ago I swore off violence unless it is in self defense.
And seeing as I'm married I can't pick up a girl at a bar.
My wife is amazing but the physical side of our marriage is lacklustre at best.
This also because she is also working her arse of to help keep our head above water.
So after this wall of text how do you lot deal with stress ?

562,"Hi! So... I'm 23 and studying a master degree. I got the bachelor at 21 and went straight to the master. I'm in my last semester, but I'm tired and want to take a break for a year. 

Let's give more context. 8 months ago I got a job in the university where I study. It's I really stressful and demanding job with a bad salary (540 per month), a lot of psychological abuse (we don't like how you work, you are slow, you are not enought compromised, we can fire you anytime, we don't know how to get the good of you, etc.), no f*cking extra hours (I make between 10 and 12 hours per day regulary, 14 the worst ones) no social security (something that every job has in my country), and a ridiculous amount of work. And I have to give thanks bc ""it's the best place to work in this city"" and for my pain, it actually is. 

I was, not an honor student but good enough to have a good reputation and a nice CV (the reason why they called me) and a partial scholarship to pay for the master but, I gave so much time to the job bc of the fear of losing my reputation and the little money I got that I went to extra classes for first time in my life and ended up reproved in a subject. I lost my scholarship and well... It was hit to my ego and to my family situation... I don't have the economic capacity to pay for it... I spent three months w/o salary to save it to pay with my scholarship but losing it make the price go away from my wallet. 

Working with the people who teached me showed me that they don't have a clue of what the profession it's outside their classroom... And I'm at loss. I feel scammed. So I decided to take a year off, and to save money, and then to get back to university, graduate and get as far as I can. 

I live with my parents and when I told them this they got totally angry. I understand, but I'm trying this for them too. We don't have money, but they want to pay anyway. I feel guilty for not being strong enough but I really need some time away, I don't know what to do. I don't have money and I know that that degree is not worth its price. I choosed it bc I was young and I thought it could be and opportunity and they offered me a job as an assistant if I choose to study with them, thing that never happened. 

I need help.",28Sep2019,1
563,"I’m a small YouTube content creator. I am thinking of pursuing a Business Administration degree with a Marketing major because from the past year I’ve become interested in the business behind brands that reach out to me to promote their products. Jokingly some people would comment, “wow thanks my wallet’s going empty soon”. 

To be quite honest, I don’t have any other passions I want to pursue. I was an Education major (I know, a far field) but realized eventually that I couldn’t see myself live a teacher’s lifestyle. I’ve also thought of becoming a communications major but I feel like a business degree would give me more knowledge and broader options when I graduate. 

Anyway, before I ramble on and on, should I just go for the marketing major (because I find it the most interesting) or is it a lot different than what I think it is? Even if I do go for marketing, would I still have broad options in terms of jobs should I decide I don’t want to go directly in the marketing field?

The real reason that I have made no effort whatsoever, is that I have absolutely no interest or want for any kind of intimate relationship. When I was younger I did try but even the thought of it made me nauseous. 

A friend of mine believes that my aversion is because I spent a year being sexually abused by a man I worked part time for when I was 15. Although I remember even before that, I never had the usual teenage interest in boys (or girls for that matter). I do accept that my friends belief could very well be part of the issue though.

I've come to realise that over time my families pestering will just get worse and worse. Telling the whole truth, including my friends belief, will probably make them understand, but I've never told my parent or siblings about the sexual abuse. 

I would dearly like some advice on how to either, tell my family about my adversion without mentioning the sexual abuse, or on how to tell them about the whole reason in a more gentle manner. My social skills have never been great and I really struggle to talk about emotional things in a way that's appropriate. If I just blunder into this I'll cause a great deal of upset with my family.

For the past three years, I have been homeschooled (7th-9th and going on to 10th) The first year was pretty fine, I pretty much had a life, friends, and family. Then my second year of homeschooling came around and just randomly everything turned. All my family was moving so it ended up being just me and my mom, Then my friends quickly forgot about me. Knowing I didn't go to school I could see why they forgot but hey I thought I could deal with it(I thought I was going to be able to go back to school but my mom wouldn't let me) around that second year I had my mom and 1 friend who I hung out with maybe once a month. In a way I kinda liked being alone, I got to read a lot of books, I read a lot of science studies, and just, in general, get smart.

575,"I'm not sure what sort of help this could be but I'm not sure what else do to do, maybe someone will have some good advice.

I've been the primary caregiver for my mother for five years. She's been actively fighting colon cancer and in the last months it has spread everywhere and there is no other treatment available. Her cancer diagnosis came a month or two before I graduated college, I've lived with my parents since and have helped care for her, I'm in my late 20's.

In the last few months I've focused on keeping my mom as comfortable as possible and emotionally haven't had a problem doing that. Obviously I'm upset but I've held things together very well. It's been really hard trying to get her the right pain medications and all of the most recent visits with her oncologist have ended with slight alterations to her drugs that haven't helped so I've been progressively more frustrated.

I'm also dealing with my dad, who is loving and caring but emotionally relies on me a lot. He's very anxious and worried and he constantly talks to me about his worries and the appointments and what we're going to do. He isn't very helpful when it comes to her appointments and medicines, he worries too much and doesn't listen to the doctors. I've told him that it's useless to worry so much and, while I tried to be supportive, it's not helpful for him to spread his worry like the plague to me and my mother. He's a lot to handle and, while I love him and he's wonderful, I know a lot of frustration has been building up within me in regards to him and it's making me have a very low tolerance for dealing with him in day to day life.

At the last appointment with the oncologist went very poorly. The Doctor was in a bad mood immediately, voiced his displeasure about how much late in the day appointment suck and he also immediately asked about the appointment we had with another doctor (to get a second opinion). Then, I feel like the entire meeting was derailed because my mom told him she wanted to go on a week long trip out of town (not out of the state). This is a big risk and he can't help her out while she's out of town. The oncologist pretty much left the room after that, refusing to treat her until she was back and dismissing all of my questions.

Well I hoped my mom would change her mind about her trip because of the doctors advice but she's refused.

Since that meeting (yesterday evening) I've not been able to stop crying. I pulled it together for a short time this morning, I went to make coffee and my dad immediately cornered me to discuss the meeting again. I lost it, it immediately made me upset again and I cried saying that there was no point to discuss it again, I'm obviously upset about it, why bring it up? I retreated to my room telling him I needed to be alone.

I guess I'm just so frustrated and it's all coming out now but I'm just not sure what to do to emotionally cope with it. I don't normally cry so much (or at all) so I'm just not sure why I can't stop.

576,"I've posted a few months ago about going back to school at 51 for a 4-years bachelor's degree to become a teacher. Btw, I'm single without kids, no debt nor car payments or mortgage (I'm renting my apartment). I have the freedom of doing pretty much anything I want.

I don't really like my current job but pay and conditions are pretty good. It's ok I guess.

I'm really torn between the options of staying at my job and enjoying the security it's providing. Or following my heart and choosing to go back to school, even if it means putting myself in a difficult financial position. I also know that, even though very rewarding, getting through school will be really hard (while keeping my job part time 20-25 hours a week). I will also need student loans I'll need to pay back at 55 years old while looking for a teaching job.

My guts tells me to not worry about the future and follow my heart, but my head is reminding me—or even warning me—that it would be a bad decision to put myself in this precarious financial position.

I don't have a lot of money in the bank and unfortunately never had. Even staying at my job until retirement at 65 won't leave me enough to live on. I've never really thought about retiring, though, and plan to work until my health won't allow it.

Since the semester just started, I am making a lot of comments on the assignments aimed at helping the students preparing them for the industry. But for a deduction, I deduct at most 1 point out of 20 if there are solutions missing or other mistakes (which is negligible compared to what happens in other courses).

One student has been complaining and arguing with me over email for the 1 point deduction after the first assignment grading. It was their first time, so the instructor took all the blame on himself and told me to give the point back. But after the third assignment, again the same student complained to the instructor against me. And the instructor is again taking all the blame and told me to give the points back.

I make comments for every student and most of them take it very positively. And I feel that haggling by one student is unjustified. And the situation now is that everyone is getting 100% in everything till now (all because of the haggling).

I find it unfair for the students who are actually putting a lot more effort. Also, I do not know if deducting points is harmful because of the revenue generated by the students of this program.

Anyone with a similar experience, how do you deal with it? Thanks",28Sep2019,2

I feel lost in life and I really need help. I don’t have motivation or willpower to do anything I want to do and I feel like I’m falling behind in life.

Truth is that I wanted to commit suicide after I finished high school in 2015 because I didn’t see myself working, having a career or doing anything considered useful. A couple friends stopped me and after that I just stayed, with no plans or will or anything. 

I got jobs through the years to compensate, and I don’t really mind working, but I really wish to do my own stuff like selling my art and designs and that kind of stuff

And when it comes to studying I just can’t do it, I went to 4 different colleges in 4 different years and it was a disaster, the first two I hated the careers I was doing and in the last two I was doing art, which I love, but I can’t afford the supplies or the texts even with a job because they always ask for top notch materials.

So now I’m jobless and I don’t go to college so my daily routine is just:

* Wake up
* Play games on the PC until I get bored (which is like less than 3 hours because I’m not even interested in that anymore)
* Clean the house
* Cook Dinner
* Sleep

And before anyone recommends me therapy I have to say that I can’t afford it at all until I get a new job. And I had bad experiences with therapist, from abandoning me because they got a new job to forcing me to go and be in debt to them because “it was the right thing to do” (this one just needed the money and she was stressing me out even more)

In all honestly I know I have the capability of studying both art and game design if I get to it, but I have no motivation or willpower for it and I don’t know where or how to start and it drives me crazy It’s like I’m trapped running in a circle panicking about everything I could do and everything I haven’t done because I know I have the potential but I never went the full distance, the extra mile and now I’m stuck in this hellhole that has become just waking up, being a maid and go to sleep

I just need some steps, a suggestion, a list, anything with what I can work with. Please

591,"**TL;DR -** My parents have always been too busy with my brothers to stay involved with me. I have a son on the way and it's becoming a real problem for me. My drug addict brother just showed up back home with his knocked up crackhead girlfriend, and this means they'll have even less time for me, and especially my son. I'm at a breaking point, I'm scared my son will never really know his grandparents, and I'm depressed. How do I cope? Any way to salvage my relationship with my family?

&amp;#x200B;

I come from a pretty wealthy family. My Dad is a privately practicing doctor and my Mom works with him. They had 3 sons (I'm the youngest), and overall gave us pampered and easy childhoods. My brothers are in their 30's now and I'm late 20's.

Our childhoods were great, except my brothers hated school and dropped out in early highschool. They also got into smoking and drugs pretty early on (maybe 14-15). My middle brother has managed to be fairly responsible. He's only really smoked pot and drank a lot of alcohol, but he hasn't been a menace to society or my family really. However, he's never been financially independent, had 3 kids, is now single, and is severely draining all of my parents' bank accounts. Not only have they been very involved in his life because he seemingly needs so much help, but now that he has kids, they're basically raising them.

My oldest brother is a train wreck. He's never had above a minimum wage job, has probably worked 6 months total in his life, and has therefore always been a drain on my parents finances. He went way deep into drugs, eventually becoming a pill addict. He was a zombie for probably 4-5 years while on drugs to keep him off of pills, but eventually came off and got even deeper into drugs - heroin, to be specific. He's been in rehabs all around the USA for the past 3-4 years now, never finishes them, goes to a different rehab, etc. In between, he also shows up at their home, gets deep into heroin again, then they kick him out. It's a cycle that I'm afraid, and certain, will end in his death.

As a result, I've spent my life trying to be independent and responsible so my parents don't have to worry about me. Stayed in school, went to college, financially independent from my first paycheck out of college, etc. I never try to complain and ask them for help because they seem so incredibly busy with my brothers. All that said, I call my parents maybe once a week, but they call maybe once a month. It's always my Dad. My Mom hasn't called me to talk and see how I'm doing in years.

This has come to a head. I'm expecting my first son and I couldn't be more happy and excited - really, it's a magical time. During this time, my Dad has called to check in a few times, which has been so nice. However, my Mom hasn't called to chat once. They were both involved with each of my brother's ex-wife's pregnancies each and every day, and they now see their grandkids almost every single day. I want my son to have the relationship with his grandparents that I always wanted and my nephews have, but the longer this pregnancy goes on, the more I see the writing on the wall.

My oldest brother is now randomly home with his knocked up crackhead girlfriend. They're seeing my brother and his gf every day, and will almost certainly be 100% involved with their child. Knowing this just sends my mind into a really dark place.

Ultimately, I absolutely loathe seeing my irresponsible, derelict brothers getting precious time with my parents that I deserve. They're both over 60 and developing health issues, and I don't imagine they'll live through their 70's (Dad has a family history of heart disease, and Mom is a life-long heavy smoker). My brothers are siphoning their finances away such that they'll never be able to retire, and they're siphoning their last years away, causing them so much anxiety. It's sickening to watch.

I don't know what to do. Does anybody have advice?

I've come to terms with my parents being more involved with my brothers than me, but I can't grapple with the thought of them now choosing my brothers' kids over mine.",28Sep2019,2

I said about it to my dad and he said “it’s keeping you in touch with your friends if you’re that bothered I’ll give it back to you”. At uni my parents set up an account for me to use for food and expenses and they’d just pay it off every month. I moved out coming up to two ago, and I’m struggling so much. Not with a shortage of money but my spending habits, like I get food delivered and smoothies pretty much every day, and it’s not uncommon for me to just go into a store and buy a new handbag or wallet just because I want it. I’ve tried budgeting and even that wallet and cash thing but I still can’t get to grips with my habits. I think it’s a mix between my upbringing and lonelyness.

599,"A few months ago I found out my other half cheated on me, she came clean and said she was not happy and broke it off with me. I'm not suffering anymore and I managed to get over it quite quickly with a good attitude and self care. 

She cheated on me several times, not sex but kissing others while drunk on several occasions. My mistake for not breaking it off sooner, I convinced myself she was better than what she was.

I was out of a job for a few months and I borrowed 400 euro from her, she is now asking for it back. I am conflicted, I was living with her so after the break up I lost my home , my cat and my closest friend. 

Part of me wants to be honorable and pay her the 400 back which is not an issue as I now have a steady full time job with a decent salary.
The other part wants to say f*** that and just cut all contact without paying back.
We were in a relationship for 6.5 years.

601,"Hello! I’m a young lady, who was in a relationship lately. 

And, I am seeking advice to understand the point of view of a man on life.
First of all, i’m 21, and I have been sexually assaulted when I was 17. My ex bf did that to me, lots of emotional abuse, lots of trauma ensued.
I was hit by depression, suicidal tendencies, trust issues, sexual problems, anxiety, PTSD, physical and mental health issues all over. 

I understood, that until I rebuilt myself, I wasn’t able to be in a relationship again. As I know, I get attached too easily. I create emotional connections really quickly, but have a hard time trusting people when it comes to me. 

Most people say it’s easy talking to me, that they can say anything, because I don’t judge, listen to people, seek for advice, make them see other options, etc.

So, since February this year, I started accepting that it was time for me to be a woman again, and let my heart all out.
So, I started looking at what interests me sexually, romantically, and how I could get out of my hell. 

Slowly, but surely, I was almost out of it.
So, I met this guy in June this summer. 
He was a sweet guy :) 
He told me countless times he loved me, he told me that he wanted me to meet his parents, that I made him happy, calm, that he was scared to screw it up... 
And, it triggered in me, the reflex that « I don’t deserve it ». 
I didn’t deserve such a sweet-loving caring man.
All those emotions and expectations he had from me, I was so afraid I wasn’t able to fulfill them, and I told him and tried to show him I loved him too... and I knew he didn’t expect me to be super duper everything, he knew I had a condition that was possibly going to drag me down.

But... as much as I tried, I had a panic attack. And he wanted to help me, and I think...
I think I broke him.
He still wanted to help me, but I broke him.
He went away.
He told me « I fucked up ». He was man enough to sit down and tell it to me to my face.
He told me, he was unhappy in relationships, and then, he went away.

And then, I tried to remain calm, I tried to be okay, but the truth is... I knew it was my fault.
He didn’t had to, at this point of our relationship, to take care of me. It was too early and it was uncomfortable for him.

But, his friends told me he was unhappy since I went away, but everytime I tried to talk, he was angry, or had a « I don’t care » attitude.

...i’m so sorry for men, that they can’t show their emotions.

But today, I told him, that... even though he said yes to some things, when he meant no, that after he felt frustration and anger, that I am sorry... I am sorry because all I had felt during the relationship, all the love he gave me, I cherished it. And I am not trying to manipulate him, I truly thought those words.

« I am sorry... because I cared for you, you gave me love, and I couldn’t make you happy. »

And now, he just told me to move on, and like... yeah.
I mean... 
Please, I know being clingy doesn’t help, but... I am going to leave him time on his side, to help him heal. I just want to know: Men, how do you see the situation?",28Sep2019,1
602,"So I’m extremely private when it comes to my autism diagnosis mostly out of shame, but also partly due to how people end up treating me if I tell them. Its gone to roughly three different extremes and they all kinda suck. They are either understanding, but start treating me like a child or someone helpless, they’re fine with it but I don’t really get enough support from telling them or I’m just outright bullied for it which happened more when I was a teenager, but I’m always scared of it happening again.

So a woman started going to my college and we were talking. She openly mentioned that she is also on the spectrum. I figured I’d mention it as it would be a good topic for conversation. I’m midway through telling her when she says something along the lines of  “No offence, but I can already tell”. Turns out she can tell from my body language and lack of eye contact. We talked for a bit about and I remember talking about something. Apparently I try to explain my actions a lot and apologise for them without realising. We finished talking, exchanges contact info and went home.

She was cool with it, but I’m always terrified when someone else knows. She knew a lot and I know it could be a factor of her own diagnosis, but now I’m wondering if I really am too obvious and other people are finding out but aren’t saying anything. If that’s the case I’m probably not masking well enough and need to figure out how to do it better.

She says it herself yet she's so attached to him she can't just let go. I told her about my feelings a couple months ago but she didn't say much of it. But lately she's been talking and she's said stuff like how she didn't know she could have such strong feelings for more then one person. Apparently she really does like me a lot. She says she doesn't know what changed she just realized how much better of a guy I am then her boyfriend. She says she feels terrible for all the heartbreak she's put me through by staying with him and all that. As well of that she really wants to be with me but at the same time knows she can't get over him.

I have a lot going on, and in the past years, I felt probably depressed. I am a sensitive person and often feel overwhelmed with everything. I find life meaningless. I started with self-improvement last summer and I noticed that I can't find a goal. I am not suicidal, or anything, but I wouldn't mind if my life ended tomorrow as I am in this goal-less, meaningless, lonely and unhappy situation all the time. 

So, what should I do? Does anyone have any advice for me or have been in the same situation as I was?

617,"I decided to post this, because I keep lying to myself: ""My dad's nog an alcoholic, he hasn't been drinking for months.""

I feel like I've tried everything. Trying to experience things with him, offer him to do stuff, and told him he needs help. I know he can control it, because he completed rehab several times, and been sober for months before. I'm starting to feel as if it's my fault, and for age reasons, I can't live on my own because of the law.

My biggest fears is that the stress, will bother me so much that school just won't be a thing for me, and I'll fail my exams and end up like him. Especially because I have the same patterns. I get high for the same reason as him, to get away from this world, for just a few hours. I also smoke cigarettes, which is harder when he's at this state. 

Also, I feel like I could be a cause for all of this. He'd been legitametely sober for years before I moved back from foster families and institutes. He started to turn into my mom lately; Not thinking about me or listening to me. Forcing me to do things I'm not capable of, or never trusting me. It's already affected my school life. I just start forgetting about the world, and doing things others find annoying or disturbing. Always ending up with me and the others getting pissed. 

I don't know what to do. Authorities don't give a shit about me, only how many fucking cigarettes I smoke every day. They won't send him to rehab again, putting the blame on me, and trying to fix me, instead of him. It's becoming such a problem, that I'm starting to feel suicidal yet again. Something I also hadn't been for months, until I saw him drink again, and the first time my little sister ever saw him like this. 

I'm starting to lose sense in reality. I can't feel emotions anymore, I can watch people getting their heads chopped off with no emotions bursting in. It's like I only feel human, when I get the dopamine kick from a cigarette, or from being high on different substances. I really wish I died when I got drugged a year ago. No one should ever go through the same shit I have. All of this is like a fraction of my entire life.",28Sep2019,1

Sorry for the long read, but I feel as though people need the full story in order to understand and possibly help. Also sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit. And this is absolutely nonsense

Last year,during my sophomore year (I believe it was the 21 of September) I went to my first school dance, Homecoming. I had no interest in going but the week of my only friend at the time bought me a ticket.

I was severely under-dressed due to me never going to dances, and a wall flower as all hell. Then he showed up.

He seems to be a mutual to my only friend as she introduced me to him, and left us outside of the gym to go deal with some drama her other friends were having. We talked for the entire hour I was there. He was the definition of a small town boy. I was slightly attracted but halted any emotions as to not scare him off like the few boys before him.

I though he just wanted a new friend, which I was more than happy to be because I genuinely started to care for him. We exchanged accounts on messenger and by leave for home, my retarded brain completely forgetting to message him a simple ""hi"".

My friend then confronts me yet again (over a phone call) stating that he has feelings for me. I however denied any of it being true as no human has ever had feelings for me so I must be impossible or a joke or something more logical. My friend now growing in anger says I must make a decision at that very minute. I must message him with either a yes or a no. Being the stupid slow person that I am I become overwhelm and try to hide my tears as I ask her to tell him no for me. She begrudgingly agrees and we off the call. I then go onto whatever dumb shit I was doing at the time. And everything continues as normal. He never faced me and I forgot anything ever happened. 

And suddenly it starts happening again I see him every morning as we pass though the halls to our classes on opposite sides of the school. I see him at gym and at the gym lockers (they were outside of the changing rooms), I slowly start to connect his name with anything I saw that even slightly reminded me of him, but I kept forgetting and forgetting to just simply press a few buttons and message him a 'hello'.

This feeling grows all the way up until the few weeks before Christmas break. I finally make a move on the third to last day of finales, and to my luck he reciprocated. And I finally remember to message him back. Everything was great, then I fucked up yet again. The fewer days of Christmas break the lower my confidence of a working relationship between us became.

I was planning on going back to homeschool for a metal break, and I though he would forget me once school begun again and i wasn't there. So i decided to cut things off so he can be happier. I fucked up a third time as I couldn't stop thinking about him, sometime I truly did forget but seconds later he would pop up. And I decided to message him again on spring break, and to my surprise we were still okay. Then my mother fucks everything.

She informs me that we will be moving for the 11th time in my life, I go into a panic as were in the middle of having a video call on the phone. I was scared and out of my mind, I hardly remember what was even coming out of my mouth, but I remember him growing tired and agitated, then my phone shutting off from low battery. I attached my charger and turn on my phone to message him an apology saying I should of never said anything, he responds with an it's cool and that he has other things to do. I then wait till the next day to message him again just to be safe. I notice it starts snowing and record and send a video of it to him, asking if it was snowing over by his house. According to what messenger says he doesn't see the video till 8 pm. 

And we haven't talked since. I don't know what I'm doing anymore I've stopped caring for myself months ago I don't know what I'm even asking for now not advice since I highly doubt I can do anything to fix this ive been doing what I do best since I was born and have been living in my head with my own fantasies as thing only get worse outside

Anyway let's get straight to my first post, it would've been help on mental health but let's deal with the missus first shall we!

So I'm after some advice on how to get into the fashion industry for my girlfriend, she graduated roughly just over a year ago here in London with a 2:1 I believe. Subject.... *special suspense effect*.... Fashion design bags and accessories (albeit she wanted clothing but didn't get to that sadly). She is super talented bless her but she's struggling to find a job within the industry and I've told her If there's an opportunity in Europe then grasp it!

So what she's been doing so far is applying for many jobs she's had her CV checked over by lots of friends and she's applied to pretty much any job she finds (she has some experience in the design and making process work wise but majority of it was designing and making her own pieces for her course). She's been throwing in cover letters too and yes the markets hard and patience is the key but I'm getting restless on behalf of her. 

Any help or guidance will be super super appreciated, she kind of doesn't want to do an unpaid internship (I've tried talking her into it but it's difficult for her especially after she's graduated and she doesn't like too much of an idea of unpaid coz she can't support herself then).

624,"I don't have access to a counselor our therapist unless it's during school. 

I guess I'll start with the thing that's been eating at me 

So whenever my s/o's father died in 2017, she fell into a depression and at the time, I felt very overwhelmed because I didn't know how to help her with it, so we both kind of distanced ourselves. And during that time she picked up drinking and smoking to deal with it, and she also had a sexual thing with this guy who went to our school, and whenever she told me this I wasn't bothered at first, but down the line as I got more attached and more grown, it bothered me. I would have a good day, and once it enters my head that it happened, it just eats away at my mood. 
I know under the circumstances I shouldn't be upset or jealous at all. But it gets to me. 
I told her about this a few days ago and she told me that she understood why I felt like that, because what me and her do is probably the most intimate thing we can do, and the fact that she did that with him kind of gets to me and I don't know why!

I know it's wrong to think and feel like this, but it does eat at me and I really really want to properly deal with it but I don't know how. 

I'm insecure, I'll admit and I don't want to be. I'll have these moments where I'm like hell yeah, I'm kind of cool and I'll have a high opinion on myself. But other times my anxiety gets terrible and I feel miserable for awhile.

627,"I honestly do not like asking for help but I’m at a loss. I’m 21 with my dream job. I was very poor growing up and fortunately by middle school that flipped. I grew up loving IT and all things tech. It became my passion and I knew I wanted to do that and I do.  Im the IT manger of a multi-million dollar co. I’m very blessed. I fell in love last year with a very special girl as I was going through a health scare. I was admitted to the hospital for a week with no clue as to what was wrong with me and God willing, I got better. Shortly after having been dating for 6 months I proposed to my GF. She said yes and we got married on Christmas. I also purchased a 3 bedroom house. Again very blessed. 

I grew up with a verbal, abuse mom who cursed every other word and would sit me down in chair and scream and say things I don’t even want to type. Now that I’m married I’m finding my wife is struggling with anger issues. We argue and fight verbally all the time but here lately she will physically hold me down and when I defend myself she says she gets “beat” by me even though I just restrain her and try and calm her down. I’m terrified when she gets mad. She’s constantly says she will kill herself if I ever left and says she wants to die all the time. I don’t know what to do. I’m terrified to even type this. I’m worried she will flip one day and say I beat her to someone. She went to work one day after crying and yelling at me and her boss asked if I hit her or anything and I’m afraid being a guy it would be more believable. 

She screams and starts crying over every little thing. I love on her and hug her just to get yelled at. I know she’s struggled with stuff in the past and I truly just want the best for here but mentally I’m getting hit hard. I’ve never been over stressed until all of my health issues started and I got promoted at work and married and house and all at once.

628,"Hello reddit.

I don't know who else should I ask for help, so I am here.

My girlfriend has low blood pressure (and I have low blood pressure too), we both have those usuall things, like sometimes, when you stand up quickly, you can not see at all and etc. 

But today, she told me quite weird thing. She went to parents, she got into bed, we were chatting and watching series, but she just wrote: I am feeling like out of my body. Then she wasn't replying for few minutes and then she wrote, she is fine now. She also told me, that it was much worse before... Because she saw old man head, with brown long hair and brown beard floating around her, coming closer and closer to her. When he came too close, he went back again and it started all again. Then, she were just falling down and then she doesn't know at all. 

I am 100% sure, she doesn't taky any drugs or anything like that. But I am worried that this might not be caused by low blood pressure.

Also, just to mention, she has celebral palsy.

Has any of you experience with this?

629,"TL;DR: After weeks of being excited of moving in together, my brother snapped today and told me no one asked him whether he even wanted to move in with me. I am really hurt by that since I love my brother and can’t understand his sudden change of heart. Also I have no plan B for another apartment. 

Here’s the current situation: my brother and his former roommate live in the apartment above my grandparents place.

Meanwhile my cousin and I live in an apartment that belongs to my uncle.

At the beginning of this month my roommate told me out of the blue that she wants to move out together with her boyfriend. I really didn’t see this coming since her boyfriend was originally set to move in with us since our apartment is pretty big. Without thinking what her moving away would mean for me (a poor student who can’t afford a regular apartment) she is still oblivious to why I (and basically the rest of my family) is mad at her. Finding a new roommate for my apartment was basically not an option because if my uncle rents the place to someone who is not family, rent will go up and I would have to pay more too which I can’t afford.

Coincidentally the roommate of my brother moved out. It seemed like a bit of luck in this unlucky situation with my cousin. 

We have always suspected that their apartment was rather...dirty. But we didn’t think it would be that bad. The whole place stank of mold and dust. No one had cleaned the bathtub, oven or windows for over two years. There is a thick layer of dust everywhere. Having a tidy, clean apartment is REALLY important to me, so as I asked my brother whether I could move in with him, I also told him “well...you know I like my place a bit more...clean, so we would need some changes around here.” And he agreed saying “yeah I can see what you mean. I also don’t like the dirt too much.” 

We started renovating the place, I cleaned the kitchen for 10 hours and helped my brother throw out a lot of old stuff. My brother suffered through depression last year so I thought cleaning and decluttering his place would make him happy too!

Now today we went and bought new furniture and new decorations. I was totally excited, basically distracting myself from the fact that my cousin left me hanging. I am devastated that I can’t keep my current apartment and told myself I am going to make the best out of the situation by helping me and my brother to live in a modern, clean apartment. 

However, as he wanted to buy a cocktail shaker for our apartment I said something like “well, do we really need it?” Since we are on a tight budget. He bought it anyways and I didn’t say anything to that. But as we got home, all hell broke loose. My mum was there too and was like “hm...there are still such thick spider webs up here.” And he just exploded.

He said something like this: “I am so tired of everyone telling me how to live my life. In your eyes (directed at my mother) I can never do anything right. Your daughter (so me) is your perfect angel who tries everything to clean this “mess” that you blame only on me. I am so tired of being made out as the evil one and she as the innocent saint. When I wanted to change something about this place, everyone just rolled their eyes, when she wants to change anything, everyone moves and applauds her! No one even asked me whether I want her here in the first place. Now I am even getting shit for buying a cocktail shaker. I have no say in what is happening to MY apartment anymore.”

I couldn’t quite believe what he said. I actually started crying right on the spot, since him and I usually are like best friends. My mum then said: “Well you should have said that earlier since your sister now has no time to look for a different place anymore.” And he said: “I know, yes, she should move in here. I am just tired of everyone criticizing my way of life.”

I kind of knew conflict would be on its way, since I am VERY tidy and NEED to have everything cleaned. But why would he say he is excited for moving in with me and then basically tell me he never wanted to in the first place? I didn’t want this either. I LOVE my current apartment and am still crying over loosing it sometimes. But now I am even more confused, hurt and lost. I really don’t know what to do.",28Sep2019,1

For the past decade I've spent my life in a very stressful career field surrounded by personality types that are often in conflict with my own. I've done well at it but right now my body seems to be done with it, and it's gotten me thinking about what I want out of life.

I used to think that I wanted all these grandiose things, but after a few days of thinking about it I think what I really want is to just raise a family. My dad was never around when I was little for multiple reasons but I remember even when he was I was always wanting more of a father than I received. Living as an adult now I can tell you I see more and more of men continuing to push aside their fatherly roles for really mundane reasons and then attempt to justify them through thin arguments of who they are or how they are. Not all men are like this but it is something I myself have noticed more and more.

Being a dad is something I've always wanted to do and I think now days there is the opportunity and acceptability of society to respect a stay at home father (whether in a relationship or not). My life has been, for the most part, good but I am worried if I wait too much longer for the right time to start a family my health will have deteriorated to the point where it just doesn't make sense anymore.

640,"Hi, this is my first time using Reddit, and I'm on mobile. I (17f) work at a teen clothing store in a mall. Most of my other coworkers are my age. (this is relevant later on). I also have a girlfriend (17). This is long, so buckle up.

Last night, I went out with some friends. My best friend, (16f, we'll call her T), her boyfriend (17m, we'll call him A), and a guy I hardly knew (18m, we'll call him D). We drove around and ended up in an alley way far from home. They got alcohol, and pressured me to drink. It was dark, so I could pretend to sip. I was not intoxicated, but they all thought I was.

Later on, my friend and her boyfriend pressured me to sit on D's lap. I complied, as I was far from home and at this point, two other much older (24) men were there). I explained later to D that I felt pressured to do that, and that I had a boyfriend. Boys always get creepy when they find out you're a lesbian. I lied about my s/o's gender, but made it VERY clear I was not available.

A pulled me aside and asked if I was into D. I said no, I have a boyfriend. A and T both said ""nobody would find out"". Bear in mind, they all think I'm intoxicated.

We drive back to our area, and we walked out on a field. They made me put alcohol in my bag, so I couldn't get my bag from the car. It was very dark, and by the time we made it halfway into the field, A and T were gone without a trace. D &amp; I were alone, in the dark. He proceeded to kiss my neck, and I pushed him away. He kissed harder &amp; I pushed away and said no, but he held me there. He kissed my lips, and I finally got up and away, and went looking for A &amp; T. 

When I got home, I immediately told my girlfriend what had happened. She is not mad, and reassured me that it was not my fault.

 The next morning (today), I had work. I felt so gross, I couldn't go without crying for 5 minutes at a time. I called in an hour before my shift, with no answer. Texted my manager, apologized for the short notice, and said it was an emergency. I'm asking for multiple pieces of advice here, I apologize if that isn't allowed.

tl/dr; I got assaulted by a boy who thought I was interested in him. I'm not sure if I cheated or not. I called out of work the next day with short notice because I felt physically ill &amp; traumatized.

1) Should I briefly tell my manager why I actually called out? I still have gotten no response, and my shift is now over. I'm afraid I'll lose my job.
2)  Did I cheat? I know I may have led him on, but it wasn't intentional, and I made it clear I was not interested, but I'm still unsure.
3) Should I report this incident? My only fear is that it won't be taken seriously, as it's not r-pe.

647,"This is the biggest problem in my life right now. Can't seem to figure out with smartwatch and smartphone combo would be great.

so im debating between the note 10/ S10+ and the iphone 11 pro
all of the phones have pros and cons, the thing is that android doesn't have as good as a smartwatch as the Apple Watch.
The androids listed beat the 11 in mostly just the screen. the notch is a fairly annoying. the reviews seem to say that the 11 pro has a better battery
but i can't justify spending that much on an iPhone for just 64 GB. the features that the other phones have with more storage and less price is great, but then again no apple watch. I could go for an XR or 11, but i really don't like the phones and compared to the phones that i can get with android at the same price point its not a great deal
I've been considering to just wait for the pixel 4. but the rumours seem to have a phone whose screen isn't that great, but more storage and cheaper than an iPhone

649,"So, my best friend and I always go all out for birthday presents. They’re always summing up inside jokes...for example, she gave me a shirt one year where she printed a bunch of inside jokes with pictures on it and one year she gave me a custom record with all our favorite songs. We’ve made funny videos for each other. Two years ago, I gave her a poster that had 101 inside jokes and pictures of it and last year, I made an app where you could press a button and a picture would be generated with an inside joke. So, yeah the standard’s kinda high...I need some sort of idea that I can employ a collection of inside jokes. I could also just give her a box full of physical items representing inside jokes (think Jim to Pam), but I’m not that excited by the idea. I’m more of a digital person since I’m not too artistic, but I wouldn’t be opposed to anything physical. So basically some gift where we can look back on inside jokes and just compile a large amount of them. The most obvious one is like a scrapbook or something, but I feel like that’s nothing compared to my past gifts.",28Sep2019,1
650,"This ones a long story so buckle up. If not, just read the tl;dr at the bottom.
So I’ve realised I haven’t been straight for a while now. It doesn’t take a genius to see that when you haven’t had any real attraction to the opposite gender for your entire life, you begin to think you’re gay (which I am, don’t get me wrong).
It took me a while to fully come to this conclusion , and when I did I decided to come out to my school in hopes of helping out the younger years to know there is someone they can talk to about it.
And from there on, it was smooth sailing. Only one boy hated me for it and that’s because I broke up with him because of that reason and he believes I cheated on him with one of my old friends (which wasn’t true as she didn’t like girls like that). I had friends who accepted me and acquaintances who cheered me on in the background.  It was all good. I had fully come out as lesbian and I was content.
This all began to change 2 weeks ago when this boy (who has always been in my school) began hanging out with me and my friends a lot more and eventually joined my group. And I think I like him. 
I’ve never felt anything like this to any boy before, all my past relationships with that gender felt forced and wrong but with him, I wouldn’t mind dating them for the foreseeable future. He’s really funny and nice and cool but I doubt he’d like me back, as cheesy as it sounds he’s way out of my league.
Honestly, I don’t know what to do. I’m obviously not gonna do much to revel my crush anytime soon due: A me being an antisocial idiot, B bit to early for any of that and C I’m an antisocial idiot. But if I were to do something, what would I do? Most people would be understanding and be totally cool with it but some (my ex especially) would start arguments with me, which I don’t want to deal with again. I don’t think I’ll feel this way for the other gender again, just him (based in past experiences). He’s a exception.



TL;DR I’ve come out as lesbian but have gotten a crush on this boy. Chances are, he is the only boy I’m going to actually like.

Am I gay with an exception or bisexual with a heavy preference? What do you think I should do?",28Sep2019,1

Is it common to bring spouses/fiancés to these kinds of things?

661,"So I recently moved to a city on the other side of the country to attend university, and left a tiny village in the countryside where I lived for 19 years. I had several good friends there who I would hang out with a lot, but one was always a bit too active in my life. He wanted to be a part of everything I was doing, would text every evening and would get angry if I didn't respond for any reason. Now dont get me wrong, he is a really nice guy, very easy to get a long with, funny, same interests etc.

The issue is he still wants to be stay friends while I am here. I have no issue staying in contact and messaging him when I get a chance just to catch up, but he regularly asks to visit me up here, and it is raising a lot of concerns:

1: My university course is very intense, I have several readings, projects etc and can't afford to spend more than 2 full days without work.
2: I know if I let him come up, he will think he can keep coming and will be up practically every other day. It almost feels like he is just looking for an excuse to have fun in the city and just sees me as an easy source of free accommodation.
3: He can get incredibly annoying and I don't want to be dealing with all that sh*t.
4: I am living with someone else who doesn't necessarily like him and I know they will be very very unhappy if he suddenly turns up.

I really don't know what to do about all this. I am a nice guy in general and don't like to hurt people so I haven't told him all this. Would it be best to tell him the truth? Or is it worth just cutting contact altogether? Can we still stay friends? I'm in a huge dilemma",28Sep2019,1
662,"I don't know where to ask so if this is the wrong place, sorry! I also know I should bring this up to a professional, but it's the weekend and I want opinions before I turn to my parents and then a professional. 

I am in my early 20s and a junior in college in a tough major. Growing up I was always a more nervous kid and I still now have a habit of chewing my nails when I'm nervous (but it's better than when I was a kid). I am a huge perfectionist. 

I've been having a tougher time focusing in schoolwork, so my grades lately haven't been great. My GPA went down last semester. I can't seem to get myself to sit and study a sheet of notes. Recently I've figured out I might go to law school, but that means my GPA does matter now. The uncertainty of the future (not knowing quite if I will get to law school) has been making me very anxious. This past week, I had 3 exams. I was extremely stressed and anxious. But this year it has been difficult to do so because of lack of concentration. I also find that my brain/mind is cloudy. In high school, I studied better than I have been this year. It's not that I don't want to study, but that I can't concentrate. I want to do well in school because it's something I truly care about, but I find that it's just hard for me to do so. 

I've also been horrible this year at managing finances. My parents pay for school, rent, &amp; food but otherwise I pay for entertainment or clothes (using my savings. I had a lot of money saved from internships). I spend money without checking my bank account because I'm fearful to look. (I also am scared of checking my grades). I'm getting in horrible habits and I'm trying to fix it.

I've been dealing with digestive problems for the last year and a half or so. They were especially bad this week. 

I know that most people my age are getting around 5-6 hours of sleep every night. I manage to get 7 or 7.5 and yet find myself extremely tired everyday. Yet I have trouble falling asleep at night, except for nights when I'm exhausted. Or I will wake up multiple times throughout the night.

Emotionally, I'm very stable but I feel unsettled because of stress. But I also find myself more irritated at times.

I don't think it's depression. I never have bad or negative thoughts, I still love the activities I do, etc. I hang out with my friends constantly and love being with people or doing things. It's more like there is a constant unsettledness &amp; physically symptoms that get worse at certain times.

I don't know if I have anxiety, but it crossed my mind earlier this week because I was experiencing anxiety-like symptoms.

A little bit of history. My family has been through some really tough times over the last decade and all of us (family of 4) have scars of our own.

My elder sister has severe anxiety, dad has depression (work related), and as for me, I'm a borderline sociopath. Now, my mom most definitely has some sort of mental condition but she takes mental health as a hideous joke, even after seeing everything in the house. She'd rather die than visit a psychologist/psychiatrist. So, I need a little help in diagnosing her condition.

Also, she is becoming a manipulative bitch and tries to pit my elder sister and me against each other (I just turned 18 and she's 25). Luckily, over the last decade, we grew really close and almost nothing is off limits for us to discuss.

Anyways, her main symptoms are:

* Cognition problems when under moderate to severe stress.

* Being a manipulative bitch without any remorse.

* Seeking people's soft corner and then coaxing them to reveal information they otherwise wouldn't and then using it against them when she feels like it.

676,"Hi Reddit,

I've been dealing persistently with a problem that goes beyond public speaking anxiety since before I started college. Namely, I have a LOT of trouble expressing myself verbally. It's not an issue of having ideas - I'm a decent writer. But I cannot improvise or come up with things to say fast enough in verbal conversation or when presenting an idea to a group. I feel that I cannot respond in a measured way quickly enough most of the time, and I would rather stay silent than say something ignorant just for the sake of speaking. It doesn't help that there are embarrassing gaps in my knowledge of things that it feels like most people grew up knowing (for example, my public school history education was laughable and virtually none of it has stuck with me).  

When it comes to public speaking anxiety, the advice I have seen proposed most often is some combination of exposure therapy and ""fake it 'til you make it"": learn how to pretend you're confident, learn the body language, and just keep forcing yourself to do it until you become comfortable. However, I have been forcing myself to do it for many, many years, and neither my ability nor my comfort have seen improvement. In fact, I work as a teacher now and I speak to kids on a daily basis with the expectation that I assume some measure of confidence and authority. But it has not gotten easier and I find myself in front of students all the time at a loss for words, having absolutely no idea what to say even if I spent hours on a lesson plan because of the improvisational demands of the classroom. I over-prepare for everything where I feel I need to speak, trying to imagine eventualities so that I am not caught in the horrible situation I often find myself in, of many people looking at me expectantly for the answer to a question, or a response, while I stare back like a goldfish with nothing to say before finally saying something inane just to end the silence and awkwardness.

Much of this has to do with my declining memory. I have an autoimmune disorder and frequent brain fog, so it can take me an inordinate amount of time to remember simple things (imagine someone at parent-teacher night asking you for your age or your name, or what subject you teach and you can't answer right away - it makes a terrible impression). 

I don't feel like my problem is solely a memory problem or a social anxiety problem, but a combination of each compounded by my difficulty with spontaneity and improvisation. But it negatively impacts my life so much, and I live in a state of shame and constant fear at work, social events, meetings etc. Any advice that isn't ""try Toastmasters!"" very much appreciated. Have you dealt with any of these issues? What techniques and coping mechanisms have worked for you? Thank you so much!!",28Sep2019,1

680,"Without getting into too much detail, I work in STEM and having issues with a coworker who lacks the educated needed to work with us. We do do work that isnt anything super advanced, but not anything youd really want entry level or someone without the formal background working in (this individual has a masters degree but non of their education has been in our field, mostly just self taught). We have this individual at work who as a person is great, but when it comes to the actual job they are really lacking the education and its hurting us in my opinion. Quite often it turns into this individual asking other coworkers how to do things until a task is done. This has been causing some of the work to fall behind, and whats even worse in my opinion is this individual interacts with other organizations who do similar work and makes it incredibly obvious through conversation that they are lacking the education needed to work there which turns into my boss having to be there for damage control (hes told me this) , or during meetings will ask questions that are our field 101 college class level questions.

When I first joined the team they told me I was replacing this individual and they were going to find the individual something to do that better fit their talents, but because of the nature of the work it didnt exactly turn out like that. I think the best way to handle the situation is to  tell this individual they need to go grab some books and learn the material within X amount of time or they are going to have to be let go, but I am also not in a position to do this and I don't even think its appropriate for me to bring this up.

What can be done, I like the person but its hurting us?",28Sep2019,1
682,"Yes. I know this is a very first-world problem, and I know many others have it much worse than me. Still, I feel so lonely.

In primary school, I was really outgoing--I was friends with practically everyone, was complimented many a time for having good humour. I was happy. When I got to highschool, everything changed. 

As it happens, and has happened, for many of you, I'm sure, I became extremely socially awkward. I don't know when exactly I *did* change, but I know that I was no longer the same, and still am no longer the same. 

I haven't had a friend since 5th grade, haven't held a conversation longer than 10 minutes with another human being since, haven't smiled in front of another person in God knows how long.

Everytime someone tries to talk to me, I can't reply. I have talked to my parents about my social struggles, but my mother--my mother especially--seems awash with the idea that I'm secretly the popular kid, the brooding deep cool guy. Fuck no. I have so much trouble replying to even the simplest questions, and when I do, I'm never able to send a question back to the interlocutor. 

I feel empty.

The last time I was invited to something, an event, it was clearly out of pity. And I hate that. I hate being pitied. I can't stand it. When someone feels bad for me, I can't help but hate them, too, on top of myself. So I distance myself from them. 

When I speak in front of a crowd, my voice starts to quaver, my body sometimes trembles, depending on my stress level, and it's even happened that my leg starts to shake uncontrollably, jumping up and down. 

In highschool, I was called a robot because of the lack of emotion my countenance bore. I am not a robot. Please, don't ever call someone that. I am human--don't degrade me to something lesser. I *feel* things. Emotions. Anger, happiness, sympathy, sadness... I *feel*. I feel all of them. And everytime I'm called a robot--while I maintain a stolid face--I feel like my heart cracks. It hurts to be called inhuman. 

I couldn't ever find a place to eat at in the school's cafeteria, and everytime I tried to sit with classmates, it was clear I was unwanted; so i ended up finding a secluded area where I could dine without judgment. That is, the bathroom. 

I ate there everyday, and never ate anywhere else. 

Now I'm in CEGEP (sorta like a college in Québec, I guess). I promised myself I would change. I promised I would make friends. But it's been a month and I haven't mustered up the confidence to utter a word to anyone else.

I don't know what to do. I've been alone for so long. I haven't had friend in so long. Hell, I feel like I don't know what it even is to *have* a friend.

Sorry if this was just me listing things I wabted ti vebt about. I needed to vent this somewhere, if not to a friend, then to the internet. I'll probably just end up deleting this post. I just needed to free the words cloistered deep in my mind.",28Sep2019,7

684,"I’ve never been too involved with athletics and sport, but have gone to the gym from time to time to do a bit of cardio and weight lifting. 

When I decided to get more into fitness to lose weight and obtain a healthier lifestyle, I feel like I’ve really made strides.

I’ve lost weight and have gotten stronger. I am able to move in ways I haven’t before. 

However most of my work outs have been boxing classes. I’ve been hesitating other types because I’m not very good at moving my body. I wouldn’t say I’m clumsy, but I excel at work outs that are simple in movement and require raw power. 

I noticed while even in my boxing classes, while I’m good at throwing a punch, I have a hard time with combos. When my instructors give me a combo it takes me a while to commit it to memory and have my body follow suit. I’ve even catch my brain say throw a left hook and my right arm does a jab. 

Today I decided I wanted to try a pole dancing class. It wasn’t a complete disaster, but it’s clear that compared to everyone else- I have a harder time moving my body and replicating the instructors movements. It’s not that I’m not paying attention, I just get overwhelmed with the steps and if I’m doing it right. I was pretty embarrassed the whole time. 

Basically; I can’t move my body with much control. I would be lying if I said body image had nothing to do with it- I’m a little scared of looking unattractive and dumb when I try something I never have before. 

I thought the pole dancing would help with it but I walked away feeling more inept.  

So I’m asking what can I do to fix this? Should I try yoga? Tai chi? Any advice is appreciated.",28Sep2019,1

688,"My (ex) fiancé and I broke up at the beginning of this year. I broke up with him because I couldn’t take the emotional and verbal abuse, the drinking and the constant video game playing (and $$$ spent on them). We have two girls age 5 and 3. He is a narcissist and the break up was a bit messy (he kicked me out, kept all the girls clothes and toys ect). We had a couple of really messy parts where he was calling and texting me non stop and once broke into my new house. 

The thing is, he loves the girls very much and I’ve been trying to keep the peace for their sake. We currently have a shared placement schedule for the girls and it’s been working well for a few months now because he’s been mostly leaving me alone. This last week was stressful for him I guess and he ended up sending me many many texts calling me ugly, a whore, worthless and saying really hurtful and untrue things about my family. 

These types of things don’t really hurt me too much anymore because I’m used to them from when we were together, but I don’t want to receive this type of harassment. My attorney says that I can use this to file a motion to have placement of the girls (which I could’ve done from the beginning but I have been trying to be fair and even with the girls)

I feel really guilty though. I know he loves them very much, but that behavior make me uneasy and I don’t want to have to see him so frequently as I do now with a shared schedule. 

I’m sorry this is so long but I could really use some advice whether I should go forward with primary placement or just stick this shared schedule out and hope he stops using me as an emotional punching bag?",28Sep2019,1

691,"So there's this girl I've been talking to, as a friend, for a while and she doesn't know I've developed more than just a little crush for her. I know her from way back then when we were still in highschool (I graduated in 2017, she graduated the year after), but we were different people at the time and associated with a different groups. I never saw or heard anything about her since I graduated.

 Sometime around March or April, we started hanging and getting to know one another through a friend of mine, which happens to be her step brother. When we were first starting to get to know one another my friend would always be there with us so I never really engaged in conversation with her but more through the group we were with by adding or just reacting to what would be talking about and slowly just started being more open and engaged with one another. Today, we go on pointless drives sometimes and hang out late at night talking up until 3am without my friend being there with us. One night in particular we started hanging around 8 at night and we ended up talking non-stop until 6am talking about eachother and just getting into personal close topics and past experiences. I had work the next day but I didn't care. I never wanted to just be around someone so bad talking and getting to know one another. I leave for work at around 6:45 so I had to call it,unfortunately, to get ready.

Now, I'm just struggling with telling her how I feel about her. She's told me in the past that she's had really great friends, who also happened to be guys, that end up telling her they have feelings for her. (In my defense, I developed feelings for her before we started talking as friends). Eventually, things between her and those guys she had a relationship with just got wierd and they eventually stopped being friends because of it. I really want to tell her how I feel because I get the feeling I'm lying to her face when she tells me personal things and opens up to me because of how I feel about her. I don't want to feel as if I violated her trust for not telling her. But at the same time if she rejects me I want her to know that I'd understand if she doesn't feel the same way and I'd still want to continue being around her just as a friend.

699,"a couple months back, i started talking to this girl again after she split with her ex(my friend). I was kind of in a weird spot being friends with not only one of her ex but the both of them from the two relationships she had. I kind of kept our friendship a secret thing until one night where we had our deep late night talks, and recently while hanging out I've come to realize that I really like her.   What hurts is that she has called me her ""best friend"" but acts as i'm just another person. One night she broke down completely, and I realized how vulnerable she was giving me the sense that I have to be there for her. Her insecurity has made me into something supporting her. If I were to compare it to something I would be a pillar to a building. I want to be there supporting her, but her ex told me that was exactly what she said to him. It's kind of giving off the vibe that she's using me, and I'm really not sure what to do. I've been talking to her every single day for the past 3 months and she's been such a big impact so far. Most of my close friends have been telling me just to cut her off since its been heavily affecting me emotionally.

705,"I started my first corporate job 2 years ago, and have been promoted once in that time. I have a great friend group, a cozy apartment, and a clear career path laid out for me. But I am reaching a point of burnout and have no passion for my job. I know I am young and can't expect the first years of my career to be fulfilling. I've put in the work and have done my best to have a positive and realistic attitude. But I know this isn't where I see my future long term. I don't want to climb the promotional ladder at this company any further, nor do I really want to continue a corporate career at all. I always envisioned working for myself in some creative capacity.

Through a connection at another corporate company, I landed an interview for a somewhat similar position that will pay me more and take me back to my home state. I know I could be comfortable in this position and would love to live closer to family and friends. But I fear getting stuck in the same situation I'm in now -- unfulfilled and devoid of purpose, feeling creatively drained.

Or, I could quit without anything lined up. I could travel the world, maybe find a job at a hostel or teach English in another country. I could even move home and go back to my old serving job. It would be nice to take a break from the stress and contemplate what I truly want out of life. But I know I would trade work stress for financial stress, and feel like I'm regressing in my development. I fear being seen as a quitter by my family, my friends, and society. But sometimes radical changes are the ones that allow you to discover your true self and offer the most personal development.

I've always dreamed of being a writer. I aspire to write my own book or screenplay. I long to work in film and entertainment, and would love to direct movies as well. I also love music, and would love to write and produce music one day. These dreams feel so far off and unattainable to me, since I'm not in those industries now nor have I ever pursued them. But I know if I never try, I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

Really I'm seeking an objective perspective, from someone who doesn't know me, to give me their opinions and advice. If anyone has been through a similar situation, or has an opinion or life advice to share, it would be greatly appreciated!

Sincerely,

Feeling Stuck",28Sep2019,1
706,"Ok, so I overheard my GF say something about her ex having a small penis with her very close friend. It was a small comment that probably only I noticed.

We're extremely honest and open, no sugarcoating, so I asked a risky, stupid question on my end.

I asked if he was similar to me (Im 6""x5"", about as average if it gets), later in the conversation she said you want me to compare you guys? I said sure. She said ""no it was smaller."" 

Which should be a great answer! But for some reason the wording of that makes it sound like ""you're both smallish but he's smaller"". Like instead of just saying it was small, she said it was smaller or whatever. 

Even though after she said, ""you're not small if that's what you're worried about?"" I was totally worried about it, but didn't want to look as extremely insecure as that made me!

707,"I'm not sure where to start on this, I think I'm just gonna start writing and see where this goes.

I (19M) was diagnosed as high-functioning autistic in 2007. In most ways, I've completely surpassed the expectations of my old psychologist - e.g. I can hold eye contact perfectly, I've travelled around the entire country on my own, successfully learned to drive etc. But in some social areas, I really don't feel that I have. I'm incredibly introverted, struggle to open up and let people in, and as a result, I've been affected by depression and anxiety for at least four years.

I'm not entirely sure when the self-loathing started. I spent most of my childhood being bullied for my differences, and I guess in turn that made me notice them even more. This made me start to scrutinise every single detail about myself, resulting in a vicious cycle that has continued to the present day. Even now, if the slightest little thing goes wrong in my life and I feel like it's my fault, I find myself in a hole from which it feels like there's no escape.

Over the years, I've had peaks and troughs. Some periods of my life have seen me be sociable and outgoing, some - particularly, the past year - have seen me withdrawn, reclusive and anxious. I spent the past year at art school with pretty much no friends of my own, due to the constant anxiety I felt.

Well, almost none. I used to commute home with someone I'd met at college, and we bonded pretty quickly over the fact that we're both rather weird. A year after we first met, we've been dating for 5 months.

Only now, I feel like I'm placing all that in jeopardy. My girlfriend (20F) has been nothing but kind to me from day 1 - supportive, loving, funny and everything in between - but I feel like my anxiety is holding her back in many ways. It's taken me a hell of a long time to completely open up to her, which has now started to cause serious problems for us. Every time she explains something that she's not completely happy with in our relationship, I spiral into panic and the feelings of self-loathing come right back to the surface. This of course causes her to become upset, which obviously neither of us want. This actually happened five minutes before I started writing this, which led me to virtually having a mental breakdown.

Basically, we'd come home from a day out and I was feeling cold. She mentioned how, whenever something didn't go right during our day, I'd become reclusive or short. I then apologised, and while we were both upset, she missed a chance to socialise with her new flatmates at uni. I then started to feel guilty, feeling that I'd ruined her night, and ultimately that I was holding her back at uni, and broke down, explaining how much I dislike myself. 

Although this is a particularly big problem for our relationship, it's also made me short-tempered and depressed at work, it's made me withdrawn around my family and friends, and has brought my studies into question as I struggle to enjoy anything I'm doing. This extends to hobbies as well.

Ultimately, I want to fix myself, maybe even like myself, so that I can finally enjoy all the things and people I'm so lucky to have in my life. I'm currently terrified of losing my girlfriend in particular, as she's struggling to cope with my problems.

TL;DR: I've been affected by depression and anxiety for a long time, but always fallen into a cycle of feeling slightly better and not seeking help. Want to fix myself to enjoy my life, become more sociable and keep my beautiful relationship with my girlfriend.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Any advice is truly appreciated, and I'm happy to answer any questions that might help.",28Sep2019,2
708,"10 months ago, I moved to a large city on the East Coast to pursue a career in live entertainment (I'm trying not to get into much detail because my work community is very small) and ever since then, I have had a hard time with the transition. I have also had a hard time balancing the freelancing life. I am trying to move back to the West Coast and I want a full-time job.

I applied for a job that I thought would be a good fit for me on a whim and I was selected to be interviewed, but I am concerned about 2 things. First, they want to interview me in person so I'm taking the gamble of flying there for 1 day on my own dime. Second, I have taken on projects between now and February of 2020 that I would need to back out of if I got this job. I work in a field where I freelance a lot and I am not on a contract with anyone at this point. However, I do feel an obligation and loyalty to the companies that I work for (about 3 total). I work in a management capacity, so I would feel guilt about backing out of the projects I've committed to. 

Is it worth it to fly out there for this one interview? I don't know if a job that is this good of a fit will come up again soon, but I am so torn. I have never been more on the fence about something in my life. Any insight out there? 

TL;DR - Not happy in freelance life on the East Coast and an interview for a full-time gig on the West Coast has come up. Should I take a gamble and fly out for the interview and, if I get it, will I be a dick for backing out on work I've verbally but not contractually committed to?",28Sep2019,5

712,"Quick background: 22 years old, last semester in college, graduating in December with a major in Criminal justice. College has been hell for me, I have been dealing with depression for 5 years now. Although there have been better days than others, the depression has still been very consistent. I honestly don’t even know how I made it this far... my only motivation was the idea of working for the U.S Marshal Service, FBI, DEA, applying for Officer Candidate School in the military after graduation, etc.

 I had this simple plan; join the military then gain some experience in law enforcement until I can become a Fed. But I am delusional, there’s no way in hell I can do any of those things. Because of my depressive episodes I have used marijuana probably  more than a 100 times (thc and cbd oils) to help relieve my depression. I also used magic mushrooms 5 times (also to help treat my depression with approval of my therapist). Those are automatic disqualifiers for any law enforcement and military position. 

Depression + Drug use makes me an awful candidate. I have been reconsidering my career choice, it seems unlikely that someone like me is even suitable for military and police work. It hurts so much to admit this because much of my motivation and identity has revolved around these things. I have no other passion.

Or if I am with my boyfriend and he gives me a look and then tells me when we are alone that I overshared information. I am not diagnosed, but I know I have social anxiety and when people aren’t talking I feel as though I need to talk and then when I’m alone I have an anxiety attack about how I shared information that was either irrelevant or did not need to be shared.

715,"So, here's the background: when I was younger, my grandpa touched me and some of my other cousins as well. Well, I'm 25 now and it's been about 20 years since it happened and I didn't tell anyone about it until a couple months ago. So, I'm now dealing with really old wounds that haven't healed. 

Well, my boyfriend was the very first person that I had ever told about the molestation and he was the one that actually helped me talk to my family about what had happened. He was so patient and understanding and not pushy. I think I took like 2 hours to tell the story and he sat there and let me cry untill I could talk and just held me. 

Fast forward to a couple days ago, we were talking on the phone and my grandpa got brought up. I was saying how I'm not sure how long it will take to get over what happened and I think there will always be small triggers through out my life. He tried to make a joke about how that meant he couldn't come out of the shower and ask me to touch him (which is what happened with my grandpa) and it threw my mind back to what happened to me and I started crying.

 As soon as he finished his sentence, I could tell, by the tone of his voice, that he knew he made a mistake. He said sorry and that he overstepped and that he should have never tried to joke about it. I couldn't really talk because I was crying and because I was hurt that he would try to even joke like that. So I got off the phone call and sent him a text saying that he really hurt me, that we needed to set some boundaries and that we would talk later about it. 

I'm having a hard time getting over this. I know it wasn't meant to be malicious, he deals with hard things with humor and will try to break the seriousness of things with a joke.

720,"Hey guys, needed some advice and opinions on a situation i've been going through these last two days. 

So i live in a conservative country (nothing too crazy, but not exactly the west) and since i've been 15 i've wanted to dye my hair. Now, this isn't a problem in and of itself, but since i'm a male, it's (at least where i'm from) a little bit frowned upon.

For some time i just ignored the whole idea, knowing i was 15 and could get a lot of crap by my parents, who are very against it. Fast-forward 3 years later, i'm 18 and thought i could at least dye my hair without my parents going batshit crazy about it. I decided to do a very dark colour, that has a blue tint when directly exposed to the sun. This morning i had to videochat with my mom, since she's traveling with my dad atm, and when she saw my hair, she got really confused and then went absolutely crazy about it.

She told me to wash my hair immediately (i told her the dye is not permanent, dumb ik) then told me i'm crazy, and after that told me i need to get it bleached and i need to cut my hair short. I told her i won't do that, and she got pissed even more (ok understandable). She then texted me, told me she'll kick me out of the house because of my 'crazy' and 'unnatural' behaviour. She told me my friends are disgusting and that she doesn't ever want to see them again (oh yeah she told me my hair looks disgusting too). She told me i can contact my grandpa/grandma and see if i can live at theirs, or i can move in at one of my friends. At that point i got really sad but kinda got over it.

After around 5 hours i decided to call my dad because of something unrelated to the whole thing, and he was talking to me as if nothing was happening at all. Then he told me mom wants to talk to me, she informed me that she wants my hair back to normal by monday (that's when she's coming back from the trip). I said no and ended the call. 

What would be the smartest way to proceed? I contacted my grandpa, but he doesn't have a free apartment atm, and i really don't want to have to call my grandpa because i haven't talked to her in a longer time and i don't want to look like i'm just calling because i need help.",28Sep2019,1

724,"First of all, I apologize if there's a few errors here and there as English is not my native language.

I know it's gonna sound a bit creepy, but there is a particular actress that I find really beautiful and overall really like (I wouldn't say ""love"" in a romantic way because I don't know her personally and she obviously doesn't know about me either). 

I'm currently pursuing my studies to become a filmmaker, and I must admit that it would be pretty awesome to have the opportunity to work with her one day. I bought some of her movies, and watching them has been really useful to me in order to improve my cinematographic culture.

Now, the problem is, I'm scared that I could one day become too obsessed with this person for my own good. I'm not a stalker or anything, but I'm afraid that I could become a creepy guy of that sort if I keep idealizing her more and more. I mean, I would really love to at least meet her in person one day and talk for a little bit, but I clearly wouldn't want to insert myself in her private life.

So my question is, do you guys know if there are ways to moderate your appreciation of a certain person ? I'm really afraid that I could become really creepy and/or so obsessed with her that I could become depressed if I don't ever meet her irl. Oh, and sorry if my question is vague or weirdly-phrased.

726,"So the past year has been pretty rough. Last summer (2017) my boyfriend of 4~ years got really drunk on our way to a festival and was a complete mess. I had to hold him upright so we could make it to the fest, but we basically never got there. He harassed me verbally to the point where he scared me and I had to call a friend about ~1 hour away to come pick him up because 1. He wouldn't leave me alone 2. I was scared he was going to hurt me 3. He was way too drunk to even get into the festival. While waiting for help to arrive he got in my face, smacked my phone out of my hand and it went flying, my earring came off, he smacked my head so my hair was all messed up. Little details but these help me remember for a fact that he did get physical. Help came and he still tried to justify his actions, he claims I (half white, very light skinned) called for help because I'm racist (he is Asian). He claims I could have got him jumped, or even killed. Which is ridiculous to me and clearly was just a tactic to make me feel silenced and I was in the wrong for reaching out for help. He told me I was a bad person for possibly getting him into a situation where he could get killed and used the recent death of his father as a way to guilt trip me. He said ""What would you tell my mom? Oh I got your son killed and you're mourning the death of your husband?"" Although yes he was very drunk and what he was saying is nonsense, this is very much like him to guilt me into feeling like shit about his father's death. Yes, I understand it's traumatic as fuck to lose a parent, it was hard. But I tried to be there, I wasn't the best, but I was learning. And he continuously made me feel like shit for not doing X,Y, Z. Comments throughout our relationship like ""it's X amount of days since my dad passed and I bet you're just going to ignore me/hang out with your friends today"" before I even got the chance to speak to him or even plan hanging out, I've even suggested seeing his father at the cemetery on different occasions but those were all never considered. Anyways, fast forward to this year, maybe April-May. We finally break up. March was the one year anniversary of his dad's death and it was becoming to much for me to stick around while I know he was going to continue to manipulate me into feeling bad, guilt me from enjoying any time alone/with friends, etc. It was just something I didn't need on my plate at the beginning of the year, I was starting a new serious career and he was still coming at me and accusing me of ignoring him or spending time with others when I was literally working or just living my own life. Okay so it's May, our mutual friend from high school that was in our small friend group for 4+ years took his own life. I've never had a friend, my age, pass away, and never had it been suicide. I didn't handle it well at all. It didn't hit me right away, but when it did, it was like a ton of bricks. I excessively cried the day I found out, I went to the liquor store and drank. It's kind of a blur, especially at this point since I've tried to forget what happened. But basically that night I was still drinking, I think I had a box of wine that I planned on finishing myself. After midnight I was planning on self harming, something I've struggled with for half my life but was working on not relapsing. I needed someone to talk to so I reached out to my ex, he basically invited himself over when all I wanted was someone to talk to so I could distract myself. I didn't feel much comfort from his presence but he offered to hold me while I cried, which I did, heavily. I was hysterically crying. I'm still drinking at this point mind you, I have a mini fridge in my room and would refill my cup every once in a while. He eventually fell asleep in my bed and I didn't want to wake him so I just covered him with a blanket and shit my eyes. Next thing you know he's waking me up by kissing me. I felt like I couldn't say no, it was already happening. I wasn't into it but something in me wouldn't let me protest. I don't remember much but basically we have sex, or at least that's what I tell myself, even though I didn't want it. We're having sex while I have fresh self harm wounds on my leg, blood on my sheets, I'm literally crying. I don't know why all these things were not clear indicators that I wasn't in the right state of mind. He claims he didn't know I was drunk, but I was drinking all day, I know there had to be alcohol on my breath. I was stumbling, bumping into things, my eyes were puffy and I couldn't even keep them open at all. This next part things get complicated. I hear my dad come home and I have very thin walls so I didn't want him to hear us in the next room, when he walked into his room I suggested we leave and go to my ex's house to ""finish"". We did, it's like 4 am or something I don't remember, I think the sun was coming up. I blacked out on the way to his house. We continued having sex there, I don't remember much of it but I woke up at his house the next day feeling disgusted, hungover, spinning, and something didn't feel right. It's hard to talk about this because he paints himself to be this person who respects women, is a trustworthy person, and is even in safe spaces where assaulters, rapists, racists and etc are not allowed. He has the trust of so many people. I know if I say anything that he will flip the story, someone bring his dad into it and guilt me into feeling like I deserved it or wanted it. When that's the furthest thing from true. If he never kissed me I wouldn't have found myself in this situation. I just wanted someone to stop me from potentially self harming too much because I was drunk and didn't know better. I was mourning the death of a friend, freshly relapsed self harm, drunk out of my mind, and emotionally vunerable. He took advantage of me that night but he probably thinks nothing of it.",28Sep2019,1

728,"So, my boyfriend and I have been together since April. We were very sexual at first, but that kind of tapered off as we spent more time actually getting to know each other. I personally feel like emotional intimacy becomes more important after a certain point than physical intimacy - if I'm going to continue having a relationship with someone, I need to feel like I really know them and that we're compatible. Otherwise, there's no point in continuing things, because anyone can do sex. 

I don't feel like we really know each other, and I've been trying to communicate some things that bother me to him. He's been receptive I guess, but doesn't seem to actually understand why those things bother me, like pushing me to cut his hair or spend holidays with his family even though I'd repeatedly said I did not want to do those things. He claimed he just wanted to push me out of my comfort zone to do things he thought I would like. I told him that was not necessary, because I already know what I do and don't like. We often can't talk about things like politics or religion because he will either completely shut down or sometimes he just won't listen to me and talk over me with his own opinions without listening. I'd prefer to have a future with someone who has common values, so I told him we needed to work on that and see where it goes. 

He's always said he wouldn't pressure me to have sex or do sexual things, that it was all just a bonus to him, but he kind of does. If I say I'm not in the mood, he gets really quiet and doesn't seem interested in me at all, or makes comments when we do about how I'll ""finally let him"" touch me. Now he's saying he wants me to send him more nudes, etc because he ""likes getting to see parts of me that no one else gets to"", and that for him it's more of an affection/love thing than a sex thing.

This just rubs me the wrong way. It makes me feel like he seems to think he has some kind of ownership over my body, and that reaffirming that makes him feel like I love him, even though I don't really see that as a loving gesture, more of a lustful one. This is having the opposite effect and makes me less sexually attracted to him, because I feel like he doesn't really care about whether or not I feel comfortable doing that just because he wants it. Sort of how like he didn't really care when I had told him I did not want to do the things he was insisting I was going to do (cut his hair, spend holidays with his family). I told him I would try to do that even though it made me feel weird. He didn't seem to care about that as long as I try. 

Am I being a shitty girlfriend? What do I do, and how can I articulate this to him without hurting his feelings? Is it selfish that I don't want to do that? It just bugs me, because I always felt like sexual interactions are things that should be freely given, not necessarily pushed for, in a relationship - especially when someone says they feel uncomfortable with it.",28Sep2019,5

My life is actually going pretty good, I'm going to graduate soon, I am in the best shape I've ever been, have made great accomplishments in terms of work that I have been praised for, and I have a pretty well-paying job for someone my age who hasn't even graduated college yet. But I have this inkling in my brain that I need to get a girlfriend to live my life to the fullest, that it's the missing link, and it constantly bothers me. I've been on multiple dates in the past two months, and they end up not working out despite me not really being nervous at all and (at least I think) making good conversation. Some of these first dates have even escalated to making out, but I never can seem to get girls to meet up with me again.

This has made me put a lot of blame on myself as I am the common factor across all of this, of course. If the girl doesn't respond back, I immediately default to it being my fault for not being good enough to the point of borderline self-hatred. And my response is that I need to improve myself, which I think is a good intention. But as a result, I go to the gym six times a week and am on the verge of overtraining because I feel insecure and feel that I need to be as muscular as possible to get girls to like me. I know that sounds pathetic as fuck, but that's the honest feeling I have. Has anyone dealt with thoughts like this? I feel like I definitely need to change my thinking and would like some advice.

732,"This concerns me and a friend, both in our 20s. I don't want to go into too much detail but some background is required before the question.

A while ago I noticed that despite seeing them fairly frequently, I drove all of our conversations and realized that I could not think of a single conversation or in-person meeting that they had initiated, which seems like an indicator that they might not want contact with me. This was a bit sad but it's not like I can force someone to be friends with me, nor would I want to do so. Note that I do not think it is just that they are less social since I have noticed (purely by accident, not me spying on them) that they seem more talkative with others. 

Anyway, I decided to see what would happen if I did not start a conversation. Perhaps they had not started any interactions because I did too frequently? A little over a month passed without any contact before I happened to see them in person. By this point it looked like my suspicion was correct but something weird happened. They seemed happy to see me and expressed surprise at how long it had been, wondering why. I let the solution be that we had been busy instead of stating what had really happened because it seemed like mentioning it would just lead to unpleasantness. That was a few weeks ago. It somehow came up again and they said that they were still surprised at how we had no contact for a long time, given the previous frequency. Again, I said something like it's a mystery or who knows or similar to avoid any sort of confrontation.

Now that that is out of the way, here is my question: do you think that there is any reason to bring up the real reason that we had no contact, which is that if I don't initiate then it will never happen? I enjoy talking to this person when we actually talk but so much of the time it feels like me talking at them rather than with them and I don't know if they realize it. My feeling is that mentioning this will just lead to problems but I suppose it could also fix some. I just don't know.",28Sep2019,4

Just an hour ago my good friend told me that they’ve been getting very close recently, I won’t go into detail as to how but it’s a fairly safe bet they’re into each other. He’s saying he wants to ask her out but doesn’t have the balls to do it. I’ve hatched a sort of plan with him that’ll go into effect Monday.

We’re both very socially awkward. I’m a lot better at hiding it than he is, but I think I could help him out here. Though this has brought about the issue of my feelings towards the girl. Her and I have been friends for a while now, and as I’ve said she knows that I’m into her.

I was honest with my friend, and told him that I like her too but I respect that if they’re into each other I’m in no place to stand between them. He said he really appreciates that.

The issue lies in the following, which is also why I’ve made this post. I’ve no fucking clue how to react if they’d actually start dating. I know I wouldn’t hate them for it but it’s super conflicting, I just would like some general tips on the do’s and donts of it all.

Some extra context:

All of us are 16 going 17, so we’re old enough to kind of know what’s going on but at the same time young enough that no one has a clue what they’re doing.

Me and the guy have been friends for a while

The girl does trust me, and enjoys my company and while she never explicitly stated this I’m pretty sure she wants to keep it that way, and again while I’m kind of upset about it I’m in no place to force her to like me because while the ethics and everything on that are questionable in the first place I’m not that kind of person.

This was all very sudden so I was unprepared to know this and I’m regretting offering my help, not because I want to interfere but because I feel I could fuck up severely and ruin it for everyone involved. In real life I’m trying to act chill but obviously in my online world I’m ever so slightly freaking out.

He started to say things like I've changed and that those ""friends"" are using me. He then started to insult them and saying stuff like ""i wouldn't hang around them"" and that i was desperate and that i feel like I'm finally part of something.

I told him he was just jealous. He then proceeded to block me on every single social media platform. I feel like I've offended him greatly.",28Sep2019,2

747,"I’m in a very new relationship with a guy I’ve had a major crush on for a few months now. We met at a party and instantly clicked. He makes me laugh and we have many of the same interests. 

But in life, we’re very different. I have a high paying job, a new car, and my own apartment. He still lives with his mom, he decided to quit his high paying job a month ago, and doesn’t have a driver’s license. So when we go out, I always pay and I’ve been using a lot of gas going from my house to work (30 minute drive) and his house (40 minutes from my house, 10 minutes from work.) 

I’d like to eventually move away and go to University so I can pursue a stable career. He doesn’t know what he wants to do and plays video games and drinks and smokes weed all day (I have nothing against marijuana, but I do it rarely since it makes me very lazy.) 

I really like him and he seems fairly intelligent. I do want to help him get his life together because ultimately his parents never pushed him like mine did with me. But at the same time he’s a grown adult and he seems to have just given up. I know life can be hard. 

Should I dump him? How can I help him?",28Sep2019,2
748,"So when i tried to pay my rent, the page went funny, but then refreshed itself and said payment successful (I have screenshots of these). This was just over 2 weeks ago. When i check my payment history on the landlord company website, it says i have paid my term 1 rent. 

I've  just checked my bank account, and the money hasn't left the account and the payment doesn't exist. It's been over 2 weeks since ""paid"" so it would be registered on my statement by now.  

WHAT DO I DO??? Do i just say nothing and let the company think I've paid rent and keep the money?? Do I go to the office and see what's up and pay there?

749,"My wife and I went to a wedding in which she was the matron of honor. We stayed at a hotel for two nights.  Or at least i did.  The first night we had the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner, being in the wedding she went to the rehearsal while I stayed in the car and waited(for 2 hours) afterward was the dinner which was fine but I was starting to feel sour that I wasn’t getting to spend any time with my wife.  After the dinner a bunch of people went out for drinks and I chose not to because I had been at work all day prior.  She didn’t come back until about 3 am just to tell me she was staying with the bridal party. So I slept alone. The next day she obviously had her thing to do with the bride and so on but again I felt sour because I knew no one and was left all alone all day in the hotel room.  I went to the wedding, spoke to her for all of one minute and then everyone left.  She was very nervous about giving her speech at the reception and really wanted me to be there.  At this point I was very angry with everything that was going on and I didn’t want to go anymore.  I built up enough courage to go, knowing i wouldn’t be able to speak to her because she was at the bridal party table and so on. I go to walk in the door of the lobby and I see her (what I would call) flirting with 2 members of the groomsmen.   At that point I lost it and left.  She didn’t even see me standing there.  I felt broken inside   When it came time to give her speech I obviously was not there and this really upset her stating she only wanted me to be there for support.  But I feel she didn’t need me for anything else all weekend.     Was I in the wrong for not going to the reception?  We’re now thinking a divorce is in order...

760,"It's been just about over a month of me moving down into my girlfriend's place( she and I are 21) which is also with her father over here in California. I moved from Texas because I had some family issues going on and didn't have a good spot to stay until my girlfriend's father said it was fine with him for me to move in. I'll always be grateful for his kindness and hospitality. But ever since I moved down it's like my stomach has been so weird like when I eat sometimes I really bloated or just an upset stomach with pains from time to time. I'm lactose intolerant so I don't fuck with dairy at all like even eating a piece of red meat for lunch today just has my stomach feeling weird again. Everytime I eat I get slight constipation when my pooping schedule back home was 2x a day even though I know it's normal not to poop everyday just I feel the constipation. It's not easy just to go get checked out just in case something really is wrong but I have no insurance and already have hospital bills from back home, I complain a lot now which I know my girlfriend hates but I don't know what else to do. Trying to hear back from the jobs I've applied to have been a bust, nothing seems good so far besides being able to be with my girlfriend instead of log distance. I could be depressed but don't wanna feel like I am cause it'll be another thing to have in my mind which my head feels like it wants to explode already. And I can get more in depth about how it is living with my girlfriend but this is getting long already lol but I just have a feeling we wont be dating anymore if I bring up the possibility of me just going back home. Things with her are great most of the time but I just feel like I'm bringing her down when she's already all over the place with school since she's getting ready for grad school next semester. We've had some issues before I moved down here dealing with trust and I won't be able to really trust her if I go back. So wanting to move back home would most likely be the end of our relationship but what if I need to go back home for my health? In my head I don't feel homesick but what if my body does? And going back home means I'll get back into my habits of smoking too much, taking xans when I shouldn't, finding anything to numb how I feel. It's just super frustrating knowing there's not much I can do and maybe me just being here is making things worse. Part of me doesn't even wanna go back home, don't wanna stay here in cali, so it'll leave me to just being on my own out there. maybe I don't belong anywhere cause it seems like no matter where I'm at I'm always going to feel like this.

763,"Okay, this is going to be a long story so letting you know in advance. Me and my gf have been dating for almost 5 years. We've decided to move in together by the end of this year. Currently, we are going to be moving in together around November or early December. Around 2 years she got a kitten from her friend. My gf knew that I wasn't a cat person at all and really hated cats due to being attacked by one when I was a child. For those 2 years, the cat and I don't get along in the sense that she doesn't bother me and I don't bother her. She never once attacked me or anything. Then out of nowhere earlier this year she hissed and then proceeded to jump, bite and scratch my feet. This caught off guard because I was standing by the bathroom talking to my gf then out of nowhere the cat just proceeded to attack me. I decided to push out of my mind as a one-off thing. Then 3 months ago the cat proceeded to once again hiss, run, bite and scratch my leg. She missed because I decided to run away into my gf room. The cat then stood in front of the door for hours until my gf came home. Once again this caught me off guard because I was holding food about to get a fork when she did that. This incident gave me cat phobia to the point where I couldn't be left alone with the cat without my gf being with me. Every time my gf left me alone with the cat for a second I would start to tense up, and get very anxious. Then 2 months ago the cat proceeded to attack me as I was getting tissues for my gf. The cat got out from under the bed and ran towards me. Once again I ran away and my gf took care of the cat. This once again put me in a state of panic. Later on that month the cat once again attacked me when I was trying to clean our dining table. This time I sprayed the cat and stood my ground and she backed off. Then 2 days she hissed at me and proceeded to attack me when I was trying to give my gf some pizza. This caused me to drop the pizza because it was out of nowhere. Each time I was attacked I was put in a state of panic due to it coming out of nowhere. I then found out last year that she attacked my gf dad foster child to the point where the kid was bleeding from his leg from cat scratches and bites. The cat also then attacked my gf brother 2 times for no reason as well. Today I believed I found out that the cat is allergic to my dandruff. I'm not sure if that's it but we tried to see if the cat will react to my clothes that weren't clean and she started sneezing. Also, I found out that my gf brother has dandruff as well. Honestly, at this point my phobia is getting worse with each attack and I don't know what to do anymore. What would you guys do?",28Sep2019,1

767,"I’m on mobile and I typed this quick so I apologize if this is hard to read.

I (17,f) and my brother (12) and the rest of my siblings haven’t had the easiest life and I could blame this and that for his behavior but that isn’t what this is about. 

From the beginning he was always the favorite, me and my 2 other siblings were assigned to to everything for him no matter what or else we’d get beat by our parents up until he was maybe 9. He got things that the rest of us couldn’t have is the simplest way I could put it without typing out a million things.

This era is over for the most part but he still hasn’t adapted to being treated like the rest of us. Every single day when he doesn’t get what he wants he threatens to kill us, more specifically me because I’m around him the most therefore I “disappoint” his expectations the most. He attacks me almost daily whether it’s with his hands, knives, or other household objects.

As of recently, he’s been incorporating “sexual harassment” into it as well, saying shit like

“I’m gonna shove my cock down your throat”
“I bet you’d love to suck my cock”
“I’ll put both you bitches on my dick”

To either me or my sister, it’s fucking repulsive. I’m typing all of this fast so those were just off the top of my head, he’s said more. You don’t know how hard it is to not fuck this kid up every time I see him. 

This has been even crazier the last month because he now believes that I’m my mothers favorite and he doesn’t take too kindly to that, he’s written a diary about me and how much he hates me and how he’s gonna kill me, sometimes featuring my mother too. 

My parents are no help considering my mother isn’t the brightest, she put herself in this position from the start to make things easier for herself and now it’s biting her in the ass and my father lets him believe that what he’s doing is okay.

770,"All my life I have had problems with being able to tell people how I really feel. I will let people walk all over me until the ends of the earth just to avoid confrontation. I fear making people sad or unhappy. This has taken a very big toll on my mental state and while I am aware that this is an unhealthy way to be, I just don't know how to tell people NO. I'm having a really bad situation currently that's causing me to have a really hard time on knowing what to say to this person without feeling like I ruined their life. 

I'm finishing up my senior year in a public high school after being on an online school for the past 2 years. I really wanted to make this last year worth everything and make some lifelong friends. I met this one girl and we really hit it off at first. I thought she would be a great friend to have and she was the first person at the school that I told that I was bisexual. For some reason, coming out to her caused something to click in her brain and she immediately thought I was attracted to her despite the fact that I told her I am not looking to date anyone in school. She then started becoming obsessive. She would follow me to every class, feel on my hair and my skin, and stare at me for several minutes at a time. She bought a notebook just to draw images of me. I received a text from my mom in class, and she looks over her desk onto mine to read what my mom said, and then would ask me about it as if she was part of the conversation? I never told her I was uncomfortable about her advances, but I was deeply disturbed by everything she did. The biggest problem I'm having is the fact that we share a P.E. class and locker room with the other girls in my grade. I walk in to change one day and she is sitting in the area where my locker is. Once I begin to get changed, she starts changing as well and watches me intensely. She took advantage of the fact that it is an all girls locker room just to watch me change. Her locker was on the other side of the room and she acted like she had trouble getting into it, yet had all her gym clothes with her... There are so many other things she does that crosses boundaries, I just can't think of everything at the moment.

Monday is approaching and all I feel is anxiety about having to confront her. I know I can't let this go on anymore, I just don't know how to tell her, or anyone for that matter, that I am uncomfortable with what they're doing.",28Sep2019,2
771,"I'm not sure if this belongs in /r/legaladvice or not, so for now I'll post it here.

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify on the title, I know who she is and where she lives, but have no other connections with her other than the fact that she lives on my road. I'm not entirely sure if she's texting or what she's up to, but every time I see her she's either part of the way or all of the way over the double yellow lines in the wrong lane. She always seems to be meandering around the road with a lot of blind corners. On two separate occasions where I've encountered her, she has had all four tires over the double yellow in the wrong lane coming head-on towards us, to the point where I've actually had to swerve off the road a bit to miss her. The normal speed on the road ranges around 40-45 mph for most of the residents, so a head-on collision has a potential to be pretty serious if it does occur.

In addition to not staying in her own lane, she has tailgated and pushed people up the road. Another time she took out her neighbor's mailbox. She's only maybe late 20s early 30s at most so it's not like she's elderly or anything, it seems to just be plain old distracted/reckless driving.  About a week ago, I noticed new damage to the front of her car when she drove by. I've started to get nervous driving on this road because I'm not sure if I'll have to suddenly get out of her way or not, which every other time I encounter her now she's not entirely in her lane.

I do believe that someone else got in contact with either her or her SO, but she's still driving like garbage. So either she was never told about it or doesn't care.

I've contacted the police to report her, but they can't really do anything unless they see it happening first hand. I have dash cam recordings of two of the incidents(which unfortunately I'm not going to post since they have identifying information in them) but since my state doesn't require front plates, and due to glare on the windows, you can't ID the driver behind the wheel with the footage anyways. I do have a picture of her license plate, since I pulled out of my driveway behind her one day and managed to take a picture while at a stop sign. My state(PA) doesn't have a dedicated number to report reckless drivers, so that also seem to be off the table.

I don't really want to harass her or publicly shame her on Facebook or something for her dangerous driving, but I also don't want to just do nothing and wait until she seriously injures or kills someone/herself in an accident. I don't want ""justice"", I just want to drive on my road without having to worry about her shitty driving.

So what should I do? Send an anonymous non-threatening letter telling her that her distracted driving is dangerous and if she keeps it up she very well may end up killing someone? Message her on Facebook and say the same thing but not anonymously? Message her on Facebook with an anonymous account? Ignore it until someone gets into an accident with her? Mail her one of those spring-loaded glitter bombs /s?",28Sep2019,1

My Dad collected football programmes and has some very rare and valuable ones. When he passed I left everything in the house as it was apart from his paperwork which was kept in the attic ( also where the programmes were kept). 

A month past and we visited his house to collect the rest of his paperwork. When I went up in the attic I noticed a huge chunk of his programmes were missing. 

Now A's daughter has a history of theft so I thought if they've been taken it was probably her. A week later I found them being sold on Ebay under her name.

784,"so me (16f) and this guy (16m) from my english class first started talking about 6 months ago and we just clicked. we had mutual friends before and knew of each other but it wasn’t until we got put into the same class that we realised just how alike we are: we have the same tastes in music, tv shows, films etc, a similar sense of humour and a lot of the same goals for the future. but then again, we aren’t too alike in that we’re both pretty opinionated people so it means we can tease each other about how wrong we think the other person is sometimes which can be kinda flirty and i’m a lot more optimistic than he is so we’ve got a good balance. 

i didn’t even notice that it had turned into a crush until i realised that i’d start to really really look forward to seeing him and texting him and just being around him in general. we’ve become really good friends and have had some pretty deep conversations, as well as just jokey, everyday meme exchanges and i feel we’re starting to trust each other more every day. he just means so much to me and that’s why i’m in such a weird position right now where i have no idea what to do. should i tell him about my feelings and risk the potential of our friendship never being the same or should i go with my heart and hope he feels the same way? i’m also really worried that we’re too far into bro territory for him to even consider me liking him a possibility and that he’d be caught off guard if i were to mention anything. 

here’s some more info about where we currently stand :
-  we rarely go a day without talking, even when one of us isn’t at school or if it’s on a weekend. most times we talk we stay up until about 1/2am and we can talk for hours and hours and hours. he initiates conversations about as much as i do but we’re yet to facetime/call.
- a lot of people around us have picked up on our uhh... chemistry?? his friends and my friends make jokes and stuff and this has become so prevalent that one of his teachers even teases him about it. only thing is we’ve never really talked about what that means - he nervously laughs and waits for the conversation to change. you could say he’s not very emotionally available i guess so i have no idea how he feels. 
- he’s had pretty bad experiences with rejection before and has never been a relationship. he also has a very low opinion of himself so i think that could kinda further make him unaware of my feelings because i don’t think he believes he’s worthy of them. 
- a few weeks ago he messaged me asking me to go see a movie called the lighthouse with him when it comes out next year, i said something like “yeah that sounds great!”, he replied “epic”. what do i do with this ???
- he often sits next to me in free periods even when his other friends are at a different table
- when i recommend him something he always watches it pretty quickly and gives me a little rundown of his thoughts on it which is really cute
- sometimes i’ll make self-deprecating jokes and he’ll make a point of telling me to be kinder to myself !! and if i ever complain about my appearance he assures me that i’m being ridiculous and have nothing to complain about 

but yeah! hope that gives you a little more insight into my situation. i’ve Never had a crush like this before and it’s really starting to affect every facet of my existence lmao. any help would be appreciated and if you’ve read this far god bless you!!",28Sep2019,1
786,"I met a handsome guy 7 months ago, he's 24. He started out being kind, sweet, and would say romantic things like: ""i love you, you're my dream girl, i want to give you the world"" and ""You're the best girlfriend"" etc. But he gets angry easily, and for the past 2 months he's just angry all the time. Just yesterday he said to me: ""Shut the f*ck up, how dumb are you? Go f*ck yourself."" It hurts my feelings. Also he calls other girls ""hoes"" so i'm worried he refers to me as one behind my back. Why did he change so fast?",28Sep2019,2
