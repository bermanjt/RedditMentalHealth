0,"Pretty much the title explains it. 
I’m 5 days late for my period, I took a pregnancy test 3 days ago, yesterday, and another this morning. 
All 3 came back negative..... 

I’m still really freaking out that I could be pregnant. I’m 28 and it would be horrible timing for me to be pregnant right now. 
I’m never more than 1-2 days late, I have been under a lot of stress lately, which could be a factor. 

Is it possible 3 home pregnancy tests could be falsely negative? 
I also don’t have any symptoms of my period coming, and usually I have a lot of symptoms.",02Sep2019,1

3,I tried breaking up with her once and we decided not to because I said my reason was because of a fight we had but she had realized where she was wrong. I thought that was true for a while but I’ve realized I think I just wanna be single. Now here is where it really gets messy. (I know I’m a terrible person because I should’ve never done this in the first place and I’m so sorry) She keeps asking me if we are ok and that we are gonna be with each other forever but I don’t feel that way anymore. I did for most of our relationship but I don’t anymore. Idk how to end it without causing her to be hurt and idk what to do. Please help.,02Sep2019,0
4,"Me, my mother, my two sisters and my grandmother share the same Apple ID so we can use the same Apple Music account. For some unknown reason, our phones occasionally synch up and we get each other’s text messages. However, the messages that each of us receive is very selective, and always messages that the other person shouldn’t receive (something sexual between a SO, or one of us talking shit). 

Unfortunately, this time my grandmother was on the receiving end of a message that wasn’t meant for her. Again, let me explain. These aren’t text messages that we accidentally send out. It’s entire text conversations that we will receive but from the users view, it looks like they sent 10+ messages when they didn’t. The person who isn’t the original person sending messages can send a message back to the unknown person but to the unknown person receiving it, it looks like the intended person texting back. It’s very confusing and annoying. Back to the story:

My grandmother received a text conversation of me and my sister calling her a bitch (when in fact she was acting like a bitch). However, this happened MONTHS ago and since then she has been receiving everything. I mean everything. My aunt just shared with us some of the text conversations she had read from my grandmothers phone and they DEFINITELY shouldn’t be seen by her. I was at her house one day and I noticed whenever my phone would ding, my grandmothers would also. I thought it was weird so I looked in the settings (when she was in the bathroom) and saw that all of our numbers were checked off for all the messages to be sent to her phone. Wtf, so I unchecked them and thought everything was fine. I go back a week later and her phone still dings when mine does. I check the settings and they are checked again. (I think she has been doing this on purpose). But now she is angry at us for talking about her and I don’t know what to do. Me and my sisters are on the same page with this but I do not want my mother knowing anything because a parent (or a grandparent) does not need to know our business. And our conversations could tear our family apart for many reasons. One of my sisters is gay and does not want to be outed to our unaccepting mother. Also, there were nudes and just simply BUSINESS ONLY MEANT FOR THE INTENDED RECIPIENT. 

What do we do? We don’t want to get a new Apple ID and exclude her because we have playlists and many paid ringtones. Also, my grandma doesn’t know that my aunt told us so I don’t want to visit her because this would be awkward as hell. I would also like to say that I’m completely okay with never seeing my grandmother again because she has done many horrible things. My grandmother is full of gossip and I don’t want her telling my entire family everything she sees in our messages. We are thinking of having my aunt make her a new Apple ID but my grandma will have to pay for her own Apple Music which will piss her off. She will go to my mom and tell her everything because she wants my mom to pay for everything. (My mom should have never gotten this old ass woman an iPhone!!!) So reddit, what do you think we should do?",02Sep2019,2

6,"I have been friends with her for a few months and fell in love with her. This was while she was dating one of my friends. I kept loving her while she never knew about my feelings.

A few weeks ago. I told her my feelings. And she said she liked me too. On the same day, later, her boyfriend (my friend) broke up with her.

Sometime later, she told me she was confused and that she really didn't like me. She felt bad about getting my hopes up. A few months prior, I promised her I wouldn't leave her even if she hurt me. Well, she did hurt me and I stayed by her side until now. She just told me she liked some other guy. Older, taller and more handsome I guess.

Now she just texted me that she's sorry and to forget about it and told me to hang out with her so we could do something fun together. But I just don't feel like it anymore. I feel like she's playing with me. I live in Quebec and it's my last year in what we call ""secondaire"". The most important year to decide the ""cegep"" and then college. This situation is affecting me a lot mentally. I sleep less, I eat less, I talk less. I don't feel like myself anymore. This is starting to scare me. I need help because I don't know what to do next.

Do I go hang out with her tomorrow and act as if nothing happened? What can I do to feel less saddened? My heart feels heavy and it feels like there's nothing there.",02Sep2019,1

8,"Okay, so I need some advice- and fast. 

So I’m an 18 yr old female who graduated this May and is going to college. I am currently enrolled in a community college and majoring in Biological Sciences. I was planning on moving towards a bachelors for Microbiology or Molecular Biology. 
Well, classes started last Wednesday, and I absolutely despise my biology teacher. She’s nice, but she’s extremely hard. This is the same with my psychology teacher. 
Going out of highschool I never really knew exactly what I wanted to do, and I don’t think I want to do biology anymore. Not because it doesn’t interest me, I just don’t think I’ll like doing it for the rest of my life and I feel like I can find something better for me to do. 
I came up with the idea of dropping my current college classes (I am still able to get my money back for my classes and textbooks) and just take this school year off to actually figure out what I want to do, and then return to classes next year, maybe at a different college for a different degree. It all depends on what I decide to do. 
And I for sure think I want to drop my current classes, because just the thought of going back to them is giving me extreme anxiety. I can hardly sleep at night and when I do, I wake up half an hour later and am just thinking about college in the most stressful way. And I think it’s all me, honestly. I’m getting in my own head about it, and maybe during the gap year I can figure everything out and be more concrete about what I’m doing and not be so anxious all the time? 
I can’t seem to make up my mind about what I want to do either, I go back and forth all the time. One minute it is, “I’ll go back to biology and just keep taking my classes.” To “I’m going into cyber security again” (cyber security was what I was originally planning on going into my entire senior year and changed my plans literally in July). Or “I think I want to join the national guard or some form of the military.” 

Overall, I just want advice on what I should maybe do? Or what your opinions are?",02Sep2019,1

10,"Sorry for the long post, I have a bit of a story to tell that happened last night. 

To say that yesterday was horrible would be a massive understatement. I have no idea how to sum up what my family is like, but basically they all completely hate each other, and last night things were crazy. It all started when my mum started listening to music at around 10 AM really loud on her TV, this pissed my sister off (she is 14) because she was trying to sleep (this is also when I woke up because of their arguing), a few hours of loud arguing later, a few things were getting thrown around (a few glass cups, I think at this point), I have no idea who started it (Fights like this happen commonly, my Mum blames her for chasing her boyfriend away (who was abusing both her and my mum, he's currently in jail for an unrelated thing), I usually just try my best to mind my own business). Eventually, things get worse, and according to my mum she thought my sister was going to hit her, so she grabbed a golf club (massive overreaction IMO, she's 14, wtf was she gonna do?), my sister than though that my mum was going to hit HER with the golf club, so she hit my mum and snatched the golf club off of her.

Obviously, this escalated things to a new level. This was like around 3 pm I think, and things just continued and continued to escalate, the cops got called TWICE that night (once by me, when things were just getting insane, and I was starting to panic, at around 6-7 pm, and before at about 4 pm). 

My mum started getting drunk at around 5-ish I'm pretty sure, By 8 pm they had 3 fights that I had to break up, broke a TV, and my sister tried throwing a knife at my mum (at this point I was standing between them, since they were ready to start throwing stuff again, trying to protect both of them) My sisters boyfriend has been here the entire time, trying to calm everybody down. When my sister tried to throw her knife, her boyfriend saw and grabbed her, the knife then went flying up and on the way down nearly chopped off two of my fingers (thank god the blunt side of the knife was the part that hit my fingers). The first time the police came, they talked to my mum and said that they will get DHS here tomorrow to put my sister in foster care, then left (I guess they just didn't think enough had happened to warrant arresting anybody), can't remember what time this was. The second time (after I had started panicking), I called the police, and right after calling the police (they didn't arrive yet) my mum pretended to leave for a few hours, she actually sneaked her way to the shed behind our flat (creepy AF). Once the police came, my sister convinced them that everything was fine (we THOUGHT she left, probably to go to her sisters or something), she convinced them stuff was fine because her room smelt like bong water (weeds illegal here in Australia), and because she didn't want to get taken away. Then things were calm for a few hours, so my sister went to sleep (her boyfriend went with her, he wanted to make sure she was safe). 

I was still up when my mum came back inside (partly out of paranoia, partly from my left over adrenalin), but thankfully she went to sleep after only like half an hour of her yelling drunk insults at my sister (thank god my sister was the mature-er of the two and had decided to completely ignore mum and not provoke anything further). Now it's 10 AM the next day, DHS should be showing up any minute now I suppose. My sister was crying earlier because she doesn't want to be taken, my mum was crying earlier because she doesn't want ME to leave (I'm 17, I honestly just want to break away from the entirety of my family, I hope that my sister does the same, it's going to get even worse once my mums boyfriend gets out of jail in a month or two, I'm legitimately worried she is going to get killed by my mums boyfriend, he has gone to jail for assault multiple times). 

I'm feeling lost right now, my entire life has just changed in one night, what do I do? It feels like I just gave a police testimony.",02Sep2019,1
11,"Well guys my fiancé left since I joined the military and got orders to germany, when she found out I was going to germany her whole attitude changed, she was always negative, she wouldn’t ever really be happy, and she was always upset and wouldn’t focus on anything positive. Well she needed help moving into her apartment for college and I’m in tech school. She needed me to be there and I tried to be but since I’m in  training I was not allowed to go outside the travel radius, but I got approved for a lake house that I had already paid for but I tried to get my commander to instead approve me to go To her college, and I was told no. So I went to the lake house and two girls ended up being invited through my other friends and I told her that on the way there and she immediately accused me of cheating and dumped me on the spot. I spent the whole weekend trying to contact her, but I did nothing with those two girls. She finally started talking to me again that Sunday but she was one word response only, I finally got her to FaceTime me and I told her what happened the whole weekend and some how my story didn’t make sense to her because I was crying like an absolute freak, so I guess I’ll give her the benefit of the doubt and say maybe I might’ve had a miscommunication but honestly I don’t remember, then when she said well prove to me that you did try to be here I didn’t have anything I didn’t get any paper back, I didn’t get anything from higher up back. So I found a conversation that I had with this one girl that asked me to do a favor for her and I said I couldn’t because I was trying to get the commander to approve me to go help my fiancé and I couldn’t risk it. She then accused me of messing around with that girl and doing favors for other girls at tech school. So now I’m her eyes I’m a cheater a liar and pretty much no good. Guys please give me advice I don’t know what to do, she left and she won’t acknowledge me. Do I wait for her? Do I just move on? Why did she leave? Did I really mess up?

12,"I had a horrifying discovery of finding a (estimated) 8 week old kitten curled up by our barn door. Eyes were open and it had some weight on it. The poor thing was dropped off (unknown to us) sometime in the past week, and died because of hunger and dehydration. I will check again (top to bottom) to make sure no more of its litter is dead elsewhere in the barn. 

We have a family farm that is clearly not in production. Our fields, we simply brush hog off. There is no fence or anything to show we are an active farm. Our barn is more or less a garage and a storage shed. Whomever did this act.opened a barn door and saw that there was no animals and we had various junk in there and dumped the poor sweet thing off.

Most likely who ever did this was told (by someone) to drop it off at the 2nd barn at the right. This farmer has a active farm and has cows. The person clearly passed this farm, missed the first barn and dropped off sweet thing at our barn. We are the 3rd barn on the right, but 2nd most visible.

I cried when I buried the kitten. I do not know if it was male or female but know the poor thing did not deserve this end.  We only have a dog who is a indoor dog. We have no other animals. Last time this happened, was in 2002 and we adopted Phil (cat) he was older than this poor thing and knew how to hunt. He died at 17. And we know that there was no way a mother cat could get into the barn to have a litter as a solid built barn. We are certain someone dropped it off.

I feel guilty because I was in the barn this past week. We have no idea when kitty was dropped off and who did it.

Is there anything more I can do as I am sick over this situation?",02Sep2019,2

17,"TL;DR: I have been in a relationship for two months but he's busier than me and has seemed to slowly talk to me less. It's been bothering me and makes me feel like he doesn't care. How do I approach talking to him/how do I get over this mindset?

&amp;#x200B;

I (16F) am dating a guy (16M) for two months and it's been amazing. We have a lot in common and it's just really nice to be in a relationship. This is his first relationship, I've only been in one in middle school which hardly counts and a not so great relationship freshman year.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a crush on my current boyfriend for awhile before we began dating. We began to really talk near the end of the school year. The first day we messaged each other until 1 AM, and the next day we talked online for 14 hours straight. From there we began to talk just about every day. It was amazing. He got his license on the first day of summer and I suggested we go do something. So we did. From then on we hung out basically every week. He's busier than me, having boy scouts, marching band, work, and vacations. Over the summer I have very little I do. I hung out with friends occasionally, had a summer job, and volunteered. On the second week of us hanging out I asked him out and he of course said yes.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, maybe a week or two, I felt like we began to start talking less. I think two weeks after we began dating he was off on vacation for two weeks for two separate things. We didn't talk much since they were both nature oriented and he only had his phone on him occasionally and bad internet. Plus I didn't really want to bother him.

&amp;#x200B;

After this vacation it felt like we began to talk a lot less. Every week we'd hang out still, but we hardly talked otherwise. Even before then he hardly took the initiative to ask if I wanted to talk, and I think I began to ask him less as well. He was beginning to get busier at this point and I'm a bit in the mindset of not wanting to bother him. I wish he would take the initiative and ask me, especially since he's the busier one. He knows I'm free basically whenever.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that school has started he's been amazing and has gone out of his way to drive me home, and we'd talk then. It still feels like we hardly hang out, though, which seems a little stupid to me. We still hang out once a week and we get the time after school to talk. Yet we hardly talk online after school. But it's stupid because most days he's busy with work and marching band. I think the big problem is I don't have as much taking up my time. I want to get a job, I just don't have my license yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the whole point of this is I've begun to feel a little insecure. It feels like he's not making as much of an effort to talk and such, even though that's probably stupid of me since he's pretty busy. I keep wanting to arrange things like a weekly movie night (online) but so far that hasn't happened. I've never thought of myself as insecure but ever since I've been in this relationship it feels like I've begun to feel more and more insecure. He isn't saying anything negative about me, I know this is all in my head. He's amazing, just busy. And I have too much free time. I think it's really just an illusion of talking less, for the most part. He had work starting near the beginning of summer, but slowly more got added to that. For me I just don't have that much going on.

&amp;#x200B;

All I really want is for him to ask me if I want to talk and play a game, or watch a movie. I'm not usually the person who takes the initiative. I'm fine taking being the person who does, but not the only person. He had very rarely asked me first. This is something that's begun to bother me for awhile now, and I really wanted to see other's thoughts. It feels too silly to bring up to anyone else. I'm aware I should probably talk to him about it, but once again it just seems a little silly, especially since it feels like it's all in my head. I might mention to him that I think he should tell me/message me whenever he wants to watch a movie to kinda encourage him to be the one, but who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

I just get a vague feeling of being a prize he won, though. Like now that we're dating he can begin to talk to me less. I know that's not how it is, though, and I know about the honeymoon phase. So maybe it's just the initial sparks are beginning to ebb so he's taking less time out of his pretty busy schedule to talk to me. I really hate how my mindset is right now. I feel like this is going to ruin the relationship, but I really don't want it to. I want to get over this and maybe talk through this, make our relationship stronger or whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said I know I should talk to him about it, but how would I approach it? How do I get over this mindset, knowing it's rather toxic?",02Sep2019,2

24,"I (20F) have a 17 year old little brother who is currently enrolled in a local high school. He has brought to my attention that a couple days ago there was a shooting at our local fast food/ hang out place called cookout, if you live in NC may you have heard of it. After a family conversation about how dangerous this is my brother voiced how there are dozens of boys all aged 15-17 at go to school with him carry guns and constantly post pictures of them pointing guns at a camera. 

I fear that one day someone some day is going to get pissed at school and blow somebody’s throat out and that my brother could either witness that or be the victim in that situation. I am also concerned with these boys because I live in the south, most of these boys grew up around their dads going shooting for sport or hunting... so not only do they know how to use a gun but they also learned this directly from their parents. 
I am all for the right to carry a gun and I am completely against stripping gun rights away from law abiding citizens who own a gun for protection or sport. I am not for underaged boys carrying guns and posting pictures with them because it makes them “hard”. 

My family and I have considered filing an anonymous police report as well as one with the school directly, including screen shots and names. My dilemma is I dont want this anyway connected to my family or my brother, just in case any of these boys are connected to gangs (frequent where I live). I also don’t want to play into red flag laws and eventually get their gun rights stripped for life. I know that they are kids and don’t fully understand the reality that guns are not toys but they are also fully capable of informing themselves on the topic.

25,"I have been dating a guy for a little over a month now (saying that now makes me realize it’s only been a month) but in this time I’ve learned quite a lot about his sleep issues. Every night, he stays up until way early in the morning and basically stays awake until he passes out and then wakes up at some time in the afternoon. I’m hoping to god that his habits will change when school starts, but I can only hope. He has tried sleep masks, night lights, music, rain noises, medication, anything you can imagine. He tells me is not afraid of the dark, but rather the figures he sees in the dark, which he has just now discovered is what many other people see and call “The Hat Man” which we just found out is a really common thing for people with sleep paralysis to see. He has slept over my house multiple times and usually goes to bed extremely late, but once he is asleep he is like a rock and it takes a lot of effort to wake him up. Not too long ago we had a “camp out” (in a back yard) with many other friends and when it was dark out he had told me he saw “the hat man” and he became extremely shaky, his breathing sped up, he started mumbling things, and all he could do was curl up in a ball and lay in the tent. At other points he had also almost cried.

It hurts me a lot to see him like this and I don’t know what I can do for him. He goes through unimaginable things every night while I am soundly asleep.

29,Two days ago I found out someone I knew from my college had passed away. I don’t think I can call him my friend. Acquaintance definitely. We weren’t close. Hadn’t talked in two years. But for some reason it’s really effecting me. I met him my freshman year. I was at a school auction. I was trying to buy tickets off this guy so I could have enough to buy a jewelry bag for this girl. However than the guy who passed away showed up and started trying to out offer me. It turned out he didn’t even have money and was just doing it for the lols. I ended up having to pay extra cash because of him. That year I constantly saw him everywhere on campus. I’d always shit talk him to my friend who was with me during the auction. Then the next year he became my dorm neighbor. The dorm room next to mine. We made small talk everyday. Realized he was a very nice guy. Super distinct personality.  He even went out of his way to help me get alcohol for my friends too. But we weren’t close. I played football with him a couple times but he wasn’t some guy I just went out of my way to hang out with. It was mainly the guy I made small talk with everyday. He was always smiling. Really distinct guy. I had him on Snapchat. He was one of those guys who’d put up a Snapchat story almost daily. I got used to seeing his face everyday even after moving away from college. Why is his death making me feel so weird? I cried for someone I wasn’t close to. I don’t feel like it’s my right to mourn him. I don’t even know why I should be mourning. Maybe a little sad sure but why is am I processing it so weirdly? Life just seems different. It seems dark.

30,"Today i was searching for a book i wanted to give away and i ran into an old old book that was titled ""without family"". Strangely, around the title my name was written in the form (name) ""without family"" (surname), this was on the book cover. Right on the next page there was written 

""To (my name)""
""From: anonymous""

I was kind of shocked when i read that part and i dont know what to think of it ... I suppose this book was gifted to me when i was around 10 to 13 years old.

I am kind of stuck on this thought about that book ... i dont even know what advice could i get for it i just wanted to post it since i dont really want to speak to a member of my family for it. I dont know how to do that. It would just become strange.",02Sep2019,1
31,"I've dated my boyfriend for 5 years and I really think he's the one. We've been through my college degree and he's so loyal to me and I really don't know what I did to deserve him. But our sense of humor is really different and what he finds funny is kind of annoying to me. So when we're together at home and he's comfortable, his comfortable and cute but weird side comes out. In public, he kind of blends in and isn't goofy like that in public. So when we're walking around and doing things together, I can't help but want to be all over him. We hold hands and I want to kiss his cheek in public whereas he finds that embarrassing I guess? We hold hands in the car too and we're cute, but as soon as we get home and he tried to grope me like we goof around, I swat his hand away (but I finding it awesome and daring that he gropes my butt in a target aisle)

Idk if I have a problem or not lol we're in it for the long haul and I don't want to think otherwise because we're in each other's lives so much I wouldn't be myself without him. I've explained to him about this that when we're home I just get really turned off (which I can tell he's getting a little frustrated about our sex lives too).

39,"I don't know how much background information is necessary, and my thoughts are a little disordered, so please bear with me.

My twin brother and I are both teachers, but he has hated every teaching job he has ever had. He just accepted a new job at another low income school, and he hates it so much after just a few days that he's threatening to kill himself. He says he has tried to kill himself twice before, once when he was a minor and now this past week, and that he stopped both times when somebody came in to the house. Nobody has ever SEEN him try it, but he says he has.

He has also complained about being lonely, unfulfilled, and unhappy for years. At the risk of sounding mean, some of this is his own fault. He does not join any clubs or go out where he could make friends. He does not try to make friends at work, and he always comes up with excuses, like ""They're older than me"" (which is silly to me, since neither of my best friends are my age). He goes to work, he visits the gym, and then he goes home and plays video games. His friends in high school and college were all frat boy jerks he ended up falling out with, and frankly, I think he picked those sorts of people because they were ""easy"" and didn't require much work on his part. He has outright admitted he didn't even really like these guys as people. When he'd meet a decent person who could be his friend, he'd find one character flaw to center in on and insist they couldn't be close because of it. (""She's spoiled."" ""He doesn't really like video games."" ""None of them really KNOW me."") He has never had a real girlfriend, just some very weird fuckbuddies. He insists that every hobby he has tried hasn't worked for him, which sounds like ""nothing makes me happy"" (aka clinical depression) to me.

I should also add that a lot of his issues may stem from low self-esteem. He was overweight growing up and was teased for it. In high school, he decided to lose a ton of weight by changing his diet and exercising constantly, and then he became a weight lifter. But he is still really sensitive about his height, his masculinity, all kinds of stuff like that. He is a good looking, intelligent guy with zero confidence.

When he and I had our first part-time teaching jobs out of college and still lived with our parents, he became what I'd call a ""rage addict."" He'd get upset about his bad job, how little he was making, how his position was ""inferior"" to that of other teachers, and he'd go in to frothing rages. I can't describe it any other way. He'd throw things, be mean to us, slam furniture...we all walked around eggshells to avoid setting him off. He was, for lack of a better term, an emotional terrorist. We were relieved when he got his first full-time teaching job out of state; we thought the change in position would make him happy. It didn't. He was lonely all the time, hated everybody he worked with, complained about his workload, and was generally miserable. Now he's taken another teaching job in another state, and he hates it, too.

I have recommended he visit a career counselor and quit teaching for several years, and he kind of went, ""Yeah, yeah, sure,"" and just ignored it. Now he's saying to me, ""Well, I'm going to quit this week. You always told me I should stop being a teacher."" And I'm realizing that every bit of advice I've ever given him might come back to haunt me if he harms himself. Like, I recommended that he speak to the principal first before making any rash decisions; what if he sees that as, ""You told me to stay in this position that made me miserable and I hate my life,"" and then he kills himself?

And if he quits, he'll lose his health insurance. (He has refused to see a therapist for years, but we've persuaded him to consider it this past week.) He might have trouble getting another decent job in any field if he bails on a contract like this. Or he'll just be miserable again, because he hits these setbacks at work and just quits or flies off the handle instead of talking to his boss or coworkers about the issue. I've thought of getting him a job in my town and getting him a place to live out here, but I would just be putting a bandaid on his larger issues. He would still have no friends, he'd still write people off to avoid doing the emotional work of making friends, he'd still be depressed, he'd still hate work, and he'd still get depressed and suicidal every time something went wrong instead of just talking to his boss.

I think we have all coddled him a lot, actually, and this is coming back to haunt us. He'd lose track of important paperwork or not plan things, and then he'd go in to a rage when it caused him problems. For example, he bought a very expensive computer, didn't change his address on his credit account for it, and threw a fit when a late bill came to my parents' house because ""THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO FORWARD MY MAIL!"" (USPS outright states that forwarding is only a temporary service while you get your address switched over on all of your accounts; I used it when I moved.) To avoid him getting in to more debt (he's also shit at handling his finances), I've basically done certain things for him just to make sure they're done, like submitting his loans for an income-based repayment and creating a budget for him. He didn't get his car registration switched back to our home state when he left his last job and he got pulled over, which ""made him so upset and depressed."" But he knew he was coming home for several months. Stuff like that.

I'm sorry. I know I'm not making much sense. I just don't know what to do. I've done a lot of things for him, and I know that babying him like that is wrong, but I still want to help him now. But I feel powerless. I live across the country, so I can't be there for him. And since I've been his only constant friend for most of his life, I feel such a burden. I've sent money, I've called, and I've tried to give him advice, but I just don't know what else I can do. If we have him committed, we could ruin his life, but if we don't, he could kill himself.

I've felt so many things today. I've been sad, frustrated, angry, depressed, and most of all, anxious. Being anxious about him is actually affecting my entire life. He is visiting my parents for Labor Day and they are so anxious, too. We feel trapped. Help.",02Sep2019,1

47,"I moved into my (college campus) apartment last week and I'm pretty sure somethings wrong with our stove. Whenever the heat is turned on, the burners begin smoking, and there's a strong electrical smell. I've tried cleaning off the burners (they're visibly fine, and i wiped them as well), along with raising the heat slowly over the course of probably 10 minutes (friends solution), which worked till about heat level 8, and then it began smoking anyways (the options are low, 1-9, and high)

It's a Kenmore brand gas (?) stove, i'm not sure the model or anything, but it's probably pretty old, just by look and the fact that it's a cheap campus appliance. No idea when the building was built/last updated (I looked briefly online and found nothing), and a friend who lived in the building last year said they had a similar issue, but never did anything because she thought stoves just did that..

Is this an actual issue worth calling maintenance over (almost 100% student employees with minimum training, failed to fix my door last year which was so squeaky it woke roommates, WILL be a huge pain in the ass) or is it fine given that it's an old stove (not sure if this just used to happen).

51,"This past summer, my wife, 3 children and I took a month long vacation to Scotland. My wife and I are teachers and wanted to do something as a family that we would remember forever. We ended up switching houses with a wonderful family in Scotland, who were also teachers, and the trip was amazing. The trip took a lot of planning and we wanted to make sure everything was laid out so we could get the most out of our time. One of the things we really wanted to do to help remember the vacation was to get pictures taken while we were in Edinburgh. Before we left, we got recommendations of photographers from an Edinburgh Facebook group and chose an individual that came highly recommended. After a couple of days into Scotland we met with the photographer for breakfast. We talked about what we were looking for in the shoot. She seemed very receptive and offered a lot of suggestions to help make the pictures he best they could be. We paid her half of the money that day £125 and made plans for a time to meet up for the pictures. That day came and the shoot went wonderful. She took lots of pictures and found some really neat spots to capture the spirit of Edinburgh. When we left her that day, we paid the other half and I asked her when we could expect to receive the images via email. She stated “2 to 3 weeks”. 3 weeks passed and no pictures. We texted her on WhatsApp and she said she had been busy with some other pictures and would be working on them next. We said ok and waited another 2 weeks. After those 2 weeks went by, we texted her a friendly text just asking if they were getting close to being done. No response. Meanwhile my wife and I are starting to fear that we have been duped. We waited another week and texted her again. This time my wife laid out our situation to her. She said that we were very worried about our pictures because she hadn’t responded to our last text. We said that we understood pictures can take a while to be edited the correct way so they turn out nice, but we’re getting very fearful now that she stopped communicating. She contacted us back the next day saying she was sorry and that she understood completely. She said that she would make them a priority to have them done by the end of the week. That was 2 weeks ago. I’m starting to become a little irritated and don’t know really know what do. I don’t want to be that person who is being unreasonable about what she is doing for us but I feel like something just doesn’t seem right. If the worst were to have happened, meaning we aren’t going to be getting any pictures, is there anything  we can do now that we are back in America? We have texting conversations with her agreeing to the price and acknowledging the shoot happened and she was paid. Any advice either way would be wonderful.",02Sep2019,1
52,"Hey Reddit people, I know this issue would probably sound pretty silly or senseless, but it's making me think a lot 

So well, I was chatting with this girl with who we have feelings for each other and had admitted it  and talked about it. Today, we had a kind of hot convo with loads of insinuations, and she asked me if I wanted some nudes, I told her yeah, but we need to see a romantic film together next weekend(some kind of silly deal). She said okay.

For some minutes, I thought she might be joking, because we've always had this kind of jokes between us in which she would send me a pic of a cat she used to send me when I asked her for nudes(while joking).
Them, after 15 minutes I received a pic on Instagram, and well...she did sent me a half nude.  At first I was kinda turned on, but few seconds later I felt guilty, dirty and really mad at me. Nearly all my thoughts were gone, only negative thoughts remained. I just spammed her ""I'm sorry, I am really sorry"" over 4 times. She hasn't replied yet. It has been 2 hours since I told her that, and now I'm cool and fine. I think I was shocked, but I don't really know.

53,"Ok so as a disclaimer, this is not a joke. Ok for context as to why I am suffering from this addiction it is because I have suffered from extreme constipation in recent years to the point where I have had to have bowel surgery to get to faeces removed from my bowel tract. While I was having treatment I developed a severe addiction to Methylcellulose (a certain laxative) only recently I have gotten back into this addiction and it is very painful as when I have not eaten anything I usually end up excreting large amounts of blood and other fluids. Most ask how I could get an addiction to a laxative so I’m going to tell you in a less detailed version. The feeling of your own runny faeces running down your underwear beats any kind of sexual pleasure imaginable. I do not have a wife (I am 57 years old) and I find this as one of the few ways to stimulate myself. I personally believe that the orgasmic feeling as such is worth putting women to one side. However I have come to realise that this addiction does not have any health benefits as I have come to lose 30kg in the past month. Any help from those who know how to deal with an addiction? Also I have no clean underwear or jeans as they have all been soiled by my faeces. My toilet has been rendered useless so I have a rather crude hole situated where my toilet would have been. A cess pool worth of months of my excrement has formed under my house.

As a side note I have also have had run ins with the police because my addiction has taken ahold of my morals and forced me to defacate in public in the view of women and children. I regret this to the point where I have decided to take action against this and I now have locked myself indoors.",02Sep2019,1

Well one thing led to another on our second date and we hooked up, best sex I've ever had and we agreed after that we should maybe just keep it sexual which I was fine with....until this past week.
He asked me over for a booty call so I drove over and we ended up staying up playing until we were exhausted and he told me I could stay over instead of driving home tired, he cuddled me,  would grab for me in bed and call me ""baby"" he asked about my friends and family and asked if he would ever meet my friends, asked me if I he could teach me how to fish, and other things I would ""need to know"" about him (like his favorite movies, stuff he likes doing, things he would want to cook for me and such) then before I left in the morning he got me coffee and fed me and kept grabbing me for hugs and asked me to text him i got home safe...

Well, they have a neighbor who for the past year has been non stop harassing them and every other tenant in the complex. 

She does crack, abuses her kid, has keyed my boyfriends car and his cousins car, stolen our mail, called the cops on me for *looking* at a raccoon in her yard etc. One of her dealers was talking to her in the living room (she had her door open so we could hear) and he said how he wants to ""come over there right now and beat the shit out of him"" (my boyfriend). She's an absolute psychopath, we even have these things ON CAMERA. She has been arrested multiple times and yet our landlord will not kick her out. Living here with her as a neighbor is impossible. She also frequently has loud sex with drug dealers in her living room with her WINDOWS OPEN with NO CURTAINS, she constantly is banging around (she's severely over weight so idk if that's why?) and is constantly starting issues. We've been told time and time again that he's going to evict her by x day and then that day comes and she's still here. 

I'm not on the lease yet, but my boyfriend wants out of it so him and I can get our own place. Would he be able to use this against the landlord in court?

It got to the point where I woke everyone else up, despite all of us feeling like shit to figure out what were supposed to do, if he should just sleep it off or if we do something, it got to the point where we took him to the hospital
Though I'm not sure how hes currently doing and despite the fact that I cant completely control how much hes having, this happened in my house and I feel horrible about it
As far as I'm concerned his parents do not intend to press charges and because it's a first offence my sister wont get fined
But the big thing right now is should I tell my mom about this, all I've said is that he ate something bad and got really sick, but should I tell her the truth, I hate to lie to her but I don't know if it's a good idea to tell the truth, on the one hand she probably has been in this situation and could maybe give advice, but I don't want to get into a ton of trouble

62,"Before I begin, let me just provide definitions of these two conditions:

1. Fear of abandonment - the fear that someone you're interested in may not be as interested in you, prompting you to jump the gun and ask for a relationship from the get-go to ""cut your losses.""

2. Fear of engulfment - the fear that one might lose their indidivuality, freedom, and autonomy when one commits to a relationship.

With that out of the way, let me get into the details. 

---

Tl;Dr: I have a tendency of accelerating budding relationships just so I know that the other person is interested but then pull back because I feel trapped. Halp. 

---

It's gonna be quite a long one, so bear with me.

This potentially began (because I can't quite place a concrete finger on the beginning) when I liked a girl way back in high school who was already emotionally occupied. She was my dream girl, to say the least. Physically gorgeous, incredibly smart, pretty funny, and had a great smile. Also super mysterious, which really drew me in. The thing, though, was that I realised at the six-month mark of being friends that she was actively seeing this other guy. I decided I wouldn't interfere and/or destroy their happiness. This really left a scar in me; I really wanted to be able to work out something with her. But alas, I never could. 

Fast forward a year was when the first fear (abandonment) made it's first appearance. I was with my best friend at the time. The relationship was magical. She, was magical. Dating her felt like a fantasy, for the most part. But there came a moment when another guy came into the picture. She told me he was her best friend, and that we had nothing to worry about. I could tell his intentions were impure. Nevertheless, I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. This, however, never quieted the lingering sense of fear in me that she might abandon me for him one day. 

We talked about it a few times more since, with her constantly assuring me and me fluctuating between ""okay, I trust you"" and ""I'm really not comfortable with him in the picture."" And it's potentially because of this that I started speeding up the relationship. We started getting more physical, turning the relationship into something I no longer recognised. 

Dating after I broke up with this girl goes along the lines of something like this: I'll meet a girl I think is really cute, we'll talk a bunch at the very beginning of things, and the moment I feel like she's ""losing interest"", I'll try to speed things up; to jam a foot in the door. And then I'll recoil because it feels like I'm getting myself into something that I might not want (fear of engulfment). 

Has anyone here also gone through this? Have you gone over it? How did you go through it? I really want to help myself overcome this and would appreciate any/all help.",02Sep2019,1

Whenever he wakes up he is always in a horrible mood, he woke up 20 minutes and he was beating his step-grandson for playing in the tub because he gets water on the floor and his grandson is 5 and he pooped himself because he was beating him that hard. Just a few nights ago, I was doing homework and i was using my phone to do it and also listening to music, and he said i can't use my phone to do my homework, im in 10th grade so i use it for online calculators and to search up definitions, and so he took it and he told me to come eat, and when i tried to explain to him that i needed it for homework he got in my face and started yelling at me, and i was just looking at him normally and he said to stop looking at him like that, and he told me to get my food and when i was getting it he said that he will punch me in my nose. When he was beating my nephew(his stepgrandson) my stepmom tried to get him to stop, and he said get out of the house and take him too, and when she told him no, he pushed her against the wall and i could hear her screaming to let her go, and i guess whenever she was finally let out he smacked on the back of her head, i texted my grandmother and told her the story, and i wanted to post here so I can get a idea of what to do about it.

72,"Mid 20s guy, no real luck with dating. I know people in long lasting relationships, marriages, have had sex, etc. and I have only gotten to dates and making out with some women over the years.

I am pretty jealous of how great others have it but I give up on trying anymore. I am happy for my friends and everyone who found someone or got to have fun in their lives. Clearly I am doing something wrong and I don't think any woman can really make up for what I have been through, missed out on, or be what I want. All I have been doing is going to work and trying to study on my time I am not at work and sleeping. My friends are living their own lives with their relationships so I am on my own and usually just stay in bed when I am not at work.

I am going to go to therapy but as for dating I really do not want to try anymore. I really do not want to hear about cliche phrases that I have heard so many times and after every failed situation. I am considering deleting all my social media as well so I am not reminded as much about women. I am looking for a way to be positive and happy in my life through other avenues.

He had shown obvious signs of being attracted to me but he said that since I'm straight "" I’m not gonna like chase after you with my dick in my hand because you’re straight "".  I overlooked the signs and thought maybe we could be friends because he was treating me like a friend other than that. Now I just feel really grossed out over the whole situation. I thought we could be friends because he seemed like a nice guy who was lonely. I really just don't know what to do about this whole situation and would like advice.

76,"Hey Reddit. First off please forgive any formatting issues, I’m on mobile.

I’ve been working at this shitty office job processing insurance policies for the last 3 years. It’s constantly busy (as in we are constantly smashed and behind on workloads just about every day), the targets we’re set are ridiculous and the management refuses to hire more staff to cope despite the fact we’re constantly snowed under. Most of the team I’m in is part time, while the other one (does the same job as us, same skills and training etc) is all full time people. They refuse to shuffle it around so there’s an equal mix of full and part timers on the teams. This environment is just unsustainable. They want productivity and shit processed, yet you get reprimanded for getting a single bit of the complex processes wrong. It’s ridiculous. The work is boring, repetitive, and difficult. My boss dumps more and more work on me because I’m “capable”, while the other idiots on the team sit around with their thumb up their asses barely doing any work, or making excuses. It never ends. 

I honestly cry when I wake up each morning, knowing I have to go to this terrible job. I’d honestly rather get hit by a bus or something instead of have to go in. But, I can’t quit. My partner is constantly in and out of jobs (can’t seem to keep one, it’s caused a lot of issues in our relationship), so we’d be absolutely screwed if I quit. On top of this, I’m also studying full time (online), so I have that to worry about as well.

I don’t know what to do. I feel helpless. I want to quit so badly. I’m stressed, burned out beyond belief (the week I took this year of leave didn’t help, it only made it worse), and it’s worsened my depression and overall mental health so badly. I know I should probably just suck it up, there are so many people who have it worse... I just don’t know what to do anymore. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What did you do to get through it?",02Sep2019,1
77,"So, I just began my junior year at university. Before that though, my friend Steve and I were having discussions over the phone about plans for our upcoming college year, and all the fun we'd have together. Then, he mentions that a friend of his from his high school would be attending our college, and that she would also live in our dorm. I was excited to meet this person because he was a friend of my friend, so I figured I would make her feel welcome on the campus. Eventually, I arrived at campus ready to see her (Steve at this point had already told her I'd be going out of my way to meet and greet her). She was very outgoing and such a delight to be around. 

I didn't immediately start to grow feelings for her, and back then I was set on her at least being only a good friend of mine who I'd show around the campus. Over time though, the feelings REALLY started to overtake me. Now, however, I'm at the point where I don't know if I should wait (and how long), if I should abandon ship, or just go for it right now and tell her how I feel (having only known her for about a week this goes against EVERYTHING I've been taught growing up as a child). 

Now that you guys basically know my backstory on this girl, I'd like to point out all of the things I've noticed throughout the week that to me seem like pretty good signs.

* She most of the time looks at me whether in a group or one on one.
* I am already one of the few friends she has on the campus that she's told a good portion of her darker stories and secrets to.
* She really likes drawing, and I just got into it, so eventually she asked me if I wanted her to help me learn to draw a bit better. This is an activity she has stated that she has NEVER done with ANYONE else, or even taught anyone else how she does it. 
* She is an absolute fan of torturing me in several ways like: bean dipping me (scooping my tits and slapping them basically), blatantly sitting on my chest when I was lying down on a sofa, using her ass to prevent me from playing piano in the common area, fiddling with my guitar while I jam out on it, stabbing me with a pencil while playing around, lightly kicking me, lightly battering my head with her water bottle (which funny enough was in the pitch of E when smacked off anything), you know...the usual stuff...
* She has flat out told me in a conversation with me and one other guy that I have a ""nice chunky ass"", literally five minutes after I had explained a story where I had never really been complimented, except by some random girl who did culinary work while I was working in a stadium on seats.
* Pretty much laughs at everything dumb, stupid, funny, silly, absurd that I have to say, whether it be me really trying to be funny, or me just being an absolute jagoff. 
* She actually listened to my advice, instead of just intervening with it as she had done with other people.
* She and I always have plans together (like this Wednesday we're going to this church thing, and the next weekend I'm having her play Undertale on my PS4). 
* She sometimes mocks me.
* She is always slightly happier than normal when I'm there in person.
* When I leave her presence earlier than expected for whatever reason, she gets silent and seemingly disappointed. 
* When she stands next to me, she is most of the time practically invading my personal space (which I never minded with her). 

Rambling off the top of my head, those are the major points that I remember noticing. Now, before you jump down to the comments and tell me your opinion, please read the rest of this post, because there is one possibly major oof that I need to discuss, these two guys who I will call Gary and Genie.

Gary pretty much doesn't have much of a chance from what I've gathered, and doesn't realize it (which hurts my poor soul with him kinda being my little). 

Genie, however, seems to have way more of a chance than Gary does. Like me, Genie had some advice of his own for her sad times that has personally affected her because like mine, it was different. A mutual friend of mine and this girl has told me that she said she liked Genie, but we are both unsure of the validity of that because she has only known ALL of us for a week or less. She also doesn't seem to talk with him as much as me, or make as many plans with him. This girl has also told me before that he told her that he liked her, yet nothing at this point in time has been done about it from either party. If she really did like him, I feel like she would've at least discussed with him the possibility of becoming a thing down the line...right? He made the move, and yet she hasn't acted on it. So while it is something to definitely keep in mind, it isn't a doomsday tell that I have 0 chance with her. 

That is everything I have to tell about this girl at this present moment. Who knows what'll happen in the matter of a week, a month, a semester, a year. Maybe I won't feel for her anymore? Maybe I'll feel more for her? Maybe Genie will be eliminated from the equation? Maybe she'll somehow choose Gary? I don't know, but I am aware that what is happening in the present may not necessarily be what will continue to happen in the future, a lot can change. Maybe for the better. Maybe for worse. 

My question to you guys here who've decided to read my essay long article on this girl from my university, is...what the hell should I do right now?

85,"First of all, i want to clarify that english is not my first language so i'm sorry for any typos or grammar mistakes.

Some background to our friendship:

This is all online. She lives in the US, i live in colombia. I'm currently 21, she's 19. We dated when we first met, 4 years ago, she liked me for a while and I didn't notice until she confessed, so I asked her out, we didn't date for long because we both messed up badly, and hurt each other a lot. After the breakup we didn't talk for a year, until we reconnected and apologized for what we did. However, things didn't work out, and we stopped talking after a month, we did the same thing for 3 years, (not talk for months, then reconnect, talk for a few months, fight, stop talking, and then the cycle repeats itself). We have similar personalities when it comes to stuff like having little patience, getting easily offended, wanting to be right all the time, and other stuff that can create conflict easily, but completely different personalities when it comes to relationships with other people. I'm the emotional type, I like when people show they care, and she doesn't like showing emotions, so, that caused more fights between us.

Thing is, this year, we talked for the longest time since we dated. This time our friendship lasted 6 months, and when we fought and decided it was time for a break, we ended things in good terms, which had never happened before. So I thought things were finally getting better. But she kept on texting me even though we were supposed to be on a break, and I liked that, we even pointed it out a lot when we called and played, cause it was funny how we were supposed to be on a break, yet we were still calling daily for 6+ hours like we used to before we took the break.

I'm still attracted to her. She's funny, she has a great personality, she's clumsy, I love being around her (when we don't fight), she's attractive, and she has a great physique. Sometimes when we call and play multiplayer games together, guys hit on her, and I get jealous. She says she doesn't notice they're hitting on her, but I'm sure she's bullshitting me cause she likes attention, she loves it. (I have difficulty trusting her because she's a compulsive liar, and she's lied to me a couple times) So when they hit on her, she starts giving them attention, and starts ignoring me if we're in a game, which upsets me and when I'm upset, I just go quiet. Then she asks why I'm not talking, I tell her there's not a specific reason, she gets mad, and we fight.

A few weeks ago, we were texting and she asked me what was wrong, cause she noticed I was kind of sad. I told her what was bothering me, cause she gets mad at me if I'm sad or upset and I don't tell her what's wrong when she asks. So I told her, and apparently it was too much for her, because she asked her mom for advice (she trusts her mom with everything, She literally tells her everything) so her mom told her to tell me that ''neither she or her daughter are my fucking therapists'' and that ''I should stop stressing her daughter with my bullshit cause she doesn't need that kind of negativity in her life''. So I got pretty offended, as expected, and flipped out on her, because as soon as she told me what her mom told her to tell me, she completely backed off, and acted distant as hell, l didn't know what the hell was going on because she was the one who always asked, and now she was acting super distant like my problems were too much for her. She said she felt like I only used her to vent, which is a lie, because me venting to her is only about 5% of all we do, we watch anime, we call (usually for more than 4 hours), we watch movies, we play games, we videocall, we stay up calling till the next day, and I rarely vent to her, I only do it when she asks me to, because if I didn't tell her, she would get mad at me.

So we fought for about 3 days, we barely talked, and we didn't know what we were supposed to do, so we decided that we would take another break, and talk again in October. She said she wanted to get better together, and be good friends because 'no one knows her like I do', and I feel the same way about it. No one has ever known me the way she does, we have been through so much together, we do (or, used to do) so much stuff together that now that she's gone, I feel empty, even if it's supposed to be just a break. I feel lonely and empty because now I play alone, watch anime alone, watch movies alone, don't have anyone to call with, and if I do call with new people I meet, the conversation dies quickly, because we don't know each other and I'm not very talkative, but when I called with her, she did know how to keep conversations going.

Now, the thing is, now that she's gone, yes, I feel empty, I feel lonely a lot. But at the same time, I feel way more emotionally stable, I don't fight with anyone, I'm not constantly getting jealous, I'm barely on social media, I'm at peace pretty much. Lonely, but at peace. So I really don't know what to do, I don't like blaming people or pointing the blame, but even though I'm aware that sometimes I start fights, I'm also sure that most of the fights are started because of her, because of her complete, 200% lack of empathy, her compulsive lies, her changing her mind a lot, and her hypocrisy.

We said we would talk again on October, but I'm not sure about what I should do. I don't want to go back to constantly stressing, worrying and fighting about stupid stuff, and at the same time, I don't want to end my friendship with the person that knows me the most, and that has spent the most time with me. I don't know if I should either just ghost her, message her telling her I don't want to be friends anymore, or message her and tell her about how I feel and see how we can fix things. I don't know if change is possible, I really don't. She said she wants to change, I said I wanted to change,  too, we've said we would change so many times, but she keeps on doing the same things, and because of those things, I react badly, and that just leads to fights.

I'm still with her because in 4 years, i haven't found anyone who is willing to spend as much time with me, someone i have so much in common with, and someone i get along so easily with. I'm an introvert so it's hard for me to find people like her. I haven't found a single person i'm comfortable around the way i am with her.

I don't want to end things with my closest friend, because i really appreciate it, but i know it's not good for me, and i don't want to feel like shit and struggle anymore because of the stuff she does.",02Sep2019,1
86,"My dad (59) and mother (57) are married, and I am their only daughter (19). I think my father might be involved in an affair of some sort, but I’m not totally sure on how to handle it, or if it’s even a big deal in the first place. I’m posting this on mobile, so sorry if there are any formatting goofs.

For some background, for the past 5 years or so my dad has been getting more and more weirdly obsessed with politics (the whole right-wing gun-slingin’ stereotypical type stuff). When actual guns (along with other strange items and weapons) started shipping to our house, I realized there might be a problem. The internet fueled his unhealthy habit, so this is about the time I started discretely checking in on his browser history &amp; phone. 

I would basically check in to make sure he wasn’t going into dangerous territory, or ordering things we wouldn’t be able to afford or use (like heavy weaponry lmao). In the past 3 years I started noticing weird dm’s on his Instagram or Twitter. He would say strange, almost borderline sexual things in tweets to people. I would find him following these sexy-female accounts. Considering his social media was public, I choose to keep an eye on the weird sexy stuff for his own sake. 

Then, after hearing about the Ashley-Madison dating site news (the dating site where you can have an affair), I decided to see if he had an account. His account login automatically filled in on the site. I deleted the account and had a little mental breakdown. I had been getting more and more concerned and depressed about my dads internet driven obsession, and this on top of it was too much.

He talks way too much about his female coworkers, and even text with one of them. I’m trying not be be paranoid, but when my mom thought it was weird, I started to think it was really strange too, especially because they are all young “pretty” woman. Idk, this part sounds kinda stupid, but it just has a fishy vibe to it.

Today I took his phone to look something up. He tried to keep me from grabbing it in a defensive way, which made me immediately suspicious. In the lock screen was an Instagram dm from some lady saying “sweet dreams 💋 I won’t touch myself lol”. I made him unlock his phone and quickly scrolled through. I took a pretty useless screenshot and sent it to my phone. He was chatting with her for a long time it seemed. It look weirdly sexual and it looked like they were exchanging info, but I had to be really quick and discrete so he would catch on so I couldn’t see too much. I’m pretty sure this isn’t the only dm’s of this sort he doing.

Mom doesn’t know. I think she would be broken if I told her. I’m scared to do anything because my dad will play dumb and come up with a stupid excuse, and he is the “man of the house” so I don’t want my tuition being cut off (or my phone or something like that) for exposing his jig. This hurts me because I feel weirdly disconnected from my dad as it is and this makes me see him in such a grosser light. I don’t know if I should blackmail him, confront him, or ignore the whole thing. I’m pretty confused and upset. What should I do? 

Sorry for all the stupid backstory, basically (TLDR: sexy dm on dad’s phone, affair website, &amp; confused daughter)",02Sep2019,1

88,"Hello Reddit,

I am a 17-year-old American guy living in South America and I graduate in 96 days. Almost 1 year ago now I met a girl in a small beach town in Massachusetts during my winter break, she lived close to my house there and we hit it off immediately and we kissed that same week. We decided to stay friends with the occasional flirting, we facetime frequently and text all the time. She says she misses me a lot and would like me to go see her. Unfortunately this year our schedules didn't line up and we both went to that same town but during different months. 

Over the course of this year, I've gotten to know her and I miss her a lot. Since I start college next September (In the US) and will be moving there this December, I was looking at tickets to go see her for her birthday in January and it was surprisingly cheap. She has expressed that she'd like me to go, even offering her place for me to stay at. In addition, we're both applying to the same colleges in Massachusetts as well as planning on spending the whole summer in that small town next summer.

I was wondering if it would be a good idea to book a flight to go see her for a week in January for her birthday, I also plan on asking her to be my girlfriend because she's gonna fly out to MA for spring break and move there in June. I really like her and I've given it a lot of thought, so far my friends have been slightly skeptical but support me and think I should go. Even though we'll see each other relatively soon I feel like I don't wanna wait that long, I'm afraid I'll regret not doing it since it would be pretty cheap and not for a short visit. Any and all advice is appreciated

TL;DR I'm in love with a girl and she has expressed similar feelings. The trip would be cheap and I believe it would be worth it, should I fly out to Colorado for this girl?",02Sep2019,1
89,"Some background info:
She is 7, almost 8 years old. Her mother and I aren together but we have 50/50 custody and coparent pretty well. 

She told me she doesn’t like coming to my house and doesn’t want to anymore.

Lately, she’s been getting into a lot of trouble at home and at school. At school she is yelling, stealing from others and just overall being a bully. At home she ignores adults (myself and her mother), gives us dirt looks, talks back and does things she isn’t supposed to. I’ve tried a lot of different things to figure out what’s going on and to fix things but nothing has really worked. It’s gotten to the point where I ended up taking her TV away and she can either play with her toys or read. I think that coupled with having chores, (sweeping the kitchen and vacuuming or wiping down her bathroom) is why she doesn’t want to come to my house. Her mom doesn’t make her do chores that often and that her punishments for the things she has been doing aren’t as severe. I just didn’t think she hated my house so much.

I’m not sure what to do. I’m a young, single father. I love her to death and I’ve done everything I can to raise her right. Am I doing something wrong? Should I just let her stay with her mom or should I continue making her come to my house? I just need some advice or something because it’s breaking my heart.",02Sep2019,2

•people talk over me continuously (it's the norm now), even if they listen I still have to ask like 5 times to get an answer back when I am in a group, should I be pissed ?

•i know I am a loner, but I try very hard not be..my actions mostly come out as forced, so is it justified to be pissed for point 1 ?

92,I grew up with my grandparents raising me. They are my parents basically. My grandma just recently in March died of cancer and it has been very hard on my family and me. My grandpa was my bestfriend growing up but now we have strayed. He has become hard to talk to and I’m very emotionally abusive towards me and my family. And refuses to believe we are upset about her passing and only he is grieving not all of us. Recently it’s gotten worse he talks about dying and death all the time and even told my 6 year old cousin he is going to “pass away in the next few months.” Which is not what you should be telling a small child who is still sad about his nana. I tried to speak to him and was very gentle and he told me that he doesn’t care about anyone else but himself and He will never be the same with me and he doesn’t really care for me anymore.

94,"So just some context:
I'm 19 and have just started university. I'm currently in my 8th week. I decided to start uni in semester 2 so that I could have 6 months between ending high school and starting uni to work and make some money. 
The 6 months that I was out of high school and working full time in multiple jobs were the busiest but best 6 months of my life. I had a proper income and loved working, I worked in a bar, I taught in a school, directed a school play and found a job in government health promotion. Similarly I also did a lot of work with LGBT youth and health services and found it rewarding and interesting and something I very much wanted to pursue. 
I've now starting uni and I'm studying secondary teaching and have been forced to quit all these jobs and now work part time as a tutor. I've always known I've had a passion for working with young people but I'm hating my degree. I feel trapped and lost like I did when studying in high school. The reason I chose to study secondary teaching is because I've always been passionate about improving the lives of young people but I'm becoming more and more aware of interesting and valuable ways of doing this that better suit me.

So here's my dilema:
I can't decide if I've legitimately found that I want to pursue a career in the health and wellbeing of LGBT youth OR if now that I'm in uni and the reality of studying and being a student again is boring me so much that I'm searching for an excuse as to get out. 

I don't want to disappoint my parents or be laughed at by friends. I fear regrets and honestly don't know what to do. 

Any advice would be much appreciated.",02Sep2019,1

98,"A little background here. I’m a 16yo female, 5’. My cousin is a 14yo male, around 5’10. I am made fun of for my height often and it gets to me because you know, no one likes a short girl who is the size of a child, and it gives me a lot of disadvantages in life. No one takes me serious. 

Anyways, my cousin and I went to my grandpas house to go swimming. As soon as we got there, my cousin saw my grandpa and said something along the lines of “hey papaw watch this! (Gets behind me and puts his hand on my head to display how short I am) lololol look how SHORT she is! I’m like 2 feet taller than her!” I was sick of it but trying to remain tolerant. I playfully flung my hand back to tap him on the head because we’re like that, but I noticed I hit a little harder than I meant to (but still not that hard) so I turned around to tell him “omg I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to hit that hard” but before I could get through the first part of my sentence he punched me, in the eye. 

I got knocked back and my hands were holding my eye. I thought for sure I was going to have a black eye. 

When I took my hands of my face and saw him, I yelled “FOR FUCKS SAKE!” While lunging at him and beating the shit out of him, slapping and punching him in a fit of rage that lasted about 5 seconds. I don’t know exactly what I was doing because it was in a flash and out of impulse but I know I’m not very good at hitting at all, so I’m sure I wasn’t hurting him (especially since he kept blocking). 

My aunt had to take me off of him and I just burst into tears and went back to the car. Surprisingly they were mad at him and not me, because he hit a girl. 

I think I exploded like this because I’m so tired of constantly enduring the abuse that goes on in my daily life, and then everyone making fun of me (and my height) to go along with it. But I have never even yelled at someone, let alone cussed at them, or beat the shit out of them.

100,"Hey Reddit, 
sorry this will be long! maybe someone can give some insight on my creepy a** behavior. It’s ridiculous to me that i can’t stop checking on a guy. We met online around 2015, he’s from Canada and im from Europe. Both in our mid twenties now. I wasn’t thinking anything that time since he’s so far away,  but we kept talking through the year,  became friends and at some point we both were into each other, or at least into the versions we had of each other. I thought im someone who’s convinced that you can’t develop feelings for someone you haven’t even met. But it clicked, what can i say im weak for a nice tall canadian guy haha we video chatted and were in touch as much as we could, thinking about meeting up and how and whatnot, but no clear plan/ the funds nor time as we were both still in Uni and working. 

Anyway at some point we stopped it because it felt unrealistic and like going nowhere, so we went no contact for a while to move on and i deleted him because it hurted. After some time i contacted him again though, with no intentions other than friendship and seeing how he’s doing. I really missed talking to him. we were immediately back at where we left it as if no time passed, but i figured he’s in a relationship and im genuinely happy for him. We kept talking a lot for quite the time but he hid that from her. It was all just friendly though. Long story short, she figured it out, he deleted me and we haven’t spoken since. Anyway thats some time ago, im in a happy relationship myself for quite the time now too. But, in phases i think about this guy, not romantically but im just thinking about him a lot when it comes to it. I started checking his social media again, and since hes not even that active anymore (or private) really my stupid self goes and stalks his gf just to see something. I feel ridiculous and weird for this, it really comes and goes - but when it does - its obsessively. It isn’t normal, in a total it has been almost 3 years now. Funnily enough, i haven’t checked on him once back then, also not when i knew he had a gf. It came way later and i just don’t know why. I just know im annoyed that i can’t stop myself doing it, it’s so ridiculous to me. I hate and love the internet",02Sep2019,0

On my last night shift training i get a sarcastic text from one of those friends. I replied that night. The morning after, i went home after my night shift and posted a story. Friend replied in a lengthy message about me not being a good friend for not updating them. I get that. I had told them before I left that I wanted to tell them things in person cause there’s a lot I’d want to tell them. But friend just kept going and belittled and judged me for making decisions that didn’t involve her. Friend dissed my partner for thinking he’s not good for me and changing me. Friend contradicted herself by saying that friends can go on without talking for a while but not years. It has been LESS than 2 weeks. I needed time to process everything.

I will refer to myself as Nicole.

I was training a new worker (I'll refer to him as Ron) who came in on how to make a drink. I had been working there throughout the summer so I know how to make most of the drinks. Or so I thought. My boss (who I shall refer to as ""Amanda"") saw me making it completely wrong apparently, and she started speaking in her native language to the newcomer who also speaks the same language, stepped in and helped him finish making the drink. After she was gone, Ron (who is also the brother of one of my close friends) told me in shock that Amanda was so mean. She said something along the lines of ""Nicole is doing it wrong and she is one of the terrible workers. Don't learn from her. You can learn from anyone else but her."" 

This actually hurts. She could've told me what I was doing wrong instead of bitching out about it to him. She barely comes into the store to see how I do. I know that I am not a terrible worker in any means as she says. I follow the recipes, clean, etc of all the tasks. I just made a few mistakes that anyone could've made. I get that I may not be the best, but why would she exaggerate my abilities and make me look bad to someone else?

I hate confrontation and I don't know if it is necessary to speak up about this to her. I overall love the people I work with and making drinks here is actually fun. I also need to pay for my gas money, college tuition and books, and just general everyday life stuff. I'd like to keep working until I find a paid internship in my college major.

111,"A bit of background: I (24F) have had a chronic illness since I was 16, had missed most of my junior year of high school and was on homebound schooling for the rest of the year and most of that summer. With medication and chemo, my illness can reach remission, but I had bad flare-ups at least once a year.

Last year I was almost homeless and an acquaintance reached out to me and said that I could move in with her. Now we had come to an agreement that I would use what meager savings I had to pay the bills until we could both find jobs. Nothing was agreed upon for chores, but she was willing to do the dishes when I asked and I would do clean the rest of the house except for her room.

I quickly found a full-time job above minimum wage and was more than willing to pay all the bills until my roommate could get a job of her own. I would ask her constantly to clean when I was at work so that I wouldn’t have to clean when I would get home as I worked 4:30 a.m. until 1 p.m. or later, on my feet all day, and I didn’t want to come home and have to do anymore work. She would not clean and I would get home every day and have to do everything myself as I can’t stand living in a dirty house.

As time went on, my roommate contributed less to the house and started making decisions without asking me or even informing me of what was going on. She moved her sister into the house and her sister has taken over the living. My roommate has also moved her boyfriend in without my consent. With so many people living here I don’t think it's too much to ask for the house to be clean while I’m the ONLY person working.

Eventually, I had to stop working because my chronic illness had flared-up and other problems have shown themselves and I’ve been to and from doctors several times a week. Yet, no one in the house is working and I’m trying my hardest to clean after 3 grown adults who I have seen do nothing but sit in a chair or lie in bed playing video games. I have asked about how job searching is going several times, but I have gotten the feeling that no one in the house is even bothering to look. They pay the bills by borrowing or asking for money or doing small odd jobs like dog sitting. No amount of asking them to clean will get them to move. Sometimes they’ll agree to clean or do something but never do.

To give a few examples of how lazy and unsanitary my roommates are: they have two cats but don't clean the litter box out frequently enough and the cats then poop out of the box. I have seen poop sitting literally 3 feet away from my roommates as they ignore it and play video games. The poop piles up and I am forced to clean it because of the smell. They leave dirty clothes, including underwear all over and the animal get into. I refuse to touch their clothes or get their undergarments from the cats because of how dirty the clothes are. They leave dirty dishes in their rooms and they grow mold and such a strong smell that I have thrown up a few times.

I have refused to clean up anything unless it's mine. 

One of my roommates ‘confronted’ me today about my current behavior and how I should contribute more to the house and cleaning. I honestly didn’t know how to respond to that so I just walked away before I started yelling at her and saying or doing something I regret. But it stuck in my head so I decided to write this and ask for advice.

I’m trying to get my own place or move in with people I know very well, but it's slow going as I’m more worried about getting better and have no money. I honestly just need advice on what I should do or how to deal with my roommates until I can get out of here.",02Sep2019,1
112,"So I'm 19 and a freshman at my University. I moved here about a month and a half ago and my wallet is drained. I am working on paying off my laptop as soon as I can and in October I will get $1600 reimbursed back to me. The bad thing is that this is only going to be spent paying off my textbooks and November's rent.

I actually have a fairly cheap place compared to my peer's, well besides the people at the dorms. For athletics I play basketball and I practice all the time, usually 3-4 hours all 7 days a week. Plus I lift weights 4 times a week. With how much I'm exercising, I need to eat a lot of good quality food. I made a meal plan, but that (on top of rent and other bills) leaves me just $200 a month extra.

Now $200 is a lot, as I am not going to be spending it, but saving it. My problem is that when I play basketball at the college, I won't be able to keep my full-time job. This will prevent me from being able to pay for much of anything. Right now I'm technically ""fine"", but when I make the team there are going to be plenty of problems. I can't save up enough by that time if I'm only left with $200 extra. I do plan to work a lot of overtime next summer, but I still worry that it won't be enough. What should I do?

TL:DR: I'm new to university and I won't have enough money saved up to actually play college sports when I get the chance. What should I do?",02Sep2019,1

118,"Im going to try to summarize this as much as possible...

This new job I'm in the hiring process for asked me for a reference from my current job. I decided to ask my manager because she and I are on good terms and I work with her most often. She said yes of course she could be my reference and gave me her information. I go home and fill out all the paper work and then submit it (it's for a government job so it's all very official and lots of paper work to fill out with reference information, criminal record check). Done, perfect! 

About an hour later, she texts to say she doesnt feel comfortable being my reference because she feels like it's ""going behind our owners back"" and that she ""wouldnt be happy if she found out she gave a reference"". Btw, the toxic owner is the main reason I'm leaving the job, she rules with fear and is not a nice person.

I tried my best to reassure her that everything is confidential and that I've even signed forms that say they cant contact my current employer or the business without my direct permission. Assured her it's pretty standard to give a reference as my manager and not abnormal in a workplace, and that she isn't doing anything wrong. After a bit of back and forth she agreed to keep her word since everything was submitted and i thought it might look bad to pull back a reference now, since I'd have to contact their HR?

The worry and anxiety over it ruined my day yesterday and I'm fear something else is going to happen, that she will be weird to me when I see her at work until I resign, or that she will tell our boss I'm looking for a new job (then I'd likely get fired).Fingers crossed that everything goes through and for the official offer so I can give my resignation officially ASAP. 

What should I do here? I dont feel like I did anything wrong asking her for a reference and I dont really think it's going behind our bosses back? For perspective it's a small company, 10 employees that work in close proximity but our boss is rarely around- pops in maybe once a day but we dont generally see her because we are with clients. She talks down to us a lot and often says things like if you dont like how I do things here then get out. Cares only that we are there to make her money not about our mental or physical health.

119,"So I’m not sure why I’m writing this. I think I feel really desperate for encouragement. Here’s some background about the situation: my boyfriend and I were together for 3 years. We lived together for a while. Everything about our relationship was magical and he was absolutely amazing to me until about two years into it. I became severely depressed and anxious about my life and he was having problems with his job and we were both just giant stress balls. We kind of took our stress and anger out on each other and didn’t really try to make each other happy anymore. At that time we were living together, so I decided to move out and get my own place. We were still together after I moved out but things felt different, like we took a step backwards in our relationship. I felt like I needed a bigger change and although I was in love with him, I thought maybe if I left him I would journey on this road to self discovery and become happier. That is actually the opposite of what has happened. First of all I absolutely destroyed him when I broke up with him and I tried to explain myself to him but I think it just made me sound like a selfish piece of shit. I don’t know how I justified any of it. Second of all my life has actually gotten worse since leaving him. I’m so bored and lonely and although I do have this new sense of independence, I feel like there’s a massive hole in my heart. He hates me so much now and won’t even talk to me. I’ve begged him to talk to me but he’s threatened to block me. I love him so much and I don’t think I’ll ever move on from my stupid mistake. How do cope with this?",02Sep2019,2

My family and I recently obtained and amazing Belgian Malinois (2, male). He’s absolutely great and fits my family’s very active lifestyle. His name is R.

However, for the past 4 years we’ve had a (labeled as a Maltipoo, but more so resembles a terrier) a 7 year old female. She’s a rescue and has gotten very comfortable with us as a family, We’ve had her since she was around 2.5 yrs. Her name is Lola.

Now onto the issue;

When we initially brought R home, we had him meet Lola on neutral ground, such as a park. Obviously due to the male/female nature of things, this did not go well. However, R is no longer antagonizing her like that anymore. He knows what not to do around her and has adapted very well. However Lola is totally ultra defensive of not only my family and I, but of territory as well. She has also deliberately gone out of her way to sneak up and attack R whilst he is not doing anything wrong.

Unfortunately, we made the mistake early on with Lola not to socialize her, with obviously has come to bite us in the back. Basically if Lola doesn’t calm down, my family will be attempting to rehome her. I really do not want this as Lola and I are the most attached out of the whole family.

125,"Disclaimer: I have nothing against gay people. You love who you love, it's beautiful. 

Alright, this is gonna be a long post. I have to explain quite a few things first, so please bare with me. 

First off, I'm 23, soon to be 24. I usually rock a kind of pink getup with skinny jeans, a couple of spiked cuffs, the hair, yadda yadda, but I'm comfortable in it. I don't go overboard with makeup or music, I just let it ride out on its own. 

Now, for whatever reason, a lot of people have questioned if I'm gay or not. This comes as a surprise to me because I really didn't think about it. Everyone I've met in person that has asked me has told me that it's my mannerisms and the way I carry myself. I just don't know what that means. 

I've also been told that I'm cute and friendly and all that fluff by women, so I'm super confused and a little befuddled, because it's been really difficult getting a girlfriend recently, and appearing more masculine. 

I have impeccable hygiene, I brush my teeth, wear deodorant, and do everything I should in terms of appearing and smelling nice. Is there any way I can appear more masculine so that I can maybe attract the opposite sex? 

How do you carry yourself as a man? How should I change up my style or even challenge my status quo?

130,"I’ve had pretty bad anxiety and depression for the longest time now. I’ve avoided drugs because I knew that as soon as I found a coping mechanism I would want to abuse it. About six months ago I went on Prozac which helped to an extent.

Two nights ago I finally tried weed for the first time. I just got tired of refusing it I guess as most of my friends use it semi-regularly. Well it certainly solved things, for a time anyway. The rest of that night was one of the best of my life because I finally felt relaxed and happy. Two days later and my issues are even worse somehow. It’s possible this is an effect of having used the weed. I think it’s more likely that I’m just overly anxious about this new part of my life.

What I’m scared by is abuse of it. If I start using it regularly, it should pretty much solve my problems, right? But long term effects of marijuana are murkily understood at best, and what we do understand doesn’t look too favourable.

But honestly I don’t even know that I care. If I could live the rest of my life happier in exchange for brain fog, lowered intelligence, whatever—I’m not sure I’d say no. It’s just such a *chore* feeling like this day in, day out, even with the mitigating effects of the prozac.

I just don’t really know what to do. I mean, objectively I should avoid weed from here on out and focus on getting myself under control in safer, more real ways. I get that. But I don’t know if that’ll ever really work. What if I’m just unhappy forever. At that point isn’t weed the better option, even with possible negative effects?

I’m sure it’s obvious that I’m over-analyzing the situation. That’s just an unfortunate effect of who I am, and ironically the thing that the weed thankfully inhibits most.

I guess I’d just like some advice from people who have been in similar situations. Thanks.",02Sep2019,2

Recently she's been taking interest in putting her face in my crotch, pretty normal for dogs, but last night as I was getting undressed she starts trying to lick me. Like, LICK me.

137,"Hi all. I’m in a dilemma right now and would love some advice. I’m a senior in HS applying to colleges this fall and it feels like this is where I have to choose a direction, and I’m considering two.

1) music. I’m a jazz fusion violinist and composer and music is truly my passion. I always have music in my head, always am writing, and always am happy when I’m playing music - I’d always rather be doing some sort of music. Ideally I’d make a good living for myself with music - I got a hefty scholarship from berklee which is an ideal school for me for music, and I’d love to go study there.

However, music is an incredibly hard path. The average jazz musicians make 20k a year and I’m a jazz violinist, which makes everything exponentially harder. Even the top violinists in jazz are struggling to make a living. Thus I’m pretty hesitant to go into music, as are my parents for me, tho they are supportive whatever I do. Either way it feels like a young mans game and idk how I’d make it work.

2) academics. I’ve also grinded pretty hard academically and have the test scores and grades to get into *almost* any school I want to (excluding the top tier which is rlly just a crapshoot). I love academics, and while I don’t love them quite as much as music, I could be happy in a career with something to do with an academic interest of mine, including math/history/geo/finance tho I don’t have a particular direction yet. I could def see myself being happy here and could make a good living working a job or starting a company.

I’d love any advice you all have. Should I follow my #1 passion which is a hard career or should I go with my #2. Thanks in advance :)",02Sep2019,1

My period is five days late (my period is never late in all the 13 years I’ve had it except for the one other time I was pregnant) and I have been extremely nauseous the past few weeks. It didn’t even occur to me I could be pregnant until the fifth day of my missed period. Only thing is... I am not in the slightest bit upset. I have wanted to be a mother so badly. Although the circumstances are not ideal, I have a degree and I am working a very good job with a great salary and my significant other has a great job as well. Him and I are in an extremely healthy relationship and have discussed the possibility of me being pregnant and he is completely on board with the whole situation and is very excited if I am pregnant.

167,"Hello, I'm a 21 years old female, lately I've been thinking about sexuality a lot.
I don't mind either gender tbh, so I guess I'm what's considered bi for most.
I always tell my friends, no biggie but I'm somehow hesitant when it comes to my mom.
She had gay friends in the past and told me she doesn't mind but she always tells people that ask about me having a boyfriend that I don't care for it yet.
That could mean she considers the option of me being with either gender but once a friend asked and she said ""She's not interested"" so the topic of me being a lesbian came up which my mom declined.
So that got me worried a little, even if she would be fine with it, I can't help but feel so nervous and like I'm about to die at the thought of speaking to hear about it.
I keep a lot of things hidden from her actually, I don't want to be a disappointment, not as much as I already am at least.
Also at work, I don't think it's anyone's business but I get asked if I have a boyfriend by my workmates and it makes me sorta angry that they assume I gotta be straight.
I know they don't have any bad intentions but is there anything wrong with loving a person regardless or focusing on their gender? 
I know heterosexuality is the norm but if the person is nice and you get along, who cares about what they have down there? 
Thinking about it more and more I start to hate the fixation of labels, I don't want to be called bi, I just love whoever I want to.

170,"Hello everyone,

I have not gone outside willingly in almost a year. When I say willingly I mean that the only time's I've had to go outside was either to take out the trash, check the mail, or when my parents want me to come over for Dinner which is like once every few months. Aside from that, I am just sitting here in this chair browsing Reddit, watching movies, or playing video games. The most productive thing I think I do is when I decide to cook something new for the first time which can be nice. I do have a job but about a year ago they offered a new ""work from home"" option for long-time employees. You can kinda see exactly where this major ""hermit"" phase began. 

It wasn't always like this though. The 3 years prior to me being a hermit I used to go out ALL of the time with my friends. We would go on trips together, Ride dirt bikes, and have fun parties with each other. At some point last year though I started communicating with them less and less until eventually, they stopped hitting me up. I am aware that this is all my fault. They did try to reach out a few times but I ignored them so that time has long passed. I ignored them for the same reason I would now. I am terrified of them asking what I have been up to. The answer would be absolutely nothing. For months on end. Even if I did decide to meet up it wouldn't be the same. I am a different person now and so are they. One of them even got married. I don't blame them for moving on since they are trying to progress in life. I felt like I was holding some of them back.

I have always been an introvert. Not to this level but Anytime I would socialize (especially with people I don't know) I would feel like I needed to recharge my brain batteries by spending some alone time at home. By the next day, I'd feel alright again. This feeling of needing to recharge my batteries just got worst and worst until I just said ""fuck it"" and wanted to never go out. Social interactions now feel like a death sentence. Now if it's someone I need to talk to that is work-related for example or even like a delivery driver I have no problem talking to them but if it's someone trying to have a genuine conversation in person I want out right away. The only time I seem to be able to have those conversations is with people online and even that circle is quite small. Not sure why I am typing this as I have no plans to go outside still but I just wanted to let someone know.",02Sep2019,4

172,"Six months ago, I (25F) put in a wellness check when my now ex-boyfriend (26M) was having a mental health crisis while away at grad school. He was furious and cut all contact with me.

We had discussed marriage and children and finances openly, and I truly believed he would be my husband. When his mental illness came out in full force, I didn’t have the knowledge, skills, or physical access to know what his needs were. My mental health suffered for it and still continues to. This experience has changed my beliefs on romantic love and my ability to be truly intimate with others.

As much as it does suck and I would like to make peace with him, I know I need to move forward in life to focus on the progress I’ made for myself (first salaried job, grad school applications, overall better health) despite this setback.

The biggest lesson I choose to see this experience as is that I need to guard my heart because the love and support I give goes above and beyond, and I deserve someone who is healthy enough to appreciate it.

In any event where you have tried to support someone and they pushed you away or blamed you or hated you for trying to help, how did you grow from it? How did you heal? At what point did you forgive the other person?",02Sep2019,2

177,"This happened a little over six months ago, and I'm scared I did something wrong. 

I had been talking to this girl for a while. We never dated, but were in a friends with benefits kind of situation. I'm pretty sure she had a crush on me.

Every time she said she *expressed* that she was uncomfortable when we were together, I stopped. 

Eventually, over text, she agreed to blow me. When the time came, she outright said she didn't want to. She was pressed up against the wall, with her arms crossed, and asked if we could do *anything* else. I said she could start doing it, and if she decided she didn't want to anymore, she could stop. 

She started doing it, and I started facefucking her.  She got up and completely faced away from me, pressed up against the wall, not saying anything or moving. When she turned back, her eyes were glossed over. I asked if she was crying, and she said no. So we continued. 

I finished, she left, end of story. 

Then she asked to do it again over text. I facefucked her again, she didn't speak, and seemed extremely out of it the entire time.

I asked her to do it again, and she said no. she said she never wanted to do it again. Then she avoided me, my friends, the place that it happened, and stopped attending the class we had together.

Two weeks later, I texted her and asked if she wanted to fool around, and she said ""I don't know."" and ""I don't think we should."" I didn't push it.

Then I asked her if she enjoyed sucking me off the first time, she said no, I said sorry and asked why,  and she texted this:

""No it's okay!! I low-key blocked it out of my memory so I don't really remember much but if you remember you asked me if I was crying and I  said I wasn't and made up an excuse for my eyes watering but I was actually crying a little bit because I felt super uncomfortable but I would've felt bad if I just backed out of it and then I did it again because I felt guilty because I thought I did really bad and I'm super sorry ""

Anyway, we didn't talk for months until school started back up, and we had a class together. When I walked in and she saw me, she started shaking and tried to avoid eye contact with me. Apparently, she tried to switch out of the class.

179,"So my friend [21 F] and I [23 F] have been best friends since elementary school. Six years ago we started being friends with this guy and they started dating shortly after that. Now, I used to think I knew him pretty well and we were pretty good friends but then I started hearing rumors of him sleeping around with other people and then one friend actually confessed to me that he had raped her. She made me swear to never say anything, so I never did. That was 2 years ago. Last night I went out with my friend, her boyfriend and a couple other people and I got pretty drunk.

I managed to squirm out of the couch and ran to my friend’s roommate’s room and slept with her the rest of the night.

I’m very scared to loose her, she is basically my only friend and I love her so much, and I know there is a big chance I would if she decides to work things out with this guy even she hears it from me. I know they love each other a lot, he would also be devastated if they broke off. Their families are super close and I would be responsible for shaking all of that up if I say anything.

I really only realized that what my parents were doing to me was abuse about three years ago. Because of me not realizing up until then i feared that if i told people about this that they wouldn't believe me because this would be the first time i would be telling them this after years of knowing them. I also was afraid because i was, and am still, scared that i would do a bad job of explaining it and they wouldn't believe me.

TL;DR - don’t feel comfortable going out for a long time. Feel overwhelmed and want to break down and ruins a lot of my social interactions.

So most of my life I’ve always had a hard time “going out” for a long period of time. I can usually survive going shopping for a few hours or going out for drinks. Though after a few hours I get extremely uncomfortable. It gets worse in social settings when I’m usually the only person who doesn’t know everyone as well. Of course, if I get drunk... it’s a different story.

Okay anyway, when this does happen, I almost feel like i’m going to break down crying. It’s like I become overwhelmed and can’t handle things. Then my mind starts to think that everyone around me doesn’t like me or doesn’t want me there. I’m not sure how to deal with these feelings or kind of “get over it”. Honestly, this has prevented me from having sleepovers when I was younger (even with best friends) and it’s kind of ruining my small vacay right now. I’m leaving early because I miss being home and with my cats (which sounds so sad haha). 

I mean part of it has mainly stem from not feeling like I fit in. Though it does happen when i’m with family/close friends too because i’ve had to ask my mom if we can leave early if we go out to shop or enjoy the weather. I kind of want to find a way to overcome it. I usually push myself to stay out longer or something. However, it backfires at times and I end up in a funky mood - which people can notice and then they start asking me whats wrong. I feel extremely bad when my mood shifts because I don’t want people to think i’m not enjoying myself or hate the company.

196,"This is going to be kinda long so I’ll say sorry in advance. I’m a sophomore in high school and have played (American) football since 7th grade and have hated it more and more each year. I also do band and love it, it’s where all my friends are and I genuinely like it. It’s extremely difficult doing both marching band and football at the same time and it’s taken quite a toll on me since the school year has started. I’m in the most advanced classes I can be in right now, which should be fine because I enjoy academics, but it just makes things worse when combined with everything else I do. There’s rarely ever a time when I’m not doing homework, at band practice, or at football practice. My life has become just an endless cycle of the same thing over and over. Now the logical thing to do would just be to quit football but that’s not as easy as it sounds, at least for me. My older brother was insanely good at football and ever since then my family has loved it and me not doing football was simply not an option no matter how much I would beg. I haven’t brought up quitting it since middle school but I’m starting to think I should but I just know they’re going to say no. And I know I know it shouldn’t be their decision and that I should do what I want with my life, but they are my parents after all. My grandpa loves football and it would break his heart if I quit too. But another thing is that I literally suck at football and the coaches hate me for absolutely no reason other than that I’m just a good kid and not some kid who thinks he’s “cool”. Quitting football would solve all my problems and I truly believe that. Every day I dread going to practice and I try so hard to stay up late every night just so that it takes longer till’ the next day where I have to go back to football. So please just tell me how I should go about quitting football, or if I even should. I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings and I don’t want to make my parents upset but I honestly don’t think I can put up with football any longer.

TL;DR I am stressed out by band, football, and school but absolutely hate football. My family loves it and pretty much won’t let me quit. How can I get out of football without making them upset or disappointed?",02Sep2019,1

So on a Minecraft server I am making, I have 4 admins. Let’s call them Jeff frank Ronald and bob.

They showed me some xbox chats between Jeff and bob, and it said that bob was going to raid the discord. He may have been talking about another discord though. Also a conversation between frank and a player on the server about a hacked client. Neither showed bobs username though so I am not 100% sure. I then talked to bob and he said that he would never lie to me no matter what. Even when I asked him why he would ever lie to me, he said he doesn’t know because he never would.

200,"Hey guys! Im wondering if you can help me out.

My dad died last year, and its been pretty rough. He was one of the kindest people Ive ever met-- hed give homeless people like $20 if he could, he loved giving gifts or cooking or hosting people, he loved his family and was very loyal-- but he was in ill health with an opioid addiction which got a lot worse during the last couple of years of his life. As such, he became very unstable, very cruel, and, subsequently, very isolated-- even I stopped talking to him about one week before he died because he kept sending me awful messages about my mother who had filed for divorce.

It was awful. At the time, I couldnt remember him ever being anything but a monster. Now after his passing, I can remember the good times but... I seem to be the only one. 

I seem to be the only person that cares that hes gone. I have no siblings, he didnt have many friends towards the end, all our extended family is pretty selfish, and my mom just wants to be done with it (she has a new house, new live-in boyfriend, and doesnt even remember the day my father died). 

Its just been very hard carrying around this weight of being the only person that cares about him still. Ive read some books about grief but the advice always seems to center around the idea of sticking close with your loved ones in remembrance. 

What do you do if you're the only one who remembers? 

I find that reading tends to help me. If anyone has any book recommendations, that would be fantastic.

But we are nerds. Typically I take pride in this but lately I feel stale, and like I’m just kind of floating in social gatherings. I even feel like the center of a joke? Like being a “nerd” automatically equates to childishness. 

 I can’t really connect with anyone and maybe this will pass. We do have good friends that our are ages and share our interests that we enjoy hanging out with. They are genuine, kind and funny. But the people I’ve been surrounded around lately don’t even get my sense of humor. I’m not sure if they have one TBH. I never hear them laugh over anything. 

I’m getting to the point where I’m even checking out stuff that typically doesn’t interest me just so I have a life line while being forced around them. I have a problem with feel super socially awkward when there’s nothing in common, and I’m usually pretty good about connecting with almost everyone. 

So I guess I’m getting a little insecure... does me being a DND, video game, book lover, dog momma, rock/metal music loving nerd at the age of 30 mean I need to grow up? I’ve been trying to expand my interests, but it’s all kind of boring.

207,"Hi all! Sorry for the wordiness of this post - I’m new here 😅

We have new upstairs neighbors at our apartments (within the two weeks or so) and they are quite loud. I understand thin walls, etc but this is a whole new level and is happening at all hours of the day. I’ve written down different times of day when the noise is out of hand ranging anywhere from 11am to 4am (during ‘daytime’ hours I know is out of our control although it is giving our dog some anxiety).

Further - they seem to partake very frequently in smoking weed. Which, if that’s your jam, do what you need to do. However, the smell is starting to overtake our apartment. I can smell it in every room and today I could smell it faintly on our clothes. (This crosses the line for me, especially because my husband is a military officer and any form of cannabis has potential to threaten his job. Plus I’m not interested in that so I’d rather keep it out of my life)

I’m finally asking a question, ha: how do we respectfully approach the neighbors about the noise/drug usage? I’ve just had terrible experience with approaching neighbors in the past so I want to do this in the best way possible that we can all benefit here.

213,"Hi, guys. I was wondering what do you think about this whole situation that I’m facing with my boyfriend.  It might be long. I’m sorry. 

One year ago I came to the states on my exchange student visa and met my current boyfriend. We both fell in love very quickly and everything was going perfectly even though I knew there was gonna be problem since after one year I’d have to go back to my home country. Couple months afterwards I met his parents and a huge part of his family - I heard a lot of compliments about my personality, about my looks and in overall - they loved me. I was really happy they accepted me so quickly. His mom would buy me stuff to sleep over at their house, they’d invite me for dinners and whatever.  I should mention my boyfriend is different nationality than I am, both from Europe but different languages and religion. I never felt like it was a problem at the beginning. 

But in April, after us being in a relationship for 8 months, my mom invited my boyfriend for vacation in my home country. He really loved the idea of meeting my family and asked his parents about it (he had to cause he works for his dads company and he doesn’t get payed for it, so he needed money to go with me). And from that moment, everything went crazy. 

They had a huge fight because of me. My boyfriend told me everything even if it hurt me and I really appreciate that he did cause I can’t stand fake people. They basically blamed me for everything, accused me of trying to get the citizenship from my boyfriend, controlling him and other stuff that I don’t remember anymore. I just remember it hurt me a lot and I cried a whole night. Even though it happened and I’m a very proud person, I thought maybe we could fix it anyway. I felt uncomfortable around his mom, knowing all of the things they said about me but I still pretended everything was okay and talked to them. They didn’t let him spend Easter with me (I celebrate it one week before him) even though they knew I’m here alone without my family and friends). In case you’re wondering - they didn’t let him go with me to my home country for 2 weeks.  

I came back in the middle of July and haven’t seen his parents in a while. One evening we talked with his mother and she seemed like she liked me again so I had hope that maybe it all changed. But I was just naive. The next day when I left their house, they had an even worse fight. This time I got hurt even more. They blamed me for the speeding tickets my boyfriends gets or a class that he failed two times, once before even knowing me (I only see him once a week so no, it’s not my fault, school is his responsibility not mine). Also his father said I’m ugly and that his son could ask any other man and he’d say the same thing. Or that I want only his stupid papers. By accident I found out they called me words like whore and other bad words. Again I cried a lot that night. Most of people always like me and I try to be as nice as I can. I always support my boyfriend, never lie to him and help him as much as I can. People say I changed him for better but his parents somehow hate me. We both don’t know why. 

I can’t face them about it because I’m not even supposed to know about the things they said about me in the first place. My boyfriend still lives with his parents cause he has to go to school for one more year and he works for them, for free. I hate that they are using him and not treating him well. They always put him down, control him and don’t let him get another job cause he has to “help them”. He wants to move out but he cannot until he starts making money and he won’t with his parents and they’re not gonna let him get a job. I have no idea what to do anymore. One week ago I got banned from going to their house just because my boyfriend took off one day to help me move out. They got very mad and said they don’t wanna see me ever again. He argued with them many times but their answer is always the same - we’re gonna kick you out if you don’t listen. 

I don’t care about staying in this country. I’d love to go back to my home country but with my boyfriend... It’d be so much easier for me since my parents really love me and they’d support us. Plus I miss school a lot and here I cannot study cause I don’t have money for even a student visa. But my boyfriend doesn’t wanna move out cause it’s very hard to be successful in a country like mine. 

Can anyone tell me what you think about it? I know it may seem like a stupid subject or a problem, but it’s very hard for me to handle. I try to handle my own problems with me staying alone in a foreign country and I have to help my boyfriend handle this whole situation too.",02Sep2019,1

When we’re together he is really open about everything with me, Hes 6 years older than me, which surprises me how he comes to me for advice and trusting me with his problems. But things changed once I found he was dating someone else, I know this person and I’ve heard rumors about them going around. I asked him if he knew anything about the rumors without knowing he was dating them, which made me feel 100x worse because I just told him how everyone perceived this person and were attracted to them and all the rumors. He then said he trusted me and told me he was dating this person.. after that he seem pretty stressed and was really quiet for a while just staring off, I asked what was wrong, but I knew it was my fault I told him rumors about his relationship. Deep down I wish it stressed him out that I found out because he likes me but that wouldn’t happened if he actually did like me.  I feel like their whole relationship is a red flag, he began to talk to people and tell this person to know that he was a good guy and make a good image of him but instead somehow someone went off and told the girl he liked her, now this girl went to him and told him he liked him too and started dating right away which was so fast. Anyways.. I truly believed he liked me, when I was around him he was nervous and fidgety and couldn’t focus, he was polite to me and respectful. I felt like he cared. But my whole perception was off. Im truly heart broken and its my own fault, after that day it was so hard being next to him, and trying to joke around, but he just wanted to leave and was in a hurry. Things weren’t the same anymore, I felt it, my heart sunk so deep, that I had a knot in my throat.

217,"I lived in an apartment complex from the years August 2007 - June 2008. I remember this period as one of the best times of my life. Why? Because I had friends that talked to nearly every day. They lived in the apartment across the garage from mine. There was this guy I would talk to and hang around outside in the complex, we just ran around and had our little adventures around the neighborhood. Another girl would play with us sometimes, and multiple other kids too. Every one of us lived literally within the next couple of apartment doors. We would sit in each others' houses and get a carpool sometimes to the school that was 3 minutes away. I had my ""group"" that was constantly around in proximity. It was an ideal living/social situation. I was 7/8 years old, in the 2nd grade.

To this day, I get excited to the idea of moving back to an apartment complex (not planning to in the near future). As a 19 year old guy who has lived in a single-family home from 2008 till now, I am still waiting to feel that sort of social dynamic that I felt in the apartment complex. Everyone I liked lived next door and we'd hang out after school provided that homework wasn't a lot. You actually cared about those people because they were your actual friends. You could go to each others' house without calling them because they lived 5 steps away from you. We were all a big group that consistently socialized with each other in the apartment complex and at school. I miss having friends that live 5 steps away from you, and I miss having a friend ""bunch"" I actually liked. I don't know any people my age (19M) in my neighborhood to hang out with after studying or getting bored. I miss the spontaneity of an apartment complex social life. I commute to my university, so I don't have a social life because all of my friends live 40 minutes away in the dorms or in other cities. I don't want to drive to school to hang out because it feels like I'm going to class. Driving around town alone is a death sentence for me, as I'm constantly hoping to run into someone I know.

I really hope that the day I will move back to an apartment complex again I will experience the joy of that time, because living in a neighborhood of standalone houses is depressing and too quiet for me.

221,"This is something I feel horrible about, but here goes. 

So I thought I was transgender this spring. I’m a 25 year old woman and I thought I might be a man for various reasons. I had feelings and triggers I interpreted as dysphoria that are actually trauma related, and I had a lot of hope for a future as a man, and when I tried to present as a man I felt amazing for awhile. 

I was experimenting with masculine pronouns on a private blog and the woman who would later become my girlfriend saw it, leading to me using male pronouns with her. This snowballed into using male pronouns with everyone else in my life, including new friends and roommates. Several of these people, including my girlfriend, are transgender. 

At this point I know I’m not trans and I feel awful about all of this. I feel like I lightly adopted something that absolutely doesn’t belong to me and have encroached on the deeply personal identities of several people I care about. I was honestly questioning my gender but I really jumped the gun with changing my pronouns. At this point I need to be honest but I don’t know how to do it. The longer I wait the more this becomes less an honest mistake and more a pretense. 

I want to say I realize this has already gone too far. I’m afraid of hurting people, I’m afraid of losing a friend and I’m afraid of creating a bad relationship with my housemate. My girlfriend knows I’m just questioning and has always known, and she says she’ll love me regardless of my gender. But that’s just her. I don’t know how the other people in my life will react. I’m afraid people will be disgusted with me and honestly that reaction would be warranted.

225,"So my relationship with my girlfriend is acceptable, we have been in a relationship for 7 months and me/her have a lot of stuff in our apartment. Right now me and my girlfriend are having a serious conflict where she says that I'm being greedy for not wanting to pay 100% of the rent. Now granted my rent money is by no means a fortune, per month the rent is **$200/month** including utilities. Before we agreed on renting/living together, the agreement was $100/month per person or 2\*100 ($200/month). My girlfriend is by no means rich but per month her father pays her about $300/month after college is accounted for. I on the other hand have about $450-$650/month TOTAL so I am by no means rich and actually I'm quite poor. Thankfully I live in a developing country where this income is about what a mid level factory worker makes. Practically my income is just about enough to cover the bills. 

&amp;#x200B;

What makes me mad about my girlfriend are the following things:

* She doesn't want to pay the rent and throws a fit if I want her to pay the $100/month for the rent/utilities
* I personally pay about 70-80% of the grocery bill which eats a minimum of $300/month from my budget
* I pay for the car insurance, car costs, fuel, everything for my car and she uses the car for personal use 50% of the time (like driving to college)
* By the end of the month I normally break even or maybe have about $20 in the green. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's only fair that at the minimum she covers 50% of the rent, which would only be $100/month. For more clarification, I'm unemployed right now, she's unemployed right now and I've had no luck with jobs after 6 months of applying for work.

I've never posted on this site before but I've been pretty bothered by things and I don't know who to talk to. Since I'm insecure this is also a throwaway account. Also sorry in advance I wrote a novel.

I'm a 17-year-old female and my whole world has been crumbling. My home is dysfunctional, my dad is a drunk, and my parents always fight. I've never been allowed to seek psychological help but I've been severely depressed for over a year, though initial symptoms started in 8th grade. On top of this, I've always been super anxious and have had panic attacks from all the emotional stress along with trying to be a good student(I'm in AP everything). I have on and off self-harmed to cope over the past year as well with occasional suicidal tendencies

Now that that's out of the way, My mother's biological mother is a schizophrenic. In a group home and unable to take care of herself. She also did acid in her youth and fried her brain. My mother probably has all kinds of undiagnosed problems. She's suffered a lot in her life, from childhood abuse to my father's abuse. As a result, she's always been a bit paranoid. Last summer i had to admit her into the psychiatric ward for psychosis. She completely changed and watching her decline the way she did was probably the most terrifying experience of my life. She's all I really have. When she finally was on the right meds she started getting better and acting like her old self again which was relieving. However, once she was better she stopped the medication. She's been super anxious, depressed and completely shutting the world out. She has admitted to having delusions again too but refuses any help. I'm scared her condition is more permanent.

Both my parents have a history of past drug abuse, especially my father. Alcoholism is also a problem on my dad's side. His half brother who severed in Vietnam supposedly has schizophrenia as well.

So given this giant hell that is my family history, which is still pretty watered down, tell me, am I doomed to lose my mind someday too? How likely am I to end up schizophrenic and is there anything I can do to prevent it? All I want is to live a normal life when I get out on my own soon.",02Sep2019,1

233,"Hi everyone, I’m on mobile so sorry for formatting. 

I’m (20F) moving back to college for tomorrow going into my third year of my undergraduate degree. I’m extremely nervous and anxious to go back. A lot has happened this summer and there is a lot that will be happening throughout the year for me. I’ll provide some context. 

I went through a break up four months ago (May). My ex attends the same university and moved into an apartment building down the street from me. I’m still very sensitive to this break up. I’m very scared to see him since I haven’t seen him since, and I’m not sure how I’ll react if I do. I’ve been through some situations with family and have felt very alone this summer, so I’m not looking as forward to going back and socializing with my friends or going out. My mental health hasn’t been the greatest either, but I’m trying everyday to better myself. 

This upcoming year I have a lot going on for me. I may be hired for a part time job on-campus, I will be volunteering, I am the president of a school club, and all of that on top of school. 

I can’t help but think about all of this that is going on/will happen. I’m extremely worried that I will fail in all aspects or even just one. It makes me nauseous to even think about. I’m scared to disappoint others, let myself down, and my grades dropping. 

Is there any advice to be able to cope with my anxiety/mental health or even just to organize myself? Do I just need to chill out? I feel so much pressure and the school year hasn’t even started. Anything helps and thank you in advance.",02Sep2019,1
234,"To start I'm a introvert and no it's not a case of I have absolutely no friends, I just have very few and having noone to talk to makes me anxious. 

I have two friends and my uncle. One friend works alot  and I only see him on mondays and fridays and the other lives in another state and is changing her sleep schedule so we talk less (I'm awake from noon to maybe four am) and my uncle can be somewhat overwhelming sometimes so I try to avoid him sometimes.

I have anxiety and depression so meeting friends in person isnt easy nor is getting out of the house period. I'm pretty much looking for something to take my mind off being alone because when I'm alone I feel this weight on my chest and a sense of panic. And I've tried to do something to distract myself but it never seems to work and I just wind up feeling like garbage.

236,"I ‘m 25 gay man, in the closet and a bit struggling with my existence here which I did not deal with very gracefully and acted like an entitled jerk in the past, I made a horrible mistake with an ex friend of mine(sexual one), but just because in my head I’m always the victim I disclosed a lot of the information to what happened on Twitter, it was a new private account with very few people I know from the internet and some of them knows my name and some of them I met in real life. looking back at it, I cannot believe how stupid and egotistical of me to do such a thing.
I hurt a “friend” real bad and shared that with others to play the victim. it was a reality check for me, I realised that the way I’m living and dealing with life is quite insane and toxic and would only ruin me.. but at a lot of times I think who am I kidding? my life is done, I have a big stamp on my back of that and I cannot recover from this, it’s been two years now and it still haunts me every fucking day, I literally showed a sociopathic behaviour and thanks to me I made sure to share it with a larger audience. in the past two years I kinda isolated myself socially even more because I cannot looks people in the eyes with any sense of pride now, and have fears that one day everybody will know and I will bring shame to my family and will live with no sense of pride.

239,"Co-worker named Allen, who I am otherwise on friendly terms with, makes a joke that I liked to get peed on. He thinks it's hilarious and says he told a lot of people. Also very tactlessly makes this joke at the office within earshot of other employees and also people from other companies we work with. I am not happy about it but I am passive about it.

One days he calls me and asks if I reported him to HR. Apparently someone made a complaint against him, although the HR person did not tell him who are why (which is weird, you'd think they'd tell him why). He keeps asking me for a while and I keep telling him I didn't, but he seems dubious. I tell him someone heard him talking like that and it made them uncomfortable enough to complain about it. He says it's probably another co-workers, Bailey, that he'd annoyed recently, and said from then on he would act nice to his face but continue to talk trash behind his back.

A while later, the company (it's a smallish company) changed their policy and emailed everyone that they had to re-sign it. I compared it with the old one and the only difference is that they added a section about preventing sexual harassment and spreading rumors about other employees. I'm pretty embarrassed now because I suspect it was added due to the whole thing with Allen, and since he told so many other people they joke, everyone likely thinks I reported him to management.

Afterward, I was working with someone and he made some kind of joke and then facetiously said ""you're not going to report me to HR are you?"" I asked him bluntly what he meant by that and then he fumblingly says ""oh uh, isn't that what companies do?"" And then after that I worked with someone who I am usually on cordial terms with and he ended his sentences with ""dude"" or ""man"" but in a really sarcastic, sneering way. I don't know if he's just making fun of that type of slang, or if he's doing the fake ""nice to your face"" thing that Allen said he would starting doing with Bailey.

I don't know if this stuff is all coincidence and I am just being paranoid, or if everyone thinks I reported my co-worker. What do you think I should do?",02Sep2019,1

He’s tried AA, and his drinking at one point cost me another close friendship. Even after all that and explaining how hurt I was he’s reverted back to how it used to be. I might be a little sensitive to his actions because a close relative of mine is drinking himself to death as well. It feels like I’ve surrounded myself with people who I can’t see pass the age of 27. My closest friends...

I’m just lost on how to go about this. He’s a lifelong friend, and has been there for the toughest of times, but I can’t figure out my next steps. Do I cut contact with him until I see change? Are there any resources that I may not know about? Any legitimate advice could maybe give me a better perspective on how to control this situation from my end...

She had called me when she got home to tell me she was safe so i told her goodnight and that was that. Apparently after I got off the phone with her she and him had gotten into a huge argument to the point where she has bruises and such.

My fear of looking stupid causes me to self edit and stay quiet around others which makes me very uncomfortable and awkward to be around.

I'm 19 yo and very shy irl. I never had a girlfriend, even thought many girls showed interest, I work out and have a fair fit body (nothing to show off) and I got told that I don't look that bad, but somehow I can't really speak with strangers or girls.

Rn there's a girl that thinks I'm cute but I fear approaching her or having to interact with her.

I can't live like this anymore. I only get out of the house to go to the gym.

I overthink anything. When a stranger on the street passes me and says ""Hello"" and I say ""Hello"" back I think about that for the next 20 minutes. I stutter sometimes when speaking with friends and cant really hold a conversation.

It's a fight in my head, every day and I feel like I can't win it.

When my friends ask me why I don't have a girlfriend or why I don't ask someone out I don't have an answer. Sometimes they even say that they would help me but I know that I would fail talking to girls and even if not, I wouldn't even know what to talk about.

256,"I started my job a couple of months ago, and we’re a small team of 5 with my boss included. When I started working there, one of my coworkers (We’ll call him R) chatted me up pretty quickly and after not too long asked for my Facebook, which he promptly added and also added my Snapchat that was also listed on my account. Just before he clocked out that same day in a story he was telling he mentioned his girlfriend, and mentions her in conversations with others occasionally  as well, so it’s well known he had some form of previous commitment. Though I’m not sure for how long exactly, I know they don’t live together.

He messaged me on Snapchat right away and was flirting with me instantly. Comments about me looking good in a bathing suit, etc etc, very clear flirtation. At that point I asked  “Hey, I’m sorry if I misheard you back at work, but didn’t you say something about having a girlfriend?” In which he responded with yes but that she didn’t care if other girls flirted with him or checked him out, and insisted it wouldn’t be crossing any boundaries (even though I knew it would).

Nearly a month has gone by now and he’s been flirtatious with me nearly every day over text, asked me to come over at night multiple times (I haven’t as of now) and things have gotten sexually flirtatious with us over text at night, and things are very quickly moving in a physical direction.

I’m really not sure what to do. I know I’ve started to develop feelings and an attachment to him through this weird process, and I think he just wants something fun on the side. I feel so bad being some “side woman” but at the same time really enjoy the advances and have developed a form of emotional desire towards him. One part of me enjoys it, but the other part knows that it could be devastating to him if somehow she found out or we were caught. I’m close with his father who also works there and I feel like if things blew up everything could go downhill fast, but at the same time what are the chances?

I’m really conflicted. I feel sexually and emotionally drawn to him but also guilty knowing she’s in the picture. Part of me wants to take it further and have sex with him, but the other half knows it’s not ethical. Advice for any of this emotional turmoil? Just let me know if I need to clarify.",02Sep2019,1

In our workplace the rules in a boss and a regular employee are a no no. But it’s already not okay because he is married. To someone who I am reminded is very good looking all the time. 

Thing is I’m selfless when it comes to love a lot of the time. I wouldn’t want him to risk his whole life over me. But however my feelings have grown to where when we work together...if he flirts with me or doesn’t pay attention to me, it messes with my job performance. My heart hurts at times. 

I’m honestly wondering what to do. When I tried to leave, go to another state, and start over, he got upset. Sad then angry. I couldn’t leave because I realized how deeply in love with this man I was and how it broke my heart I would probably never see him again. I feel like his was too. He convinced me to stay. Despite how much I knew I would struggle here if I stayed, I did it because I couldn’t bear to be away from him. Even if the only time i see him is at work. Even if I know I would never have a chance with him and I struggle from the shift they put me on and how I don’t get a lot of money. I still stay because I can’t seem to shake him.

I’m wondering if I should quit. Telling him my feelings would be futile because I know he probably already knows and that he wouldn’t be able to do anything about it anyways. At times, my heart hurts working along side him if he ignores me intentionally. And people say I over think it but I think there’s more then meets the eye when he does that, especially when the day before he was flirting and being friendly and cute. I just wonder if in the long run, if it would just be best for my sanity to quit and move on so I don’t hurt myself anymore or if I should ignore it and keep pushing.

When i started 8th grade (new school) i wasn’t being stalked by the teachers, i could hang out with friends and i could be happy at school. It was fine for a year until i started skipping school. The principal decided that i was a problem jus because my sister was a troublemaker when she was at my age, so in 9th the teachers started stalking me again. Whenever i got pissed and tried to walk away from them to calm down, they just followed me and then i lost it. I punched one of the teachers, i broke a chair and threw my backpack at them. I got expelled for a week and when i came back the school decided i was «a danger to other students», which was crazy cause i had been friends with most of my classmates since 1st grade.

Of course I don't really own the laptop but I use it for school and such. I look around and I don't find it, I go to the kitchen and see it on the table so I ask how it got there. Turns out that my dads girlfriend got it. So she must have reached over my sleeping body to get this laptop. Well I grab my laptop and bring it back to my room and open the history on chrome. I see a bunch of searches for Xfinity xfi and shit so I assume that is where the parental controls are coming from. First of all I am 18, and I have just started college. I will definitely be staying up past 10 to complete homework on some nights. Also I have my desktop in my room and I play some video games when I can and I stream as well, and my dad doesn't like it much but as long as I do my chores and stuff he doesn't really mind. So the point here is, I am stuck with no wifi past 10 pm and I don't even think that my dad did it. This seems like something she would do and she has taken this laptop from me before without consulting with my dad. She seems to try and take a parenting role even though she isn't married to my dad or my real mom. I don't really know what to do in this case. I am also going to mention that I enjoy staying up late playing video games, but why should that matter? As long as I get up and go to school and do what I need to to why should anyone care? Even if I don't go to school, why is it their concern. As far as I see, I am in control of my future so why have these restrictions?",02Sep2019,1
269,"So, my roommate and I were standing around talking tonight when I saw movement at the bottom of the stairs and it took a couple seconds for me to process that this movement was the biggest rat I've ever seen running right towards us. It somehow managed to squeeze under our fridge and we haven't seen it since. I'm pretty familiar with rats in that I have several friends with pet rats and in comparison even to domesticated rats this rat is very large. 

Neither one of us has seen a rat or even a mouse here before, and we checked the entire apartment. We can't find any sort of holes in the wall, any droppings, etc. We have no idea how it got in, especially considering its size. We bought and placed rat glue traps between the wall and the fridge, in the gap between the fridge and the oven, at the bottom of the stairs, and one by each of our bedroom doors. 

We keep it pretty clean, but we figure it might have wandered in for food. We live by a wooded area if that makes a difference. 

Due to the holiday it's not likely we can get someone to come by until Tuesday at the earliest. 

This is my first time dealing with rodents in my living space that aren't pets and my roommate hasn't dealt with this before either. 

What can we do to determine where its entry point was and what else should we do in the meantime until a professional can come?",02Sep2019,1
270,"I (F, 22) have recently been drifting apart from my friends despite desperately trying to hang on to them. I try to ask them to hang out sometimes, but I'm afraid I'm annoying them. No one ever really asks me to hang out or go out with them. I've known basically the same group of people since high school and have difficulty meeting new people as I'm shy, insecure, and have social anxiety. I've also never been in a relationship and have very few people to rely on. I go to work, then go home and receive no texts or messages from anyone for weeks at a time. I understand that people are busy, it's just starting to feel more lonely and it's very heavily weighing on me. This is 100% solely my fault and I should've been more outgoing in college, but I cannot go back now. I've been quite sad and I constantly feel terrible about myself. I don't know how to meet new people and I desperately need to get out of this rut. I want to give off positive vibes (it's all sad vibes now) and increase my confidence and self-esteem. I want to feel good about myself and my friendships but I don't know how. I've been going to the gym, but it hasn't been helping the lonely feeling.",02Sep2019,1
271,"So I work retail at a pretty awesome game store. More like everything nerdy store but mostly games and movies. 
Now my boss, is an intelligent, incredibly attractive female, with an excellent taste in media. And I’ve no interest whatsoever in being anything other than boss and subordinate.

I respect her and her decisions and I though our work relationship was going ok, but then her birthday rolls around and I figured “hey it might be nice to get her something”. Just because allot of the effort she puts into her job seems to go unnoticed or unappreciated . So I got her a 7$ mini cactus that came in a nice little ceramic checkered pot (she likes patterns on her things), and I thought it was a perfect little gift. Perfect for a employee to give to their boss. 

But after that, it seems like she was acting differently towards me. Like engage other associates in convos, and be really friendly towards them, but whenever I tried even asking her about work related matters she seems weary of me, and we all know what kind of weary. 

I like to think I’m not a bad looking guy, I exercise and eat right, and I’m certainly not looking to date my boss. And I just can’t think of anything else I did besides that, that would result in such a drastic change in behavior. Does anyone have any advice? I’ve tried asking her about if something had happened or if I had done something to make her upset.  Had always kept our relationship professional, I hadn’t complemented her appearance, or really anything for that matter. 

I’m just upset because now it’s kind of awkward and she’s really just been becoming cold towards me even directly in front of customers and other employees. I don’t know what to do. I like my job and her, especially because she’s a good boss. But this just feels really uncomfortable and all my attempts to talk to her have resulted in nothing.",02Sep2019,1
272,"I met this guy on Tinder 3ish weeks ago, call him E. E and I hit it off really well on Tinder then moved onto snapchat to continue getting to know each other. We were snapping every day and eventually we made plans to go get dinner together.
As the night of our dinner got closer, I got more and more excited. The day finally arrived and even though I was tired from  football the day before (I'm in the marching band... left home at 10am and got back at 11pm) I was still very excited.
The morning of we exchanged a couple of cuddly cat snapchats and around noon I responded by asking when we were meeting.  No answer. Alright. Sometimes it takes him a little while to answer. Hours pass by and suddenly its 6pm, still no word from E. I was beginning to worry (bc anxiety brain said so) so asked ""Everything good?"". 9pm comes and goes, still no answer.
It is 1am now and I don't think I will be able to sleep tonight because of the thoughts going through my mind: ""is E okay?"" ""Does he not want to go out with me anymore?"" ""What's wrong with me?"" etc. I think we would have had a really good time and I think... I dont even know what to think anymore...

276,"So, I’m writing this a bit impulsively because I’ve found something new to freak out about and I’m not sure where else this should go, if there’s a more fitting subreddit please direct me to it, thanks I could use all the help I  can get.

Early 2018 or so, I found a note on my phone that I’m almost certain I either didn’t write or that I lost the memory of writing it (I already have plenty of memory problems including dissociative amnesia and repressed memories due to trauma, so that might explain my forgetfullness). It was written 19 November 2017 (a Sunday) at 4:39PM, and considering that date bears no significance to me otherwise, it must have been just a normal, uuneventful Sunday, besides whatever drove me to write the note. It simply reads: “im being brainwashed by martha”. That exact syntax and everhthing, no context, nothing. I haven’t touched or edited the note since i found it in order to presetve it.

I do not know anyone named Martha. I knew a Marsha in middle school, but my only interaction with her was a brief passing in the halls, and I haven’t even been in that same town in years. Googling the phrase doesn’t turn up anything, both with and without the apostrophe in the “I’m”. I have no idea what the fuck it means; I’ve crossed off the likelihood that it could’ve been an idea for one of my creative endeavors because I’m a cartoonist, because I keep my folders meticulously organized and this was for some reason in the “important” folder, not the “writing” folder.

I first found that note last year and I asked my friends about it, but they brushed it off and assured me it must be nothing, and i promptly forgot about it—until now, because I found somethin new.

Like I said, I’m a cartoonist and I sometimes write down ideas for shit, and today I was doing just that. The entire content of the thing isn’t relevant, what IS relevant is what came up on predictive text. At some point, I used the word “contact”, and predictive text immediately wanted to continue that as “contact monica jackson”.

Like with the Martha case, I have never heard the name Monica Jackson before in my life. Googling her name turns up a few scattered Facebook profiles and articles about an ex-Fox newscaster leaving, but I don’t use Facebook and I’d never heard of the Fox woman. This is literally the first time I’ve ever seen the name Monica Jackson. I don’t know why predictive text wants me to contact her so badly, but it’s freaking me the fuck out. 

I don’t know how this shit got on my phone. I’m a generally paranoid person with mental health issues so this might be nothing but it scares the shit out of me regardless. Any advice you’ve got to help me figure this out, whether investigating who Martha and Monica are or just helping me calm down and stop worrying about this, by all means, please help.",02Sep2019,1

278,"So I’m very very very socially awkward. One thing I guess that has made me creepy is that I don’t really smile. I don’t know I just don’t understand why people smile all the time if they are not happy then why smile? Is it to make others happy? Or is it to be socially acceptable? If I’m not happy then I will not be smiling. But I guess if I’m not smiling I some how look mad or I look like I dislike you. I’m not giving a particular look I don’t think it’s just a neutral look to me. Today I tried to remember that people like to see smiling so I tried to smile but it just looked weird and forced I was told. Another thing that goes along with being called creepy is being called a gruesome person. And it’s because I can watch “extremely scary” movies and not flinch or show emotion really. It’s not scary it’s just a movie it’s all fake the blood is probably corn syrup and dye or something like that and all the gore is prosthetics or CGI most likely. One thing that I have taught to keep to myself recently is what I want to be when I grow up. I want to be a mortician i mean Someone has to do it right? And I find it interesting. People seem to be afraid of death and dead people but death is only as scary as we make it to be. Everyone dies at some point. We all will die one die, which is a sentence I have been told to stop saying because it comes across as creepy. I don’t want to scare people or have people thinking I’m creepy. Even my own parents have come out and said that i have sorta always scared them too. When I was little I would unplug my night light and would shut my door at night so that it would be pitch black. I tried being like other kids and pretend to be scared of the dark but I just wasn’t afraid. When I was 8 and accidentally cut my hand in the kitchen with a knife I just stared at how the bleed dripped instead of doing something right away about the fact that I was bleeding. I would rip apart my stuff animals and dolls when I got mad. I was never and still am not like other kids and I knew it. I don’t scare myself but I scare others without trying. I don’t want to be creepy but I don’t know how to stop making people think that about me. I’m 14 now and I think people might be staying away from me because I’m creepy. I guess it doesn’t help that I said at lunch time on Friday that if I had to kill someone that I know exactly how I would do it and how I would cover my tracks to not get caught. Ugh it just feels like the list of things in my head of things that i have to remind myself to do or not to do is getting bigger and bigger. Death fascinates me is that so bad?",02Sep2019,0

280,"I have a tendency of liking people a lot. I enjoy the company of almost anyone and it usually results in me getting feelings for them but never really acting on it. However, this time is different. 

It's been going on for so long and I've tried so many different forms of advice from different people and none of them work, so I'm literally on my last legs by posting on r/Advice .

My ex-girlfriend and I broke up because I felt like I was losing feelings for her, which hurt like a bitch because I definitely didn't lose feelings for her and I just wanted to go after some other girl. Then after we broke up I didn't go after the other girl because I felt like shit that I let my feelings for some other girl break me apart from a girl I truly did love.

Then a third person was thrown into the mix, and now I'm just stuck. I want to date one of them but  when I start thinking about it I get sad about the other two and how they'd be better for me. So I'm thrown in a circle between all 3 people, one of them being my ex, about who I want to be with. I'm stuck in a room, and I have to shoot myself in the leg to get out. So I'm just gonna go cold turkey for a while and not find romantic feelings in anyone.

281,"So this is a throwaway account since I've honestly felt really embarrassed about this whole encounter. I can't get this event out of my head and it's been on repeat ever since. I'm looking for advice on if I did the right thing and/or what I could've done differently.

Two nights ago, I went back to my home area (suburbs/country) to attend a fireworks show at a local farm. I was with my girlfriend and two other friends. Fast forward to the show itself. We're having a great time as we're towards the front, leaning up on a fence as most of the families and children are behind our group. 

Here's where things go south. Some guy I don't recognize comes up to my right, smiling, and says, ""Hey, do I know you from somewhere?"" I told him I didn't think so and we made light conversation, seeing if we might have had a chance encounter through mutual friends. We work out way through the conversation and he's still lingering around after we've essentially established there was no connection. Trying to be subtle, I asked ""So, are you hanging out with any friends here?"" hoping to politely return to watching the fireworks and accompanying soundtrack (now playing ""Rocket Man"" by Elton John). He says he is and doesn't leave. I nod and smile, he smiles, everything seems fine, albeit him not taking a hint that I'd like to be with my friends. At this point, he kind of mumbles the beginning of a question and I ask him if he said something. He just says ""Nevermind..."" About a second later, I felt like I was hit in my cheekbone/jaw with a baseball and nearly fall over. I'm confused as to what just happened and my friends are asking if I'm alright. My one friend saw the guy turn and throw a punch at the side of my head as I'm just standing there. I turn to ask this guy what the hell his problem is and see him speed walking away. I was still in shock and trying to fully comprehend what had occurred. By the time I centered myself and understood that I had been hit (still not knowing why), he had covered some distance and I just stood there in disbelief as I watched him walk away.

I know when people are posed with hypothetical situations like this, the easy answer is ""Oh yea, I'd chase him down and kick his ass!"" I probably would've said that too if posed the question. But in that moment, I did nothing as I stood in shock. I hesitated until the moment was gone. I feel like the main reason I didn't act was because of the surroundings. We were in a quiet rural community, families and children all around, all watching a beautiful firework show with happy music playing. I didn't feel like picking a fight would have led to any good outcomes. (Additionally, I also understand that he could've had a weapon and a direct confrontation would certainly have ended badly for me.)

My question is this: should I have done something besides stand there and watched him just leave? Should I have at least followed him and tried to flag down security to stop him? It's just a hit to the pride to take a sucker punch and not do a single thing.",02Sep2019,1

Do I move in to the first place and take hour long bus trips for next few months or should I ask the landlord to return the deposit and move in to the new place?

288,"im 32 he's close to my age.  known him well over 10 years.  were both pretty rough around the edges so i dont want this to seem like i saw the least likely person doing drugs.

&amp;#x200B;

quick back story:  we met.  we worked together.  we lived together.  got in trouble together.  he had a kid.  i had some shit happen too.  we got into a fight and didnt talk for almost a year.  this takes us to about 5 months ago when i reached out to see how he was doing.

&amp;#x200B;

he seemed to be a little looser with his habits.  we've always smoked way too much but he was basically chain smoking back woods.  he's one of the few who took quitting blunts seriously when i brought up how dumb it was to be smoking tobacco products as often as we do.  he runs a shit ton and even though he's never had the most self control, he's always tried to be healthy; so the blunts seemed weird.

&amp;#x200B;

we live around DC, so it didnt seem weird when he kept bringing up how he spends most of his nights there.  but, it did seem like he was a little too concerned with going to the city so often.  he became friendly with a different group.  he's also been going through some rough stuff with his kid and mom of his kid.  he's mentioned how stressful it is and how it's wearing on him.

&amp;#x200B;

tonight:  so it's been 2 or 3 weeks since i've met up with my friend.  he called me to say he couldnt talk maybe a week or 2 ago, so i assumed me meant on the phone.  when i met up with him, he was very... he was moving more than usual and looking around.  he had his car at the airport in a construction lot with a flat tire so he ubered there and i followed on my bike.  once we got there he seemed to want me to roll a couple joints somewhat desperately; and not cause he didnt have any weed to smoke.  the whole time i was rolling, he was acting nervous, pacing, then got in the car and had a had written note that said ""cant talk.  dont talk just read this.  someone is following me.""

&amp;#x200B;

the whole time were there im thinking about how sketchy he's acting, same way a kid i used to know acted while he was burning out on bad e pills.  then he tells me to get out of the car and look down the road and tell him if he sees a car coming.  because im still working on being mature, i dont usually let people tell me what to do, but i was intrigued by his behavior and wanted to see where it was going.  while i was looking down the road, i just walked up to the car window and stared at him while he didnt realize i was there.  i saw him finish a sniff and then lick the paper he sniffed it off of.

&amp;#x200B;

i tried to low key fish for info on what he was taking, but ""cant talk"".  he said something about how he needed to smoke and how the second joint would hit the spot.  i kind of told a story about taking adderall in college and being able to smoke nonstop.  the way he agreed with what i was saying and how it related to him, makes me think he was sniffing some coke.

&amp;#x200B;

not a big deal except he tried to hide it from me... and at a time where the risk of getting caught was just a matter of me looking to see what he was doing... this makes me think he has a real problem.  he wont talk to me.  i cant even talk about the shit we always talk about or he starts acing schizophrenic, like were being followed and listened to at all times.  he wanted to go to another town to talk.. i told him we can lock our phones in my bike and he got pissed and said ""dont even say stuff like that right now.  i cant talk""

&amp;#x200B;

he's serious about not talking.   what can i do if we cant talk?  HE NEEDS HELP RIGHT?  how far along do you think this drug habit is?  he's been lying to me about how much money he makes and has; related, right?  should i give him space or get in his ass and let him know he's fucking up?   i dont give a fuck about the no talking shit, im just trying to avoid giving him an excuse to blow up and ignore me.  i'll let him tho if i need to say something now

I turned 21 a couple of months ago and I’ve never even had my first kiss. I do get hit on/stared at/guys have had crushes on me, but it’s just never gone anywhere. I grew up really religious so the thought of being in a relationship, premarital sex and even making out with a guy never even crossed my mind. I also struggled with feeling unattractive for a long time (which for sure hindered my progress), but it’s gotten a bit better since leaving high school.

Now that I’ve acknowledged the fact I’m ready for something to happen, I have no way of meeting anyone. I am in university but live at home (with a strict religious mother), I don’t have any friends to meet anyone through and I haven’t had any luck on dating apps (I’m not desperate enough to do anything with someone I’m not attracted to lol).

291,"Throwaway account, mobile, let's move on.

I have a group of friends. They have been friends with each other much longer than they've even known me to exist. There is one person who seems to migrate in and out of this group due to their own schedule. They used to be around a lot and in that time I grew to loathe them. 

I have never met someone so disrespectful, so nitpicky, so obnoxious and frustrating in my entire life. This person seems to give no shits about the people they call their friends to the point that they insult the hospitality of a friend and the state of their home. They are insensitive and frequently talk over others and drag on arguments knowing full well that there are other things going on that need to be done. 

And the thing that frustrates me the most is that my friends take their side. I have pointed out all the things they have done individually and they're in agreement that this person's behavior sucks. So WHY IS IT ACCEPTABLE????? Why do they get a pass on this? It's become so much of a point of agitation for me that I tune out entirely when they are even mentioned. The fact that they know and refuse to even try to get it through this person's head that they're being a jackass is so frustrating. I tried my best to mind myself and just be quiet or find something else to do, but that feels even more defeating. And honestly? If I wanted to not talk for hours on end while someone shitty is shitty to other people, I would go to more of my family functions.

It's been a blissful couple of months while they've been out of town, and everyone except me is excited for the return of their incessantly asshole-ish friend.

298,"My brother and I always had a bit of a rivalry growing up. He was stronger than me and could pin me down but I knew how to make him angry and would call him names and harass him. 

He got into some trouble in his sophomore year in high school and my parents didn’t go easy on him. They’re much more harsh on him than they are on me or my sister. I feel like it’s this way bc I would often get away with no punishment when my parents saw my brother hitting me (although I called him things first). Thinking back on it today almost always brings me to tears. All I remember from our childhood is mocking him, ridiculing him in front of our friends and denying to spend time with him. Sure he would hit me in retaliation, but a child’s fists can’t really do enough damage to leave any life long scars (unlike my words).

I’ve left for college now and my brother has gotten away from his past. He made his schools volleyball team, has an after school job and even has a new best friend. I’m so proud of him but I still feel like a lot of the hardships he had and his troublemaking tendencies were partly my fault. My question is: how and when can I tell him how sorry I am for how I treated him? We’re friends now and enjoy each other’s company, but I know I can’t bring this up to him without crying. Is there a right time to do this or should I let it be?

299,"Hey all, I really really need your advise! I’m deeply hurt. This is what happened: 

My best girlfriend, she had on her bag my cigarettes. She went to the bathroom and I asked her if I could take them. She said yes, so while looking for them I found a limited edition perfume I’d lost several days ago.   I hesitated first. But then I found several details that made me think it was the one I lost. 
I asked her, and she said she bought it in a mall close her home. I said: I lost mine, I’d like to see if I could buy another, where is this mall? 

She said, it’s ok I’ll go and search it for you. I told her I have a free day tomorrow and that I’ll go, that she shouldn’t bother, I insisted to have the name and location of the store. When she gave me the info, I found out  the store doesn’t exist in that mall. It was a shock to see that there was no way she would buy it there. 

I was so shocked she kept lying to my face the whole day, I felt so sick that I left her with other friends and headed home. I compulsively searched for the perfume while she texted me like nothing happened. It was revolting how she kept with the lie. I asked questions and she replied with even more twisted details that made her even look worst. 

I never found the perfume at home. Then suddenly I remembered we went out like a couple of weeks ago and left it in her car. 

I feel so revolted by the lie. She knows I know. She acts so cool, like she’s so confident I will buy her story. I don’t know how to handle this. Please help :,(",02Sep2019,1

302,"Okay, I [17f] have been working with this guy [21m], we'll call him Mickey, for about 3 months now. He's really cool, and we're pretty good friends, but not so close that we talk outside of work. However, sometimes, I think he has a crush on me, and it's really off putting bc

A) I have a boyfriend 

And B) he allegedly has a girlfriend????

Maybe I'm reading things wrong, but here's a list of things that make me thing he's got a crush on me.

•Our friendship is very playful. Like, we're both pretty down to earth, and he makes stupid jokes, and I just groan at him. He teases me a lot, and I'll playfully punch him, and sometimes, it just feels very flirty to me. He really knows how to push my buttons to make me laugh.

•Three weeks ago, Mickey told me about someone who works in the same store as us had texted him ""I have a crsuh on you,"" but he wouldn't tell me who it was. Last week, he told a girl around my age about it, and he told her who it was. It ended up being a girl in our department who is 19 and engaged. Maybe he didn't tell me bc he thought I might get jealous or something???? Idk. I just don't see why he didn't just tell me when I had already told him I suspected that the  19 y/o girl has a thing for him.

•He asks/says things about my current boyfriend a lot. My other co-workers only talk about my boyfriend when I mention him. Mickey brings up my boyfriend when it's unprompted. For example, I playfully hit him and Mickey's response was ""is that how you treat your boyfriend?"" Or I'll make a sarcastic comment about beating Mickey up, and Mickey will respond with ""How does your boyfriend feel about your violence?""

•He has a girlfriend, but never calls him his girlfriend when he talks to me about her. He told the girl around my age a story about how he had to take his girlfriend to the hospital because she got too high and had a panic attack in the back of his car. He told me the same story later that day but referred to his girlfriend as ""my friend"" and ""someone,"" and gave her the pronouns ""they. Maybe he just doesn't want me to know???? Idk.

•I live in a very small town. It's technically a village bc it's population is  &lt; 5000 people. Sometimes Mickey will just randomly say ""Wow, (Town name) has some good looking people,"" or ""people from (town name) are cute."" When I asked him if he meant anyone specific he said ""Well I mean yeah, but like..."" and that was that.

I guess what I'm asking is: is this dude into me, and what do I do about it? Age isn't the problem here. My boyfriend is 20, but I HAVE A BOYFRIEND, and he allegedly has a girlfriend??? If he's into me, then how do I go about this? I would like to be closer with him and I like being his friend, but for some reason, I can't shake the feeling that he's into me. 

TL;DR: My coworker and I are both in relationships but I think he likes me. I just can't tell. What do I do?",02Sep2019,1

Since handing my notice in at my old job once I’d accepted the new job offer, I’ve been giving my career path a lot of thought and realised that in all honestly I really don’t want to be an accountant anymore and instead I want to pursue a career where I’m not cooped up inside in front of a computer or in a factory somewhere, ie something where I’m on the road a lot or spend all my time outside.

The new accountancy firm are funding my studies, but if I quit before my studies are done, I have to pay half the fees back (about £1200) which as a poor 22 year old isn’t exactly affordable. On the other hand if I stick with it for the two years it’ll take for my studies to be completed, it’s two years of misery and wasted time that I could have spent pursuing a more enjoyable career,

312,"My parents have been divorced for 5 years now, and my mom has dated quite a few men, and can never seem to find the one. She's easily manipulated, from her marriage to her past partners. She seems to always fall into the same trap of assholes, except this time.

This guy is a wonderful amazing caring man. He's kind, has kids, and has a backstory that makes him seem to be as humble and as human as can be (not saying he's not human, lol.) However, i have a feeling he's not all hes cracked up to be. For starters hes had 3 ex wives (all apparently being terrible) and his kids seem to really dislike him. In fact, they stay with their mother who neglects and abuses them, rather than their dad who has rooms for all of them in the same school district who seems to be an amazing nice guy. On top of this, my mom has confronted him about behaviors he's displayed, and he's always played victim about it, like its her fault and that he is the victim. Most notably, he's tried to integrate his family with mine and his kids are incredibly rude to me and my mother. When my mom confronted him on this, he said, ""I guess you really don't like my kids, huh?"" And when my mom said she didn't, he acted very cold. This isn't as important and may just be me feeling off, but i feel like he's completely faking this persona and the more and more time i spend around him, i can tell he's very cocky, however he displays this nervous little man attitude. My mom has noticed this too, but just ignored it. It's just strange o me, because i don't know how you can be a cocky over confident dude while also being an insecure, small, and sweet guy.

313,"I'm nearing the end of my schooling, I've been going to college since 11th grade and I'm about to graduate with an associates in electrical technology, along with 5 certifications and a lot of experience with CNC, PLCs, quality control, etc. I'm looking for a career option now as I have to leave my old job from HS.

I'm looking for a job that isn't so much in the field work, such as electrical maintenance. I'm leaning more towards a position that works in ""management"". I know my degree isn't in management, but in my years at school we learned more than how to measure a resistor or to calculate Xc, B, G, resonance, etc. We learned ways to increase productivity, efficiency, how to handle issues with employees, etc.

I know there will be a lot of stuff I have to do on my end and I'm working on it. Instead of troubleshooting something on a plant floor such as a faulty motor or why a breaker has tripped, I want to be handling spread sheets of products, making sure the productivity is at an acceptable level.

315,"If you’re like me, you probably care a lot about what people think. So I’d like to ask you a question.

Who really cares?

I know I did. And for the longest time, it dragged me down and held me there. I was trapped. It’s very easy to get very wrapped up in your appearance (what other people see), but it doesn’t matter what you say or do. People won’t care. That doesn’t mean you can go around being an Asshole all the time. It just means you shouldn’t worry so much about people’s thoughts. 

Years and years ago, I didn’t care. And it was great. I had a ton of friends, I was well liked, and everything was basically perfect in my life. Then one day (about 3 years ago), I had a thought.

“What if?”

What if people don’t actually like me? What if they just act like they do, but secretly don’t? What if I’m not good enough? What if I’m a waste of life? 

All of the sudden these were the only thoughts I had, and I quickly became a different person. I would stop talking for fear of saying something that would “make people dislike me”. I became completely isolated from all my friends, and they didn’t seem to like me anymore. This gave rise to many more negative thoughts and questions which only made me more insecure. I basically saw social groups as competitions where everyone was competing to be the funniest, most likeable person. I tried to make other people laugh, but not because I wanted them to laugh, I wanted them to like me. Worst of all, I thought that if they knew I was actually capable of making mistakes, then they wouldn’t respect me. This resulted in me bottling up everything I was thinking and feeling. 

This was how I lived for 2 years. In the last year, however, I got a little better. I found a way to escape these thoughts. By avoiding them. This worked great for a while, but every time I would do something that reminded me how insignificant I was, I would break down and ALL those thoughts would come rushing back. This has happened every few weeks for about 6 months.

But today my brother told me something that I think some of you may need to hear. People like you. They may not think you’re perfect, but you don’t have to be. Loosen up a little, gain some confidence in yourself. I know I need to. I’m gonna try to be myself a little more.

Thank you for listening",02Sep2019,6

317,"Hello Reddit!

I would like your opinion about a subject that came up with my mom. I am working for a fitness company. I am working there as a shop assistant part time for minimum wage, to pay my rent, because my main ""job"" is studying. In the store there are testers for customers. So let's say you want to buy a big container of protein, the company I'm working for has a separate one, so I can mix a small shake for the customer, if he wants to test it before buying it. I'm training a lot in my free time and protein and food are not really cheap, where I'm living. My employer expects me to be there about 20-30 min early every day and leave the same amount of time after closing, to clean up. I'm getting no payment for that time. It's expected from me. I don't know if that is legal, or not but whatever. 
I myself am taking some doses of protein out of the testers, when I'm working. Not huge amounts, just what I drink after a training session. I take that with me in a small container to consume the next maybe 1-2 days after my training, when I'm usually not working. My colleagues do the same. They are also students. With one difference. Their gyms are close to the workplace. So they come in before their training and grab the things for that day and leave again. My gym is further away, so I'm storing it and drinking my shake, when I'm done at the gym.
My mom said what I'm doing is wrong and stealing, what my colleagues are doing is okay, because they are drinking it inside the shop.

 What do you think? 

She got me thinking. Just because my employer is doing something bad to me, doesn't mean I have to do the same, right? So my mom is probably right. On the other hand I'm  thinking that it's a huge company and we give out a lot of portions a day for people to test. So no one is really hurt financially, but for me it's a nice benefit from working there and I feel compensated for the time without payment.",02Sep2019,1

Straight off the bat, I've never disrespected her in any way. Always addressed her properly the way our culture would (Tita/Auntie). I make sure to have a good attitude around them all the time. I always gave her a gift for Mother's Day since me and my boyfriend started dating (2 and a half years ago now). This most recent one I gave her a beautiful bouquet of roses with a small card thanking her for everything and telling her I love her. I had to give it to her daughter whom I am friends with but I never really got a thank you or message from his mom at all... I know I shouldn't expect anything back but that one kinda hurt. 

She never really seemed interested in talking to me. I would text her but never get a reply back. I tried calling her sometimes but never picked up or returned my calls. On Facebook I'd leave small comments on her posts and notice she'd like everyone's comments except mine.

They did try once but it ultimately fell apart as they barely participated or spoke. People get busy, that I understand. They got busy yet always found some bit of time for other people while I got nothing. I'd always, always be the one asking to hang out but unless I kept pestering, they would bail on me. It feels so one sided and it's tearing me apart. This is the third time I talked to them about it but it feels so robotic now, like they are a whole different person.

328,"I (F,25) divorced my children's father for reasons I won't get into .  I am happy with this decision ,and life seems to be going smoother. However , I am absolutely terrified to hook up with a new partner now that I am single again . And it's not that I'm not READY physically (I haven't actually had sex in ages and do miss it), it's just that my body has gone down hill since gaining 50 lbs , having a surgery, and having kids . I still take care of myself and put effort into my looks , and dress nicely, and I still have great curves. I just absolutely dislike how my stomach is now . It has an ugly flap and is a little disformed because of an appendectomy I had . It's hard to tell in clothing though , and as silly as it sounds , I am so scared that it is going to completely disgust any new sex partner I have . Im talking to aguy at work and he keeps asking to hang out . I know where it will go , and I want to do that if the time is right , but I'm just nervous about how someone will judge my body completely nude and not hidden by clothing or flattering angles. I am diagnosed with social anxiety so I think that also makes the situation more intense for me. Any advice on getting over this so I can live my life ??",02Sep2019,1

330,"So I know it’s going to be an overwhelming response of no but I just need to hear someone’s opinion on it because i’m convincing myself to do it. 

So my boyfriend of almost 2 years is moving to the other side of the country in two months time and we plan to stay together and do long distance for a year until I finish school and move over there. Before he leaves we’ve been talking about getting tattoos together, something small like a little heart on our v-lines. 

The tattoo will only be 1-2cm big, I have a friend who has a tattoo gun who will let us do it at his place. If my parents saw it (which i doubt they ever would) they wouldn’t really care. 

I know this probably sounds naive but I feel like we’ll last the long distance and this is something I want to do, should i ?",02Sep2019,1
331,"My roommate is a great guy. No doubt about it. I vibe with him and vice versa. But we are different in how we act in social environments. He is much more suave and flirty while I’m goofy and playful. Every time we end up meeting girls, they attract to him and basically ignore me. There was a girl that I was talking to before he and I were roommates and we were interested in each other (like trying to date) and when she met him, she stopped messaging me and would almost only message him. She would only message me if it was to get to him. Like I get girls may be more attracted to him but this shouldn’t happen with EVERY girl we meet.

332,"So about two weeks ago,  my best friend (non binary) was not responding to any texts that anyone was sending.  I (guy) was (naturally) worried, and so after about 15 unresponded to texts, I sent a long letter basically saying that I was worried about them and was wondering if they were okay. After about 5 mins they reply but it was their best friend. She thanks me for being worried and that it meant the world to her. After she asked for a pic of me so I sent one. She responded and said that I was cute. (Being a guy, a girl saying your cute is like, huge.) so she sent a pic of herself, and I said (and genuinely thought and still think) that I thought/ think she is cute. We continued to have a conversation over text and call for past four am.  (Btw this is still all on my friends phone)  she said that she doesn’t have a phone and can’t have one until she is sixteen. But they are on the same softball team so in September she would be able to text.  Today being September 1st, I was waiting for a while and got nothing, now the first friend isn’t responding and so I can’t get anything and I’m worried that I will never see/ talk to her again and I’ll be stuck in a weird state of purgatory where I’m not really in a relationship, but I can’t be in a different one without feeling guilty since we never “broke up”",02Sep2019,1
334,"So. I moved into a residence a month ago that has a private underground parking lot that can house up to at least 20 cars but theres 15 or so not being used. I have an assigned parking place as does everyone else. I personally don't have a car but my boyfriend comes round to visit once or twice a week. It annoys him no end when he goes into the parking lot to find the spot taken and he has to circle the lot and go park behind the building.

I realise that the parking spot is easily accessible (it's right in front of the entrance but far from the elevator), that people might not have realised it's now my spot or that they have and know I don't have a car. So in the last 2 weeks I've left 2 written (polite) notes for 2 different cars but they still park there.

There's a moveable pole but it's useless as you can just move it again. And a parking key lock thingy will be expensive and I don't have that sort of cash nor do the landlords (who only own my apartment). All they can do is also write letters to the other tenants.

The police won't get involved nor will the tow truck tow cars in private residence parking lots (so I've heard)

Have any of you encountered such an issue and how did you resolve it?

339,"TL; DR at the bottom.

Someone I know pretty well (known from here on as ""S"")  contacted me, last night,  to pick them up. When I arrived to pick them up S was pretty intoxicated about as intoxicated as I've seen S get. S said that they had had sex with somebody and they (the person who they had sex with, known from here out as ""P"") asked S to leave afterwards or kicked S out.

My first question to S was if they were all right. Then because of how drunk S was I had to ask whether the sex was consensual. S initially said the sex was consensual and maintained that for most of our conversation. S stated that S had wanted the sex. I also asked if protection had been used. 

This is where I'm getting to my question. S said, and S went back and forth when I was talking to them before I dropped S off at home, that S had wanted P to use a condom, but P was ""like 'fuck that'"". I pressed and asked S if P had forced S to have sex without a condom. S said it was consensual, but then S said that S had wanted P to use a condom and P didn't. S even stated that ""[P] didn't [wear a condom]... No it wasn't my[S's] choice. *I wanted P to wear a condom and P wasn't listening*""

So right there's part of my question. Is having unprotected sex with someone who wanted protection, misconduct, assault, rape? More specifically someone who is inebriated, and had asked for/stated they wanted protection prior to the encounter, but still maintained afterwards that, though it was unprotected, it was consensual they[S] wanted the sex even after admitting protection, that they had previously wanted, wasn't used?

After I dropped S off at S's home, and made sure S was taken care of, I made use of the information S had given me. I took a while to decide whether it was necessary, and a while longer to steady my nerves. I confronted P the person S had sex with tonight. 

P was relatively calm about my confrontation, as I was talking to P calmly and non-confrontationally. I listened to P's side of the story. I asked/prompted P to nararte P's side. I asked questions about whether the sex was consensual, whether there was protection used, and whether P knew ( at the time) if S was all right with the use or, (in this case) lack of use of protection. Through my interviewing of P several points emerged that I think necessary to discuss. 

P brought up that when they[S&amp;P] were initially texting, tonight, P had commented to S that if S was inebriated maybe S shouldn't come over. P also commented that in previous messages S had discussed wanting protection. P started by saying S came over and was ""clearly intoxicated"" and ""too drunk for this"". P says P ended things, ""I said enough, you're too drunk for this"". When pressed P admitted to having sex with S ""for only a minute"" before P stopped it and that P did not use protection. The biggest problems I'm having with all of this is that P openly admitted that ""yes over Snap [S] wanted protection...but then when [S] was here [S] [was like] ""put it in"". 

So, we see two conflicting sides about the timeline. P says S didn't ask for protection during their encounter and S said S did. 

*Is this a situation where someone was taken advantage of sexually? What can/should I do?*

Idk if I'll be able to sleep. I may try. 

Please feel free to ask any questions you deem necessary and I will try to answer them as best as possible while keeping S and P's identity as protected as possible.

348,"I finished my A Levels and did as well as I could have based on my situation. I’ve suffered with depression for 6 years - my parents don’t know this neither would they care. 


From the day I received my results she has been verbally abusing me and throwing things at me. She has spent the days crying her eyes out. I’m so fucking over it. She’s been crying like someone’s fucking died and it is pissing me off. 


I was content with my results. I had to restart my A Levels because of extenuating circumstances. This just pissed her off and she said I’ve wasted 3 years for no reason. 


We got into a physical fight the other day. I just lost it. Something in me snapped - she started hitting me and I just got up and grabbed her by the shirt collar and kneed her. I know that’s an awful thing to do but in that moment, all the days of torment just built up and I didn’t know what else to do. From the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep she screams at me and tells me that I have no future. I have spent 16 days listening to non stop criticism of me, she has belittled me and bitched about me to her family. To make things worse, her relatives are saying the same fucking thing.


She’s telling me I have no future in life, that I’ve failed and that I should be crying and thinking to myself “what shall I do? I’ve failed.” She says Uni’s a waste of time and money - I should just drop out and get married. I have no career in journalism and that she’ll find me a husband who’ll beat me instead.


I’ve never been so depressed in my life and I feel like this is pushing me over the edge. I can’t look at her without getting angry and gritting my teeth. She asked me for help pretending like everything was okay and when I refused she said I had an attitude and was acting self righteous.

* Planning on leaving with a note at most. I don't want to be involved in a missing persons search. Is there any way to avoid one? They also can't force me to stay, right? I've had the police called on me before because of a suicide threat. Will that affect future interactions with the police? Can I file a restraining order if they try to contact me repeatedly?
* My debit card is currently linked to my father's account. Would I have to open a new one or can I just detach with the money already on it? Parents also opened loans for my education (I go to a 4-year that I'm planning on dropping out of), am I legally bound to that? 
* I'm planning on getting my drivers license this winter and leaving thereafter. Parents also offered to give me a car they currently own. If I accept it, would I still be under their insurance plan? I really have no idea how insurance works. Any advice on this topic would be helpful. I'd like to not be associated with them in any way, but I also won't have much money to start with.
* Any other general advice!

As for my living situation, I'm planning on moving in with my boyfriend (who has been immensely helpful), at least for a few months as I get set up, working for a while, then applying to community college to get a degree. We'll see what happens from there.

352,"So um I think objectively my life should not be in misery, cause when I was a teenager, I could never dream of any of the things that I have now.

I was born in Korea and until 24 years old I stayed there. My family was toxic. I mean been toxic. My father has been the most unpredictable person in my life, my mother been in her toxic relationship so you have to watch all sufferings you cannot fix and after shitting about your dad you know that person eventually will cover him up which is real pain, my brother is jobless and I think he is in depression, which really worries me.

However, luckily I could move to New Zealand in my 24yrs to study my bachelor degree. Now I am thinking back, I really tried my best to fix my life. Not because I wanted to - because I had to. Studying overseas was not cheap for my family so you would be able to imagine pressures and expectations around me. I was already 24 years old who were behind my peers. Part of me always repeated only one goal to achieve - ""Let's finish this degree. After this, I would be able to earn some freedom in my life. Let's have something ""meaningful"" after all this"".

And I guess sometimes if you imagine really hard, that might come to you. 2 years ago, I met the most amazing person in my life and that person is my partner now. Throughout our relationship, I learned lots of lessons in life from him and he is the person who I really want to protect, give my heart and until.

I graduated my bachelor degree (majoring Statistics) last November as well which officially gave my financial freedom from family. The first job was rubbish but now I moved to a big company which stays very professionally and I very much appreciate this working environment. I had a rough time to find my career path until the beginning of this year, trying to find what I want to become. The choice was between Secondary teacher and Data analyst but I am now more settled to become a Data analyst. 

I applied at least 70 companies relating to Junior data analyst but I landed the job role is not what I wanted. But as I mentioned earlier, a big company with opportunities sounded great and I believe I learn from this professional environment. However, this role is very much Customer service job - I know it is a part of the role but complaints and objections from people actually ruin my day sometimes. And forgiving myself who I put myself into this situation sometimes annoys me. I am re-assessing what I could have done differently to get a Junior data analyst role, instead of this, but what I know is I need to keep moving and griding my skill. 

And the reason why I am writing this post - is that when I want to work on career, I do not have those motivations anymore and it does not keep me going forward enough. I have fewer fears in my life and less anger which really kept me motivated. I know that my family would not haunt me anymore. I have fewer people who would judge my situations and about myself. I've been feeling I need to defend myself from the world but that is not necessary anymore. I also realised that I lean on my partner quite a big amount, which doesn't give me a bad sign, but I feel struggle to find the meaning of myself. What could be my motivation? If I want something, then do I need to get it as long as it takes? I feel less motivated and feels mildly depressed because of this.",02Sep2019,1

358,"They/Them is referees to the person 

To be fact this was mostly my fault probably. 
So during sophomore year, my friends since middle school made some new friends. I like them, friends with them still. I started pushing away as they usually never included me, and when they did they would joke about me. Sucks being sensitive, got sad most days because of this. It wasn’t all of them, just this one girl. So I slowly but surely left and just sat in a class during lunch. Ever since then, they don’t invite me to hang out with them, and the one friend I found the close started to push away from me in the one class we had together. Let’s just say I was with her through her phases and let her talk everything out and listen to her. Let’s call all the friends this. 

Mel- met in 6th grade, during P.E they would go into deep talks with me, I would always have my ears open for every rant they had. The close friend they had left them and I came along. 
Had a class with them, they started being pissy when I talked to them in class, then tried to joke it off. I saw I was getting annoying I guess. The close bond I formed broke I guess.

Mei- also met in 6th grade, we just clicked since we had the same schedule during 8th grade. Never had a class with her up until this year (Junior Year)  , they never pushed me away. We walk to school together. 

Mar- They hated me from the first time they met me. I don’t know why since I was shy ass hell. Anyhow, they would kick me and step on my shoes saying it was all jokes. Always told me I was annoying and should leave the group, that I would never live up to the friend that left.  I hated and still hate being around them, always made fun of me. My self esteem went down from them saying the same things for like 3 years. 

The Original friend group I had-

First friend: Ari- how should I start with this one, met them in 6th grade, they were alone. Made friends with them and went all the way till 8th grade. I made my biggest mistake and introduced both friends I had to each other. They clicked and started leaving me out. They had a falling out, and trying not to be on the bad side I left to hang out with my sister. I came back at the end to see that they got way closer, made new friends and excluded me. 

Second friend: Ani- I had math with them in 7th grade since I had the same schedule. We clicked, had the same like. They treated me good, and then in 8th grade I introduced them to Ari. I suddenly lost the friend that was close to me. Then Ani moved away.

When Ani and Ari had their fall out I left to hang out with my sister but eventually started hanging out with Mel, Mei, Mar. 

Both groups didn’t like each other, so I eventually just hung out with Mel, Mei, Mar.

Then came high school. 

I had my elective with Ari, she made friends with another person. They made me feel useless and would make me wash dishes all the time. I was so happy when freshman year ended. 

Then Ari and I stopped hanging out sophomore year. She made new friends, even though we promised to be best friends. Stupid young me. 

Then Mel,Mar and Mei stopped going to our hang out place during lunch. I walked alone to find them at the usual spot just to see they weren’t there. You know how much that hurt me. 

The same year I had both friend groups exclude me. I was alone, and to this day. I’m still alone. I sit alone during lunch, and then at one point Mei told me they had a gc, and I mean Mel, Mei and Mar and the other friends they made. That was the official sign that I was no longer part of the group. 

They say high school will be your best four years. They are not, they are the loneliest moments of my life, and no one is there to help me. Sure I’ve made new friends, they don’t hang out with me. They have their own group. I’m just replaceable I guess.

I have no clue what I am fewling right now and it’s been eating at me ever since I was made aware of my friend’s feelings because I don’t know if I have suddenly caught feelings for a best friend or if it’s just instinct as a best friend to care about her feelings? I also feel like it’s pretty obvious when I’ve caught feelings for someone but right now I have no clue and I’m just feeling real down in the dumps.",02Sep2019,4

The start of the nail is undamaged. There is no pain. Tonight I noticed my nail has loosened. I can lift it up a bit, but not enough to see my nailbed. Am I okay to wait for it to fall off or must I see a doctor?",02Sep2019,1
372,"I’m 22 F and my life is a complete mess right now. I just quit my shitty job a couple of hours ago because my employer thinks he has every right to shout in my face and treat me like trash for absolutely no reason when I am the best employee he has. I worked my ass off for almost two years for minimum wage and all I got was shit. That happened a few days ago and I lost all respect for him but needed the money so stayed. This morning my bus didn’t show up so I called and said I am going to be late, my manager didn’t like it. It’s the first time I’ve ever been late so I lost my shit and told her to fuck off and they can find someone else to do the rest of my shifts cause I won’t be coming back. That’s thing number one.
 Second, I am leaving for two weeks this Wednesday to visit my family abroad. I have very bad anxiety, depression and flying scares the fuck out of me. I am going alone without my boyfriend and it’s making me go insane. I can’t live without him, it just scares me. He is the only person who keeps me sane and I can trust. How am I going to cope. I’ve been a crying mess for the past 2 weeks because I can’t handle the fact I will be so far away from him for the first time in 3 years. What am I going to do now without a job? I know it was stupid but I had to keep my sanity. I couldn’t deal with the toxic staff and customers anymore. I have a little bit of savings, around 3 months worth of wages but this situation still scared the fuck out of me and I feel so alone with it. I just need someone to tell me everything is going to be fine and reassure me, it seems like I lost control of my own life and it’s just gonna go downhill. I am very unhappy and stressed right now and thinking that I’m going to die in a plane crash doesn’t help at all. Yes, I am not meds but it doesn’t seem they are helping. Does it?

375,"We've lived together for two years. Our home is in a constant state of shit everywhere. And it's all her stuff. She treats the whole place like its her teenage bedroom and I can't seem to get through to her.

For example, last week we both came back from a festival. Obviously we aren't feeling great so the place gets a bit messy. I spend friday morning cleaning the place up.  I'm 5 days into a 7 day work week doing mostly double shifts (the owner is away so I'm running the show). She's just had the Weekend off as she always does and she's completely trashed the place. Everywhere I look its all HER stuff. HER mess. Literally none of it is mine bar a few items of clothing that I had hanging on a door that I've now put away.

This is one example of my life during the past two years. I spend a good chunk of my days of cleaning. Every day off. To the point that I haven't been able to spend any time on my hobbies (I have a music production studio that I'm in big debt for that I barely get to use) and she's spent the whole weekend painting and relaxing. Something I never get to do. 

Ive told her time and time again how I feel. She knows how I feel. She isn't a bad person. She loves me and she's amazing. But this is a seriously big issue for me and I just don't know what to do. We have to have separate bedrooms because you can't see the floor in hers. It's a fucking minefield. I went in before to try and find some of my clothes she's borrowed and I almost stood on and broke her laptop that is just chilling under a jumper on the floor.

I can't express how much I hate living like this to her any more than I have done over the past two years. I just don't know what to do. I can't keep living like this. How can I get her to do her bit? She's a 31 year old woman with a steady job that she's good at. But at home she's just a child. My fucking child. I don't even want kids.",02Sep2019,1

379,"Me (25F) and my boyfriend (31M) have been together for 10 months and everything has been great. We met at work and almost immediately hit it off because we had similar music tastes and had a lot to discuss.

Maybe it’s not too relevant, but I also have anxiety (GAD) and have to take antidepressants and go to regular therapy to manage it. My boyfriend is aware of the quirks that come with it and is super supportive.

Anyway, moving on to the story. Last summer, a girl (late 20s) joined our company and his team. As normal, they went to some lunches and I guess that they bonded over their similar music tastes as well. I wasn’t together with my boyfriend yet then. A few months later, she suddenly left the company and travelled abroad due to a breakup. I later found out that the guy she broke up with was in a relationship with one of my friends previously and the guy left my friend for her.

Fast forward to a few months ago: my boyfriend randomly brings her up and says that she’s back in our country. As I did not know they chatted online, I was a bit surprised and bothered, but understood that this was most likely my anxiety talking. Apparently, she had found a boyfriend there and brought him back home. She’s still together with him, by the way. Then, a month ago I accidentally saw my boyfriend going to lunch with her, they did not see me. I was furious and I really didn’t understand what made me feel that way. After, I asked my boyfriend about his lunch and he told me that he met up with her - so nothing suspicious on my boyfriend’s side. But I was still really mad and bothered. Last week was the final straw - we went out with my boyfriend and we saw her. My boyfriend yelled her name and she came to us - hugging us both. Then, my bf started talking about music and bantering with her and I was so bothered by this. When the left, he also asked me if I have an issue with the girl.

All of it makes me really paranoid, for example I would like to know if my boyfriend has been talking with her (of course, I would never snoop on his phone, also we do not believe in sharing passwords to social media accounts and phones) and I have been imagining him turning away his phone to type (probably not true).This is so out of character for me and makes me feel a lot more anxious. I know that the issue here is not my boyfriend because he has not attempted to hide anything and has brought her up a few times himself.

I would really like to know if anyone has ever experienced a similar thing? Should I talk to my boyfriend about this? What could I do to get over this jealousy?",02Sep2019,1

I seem to notice that a lack of motivation to do almost anything is haunting me, I am worried that I will slowly enter a dark phase, in which I will not want to do much and b come complacent. I am by no means a teenager, I am 25 years old, so the lack of focus hurts my feelings even more.

382,"I'm trying to make a decision that I try not to regret in the future, and basically I have narrowed it down to 2 choices.

  
Background: I'm trying to go for a University for my bachelors, preferably with hons. Not going for university isn't a choice, unless there are jobs that pay and rise through the ranks as fast as a degree holder. One of my major goals is to move out of my country as soon as possible due to the culture and the fast paced life here (+ many other minor irks) through finding a good job overseas. (via skilled employee visa)

Choice 1: Study in an overseas university. As my parents are only willing to pay up to 50% of my tuition fees, I would have to take a student/bank loan for the other 50% of my tuition fees + my accommodation budget. It would create a financial pressure for me and to be honest, I think it would be a good motivator to work even harder for a scholarship. However, one of my trait is being a worrywart and I fear that I would be stressed out thinking about uncertainty of securing jobs to pay off the loan after I graduate etc. 

Choice 2: Study in my country. My parents will be paying 100% of the tuition fees as they only have to pay for the local tuition fee which is maybe 3-4x cheaper for a 3 year course. That would remove the financial pressure, but life would be pretty mundane and I feel that I would have lesser opportunities to achieve my goal said above. Nevertheless, I wouldn't mind it as it saves money and it could be put to greater use in the future anyway.

Which path should I take? I really want to know sincerely from a third-person perspective. Logically speaking, choice 2 would be the better option but I'm worried that the chances of achieving my said goal would be dealt a great hit. What do you guys think?",02Sep2019,1

She got into a good MBA program in the States, so I decided to move back to America to be with her while she studies. She has been there without me since June while I finish up work here. I am set to fly back in 9 days, and she just broke up with me over the weekend (really don't want to get into why right now, just want help getting through this shit). I was going to move to her new city and get a normal job for about 2 years while she does school. But now, I can't imagine being in the same city as her, and I have no idea where I should go.

395,"My Ex’s name is T. But I prefer to call her “the Adolph of the current social era”, or Hitler for short. Sound harsh? Keep reading. 

T has a tendency to control other people’s lives instead of focusing on her own. Keep this in mind as you read. 


My GF (C) and T were very close friends for about 9 years, but as soon as C and I started to get close, she was riddled with horrible disrespectful comments, and given an ultimatum by T. 

She could either choose to be with me, or stay friends with T, because, and I quote, “NO GOD DAMN BEST FRIEND SHOULD NEVER GET WITH MY EX”

Once I explained to C that no “best friend” would EVER let something so childish and immature get in between them, she decided on the former. 

And oh boy, was T unhappy. 

(I honestly expected this type of action out of maybe a grade 4 or grade 5, but to be old enough to drive, and STILL carry out this action, completely baffled me)

C and I were (from this point on and to this day) added into countless Snapchat group chats, where T and her gang of 8 girls and 8 guys with a collective IQ of three started relentlessly throwing disrespectful and highly personal comments that had nothing to do with the situation, on top of the previously reinforced statement of “NO GOD DAMN BEST FRIEND SHOULD NEVER GET WITH MY EX”. 

And what do we do to retaliate? Nothing. We just said “ok” and left, blocking all the users and turning on “Hoes Mad” by Famous Dex. 

But they keep finding ways to come in contact with us. 

So here I sit with about 5 death threats and plenty other meaningless insults, and we have to deal with this every. Single. Day. 

Oh yeah, and did I mention that 2 weeks before this even started, T got with my best friend? A little hypocritical especially considering I did nothing to retaliate. 

r/advice , this is your time to shine.

I (19F) don’t know what to do. I am completely stuck without a direction in my life. I am the youngest in my family and I also have (fairly mild) cerebral palsy. I have no aspirations of what I want to do. I don’t have a job, the qualifications I have don’t amount to a career lasting job. I have a place at uni to start in September but I fiercely don’t want to go. It is a big financial burden for my family because I am not eligible for student loans. I am in the UK and there are no jobs where I live that am suitable for as I was in hospital from 16-18 when you’d get your first job and gain experience. 

I am stuck because I have never been the person to know exactly what they want and now it’s come to a point where nobody is telling me what to do anymore. This is difficult when you’re the youngest and have been told what to do your whole live. I feel like I don’t know how to think for myself. University is never something I have wanted to do but I have a place on a Business course. I feel this will be a waste of money because there is nothing I want to do with that afterwards. 

This may sound strange or odd but I never thought I’d make it this far in life, despite the fact that I have never been suicidal or anything, I’ve just always thought I’d never be an adult. I know that sounds strange. I am having a complete identity crisis and I don’t know what to do. I can’t keep doing nothing. I have no social life left because I am embarrassed of my life at this current point and I need to change it. 

I’m sorry for the ramble I need to get this off my chest. Any advice would be helpful. I thought maybe you could help 🙂",02Sep2019,1

So I (24F) injured myself last Thursday night. I fell and I thought I had a sprain when I had a fracture in my navicular and sesamoid bones. My work kindly picked me up on Friday and brought me to the hospital where I got some mixed messages due to language barriers. This caused me to reject getting a ""soft cast"" which they wanted me to have on for the next 3-4 weeks. 

Fast forward to today and I tried to go to work by just wrapping it in some athletic support gauze and I was ready to cry by the time I made it my desk. They drove me home and I've been doing work there. They would like me to return to a hospital, preferably one with a bigger English department, to get a cast on. However, I'm hesitant for several reasons...

1. My insurance won't cover it, and even though medical costs are lower here it still worries me. It's the American in me I suppose. 
2. I feel like this is so much effort on their part. They basically have already decided to assign my job to other people for the remainder of the week even if I just come into the office to do paperwork. 
3. I have a real fear of not being believed or causing a fuss when it comes to medical things. I have the xrays the medical certificate and I just hate myself for staying home on such a deadline heavy week. I'm also afraid that the new doctor will just look at the fracture and dismiss it, and then my coworkers would've put all this effort in for nothing. Maybe the pain is just an overreaction on my part and I just need to stay off it. I mean it doesn't seem that serious. It's just a break in some bones in my foot. 

In your opinion is it worth going back to the hospital or should I just rest it and wait for it to heal on it's own.",02Sep2019,1
409,"Apologies, but this post will probably be all over the place because I can't express my thoughts clearly. (17F)


For the past 6 years I've been stuck in my house basically playing video games and doing absolutely nothing useful with my life. I'm homeschooled and this is also a reason why I never really leave because I have nothing to do since I don't have a life. 

When I was younger I'd ask my mom if I could walk to the store by myself or go to the park or just do anything a normal kid would do (I was 10-14y/o at the time) and she'd never let me do anything so I just stayed inside the house and watch TV or whatever. As I grew up this never changed. I'm never allowed to do anything and now I'm almost an adult and I know absolutely nothing about the world, I live in a smaller town and I don't know how to take the bus to the city, I don't know how to do anything financially, I don't know how to make phone calls, I don't know how to cook, I don't know how to get a job, I don't know how to do literally anything and my mom expects me to pay rent when I'm 18. She makes me cook my own meals but I have no idea how to cook so I pretty much just eat pasta or something really simple

In 7th grade I begged my mom (who is extremely religious) to let me go to public school because I wasn't really learning much from homeschooling. 
Obviously she said no and didn't let me go so now I'm about to start 12th grade and I literally know nothing because when I was younger I was fucking stupid and decided to use the internet for all my answers because my family would never help me out. (I'm an only child) Instead of trying to teach myself how to do things I just cheated on everything instead and this hasn't changed at all. 

I don't know how I'm supposed to get a job with zero knowledge of anything, I'm terrified of the future and ever since I was a kid I never wanted to grow up because honestly I don't see a purpose in life.

My childhood was okay, my mom would bring me to church and I had quite a few friends there but over the years I just had no interest in religion so I told everyone I wasn't a Christian and things changed.. my friends parents warned their kids about me, that I was corrupt or some shit so slowly I lost all my friends and got depressed which makes me not want to leave my house even more. 

My parents don't care about me at all either. Since I've had to cook for myself I barely eat anything and I'm dangerously skinny. (87lbs, 5'6"") I'm slowly dying alone in this house and honestly.. I really don't care. I'm suicidal and I've cut before to release some of the pain and my thighs are literally covered in scars, there isn't any room for more and I don't know what to do anymore. 

I don't have a good relationship with my mom and she had some family over today (altho she never told me they were coming over) and me, my cousin, her boyfriend, and my little cousin were just hanging out in my room talking and my mom came in and I got mad she didn't tell me they were coming over because I wanted to at least look decent and I didn't and she said ""I don't have to tell you anything. I have my own life"" and I asked her ""am I not a part of it?"" And she said nothing.. she just pretended to not hear me and started talking to my little cousin instead, my other cousins boyfriend just stared at her in shock waiting for an answer and I never got one. She left the room.

I feel so unwanted and unloved. My mom knows how skinny I am and won't take me to the hospital or anything. She doesn't care at all. 

The last thing I had was my cat which probably sounds really fucking stupid but I had her since I was 4 and she meant the world to me, whenever I'd cry she'd lay on my lap and just be there for me. She died in 2016 about a week before my birthday and I'm honestly just broken now. I can't let things go and I still cry whenever I see her picture or anything that reminds me of her. I have nothing now. She was the last thing I cared about. 

I'm completely broken. I'm so close to finally killing myself. I have no purpose. I have no one. I'm so fucking tired.. I don't have energy for anything. I just want all this pain to end for good..",02Sep2019,1

411,"Hi y’all, first post ever to reddit so I apologize if I break a rule or two. Also very sorry if this post gets too lengthy. 

 To start, I’ve (21F) have been in a relationship with my SO (21M) for a long time. Known him for 8 years (met through Xbox in the 7th grade), dated long distance for two or three years until he finally moved me out to live with him 2,000 miles away from my hometown. (He’s in the Navy). We’ve been living together for a year now and we have a cute lil golden retriever that I brought with me from back home. 

We’re just like most couples living together, happily in love, very serious about each other with the occasional argument here and there. We talk about marriage and having kids etc very often. I’ve always been very reserved and hesitant to trust (aka trust issues I guess?) but I’ve come a long way with my SO and I trust him completely. That is, until I recently learned that his best friend (20F) from high has recently come back into his life. They had a terrible ending to their friendship back in high school and I remember how devastated he was over it because I was there for him through it all. Anyway, she reached out to him via text and he let me know and i didn’t respond how he wanted me to just because I know how much she had hurt him. Now, he’s never given me a reason to not trust him. However, It made me incredibly insecure that he was back on talking terms with his best friend because he’s never cared about someone as much as he cared for her. I let him know it made me insecure and he said that they were always just friends. I (stupidly) asked him if he’d stop talking to her, which turned into a huge fight, which eventually resulted in me saying I’m sorry for asking for such a thing. 

Fast forward a few months, I can tell he talks to her without me knowing, I guess to not upset me, but I know it’s happening. They don’t talk daily, sometimes weeks or months go by but it’s made me feel very insecure to the point where I checked his Facebook one day and saw massages saying that they miss each other and that they think about each other a lot. Now, my SO recently went back home for a few days to visit his family and I stayed behind. I also found messages where my SO asked his best friend if she  was in town so that they could get together and hang out. All this happened while he was away and not once while he was away did he message me saying he missed me, etc. In fact, he made it seem like he didn’t have time to message me but he very clearly had these in depth messages with his best friend.  

I don’t know if any of this made sense. I guess I just want to get some outside perspective here. Am I an asshole for reading his Facebook messages behind back? Am i an asshole for not trusting him? Any advice is welcomed. Sorry for any typos, I’m on mobile and it’s like 5 am and haven’t slept.",02Sep2019,1

415,"I have been in a relationship for about 1 year and a half now and things haven’t been too great for me. 

I love the person I am with and he always makes me smile and makes me happy, he makes me warm and he keeps me safe. The only thing I’m upset about is in between all of this is arguing and sadness and hate and mean stuff. 

I don’t know what his problem is but if I ask him a question anything quite simple he would say “STOP QUESTIONING ME!!” Even if I were to ask him “why did this happen” or “did I do something wrong” he would just get so angry about everything I say or do. 

Today he was bored and there wasn’t much to do at home so he said “your not even fun anymore your just a sook and you whine a lot” which upset me a lot. 
In the past he has said things such as “I wish you were normal” and “your anxiety affects me too” and once he was talking to me and I accidentally interrupted and he was like “shut the fuck up I’m trying to talk” and then there was another time when I was talking and he interrupted and I was nicely “I’m trying to talk” and he got in my face and said “do not ever fucking say that to me again!” And then I cried and he couldn’t care less. 

He has tried to leave once because he was angry at something and I didn’t want him to and then he started recording me crying and then I took his phone and he took mine and I have it back whilst I was crying telling him to stop and that “I love you” and he didn’t give my phone back and called me a child. He called me ungrateful for almost everything, he says I use OCD as an excuse, he has to message people for me on my phone meaning my family otherwise he gets angry at me and purposely annoys me, my sister was messaging me once and he said “let me reply or I’m not cleaning up my mess”.

Lately I started to realize that my family, my friends, and my colleague happens to be hanging w/ me only when I had extra cash so that they can ask me to treat them. When they need to use my car, or ask me to lend them money only is when they will be contacting me. Yeah even my family. They wouldn't even ask me to join them whenever they having a hangout and all. I saw they posting on the social media and all. Everyday I would wake up to go to work, after going back from work then I'll be sitting doing nothing in my room. Same thing goes for everyday. I kinda sad and somehow feeling like moving out from the house and live by myself. Recently I went to Japan for a work related meeting w/ one of the local company there.

418,"I’m a part of the team that really dislikes babies and toddlers. I’ve always been the youngest of my family and haven’t really interacted with any children younger than me, so I’ve always disliked kids. Even when I was a kid, I hated kids younger than me.

As I’ve grown up I’ve become fine interacting with school-age kids (like 6 upwards, if I was to estimate) but still hate being around babies and toddlers. Mostly because of hygiene and various excrements, but also a plethora of other things.

I don’t have the closest relationship with my sibling/in-law, but we’re in a position where I’d be interacting with the child fairly frequently, so I’m not sure how to go about the situation.

429,"I just finished a fixed-term contract last week and flew home.  They want to fly me back to help them for a week because I know the project and they're coming towards a deadline. 

Here are the two arguments I'm torn between:

1. They are a good company that it would be good to have a good reference from/ be on good terms with.  Morally I feel like I should help them when they need it.  But also it might help me career-wise in the future to have them on my side.  That said, I don't want to work for them in the future and don't know how much they'd actually do to help me.

2.  I really did not enjoy the work environment.  I felt such a relief when I left.  I am at the lowest position and had a supervisor/manager that I found cold, abrupt, and inconsiderate.  There was a lot of unpaid overtime that was just taken for granted.  Sometimes I would even get grief for having to leave after 2-3 hours of unpaid overtime.  I found these conditions simply not good enough but put up with them considering my short term at the company.

I often try to push myself and place myself in uncomfortable situations but I'm starting to wonder if it does me any good.  I'm stuck between feeling obliged to help them and possibly my future-self.  Another part of me feels like it's time to start being kinder to myself and to face things I feel emotionally able to when I grow to be more emotionally/socially mature.

433,"Didn’t know where to post this. Sorry if it’s the wrong place. I just wanted to get it off my chest in a way. 

At uni years ago, I lived in a big house share at the top of the house. One night I was asleep and awoke to some noise coming into my room. It was the sound of one of my female flat mates that also lived on the top floor. She had just got home from a drunken night out. She was completely all over the place. She was whispering for me to wake up. I was still half asleep and expected her just to leave. Next thing I know I realised my blanket had been removed from on top of me. 

She had grabbed my penis and was attempting to give me a blow job. I pushed her away. She kept coming back and grabbing at my penis. She was quite forceful and aggressive and kept begging me to please let her suck me of. 

I was really grossed out by the situation. And by the fact that this girl always tried to give off an air of superiority of moral ethics over everyone else. And yet here she was trying to force herself on me sexually. I managed to get her off and out of my room. At which point a few minutes later I could hear her snoring loudly in her room which was across the hall. She snores extremely loudly. 

I never really thought about it much after. It was never mentioned. I was so embarrassed by what had happened. And I never knew whether she was too drunk to remember. Years have passed. We lost touch. She was very toxic and I distanced myself. Only to then discover she is now a leading female empowerment activist for refugees and minorities. And gives talks on all of this. It makes me sick to think of what she did to me. And here she is now talking out against the exact type of things she is guilty of trying to do herself. 

If a guy had done this to a girl at uni they would have been kicked out most likely. I can’t help but think if I had said anything no one would have believed me especially as it was a number of years ago now. But seeing her now trying to come across as this saviour of morality makes me feel nauseas. I feel frustrated that I still find it difficult to move on and just forget about it. I know if I ever confronted her maybe for some weird kind of closure or something, she would just deny it. 

I’m not sure how to feel about this and i think that’s why I’m writing. If I am over blowing feeling this way and I should just man up then please tell me. I just want to not feel such resentment as it’s bringing me down. But I don’t know how to.",02Sep2019,3057
434,"For backstory, when I was 13 years old, my 16 year old sister hung herself. I'm now 17 nearly 18 and yet I still don't know how to react when someone brings up her death in a not-so-nice manner.

It started a few days ago when a 'friend' was filming a project at a cemetery and I asked him if I could take a closer take at his clips. What I was trying to do was see if he had gotten my sister's grave in frame or not. The grave doesn't have a headstone, instead, it's a bed of raised grass which we trim, water, and place flowers on weekly, so it would be easy to notice it.

Fast forward into the next class, he asks me openly in front of 2 other people why I kept asking to look at his clips. All of them knew about what happened to my sister so then it got really quiet and awkward and I tried to change the subject, but he kept pushing at it. So I said I was trying to see if the grave was there, then I went back to my work. I turn around a few seconds later to see him putting his hands around his neck to symbolize choking (aka how my sister died), then he quickly stops when he saw me look at him. I told him to knock it off and when I turn my back, I could hear their stupid little giggles and remarks about it, but I tried my best to ignore it. 
I knew at break they would all be having the time of their lives laughing about it and making stupid jokes about it but I just tried my best to not let it get to me. I should mention that their group mainly consists of edgy outcasts who make jokes about all this kind of shit. The only reason I considered one of them to be my friend was because before this, I always talked to him in a bunch of my classes.

Then today, since we’re finishing up all our major exams, our teacher just put on a kahoot for fun. Everyone knows the only fun thing about kahoot is having stupid names like ‘ice swallowcome’ or ‘rap inkids’ or something like that. And of course the same dude thinks he’s a comedy prodigy by making his name the name of my dead sister. 
I turned around and told him to knock it off and that it isn’t funny, then I ignored him for the rest of the lesson.
My question to reddit is, what should I actually be doing? This complete asswipe is poking fun at a girl who had her whole life ahead of her and can’t even defend herself against these remarks, and along with that, he’s doing it openly right in front of me. I’m sure its easy for cunts like them to say things like that when they’ve never had to deal with such a hardship, but it’s basic respect you don’t bring up deceased people, let alone make fun of them. 
So should I cause a scene in front of the class and yell at him? Should I deck him? Should I try and tell someone? I don’t wanna be nice to him and kindly say that he is being disrespectful since that’s something you say to someone who burped after lunch or something.

437,"Hey guys. As the title says, I need some advice on how to cope with school since it starts in a week for me. 

My situation is definitely not something as severe as having suicidal thoughts or being bullied, but it has been stressful enough that I've considered speaking to a therapist about it.

I'm in tenth grade, but I'm studying abroad. I can more or less converse in the language, but I'm definitely not fluent enough to write a story or an essay without cracking open a dictionary or Google Translate. 

Growing up, I really didn't need to study as much as I do now. Despite the stress I mostly breezed through middle school with high grades. I consider myself to be a stubborn and somewhat rebellious person; I really don't like feeling trapped, or feeling that I'm wasting my time on ""useless"" things. 

The type of school I go to has been described as a ""demanding choice"". It's my second year at the school. The first year ended okay, but I have had A LOT of problems in terms of my mental health, and even physical health. I have had migraines. I have had outbursts. I have vomited due to the stress and had to be fetched once by my mom because it wouldn't stop. 

Following that incident and many more, I have come to view school and some of my stricter teachers in a negative light. I have come to resent them to a certain extent because of the homework they continuously pile onto us, even during vacations (which is two times the amount they give for weekends). It is literally nonstop. I have had to give up time with my family and my friends to be able to work on my homework, which leads to me missing out on a lot. I have little to zero time for my hobbies, like writing or drawing. When I DO have the time, I'm too drained or tired to do so. Maybe my time-management skills are lacking, or maybe I'm  blowing this out of proportion.

While I think pressure can help you learn to deal with negative situations, it can also push you over the edge if it goes over the top. And that is what I believe is happening to me. 

That said, I don't think there's much I can do but tough it out and get through four more years before graduating. Any advice on time-management and mental/physical healthcare would help me out lots. I'm sorry if I ranted too much or if this was too long.",02Sep2019,1

444,"Last sunday morning I woke up in a hospital bed in the next town over, without my coat or my wallet. I’d been drinking alone, gotten into a bad place and started talking about killing myself, concerned strangers had called me an ambulance.

The psych ward won’t take people who are intoxicated, so they let me sober up overnight to ask me again if I’m actively planning suicide. They let me walk out when I said ”no”.

Had I had money, I would’ve just gotten a train ticket home and never told a soul about this, but without it, I had no choice but to ask my family to come pick me up.

When mom asked me if I’d told my girlfriend what happened, I feared she’d try to pressure me to tell her, but she was only relieved when I said ”no”. She knows how sensitive my girlfriend is, it would just have frightened her for no reason.

I remembered the time when I was 19 and just attempted suicide, I got a few ”vacation days” from the ward to attend my cousin’s confirmation party. Mom asked me to not mention this, there’s no reason to upset and worry people needlessly, so we just got dressed up and celebrated like a normal family.

I honestly don’t even know what kind of advice I’m asking for here, but for the time being, I really don’t know what to do, think or feel about my mother sharing my fear that the love of my life would leave me if she knew how badly I’m really doing.",02Sep2019,1
445,"This is my first time posting here so bear with me but I seriously need some advice here.

So I deliver newspapers and I was lucky enough to be able to land a job in my area. This started about 5 months ago and I haven't seen anything weird until now. My usual route spans just about five relatively short roads around the where I live and I can usually finish it in under a couple hours. (It's basically just a side task.) 

So there's this one house I've been delivering to has amassed a large pile of my unread newspapers on their front porch. (I stopped stuffing it in their mail box after other magazines and advertisements clogged it.) I took notice on about the third week since it was raining heavily that week and all the yellow stained newspapers stood out. People usually take their paper in even if they don't read it right? It's basically a blockade at this point and they would seriously have to go out of their way if step over these newspapers. I looked at their house more closely for the past few weeks and realized that they never leave their trash out on the designated days.   


My only reasonable guess is that they are on an extended vacation for a couple months but even then, they didn't bother cancelling any of their mail. Maybe I'm getting too obsessive with this but I genuinely don't want to be the one that ""could've done something"" if something, god forbid, horrible happens.

In the U.K., you never have to worry about being shot since the gun laws are different so going to a country where its legal to just have one scares me alot.

It’s scary to think that a shooting can happen at any moment. Its not even that really, its just scary that when I walk down a street, there are actual people around me with guns in their pockets. I hate that. 

I have asked this question on this sub before about how to survive a shooting but I get the same answer each time, they put me at ease but they don’t reassure me sadly. “Just be aware of your surroundings”, “You’re more likely to be shot my lightning”, “Stop worrying and enjoy your vacation”, “Make sure to run in a zig zag”. 

Reading those answers just scares me to death. By simply telling me those facts just worries me really as it proves that its a real risk when going to america",02Sep2019,3
447,"Female dropping in looking for some ol’ reliable male input. I have tried to chalk this up to my anxiety getting the best of me, but it’s been weighing on me for three weeks now, and it’s made me question whether or not to even continue this relationship.

My boyfriend and I are hours away from our eight months. Everything about us is a perfect match, everything except for the exertion of love. I’m a very emotionally flamboyant partner- he has cards upon cards, some drawings, a birthday banner, even a custom commissioned drawing of us. And, quiet literally, at least fifteen plus letters I’ve written to him. On top of that, I love confessing my love to him, I love touching and holding hands, I love pda, and for the most part he reciprocates.

Where our disconnect lies is when we aren’t together. His texts are dry, I feel like I might as well be talking to one of my male friends. I send sweet texts that I feel get overlooked. He isn’t a confessional type of guy, though he tries his best to validate his love for me when I ask. I asked him tonight if he has a difficult time expressing love, to which he replied yes. And that he has always been this way. I thought maybe finding the right one would change that, or at least improve it. I feel he may show me how much he loves me in smaller, less “in your face” ways, not like I who would literally scream it from a rooftop if I was asked to. I can come to terms with there’s a possibility I’m overlooking the small things he does to validate how much me loves me.  But as of right now, I’m just feeling lost and disconnected from him. I’m worried me worrying about this so much may be our demise. Can any male comrades sympathize with him so that I know isn’t a deal breaker?",02Sep2019,12

I didn’t have this problem I’ve only had my phone for 4-5 months and then it started happening out of nowhere. I don’t leave my phone out in the open I usually wrap it with some rags we have at the shop and I leave it in my tool box just cause I don’t want my phone to mess up (which I clearly failed at).

450,"I know, luxury problem, but the decision is causing me a lot of stress. I have two jobs, I have not started any of them officially. The pay is similar.

The first is a job at a café. The coworkers are really nice, it’s relatively close (like 15-20 mins away) and the vibe is nice. It is however quite stressful, I mean it’s a café. I have been to two test shifts. There is a lot to learn and honestly I don’t drink or like coffee. So personally I am conflicted on that one a lot because it has many positive things to offer. Also the boss is nice.

The other one is at a bookstore. I would rather work there based on personal interests but it is further away (40 mins away). I have not had a test shift there so I have no idea if the coworkers are nice. I imagine it’s not very busy. Also, I would like to avoid working around food, eat it all the time if I can lol.

451,"I’m 22 and I’m currently a nursing student. I live at home with my mom and she’s a single parent so I know it’s stressful. For as long as I can remember, she has always dumped her emotional baggage on to me.As young as middle school age, I remember her asking advice on men she’s dating and I would give this advice. I knew nothing about boys even my own age, let alone grown men. Hearing about her personal struggles all the time is draining to me. 

She’s always voiced her concerns on how she doesn’t make any money, how she needs a better job, how she wishes she would have went to grad school and how no one cares about her, no one ever helps her, etc. she asks for help every day and either I or my younger sister help her. We pay her bills online, help with yard work, shovel , take out the garbage, do her laundry, vacuum her room, cook for her after work, call her Uber’s because apparently she can’t download the app on her phone, walk the dog, etc on top of taking care of ourselves and trying to focus on school and work. If we miss a day then that equates to us never cleaning the house, us being lazy, us always having to be told what to do, how no one in the house can function without her, etc. Conversely , my sister and I do our own thing . I started to cook for myself when I was in elementary school, started doing my own laundry at around 14, started taking myself to the doctors and running errands on my own and I take public transportation everywhere which is no problem. We don’t ask her for anything or even learn on her for emotional support because of how stressed and tired we know she is and we never have but she leans on us a lot for emotional support and I just don’t know if it’s appropriate.

 I will say that the house is messy sometimes. My room is a  mess and I have to clean the bathroom. I’ll come home and see dishes in the sink and go straight to my room because I’m tired and don’t want to be bothered. I’ll tell myself I’ll sweep the living room later but never get around to it. 

iher constantly asking for help is draining. I don’t mind helping but if I’ve just come home from being at school from 9 to 5 or if I’ve just gotten in from work then it’s a different story. She’s woken us at like 6 am asking for help for things she should handle on her own, I’ve woken up to long text messages on things that’s she dealing with and needs help with. I have things in my own life I need to worry about. I struggle with things myself and I don’t tell her because I know for a fact she wouldn’t be able to emotionally support me and would believe that I don’t have a reason to feel the way that I do. Also, my oldest brother (who doesn’t live with us) has always struggled with his mental health. I know she struggles with dealing with him but I just don’t know if I can deal with him myself when he’s in a really down mood. And I feel awful. I feel like an absolute shit head and I probably am. But...I just don’t have it in me to worry about other people when I feel like I’m barely hanging on. 

I just feel like I don’t have it in me to support and check on them when I’m running on E and stressed out myself. But am I a jerk for feeling this way? Am I wrong?",02Sep2019,1

455,"So my girlfriend and I recently moved into my parents house while she finds a job. It was out of state so I quit my current job and am waiting to see where my girlfriend gets a job before looking again. Each day goes by and I seem to be doing the same shit, asking her about her job search, etc. 

my girlfriend and I have had our issues like any normal couple. I’ve been hit hard by some of these and have worked through a lot (she never cheated, just other issues). I’ve been getting down on myself and not been staying busy enough so these have affected me more recently and I’ve asked her for reassurance for a couple of the things.

When I ask for reassurance however, it upsets her which ultimately upsets me. We have been good for about a week now, no reassurance or anything like that. I love this girl with all my heart (even though times get tough sometimes). However, now I am anxious all the time. I can’t pinpoint what it is but here is a couple other things that could be my issue

-going to weddings where I’ll see people I don’t want to see
-not having a job (even though I’m happy around my family in the meantime)
-not knowing which state we will end up in
-not knowing if continuing to wait will affect my relationship

I’ve seen a therapist in the past with things that have happened between my girlfriend and I. I’ve moved states so I’ll have to find another one if that is the case. My only issue is my parents didn’t know I have seen a therapist and my dad being the macho “man up” kind of guy idk what they would say if I told them where I was going.

Idk, it wouldn’t bother me so much, but he’s told me plenty of times that he prefers tall skinny girls, and I’m super average in both height and weight. 

Like, at his work party, he was talking with one of his coworkers who happened to be super pretty, and their faces were SO CLOSE when they were talking, it felt weird to me. 

And at his family’s house the other night, it kinda felt like he was following his brother’s girlfriend around...? Not his brother, because his bro wasn’t around her the whole time. It seemed like he was specifically choosing to be around HER.

I don’t feel like these women are flirting with him or giving off any signals, but I don’t know about him. He’s always complaining about me when I get home, how he spends time with people who “get things done,” and how he feels like I’m not one of those people. I’m trying, but I have to save up a lot of money and pay off stuff before I can really get started doing what I want to do... it’s a long story. I’m trying to be smart about stuff and plan ahead, not just be impulsive. 

But I’m starting to think he has a thing for that girl he works with, at least...? And I know he thinks his brother’s girlfriend is super hot, he’s checked her out, made comments on how she “sure likes to show a lot of skin,” and... all that. And he complains about me to my face. I’m afraid to bring any of this up to him, because he has the tendency to just want to “break up” whenever there’s any conflict. Then when I’m prepared to leave, he insists I stay because he loves me...?

458,"For the past year I've been working on an organic vegetable farm. The only problem with working on an organic vegetable farm is the pay. It's dismal. Paycheck to paycheck and a pretty tight belt. Though I do get free food all the time. But free food doesn't put gas in my tank.

I quit a lucrative career in automation integration to be a farmer. It's a decision I dont regret. I'm extremely passionate about farming and had very little interest in automation. I disliked the atmosphere and the work in general. Was also very depressed during that time and dreaded work every day.

Now? Not so much. I'm actually quite eager to get dirty on the farm.

But today was a kind of wake up call that seems to be pulling me every which way. I woke up to a flat tire and an empty gas tank. Meaning I couldn't get to the farm today. Going to catch rides with a coworker but I still wont have the money to replace the tire for some time. 

So I'm in a pickle. Do I continue making hardly above minimum wage doing something I love and am extremely happy with or do I go back (old boss says I have a position at the automation integrators if I ever want to go back) and work a job I loath but pays 5x what I make on the farm?",02Sep2019,1

461,"Okay, so your instinctual response is probably an automatic YES. Here’s the situation and why I have hesitated. I am conflicted and nervous about the whole situation.

*This all began last summer.*
I had no idea he was married. We met on an app, went on a date, hooked up the first night. It was my first time ever going on a date or meeting someone I really liked/was attracted to (despite being recently out of an arranged marriage, but that’s another story for another time). I’m open to admitting I was dumb and naive. He was in the army and had moved to my state/town when assigned to the nearby base.

We were inseparable for days. He immediately started telling me that he was falling for me, that we would make beautiful babies, he adored me, pet names, etc. I thought I’d finally found the boy of my dreams. 

One night, he randomly mentioned that if I ever saw him on Snapchat with a ring, it was because he’d liked to wear them since he was a teenager. That made sense to me, because growing up, my brothers had done the same thing. I didn’t think twice.

Now, I didn’t have social media apart from Snapchat at the time. And it never occurred to me that I should “snoop” or investigate someone. I trusted him at face value.

In fall of that year, after nearly living together because we were constantly at each other’s places—after I’d met his friends on base—he told me he was about to deploy for nearly a year, but first he wanted to make a trip to his home state and say goodbye to his parents. He wouldn’t be able to see me when he returned because he would “deploy immediately.” I cried on the couch the night before and he held me, then he said, “You love me, don’t you?” I nodded. He didn’t say anything in return until hours later, when he woke me up to say he loved me, too.

The next morning, I took someone that I thought was *my* soldier to the airport and kissed him goodbye.

A week later, he hadn’t texted me much except for a few selfies, and I got a weird, sinking feeling in my stomach. I decided to get on Facebook and look him up for the first time. Just to see what he was up to.

And there was his profile picture, updated the day before—he was in uniform, wedding ring on his hand, arms wrapped around his beautiful and very pregnant wife.

I have never felt pain like that before. Checking out her tagged profile, they had just gotten married. She was due soon.

Immediately I texted him that I knew, and that this was horribly wrong. I felt terrible guilt and said I wanted to tell her, and he threatened me. I was scared because he knew where I lived and had friends in the area, so I promised I would keep my mouth shut and deleted his number.

A few weeks passed and he *did not* deploy, but returned home. I only know because he hit me up again on text. He told me “the truth” - which was that she was his high school girlfriend and had made him miserable, but after she got pregnant he had no choice except marriage. He told me that he had never felt about anyone the way he felt about me. He begged me to meet up with him, to see him—and then he got horny and aggressive. “You’ll always belong to me,” “You know you’ll never want anyone else,” etc. He constantly tried to call me, but I wouldn’t answer.

I almost met up with him. I mean, I still had feelings for him despite the hurt. But I decided to block him and move on with my life.

I have screenshots of all our conversations. Explicit ones with timestamps. If I wanted to prove that he had been seeing me, and also that he wanted to cheat again after the reveal, I could without a shadow of a doubt.

I hesitated because I didn’t want to cause a pregnant woman distress. And then she had the baby, and I’ve seen photos of them all as a “happy family”—all while knowing the kind of man he is.

Anyway, it’s been a year. My current S/O is also in the military and wants me to tell this guy’s wife and report him to his superiors, because something like this can get him kicked out of the army. I am stressed because I am terrified of his threats. He was a rougher kind of person before I met him, and I don’t know what he’s capable of...I don’t want to be a statistic.

It also breaks my heart to think of his wife finding out. And his child growing up potentially fatherless, even though he’s a total dirtbag.

Tl;dr - dated a guy who turned out to be married and a father, who wanted to keep seeing me even after I knew. Should I report him to his superiors and destroy his career? Should I send the screenshots and details to his wife and destroy his family?

I feel like such an asshole and disgusting for being “the other woman.” Anyway. Let me know what you think!",02Sep2019,3

However at the time I had a lot of mental/alcohol problems and she says that she didnt think I was ready for a relationship or that I needed one which to be fair is true.  Im just now finding this out and this happened  around the time we first started working.  So fast forward to now, I've openly admitted my feelings for her multiple times and she feels the same and we spent the majority of the past 3 days laying in her bed and talking and kissing and holding each other and all that.  However the problem is she started dating this guy in May.  But shes kind of dating this guy out of pity.  Hes a close family  friend whos a bit older and suffered an accident years ago that makes him unwilling (because of anxiety) to leave his house most days.  They started dating in May and he told her he intends to propose to her and he and her mom went ring shopping.  Its kind of like her whole family knows him and expects this of her.  So basically she said we cant be together even though she wasn't in love with him.  And I basically just poured my heart out to her and told her how I feel. Again.  I told her she's  all I think about and idk if we'll work out but I would do anything for that chance and all that hallmark channel stuff.  She said she needs time to figure out whats going on and that was yesterday and now I'm so nervous. I haven't felt this way about someone in a long time.  Is there anything I should do right now?  Should I text her or ask to see her? I kind of just said okay I'm going to sleep so I didn't have to text her because I was nervous.

I work as a teaching assistant at an elementary school. A year ago, I was in a kindergarten classroom with the lead teacher. The teacher I worked with was, overall, good to work with. However, my last year working with her, she seemed to develop quite a temper and could be pretty irritable with both the kids and others. One day, one of the kids told me he had wet their pants. I know, of course, to just take him to the nurse to get him a change of clothes. So before I was going to do that, I wanted to let the lead teacher know so she would know where I was going and that I didn't just randomly leave without telling her. So I go up to her and say, ""so and so had an accident"". She immediately turns to me and yells very loudly and condescendingly, ""WeLl, YoU'rE gOiNg To HaVe To TaKe HiM tO tHe NuRsE tO gEt HiM a ChAnGe Of ClOtHeS!!"" Right in front of the kids, and as if I was a clueless child who had just gotten in trouble. At that moment, I could have just very calmly said, ""I know, I was just letting you know"" and left to the nurse's office. But for some reason, I never said anything. I didn't stand up for myself. And a year later, I still think about it almost everyday and get very upset, angry, and embarrassed about it. It just pisses me off that she thought what she did was even remotely okay. There's was absolutely no reason for her to treat me that way. I am a good TA, and a good and intelligent person. I don't a grown ass adult screaming at me for something I already fucking know. 

God, it happened a whole year ago and look how angry I still get about it? I don't hate her. I don't even dislike her. 90% of the time, she was very kind to me and helped me out a whole lot when I was working on getting my own classroom. But I still get so upset about it. It's too late now to say anything to her about it now, isn't it. God, I wish I could just calmly explain to her what happened and how I feel about it and explain to her that I already knew what to do when that child had his accident (because, you know, I'm not a complete idiot). I already see a therapist and she knows about that whole fiasco. But I don't think she knows that that one specific situation still bothers me to this day, and I can't see her again until the 25th.

Sorry for the grammar mistakes

I'm writting to you because I feel like some of our human rights laws have been broken in Estonia. Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights prohibits slavery and forced labour and says that it does not take effect on any service of military service. Now here's the problem, in Estonia we have mandatory military service when you turn 18 and you can get an extentsion for about 4 years. Now the question is that are they allowed to force people in to the military who have mental illnesses or people who suffer from migraines and all sorts of condistions. Because the Estonian military is forcing people who don't have the right mental state to hold a weapon to join the military forces and also people who suffer from migraines that can be caused by loud gunshut and sitsuatsion with a lot of stress. Migraines can make someones life a living hell because it causes nasuea, intense headaches and vomiting for up to 2 days and it can happen many times a month. And if you give a gun to someone who isn't in the right mental state or someone who suffers from ad/hd it can end really badly. Also our military has forced people with for example post traumatic stress syndrome into the military aswell saying that if they don't they will get fined up to 400 euros and it will keep increasing. Also they send people with traumas, for example me growing up in a family where my brother was a soldier I was shown him losing his mind and willing to commite suicide while in the army because of everything and that makes it hard fore me, and even a psychologist said that I have a trauma. Estonia has had many military suicides and people coming out of the military with even more mental problems. I may be over my head with all of this and I wouldn't be shocked if I was but I need to know if this counts as ruining our rights as humans. I hope someone can help me and give me advice on where to go with my problem.",02Sep2019,1
471,"Idk if I'm posting in the right community, so please point me in the right direction if this post belongs somewhere else.

My step mom recently lost a child to substance abuse and it's been really hard on everyone in the family. She keeps sharing a link to an organization for donations, which is fine and all, but I personally don't believe in monetary donations because I'm just skeptical of a lot of organizations using donation funds for things other than the cause. She hasn't said anything about it but I feel like as a closer family member it's my duty to donate, even though I'm on a very strict budget and like I said, don't believe in it. Is there anything else I could offer to do in this specific situation where I'd still be helping the cause without giving money?

On that note, how can I be a supportive person to her? I didn't know her child super well, but we have all been family for almost a decade now so it's still a significant loss and even if we aren't very close, I'd like to be sensitive and sympathetic, but I don't want to come across as disingenuous. I truly do feel for her loss and want to do anything I can to help her through this time, and I can't imagine the heartache and pain. Any advice is welcome, thank you in advance.",02Sep2019,2

Additionally, both parents seem to have hang-ups in that: my mother refuses to work full-time, and may very well be a narcissist; and my father is an alcoholic with very bad money management.

I am due to begin work this month, and although it has been promised that I won't be solicited greatly for assistance, I feel like with one parent refusing to work, more burdens will be pushed onto me.
Other than refusing certain requests I honestly don't know what to do. It bothers me to be strict with financials because my little sister gets caught in the cross-fire (I have contemplated moving and taking her with me, but I don't like the idea of taking that responsibility simply because both parents refuse to go speak to a counselor and get their shit together).

479,"so, my best friend of 3+ years (lets call her alison) is supposed to meet my long distance friend on friday. (its now monday for me) alisons boyfriend tags along.

she gets there suuuper early. we all agreed on 3, she sends a voice message at 1:30 saying that shes at the meeting place. my friend and i are in a high pay entry place, so we cut it short, missing a lot of what we wanted to do. 

a little backstory to alison is that she has a long history of flaking out and messing up plans just because she can. she is on her phone a lot although selectively replies to a lot of people, leaving them feeling insecure about their friendship with her. she has ALWAYS been like this, for as long as i can remember. as for her boyfriend, i dont mind him, he’s alright. a bit problematic, but whatever makes her happy. 

we go to the meeting place, a 5 or so minute walk, and let her know we’re there. 10 mins go by, no reply. i call her, no answer. i give her the benefit of the doubt and wait another 20 minutes. i call her again. no reply. at this point, i already know whats happened. i break down crying that shes let me down yet again.

we check her location 40 minutes later and alison is at home, with her boyfriend. whatever. i go home, and settle down. shes been active on all socials, and has watched my snapchat story. ah, whatever. im kind of used to it at this point, but im still upset.

a sleepover for me and alison was planned for today. yesterday i went out and bought lots of snacks and paints and revision and activities for us to do, all of her favourite things. later that night, i text her saying that im excited. she opens my message and ignores it. i get a little unsettled, but, again, give her the benefit of the doubt. she posts on her instagram. i send her a question mark, she opens and ignores that too.
i just leave it and go about my own for a few hours. then, dhe messages me. 

“hi, ive argued with my mum, i cant come. sorry.”

then my stomach drops. being her best friend, i KNOW this isnt true. ive seen her type this to people about future plans whilst im RIGHT NEXT to her. if anything, im upset that she used such a cheap excuse on me. 

this has happened numerous times before. on another occasion i waited outside her house at night for 3 hours without a word from her in hopes that she’ll open the door. she was ‘asleep’. i saw her move in the window. 

i know part of this reoccurring is to do with me being so soft and a big pushover and hating confrontation. please go soft on me haha. thanks everyone, anything is deeply appreciated!",02Sep2019,1

484,"This is a serious post. No, I'm not trolling. (Saying this because I've never really gotten any responses on my previous advice posts. If that matters.)

It all happened on a recent trip that I took with my friends for a short escape. 

We were having drinks during our second night that led to all of us feeling very intoxicated. Knowing that I just needed to sleep the alcohol off, I went up to the room myself to get some rest. 

The next morning, I wake up to a text from one of the female friends claiming that she had sexually violated her in her sleep. (We were all sleeping together in the same room.) She wrote, and I quote, ""I felt his hand move up and under my shirt. I feel so ashamed of myself. I tried moving away from him to indicate that I wasn't consenting to what he was doing but he kept touching me."" 

At dinner, I heard from the other friend that Jim had made sexual advances on her too, from that same night. Apparently, as they were cleaning up after our session, she saw that he was feeling really sad because of his recent breakup and tried to comfort him, only to be greeted with him kissing her neck. Probing deeper, apparently this wasn't the first time that he's made sexual advances on these two girls. But I don't know much about that so I'll leave that out.

It's been almost a full day since this all happened. So far, they've only told their significant others, close friends, and me about this. I've encouraged them to try and see if anyone else has been a victim of his actions and to talk to their parents about this. But I'm not sure if that'll suffice. Since Jim is also a friend of mine, I want to shed light on his behaviour to help protect future girls from sharing the same date as my two friends, I just don't know how. 

For those of you who have had experience dealing with this, or have gone through it, what should I do? I don't condone his behaviour and want my girl friends to not feel the shame of being violated. Should they call the police? Call his actions out on social media? What's the best thing to do here?

In the summer though I worked at a great company (a job that everyone thought was stressful) and I was so relaxed there compared to uni. 

Come school time, I didn’t even select a lot of my courses until the final month because I just didn’t feel like it. I dreaded the thought of going back to all that stress.

Seeing as I've been steadily putting on weight these last couple of years and feeling worse, I've recently taken that on. 
However, I've found it increasingly difficult (and expensive) to continue with this diet as a vegetarian. I'm spending hours preparing food from scratch everyday with some costly ingredients. I dont see it as something I can continue long term. 
This is why I'm considering eating meat again. It would make things much simpler and easier. However I cant help but feel selfish with this descision because I still believe eating meat is unethical and inhumane.

490,"This is really embarrassing for me to talk about and the first time that I’ve ever spoken about this. I’ll keep details limited in case somebody I know finds this. 

When I was around 13 - 15 I had a terrible self esteem, I was suicidal with severe anxiety and depression, in therapy and on medication, etc. I went online to find friends because I had none IRL. I ended up being on the bad side of the internet, with a lot of pedophiles and not enough awareness about it. Long story short, a few men in their twenties had earned my trust and asked for naked pictures and I sent them. One had even threatened me with a dox which led to more being sent. For a few months, everything was in the clear and seemed fine until my 16th birthday. My photos were leaked in a group chat of hundreds of people and I was humiliated. I didn’t want to delete the app because I still had friends I emotionally depended on there, so I stayed and kept a low profile. 

Now I’m 17 and in a 8 month relationship IRL. I made a group of my own to feel safe in, but I’ve been in a few groups with new people. I messaged nobody privately and kept everything PG, but have found new enemies. They hate me because I’m a woman. This sounds like a joke but it isn’t. They talk about their disgust and hatred for women every hour so they’re now targeting me, planning to spam my group. They’ve also dug up embarrassing photos and videos of me, not nude fortunately, but I’m afraid they’ll post the rest. I’m pretty sure the pictures are being exchanged privately but hasn’t gone public yet. The same happened to another girl recently who was then doxxed and forced to masturbate on camera.

492,"I decided to stay at home for my upcoming first year at university, following an unpleasantness experience at another university last year of which I left just before Christmas.  


Having had a bad experience in halls last year (flat above me would have parties until early hours at least twice a week and my flat mates were....dodgy.... - although not the reason I left uni) I thought that staying at home would be the best option and due to my bad experience I wanted the reassurance of family at the time. This means a 1 1/2 hour bus ride into uni everyday.  


Now that I'm a lot closer to starting at this new university and I'm talking to people on my course and planning for the year ahead I've realised I may have made a mistake. In my course group chat everyone is getting really excited about accommodation and they're talking about it a lot. When I told people on my course that I would be living at home their first comment was that I would miss out on uni life - something I didn't really consider until now.  


I've been really looking forward to freshers and all the cool events that are going on. As someone who didn't get to go to parties in college I really felt like I missed out on the fun, but now that I've actually come to planning it I've realised how unrealistic attending any events is going to be. How would I get home? A taxi would cost way too much and whilst there is a late bus its very unreliable and I also value my life! With events starting around 10pm (same later) and costing a ridiculous amount for a student, I don't want to have to leave the events early in order to get home.  


Now I've thought about the logistics I've realised that this will apply all year round. I won't be able to just go out with my friends without having to go early. I also fear that this will impact my ability to make close friends as I won't live near them and it won't be as easy for me to hang out with them.  


But what do I do? I thought about accommodation in the city but I have no one to share with and am worried about repeating past experiences.

* *Hestiad*\-  2000 years ago, an alien race known as the Qacaans brought fleets of  curious Earthlings to a continent on an alien world known as Nellas.  Most of the Earthlings hailed from the Mediterranean, and as they  populated and settled the continent, a new culture emerged, based in  their Earth-Mediterranean roots. This alien world gave rise to many new  types of humans, such as the Furyans— people capable of great monstrous  power, forged in fire by the Greek gods themselves. Melaina, a Furyan  warrior in search of her Legend-Name, becomes the guardian of Phoenix, a  hermaphrodite who spent most of his life locked away from the world.  The blunt yet sincere Melaina, together with the timid yet compassionate  Phoenix, travel the equally magnificent and dangerous world of Nellas.  Together, they will learn more about themselves and each other; Phoenix  will find the strength to accept herself, and Melaina will discover the  true extent of her powers. Their journey is as much an inward one as an  outward. Tone/Theme: drama, romance, action, adventure
* *Hearthfire*\-  Ever since childhood, Knoori Pond has always looked up at the stars  with longing. He doesn’t know why, but suspects it is related to the  recurring dreams he has. As such, Knoori has endeavored to become an  adventuring bard, to travel the worlds and write tales of thrilling  adventures. On the eve of nearly reaching his goal, Knoori rescues the  injured Iusha K’nuccenya A’kass, and is suddenly filled with awe and  determination. His new aim is to become a Iusha just like her, traveling  virtuous knights who follow a strict code and wear specialized armor.  Honor-bound, and feeling an odd sense of kinship with Knoori, K’nu will  agree to train him. But the path to become a Iusha is not an easy one.  Their travels, trial,s and tribulations will reveal much about them. Tone/Theme: drama, romance, action, adventure
* *The Higher Ones*\-  On the continent of Matalamullu, three races have been at constant  warfare: the winged, halo-bearing bird-like people known as the  Anunnaki, who hold great power bestowed by their goddess; the Sunura,  who are the twisted, monstrous, corrupted forms of the Anunnaki; and the  Kabbidimmyr, often seen as a heretical reflection of the Anunnaki, for  they have no halo, only one wing, yet hold even more power than them.  Anunnaki will often begrudgingly employ Kabbidimmyr to kill the Sunura,  since they are more powerful. Liora, a Kabbidimmyr knight, wanders the  countryside in search of a specific Sunura. Along the way she meets the  energetic and optimistic Michi, a counter to Liora’s cold demeanor. In  her quest to hunt down Sunura, Liora and Michi will make unlikely  friends as they uncover the secrets of their world. Tone/Theme: serious, drama, romance, action, adventure, mild horror
* *Into the Wilds*\-  On the cold and unforgiving planet of Halba, Junko leads a solitary and  lonely life. Cast out from Halban society, Junko lived in the Wilds,  the savage dense forests that dominate nearly half of the world. With  eyes that turn people to ice, and a sword that can cut through anything,  Junko made her living as a sword-for-hire. She becomes the bodyguard of  Miyuka, a famous geisha-in-training. Junko looked upon her with awe as  the ideal opposite of herself, seeing Miyuka as perfect: beautiful,  poised, civilized, and beloved. Charged with the task of escorting her  and her house through the treacherous Wilds, Junko and Miyuka realize  that they are not so different. The dangers and mysteries of the Wilds  soon reveal much about her and her charges. Tone/Theme: drama, serious, adventure, mild horror
* *Star-Crossed*\-  The world of Herimia is a harsh and cruel place, broiling deserts cover  the land. The planet often acts as a penal colony, outcasts and outlaws  are sent to this world to die, which has created a culture equally as  harsh and uncaring as the planet itself. People claw and grasp for their  own meager slice of the pie. Tsi’onia L’chonchia is one such person,  after many tribulations and a case of mild amnesia, she has become the  leader of a successful mercenary company known as “Star-Crossed”. This  acrobatic gunslinger is well-liked by her crew, a rag-tag team of  miscreants and outcasts, forming their own strange, dysfunctional  family. Though Tsi’onia has other goals, she has spent most of her life  searching for a long-lost childhood friend, one of the few things  Tsi-onia can remember from her past. This girl Tsi’onia once only knew  as a princess locked away in a tower of stained-glass. Many of her crew  think she’s mad, but Tsi’onia is adamant that this person exists and  that she will not stop until she finds her, believing her strange,  ancient, alien scythe to be the key to it all. Tone/Theme: drama, action, adventure, comedy
* *Xiuhcoatl*\-  The vast, oceanic world of Vathalassa is home to many beauties and  wonders. A paradise below the sea. However, the life of luxury and  finery is not for everyone, for the twins Moctezuma it was a life of  cages and rules. A culture that treats twins as two-halves of one whole,  the twins had no identity of their own, and had their whole lives  plotted out due to their status. Having enough of a life of golden  chains, the twins broke for the surface, the many islands that cover the  planet. While the under-world is one of finery and civility, the  over-world is one of savagery and lawlessness; but it is also a land of  pure opportunity, which the twins sought after. The two seek their  fortune and identity as pirates, while being hunted by other pirates as  well as agents sent from their homeland to bring them home. Tone/Theme: comedy, adventure, action
* *Tveir Dis*\-  The dense jungles of Poludendrea are filled with gods, monsters,  mysteries, and wonders. A world where the spiritual and physical is one  and the same. A disgraced Grahtwood knight named Hjordis finds a new  life and purpose as the guard and bond-mate of the princess Eydis, who  holds the soul of a god, key to renewing the life of her people and the  forest. But there are those that want the god-soul for themselves, the  pyromancer Godric seeks to corrupt the god-soul and use it to level the  forest for his people. A struggle invocative of the cycle of life  itself. Can Hjordis protect her princess and the heart of a god from  Godric’s clutches? Tone/Theme: serious, drama, action

We first found out when she bought 10 iPhones for a man on my husbands ATT account about 2 years ago. From what we can tell, In January of this year she started talking to a very aggressive Catfish. She pawned all her jewelry and cashed in a large IRA for him. He had her set up a bitcoin wallet and was taking her entire disability check the second it hit her account (he was still actively taking money as she was dying in the hospital). She was also buying him large Amazon gift cards. This caused her to take herself off of the Liver Transplant list because she couldn't afford to keep going to the doctor every month like they require for that.

506,"I have been struggling with depression and anxiety in last 5 years, but in the last 2 years I have managed to help myself and I am not in as a nearly dark place as I used to be. Here in my country, everyone tells you that you should finish college because that is how you won't have to work bad jobs for minimum wage, etc. (obviously not true but anyway). So I was forced into going to a college I have 0 interest in because I could not make it into my first-choice college (competition is huge and there is only one college here with what i wanted to study). When I noticed that this college started influencing my mental state I took a year off but my mother did not let me drop out even though I was begging her and crying because I am absolutely NOT interested in what I am studying. I am at this point wasting 2 years of my life because my mother simply can't understand that I don't want to do this. I have been living in fear for the last 2 years of this moment. All I need is support from my parents, to tell me that everything is going to be okay and that things will work out (we aren't poor, a roof above the head, food in the fridge etc.) Sadly they will never ask me what I want. Anyway, my plan is to go work and either get married to my boyfriend when he graduates and move to him and enroll in college I want in the USA (boyfriend just wants me to be happy and he thinks if I want to enroll again that i should try) or save money and move to a different city to study what interests me there.  My main problem is that I lack courage on how to deal with this whole situation since the date when I will have to tell my parents that I failed my exam is coming near and that there is gonna be a lot of stress, disapproval, embarrassment and yelling. I just want to finally move on from this hell in my life but I am afraid of the future. How do I get the courage to deal with all of this stress and not be as afraid of the future?  
TLDR : about to fail out of college I hate, parents are gonna make my life hell with complaining and they don't care that it is ruining my mental health. I plan to enroll later in life into what I want to when I get the money to move out and pay for the college on my own.

507,So I 14M was having a long conversation last night with 13F and I brought up how beautiful she was but she then claimed that it wasn't true and that she looks terrible. So I then spent almost an hour telling her why she looks like the best girl I've ever seen but she never accepted it and said if I kept trying to convince her she would go (this is over texting btw.) But I didn't give up and kept persistent. So she then just said bye and left.  Should I of just accepted it or should I of said something different to her in order to change her view? I just feel so upset whenever I know she's unhappy. Any help would be appreciated guys.,02Sep2019,1
508,"Hello, I (M23)was born in the Middle East but I have spent most of my life in Germany (18y) and I mostly haven’t been confronted with racism aside of the dark humoured jokes me and my friends make, The vast majority of my friends are even German so I wouldn’t even assume that „Germans in general are racist“ or anything of that sort.But in the past week I came across around a few Situations where I didn‘t know how to handle it. 
E.g. I was at a party the other day were my friend had me as his tag along, we called in prior to make sure it’s okay if I come with him, they approved. It seemed like everybody there was cool with me. But later on someone asked me if I wanted so go into another room (we were all in the same room at that time). And didn’t have a reason not to so I went. A few minutes later the person that took me to the other room told me that the girl in the back seemed very unhappy with my presents there and wanted me out of the room. Sometime later I went to the other room to get my bag and she started complaining again the moment I came in, this time loudly so I could hear it, and asked what business i had there in an quite agressive way. I just said that I wanted my bag and she just grunted afterwards and looked annoyed until I left. Later on more people came to the other room to apologize to me about her friend and to hang out. Btw I actually had a fun pretty fun night besides that.  That carried on through the whole night some time later she was crying on the floor because her friends confronted her with why she was so mean to me. She said she didn’t want to be mean or exclude anybody and there were just too many people for her in the room, but after that it still wasn‘t okay If I was in that room even if some of the people where hanging in the kitchen or other rooms to have private conversations. Even everybody was allowed to stay there but after the actual guy living in the apartment left for an appointment he had she kicked me out. On my way home I thought that it might’ve been racism because I realized that I was the only none white person there.

E.g. 2 
When i‘m at work sometime my boss goes on racist Tangen about all of the immigrants in Germany and that their ruining our country. I only stand there trying to argue in a polite manner that not every immigrant hast to be a bad person and that being „bad“ differs from person to person and not from nationality to nationality. But they just shrug it off and go on again about the „violent“ Muslims 

I don’t know if I should just ignore things like that or confront people with my views, in the worst-non violent cases of confrontation (that happened to me a with the grandma of my ex girlfriend) people just dismiss my arguments BECAUSE I am an immigrant and that I couldn’t tell.

I don't mean things like sitting at a computer and taking an insane number of surveys for pennies (or less) each.

513,"I [19M] have been dating her [18F] for a bit over two years now. When we started the relationshiop I made it very clear that I'm rather possessive when it comes to sexuality and nudity and that monogamy is an absolute must. She agreed and told me she feels the same.

Since we aren't located near each other, it's half a long distance relationship. Meaning that for about half the year we get to be physically together, the other half we spend at our own places, talking to each other through text, voice and video.

After a good bit into the relationship I found out that during the long distance parts of the relationship she was being unfaithful online. Ranging from flirting and sexually talking to guys online to going on omegle to get naked and masturbate for strangers. Going completely against our initial agreement. Huge deal breaker for me.

Naturally there were lots of fights and break ups. We couldn't really stay broken up though because she would say she loves me and wants me back and I felt the same, plus she is way out of my league.

She explained that during the long distance parts she feels lonely, espcially when I'm busy and don't have much time for her or when we get into an arguement. When she is lonely like that, all the things she does help her and the attention she gets helps her cope. I didn't know what to do, but as I loved her and didn't want to lose her, but based on previous experience it didn't seem like this behavior was going to go away, i finnaly after long debates decided to act against my own word and morals. I decided to stay with her and give her the room for this outlet online.

We came to the agreement that she can post on gonewild, respond to comments and talk to people in PMs. She had total freedom of what content she posts and how often she does it. The only restrictions we agreed upon were that she can't show her face, post or give out anything that would give away her real life identity and in PMs she would not send out personalized content involving her vagina.

All went well for a while until I decided to message her from another account and engage in a conversation with her disguised as a random local guy. She got hooked and started talking a lot to him and sure enough she started giving out personal information and sent a regular selfie with her face after he asked for it and a nude with his name written on her inner thigh right next to her exposed vagina.

I haven't confronted her yet, but I'm losing hope. Will this behavior never change? Is it time to break up and move on from a pathological liar and cheater?",02Sep2019,1

I have a thought life that apparently is not like most other people (according to my friends and family/significant other). 

I know just people think in dialogue and scenario format and go over these thoughts from time to time. Like they're writing a movie as it happens and testing various options for how the movie could go. I think of my thought life like someone sitting in front of a large bank of monitors. There are 4-5 main screens going nonstop and perhaps 20 in the background. All the while I'm writing a few of them on and off in rapid succession. 

One close friend and mentor says I have 100 trains of thoughts all racing down the track at the same time.

This makes it difficult to sleep, but I'm okay with that. It also makes it difficult for my s/o to communicate with me, since my processing of this information can be difficult to handle for most. If I want them to quiet down, alcohol and weed have worked well in the past, generally. However, I'm in a position where I can't do either of those right now.

My questions are: 
Am I okay?
Is there a name for this?
Is it somewhat common?
Should I seek help?
Are there methods that could help quiet the voices/screens?",02Sep2019,1

521,"Hello everyone, I hope I can get some help.

TL;DR - Who I am recognized as in school as an athlete scholar, economic issues, and my passion for table tennis conflicts with the events I talk about below and I've gotten into the mindset of ""Why bother to keep going if you know you aren't going anywhere with this? Just stop and move on with something else."" I don't know where I should go, and I can't go back to where I was. I really want to progress in my table tennis career, I don't want to give it up but I don't see any options for me. I'd appreciate any advice or similar experiences and how you progressed.


My passion is table tennis, I'm self-taught and despite the two years I spent in a ""center of national excellence"" (a very good club) with many ""great"" coaches and great connections, here's why I still consider myself self-taught and here's where I need advice:

Due to my family's low economic standing, we couldn't afford going to the club to practice, so one of the coaches of the club came to an agreement with me. I would coach people 4 days a week and they'll train me 2 days a week (same days I coached, this is important). I would teach beginners and more advanced players, so I thought it would be fair, and I got community service hours for my school too so I agreed.

A few months pass and they started to give me less training time, whereas I had to coach more and more people. During this time, I had competed in a few tournaments and I wasn't seeing any progress. I decided I wanted to train myself more so I spent every day going to the club and going to a public park and training with my dad (who I have also coached to help me train, my parents are my number 1 supporters :) ). By the time a year has passed since I enrolled in the club, I was not recieving any training and I was basically a coach. My results were from the effort I had put in going to a public park, and I had very consistent results, I was doing well. Our club decides to go to the US Open and they invited me to participate (all-inclusive, I paid nothing). So I participated and won a few medals. And here's where it all stopped.

After the tournament, my coach felt what I believed to be too much pride for the little work he has done in training me. He'd essentially take all the credit for my progress, and when I'd hear him talk to other people about ""they're my students, I made this possible"" I'd feel aggravated. I decided to suddenly stop going to the club, and it's been almost a year since I haven't heard anything from my own coach who supposedly supported me and ""trained"" me, nor from the club itself.

Currently, my school recognizes me as an athlete scholar, and for senior year it is believed I'd get that award. I just feel terrible for not training and competing. There's no where else nearby where I can train and I'm currently only going to the gym for physical training and preparation. I could go to a public park, but it's too difficult to frequent at a public park and at the level where I'm at, I need to be training with people around my level. If I go back to the club, I'd have to pay a lot just for that privilege. My dad has gotten older, and despite his efforts to support me and help me train, I need better practice. There's no way around this where it doesn't involve a big expense.

There's a lot of external pressures and internal conflict that obligate me to do something about this, I don't know what to do. I love the sport, but knowing I can't practice to the fullest of my potential is what hurts me the most. 


If I can't get quality practice, why should I still bother practicing the sport if I'd just be wasting my time? This is the mindset that I've gotten myself into and I don't know how to get out of it.

I'd love to read about anyone's similar experiences and how you moved on, or any advice as to what I should do about my situation or my mindset.",02Sep2019,1
523,"Don't worry, I didn't give anyone my data.

For a while I though some assholes calling themselves a bank were trying to scam me by emailing me about transactions that I never made. However there was something odd about the emails. They didn't look like scams at all. They straight up said that they will never ask me for info, and to not reply to their emails. And one day, like 2 weeks ago, I got another email telling me that the info on the account was updated. I was emailed enough personal information about someone who isn't me to probably steal their identity. Then it clicked: That someone who I assumed was the scammers pretending was me had a middle name that isn't mine, but the same first name and 2 last names, lived in Colombia and a bunch of other data that wasn't mine at all including a phone number. Nothing serious like an ID number or a credit card number but still concerning.

 Now here's the thing... my email is my first name and last names. I suspect that someone in Colombia with my same first and last names mistakenly used my email thinking it was theirs. This suspicion was furthermore confirmed by a brand new email this morning telling me that I had expanded my car warranty for a car I don't have. Again, a Colombian company and again, no malice in the email. However there was a certificate attached that I can only assume is pretty important for whoever actually owns this car. I am now genuinely concerned for anyone that may be using my email by mistake. I tried contacting them with that phone number but all text messages and calls fail. They don't tell me that the number doesn't exist. They just kinda fail.

My sister was listening and took my license out of her pocket, told me she had found it and 'been waiting for the right time to give it back'.

I have two more years of school until I can teach, but live in a very competitive area for teachers (Westchester ny) so it can take years to find a position.

My bedroom is very tiny and I share a wall with my parents.

528,"A few months ago I (mid-thirties) began dating a woman (late twenties) and have been really enjoying our time together. Amidst the strong chemistry, I've come upon a few red flags (this is where you badass advice-givers come in). A few concerning elements:

- She still lives with her parents in order to save money, but she is well-off with a reliable and in-demand professional career.
- Isn't sure whether or not she wants kids
- Isn't sure what kind of career she wants (she's currently wants a career change)
- Initially wasn't sure whether she wants polyamory or monogamy (she ended up choosing to ask me to be monogamous after 2 months together and says she very much wants to stay long term)
- Said she hasn't had success in relationships: longest being 6 months
- Isn't sure about almost anything she wants for her future other than to ""be happy, have a house, be loved, and to love"".
- When I've asked her what her future looks like regarding anything she'd like for herself, her response was ""I'm not sure, I can't predict what the next 5-10 years will look like"". I take things step-by-step.
- You get the idea...

Individually, each of those issues makes sense to have ambivalence about. They are big decisions. But for almost all things that are often important to long-term relationships and individual futures, she has a difficulty coming to a conclusion, expressing interest, and making decisions. I've never encouraged her to adopt my values; I've just tried getting clarity on what she wants to see if we align.
While with her over the past 4 months (but known her well for 8), I've seen her become more open to the idea of children, monogamy, and possibly moving to another city (she's lived in same city and house during her life). But it's tough to tell whether she wants those things or is entertaining them so I don't leave (a concern she's expressed previously). She said this relationship has been one of the first times she's been able to visualize being in a long-term relationship that is healthy and works (she's previously only had brief and controlling relationships and her previous boyfriend complained of the same commitment issues, she shared).

For me, I want monogamy, children, a new city, etc. And I either know what I want for myself and my relationships and I work towards that or I have an idea of possibilities I'm interested in. My question is this: am I wasting my time? Is this a Peter-Pan syndrome issue? Is this a personality/growth difference that I should respect and walk away from? Or is this something that simply requires time?

A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

534,"So my brother has been suffering with his mental health for the better part of a year now and has just recently been sectioned to a mental health ward in the hospital. They have to keep in there for about 28 days just to monitor him and to scan his brain for tests. 

He has about 9 or 10 days left and I’ve gone to visit him a few times, he wanted me to bring his laptop so I did as it is allowed by the hospital. 

He messaged me to come onto world of Warcraft which is our childhood favourite game. so we are playing online together and all of a sudden he asks me if I can sneak him some weed in. I’m very unsure about it so I just told him that I don’t think it’s a good idea for his situation and state. I told him that it might mess up the medication the nurses are giving him. 

Weed is also illegal in my country the weed that is out now is super strong (commonly known as skunk) and I just don’t think that I should do it.",02Sep2019,2

My friend [f21] keep asking to hangout. She posted on Snapchat saying she feels like all her friendship are one-sided. So I asked he if she wanted to getting together and come over. She suggested inviting other friends to hang out, now I'm trying to make plans with people who are still in highschool so they have a curfew.

All her friends are in highschool. Doesn't hang out with anybody her own age besides her boyfriend. So she's just stuck in this high School ways. I don't want to go out at 2 in the morning and drive around. Yeah it was fun back then but now it's just a money pit. 

My parents struggle with addiction very bad. There was a lot of fighting, violence, cops being called, things being broken. It was hell on wheels and my friend was never there for me. When it comes to me being there for her, I was always there. Drove her mom to the hospital, gave her a ride to work, needed money. then one night one of her highschool friends ditched her and she was stuck at a park so I said I would come and get her.  I live 20 minutes away. I got to two and she said nevermind. She said she was going to meet a friends boyfriend, I was livid. 

When I start to see the holes in the relationship I kind of backed away bit and stop talking to her.
When she wrecked your car and expected me to come comfort her. (She is absolutely a horrible driver, gone through two cars in one year.) She posted on Snapchat saying that she was going to quit her job and needed advice. I told her that is a bad idea because now she has two car payments to pay for and she needed to put on her big girl pants and just deal with her job. She called me a bitch and then unadded me on everything. (You were asking for advice what were you expecting?) All her friends completely turned against me, called me a horrible person for not being there for her in a hard time. She wrecked her car because she was driving too fast when exiting the interstate. (I know there's a name for it but I honestly forgot). They were making it way worse than it even was and saying it wasn't her fault. I understand they were trying to be nice, but I'm not going to lie to her face and say yeah it wasn't your fault even though you were the one driving.  This all happened about 4 months ago....


I honestly don't know what I'm going to do with her. Feel like I'm trying to make a friendship work with someone who is unwilling to grow up. Should I just flat out tell her I don't want to be friends anymore or just keep trying?",02Sep2019,2

Currently 6’2”  210 lbs.
 
I’ve gone from 315 lbs 2 years ago to now 210. Thing is I’ve been stuck at 210 from about 6 months now. I still lift heavy and run and eat clean. I’ve been yo-yo dieting more recently which is not good. So like a week on a strict diet and then I’ll fall off for a day or two and then get back to it.

When I do strictly diet I’m not seeing weight loss like I used to. Im trying so hard to lose these last 15-20 pounds. I don’t want washboards or shredded abs but just to see a little outline is all.

Now my question is I’ve read a lot of articles and forums debating which cardio is best. 

I’ve read HIIT is good but you can’t do it everyday. I’ve also read long slow jogs up to an hour is best cause you tap into your fat stores after a certain amount of time and you can do it almost everyday cause your not gassing your legs and body. 

Which cardio is best? Short and fast? Long and slow? Something in between?",02Sep2019,1

540,"Here's a little backstory to my confusion. I feel like everyone in my life complains about how annoying it is when someone opens up to them to ask for help but ironically they open up to me about their whole lives. I don't do the same to them though now but I did a couple of times before when I was younger. 

The first (that I could remember) was when I was very young and naive, maybe about early preteens. I opened up to a friend because I was having a rough time with depressing and suicidal thoughts and since we talked about anything and everything, I thought that it was cool to ask for help about that. They've also opened up about something similar so I thought it was safe. I later found out that the friend was absolutely annoyed with me doing so and said some things that I've thankfully blocked out. I stopped telling anyone my real feelings since then and about 10-ish years later, I thought that maybe times have changed and I tried to open up once again to another friend. Same thing here, we talk about anything and everything, even talked about how depressed they were too so I thought that they would understand where I'm coming from. I still had the same issue, I was depressed but way more suicidal and I needed support. I've always told everyone that I was fine so I thought I could tell someone that actually I wasn't so that I'd know what to do about it since they look like they're dealing with it just fine. I even told it in passing, like a cynical joke to lighten the mood for them in case the first time was too serious and that was what was annoying but the same thing happened again. This friend also said that I was being annoying and that I should toughen up and stop being so weak. But to be fair I guess I was being weak, I was crying at that point because I felt so shitty but I was trying my damned hardest to keep laughing like it was a joke because another friend overheard and laughed at the first friend for being so tough on me. Don't even get me started on my family, weakness is definitely not allowed there.

So, back to the question; why do people say it's okay to ask help from your friends and family when really it's not? Or is it just me that's wrong in this equation? If it is okay to ask for help, how do I do it without annoying or offending anyone?",02Sep2019,1

I mention I can't make it that day and we agree on a different day. My mom then started talking about some mundane stuff, but she always rambles, so I eventually mention that my cereal was getting soggy and we end the call.

The phone (a landline) is at the other end of my apartment, and my room has a hallway wall between it and the phone, and I'm hard of hearing. When I got back to the movie and was about to unpause it, I heard the phone start to ring again and guessed it was from Mom again. But I didn't want to go back and pick it up just then because of the cereal, so went ahead with the movie.

Apparently what happened next was Mom then left a bunch of messages, calling multiple times, screaming, ""PICK UP THE PHONE!"" over and over again. But I never heard any of those messages or subsequent calls. I also forgot to follow up on calling back to see if Mom had been the one to call when I was unpausing the movie.

The next day, I called Mom to confirm the errand plans but she doesn't pick up. I check the answering machine and come across the screaming messages from earlier. But I'm not sure when exactly those messages were left because the date/time isn't programmed on the machine.

Yesterday my Mom showed up here having finished the errands herself and ignores me. I tried to ask what she was mad about, but she refused to talk things over. This morning she finally replied to me, to tell me she was mad about being ignored because she called many times. I said I never heard the messages, but she doesn't believe it.

I also noticed that my dad acts differently in front of me alone, and in front of my mom or any other family member.

When we came to our destination, he immediately started telling me what to do. I had little to no time to play some videogames or look at some of Instagram posts.

I immediately knew that there must be something wrong, as whenever I asked him anything, he wouldn't respond or hear only half of what I asked and that made me think there's something behind that.

For 2-3 days we did often ,while on beach, tell to each other some jokes we found on internet, but not dirty ones just some funny ones.

Today, I told him to take the phone and find some jokes as I was already telling him some. He didn't read any for like 10 minutes and he didn't laugh at the ones I read, thats when I looked at his phone and saw he googled ""viagra price"". He didnt see me. I asked what he was doing, he turned his phone off and said ""what was I doing? i dont remember? oh I wanted to check the weather forecast'

The day after the previous post, my mom decided to talk to my sister (17) about her affair. She didn't even flinch. I still feel like everyone is out of their heads but this is not the news I wanted to talk about. 
Recently, we talked again, and she told us she feels flattered by this man because he treats her nothing like my father used to. She also depicted this awful, toxic relationship with my father as he insulted her repeatedly and made her feel not worth enough, ugly and just a body where he could empty himself. She cried a lot while speaking, and my sister and I understood that we had to give her support while still trying to push her towards the right thing to do. I was convinced we did - I told her about my concerns, the fact that he doesn't seem interested in her and he only wants to manipulate her into having intercourse. She told me she felt touched by my worries but still told me she knew what was best. Then I simply gave up trying.
Fast forward to two days ago, she discovered she got a yeast infection (I believe that's what it's called in English). I didn't think much of it, but it suddenly came to my mind that one of the comments under the post before told me to be wary of that man as he could get her sick. Apparently, that's what happened, but I thought they used condoms.
As for today, she made me go buy some condoms for her as, she stated, ""we have never used them before"". I bought them because I didn't know how to tell her no (she can be pretty convincing since she always uses the silent treatment on us). I now realize she's choosing her own destiny. I feel like shit as I always see that woman but I can't do anything. I hope she doesn't get that yeast infection, at least. I truly hope so.",02Sep2019,1

A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 
Is this 
Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

573," Whenever I play competitive online multiplayer video games, I tend to follow a certain routine:

1. Start playing game and find it fun
2. Try to improve
3. Git pretty gud
4. Start to take pride in my prowess
5. Pride turns to caustic self-hatred whenever I don't perform well.
6. Realize that the game is negatively affecting my self-esteem and stop playing

For people in a similar boat, do you have any advice for how to play without the self-loathing? I know it's a totally irrational response and I have other hobbies and reasons to like myself fine, but that doesn't change the knee-jerk self-toxicity I feel in the moment and after I play. I really enjoy a lot of these games and it makes me sad that I have to stop playing them :(",02Sep2019,0
574,"It's been over 4 years since we officially stopped ""talk talking"" due to conflicting life goals, loss in connecting with each other and also me moving farther away at that point. But during the first 3 years since I moved, she would constantly DM and want to catch up with me, only during the holidays. I think during that time, she even has a new boyfriend she's been with for a couple years now.

During the past year, we completely stopped talking to each other at all and it felt great that I can finally accept that she is probably living the life with the people she wants and I am busy with the life I'm working for. But recently, it was a special occasion for me, and she suddenly comes back wanting to know my tea and my days.

For most people, I'm very firm and assertive to really signal that we should not talk. But maybe it was the history she and I had before we stopped talking, although I don't remember most of the details anymore after all these years. It's kind of like when you meet your best friend you haven't seen in years and stopped talking for mutual reasons. Part of it is that I'm extremely patient and nice to those I really consider as friends who've changed my life, like her, and I partly can't say ""we need to stop talking for good b/c this doesn't seem right and is not healthy for my life.""

I don't know if I'm having unconscious hope to think that things should be okay like this if we're both living our own lives farther apart and yet I don't want her clinging on to my feelings and life, as any friend should.

Maybe it's just me overreacting and it should be okay to let someone you've shared your life with before come back?",02Sep2019,1
575," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'eh that lads just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she stared at me and quickly grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. (She was saying the weird girl liked me having a joke because these girls never knew I existed before this night and the weird girl wasn’t in this night) 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her wiping the table , she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit. The blonde walked towards me to  say bye on her way out smiling and the brunette was out before her holding her head a bit looking tipsy but the blonde seemed fine .

580,"It's a long story, but essentially she did like me that way and desired a relationship but realized she would have to change a lot about herself to get that close to somebody. So at the start of this month when I asked if we were going anywhere she said no, and that I should move on. Only I didn't move on. I kept sending her gifts, lovey texts, basically just showing my affection for her. She also sent/said similar things to me.

Well two days ago I was in a horrible state and honestly very upset with her. I had told her I was going on a date with another girl and she got very weird about it. Like, threatening to not take care of herself if I didn't say who it was. Basically ""I'll hurt myself if you don't do what I want"" on a lesser scale. 

That leads me to my fuck up. I ended up confronting her about that whole date with another girl thing and her weirdness, how it was wrong of her to act like that when we weren't ever dating. I then blocked her on Snapchat and told her to get to me on Discord if need be. We fought there for literally 8 hours, I accused her of leading me on, of not caring about me at all, and told her to go to her online friends that she cares so much about. She got incredibly angry, rightfully so, and at the time I didn't realize what I had done.

Later that day it hit me that I had ruined the friendship with the girl I truly loved because I wanted her to reciprocate those feelings. I wanted her to fundamentally change who she was so we could be together. To have accused her, a person who already has difficulty showing emotions of affection and care, that she never truly cared about me was the worst thing I could ever do to her.

Yesterday I apologized profusely for what I had done, and she accepted that apology. Did not forgive, but accepted it. And after what I did that's better than what I deserve. But what do I do know? I haven't accepted what I did to her. I hurt her real fucking bad and the knowledge that I did that to somebody I love is eating me alive. I can never take back those things I said, even if I truly didn't mean them. Those conversations are still there. She was my best friend man, and all she needed was a friend.

I wasn’t too concerned at first, but he started to say some really weird things, such as that he “loves me more than my girlfriend does” (I’m a girl by the way), says that he can turn me straight (when I responded he said something about him being girly sometimes), and openly admitted to wanting to date me if circumstances were different (if I wasn’t single), along with lots of other things that kind of come off as possessive. He did say that most of them were jokes (not including him wanting to date me), but I don’t think he was entirely joking. 
He keeps saying that he wants to meet up with me so bad that he will pay for everything, and he always expects me to text him and seems upset when I don’t (as I’m typing this I just got a text from him asking if I was upset because I didn’t text him, and the reason why I didn’t text him was bc I was with friends the night before). He also wants me to FaceTime him every single day when I have a very busy schedule with work, school, and extra curricular activities and will get upset when I can’t talk. 
The worst part about all of this is that he knows that I am A MINOR. Our age difference isn’t that big, but for me its big enough to make me uncomfortable. Despite this, he still openly spoke about wanting to date me if things were different, with the thing being that I wasn’t in a relationship, not because I am a minor. I am very uncomfortable but I don’t want to upset him and I don’t know what to do.

tl;dr: One of my Internet friends is very possessive and expects me to talk to him constantly despite my busy schedule, and also admitted to wanting to date me and “turn me straight”, disregarding the fact that I’m a minor. Please help!",02Sep2019,1
584,"Hi reddit, 

First of all I'm sorry my writing here is a bit of a mess I don't really know the best way to get my current situation across but here goes:

Looking for general life advice I suppose, here's my current situation:

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated recently and have moved back home from uni, home is in the countryside in the middle of nowhere with not much going on. I studied compsci at uni and got a good grade. I was always passionate about programming but that passion has sort of worn off recently. At the same time I've always been super passionate about making music (moreso than programming). I've always told myself the music is just a hobby, but in reality, for me right now it is really a field in which I want to succeed, and I don't think I can be happy otherwise. Obviously this state of mind isn't healthy but I'm not sure what to do about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a bit of a creative block recently so the music has slowed down which always makes me feel shitty overall, but I know I can get through that as I have many times in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not happy at home, there's nothing for people my age here, I want to move to a city ASAP so I'm looking for programming jobs. The city I want to move to (where I went to uni and where my girlfriend is at, I love this place) has pretty high rent prices so I'd be working 5 days a week to live in a sub par place, I feel like I wouldn't have energy for music in that position. All the jobs I see sound super boring to me, I've worked a few jobs in the past and I definitely have a problem with authority / giving my time away.

&amp;#x200B;

 My biggest fear right now is that I'm either stuck at home or that I'm at a job where I work every day and don't have proper energy to pursue music, I'll blink and all of a sudden I'm 35+ years old or whatever and I'm still working at a desk every day doing something that doesn't make me happy.

&amp;#x200B;

I really dont want my passion for music to have to take a backseat just so I don't have to live at home.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now it feels like any direction I take will end up with me upset, in my mind my only chance to be happy is through music, I'm creating every day, trying to get it out there, I don't have many friends so feel like its hard to get it out there but I'm trying, making videos, sending shit to labels but to me that seems like a one in a million type thing that I'd have to be extremely lucky to get anywhere with.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if this comes across as some angsty bullshit and I should just suck it up and ""that's life"" etc. but I'm just not happy with it all.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of all that I suffer from quite bad anxiety, I'm getting phone calls from recruiters about jobs every day, most of which I just ignore because the thought of a phone call makes me feel sick and scared. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else been through something similar and have any advice for me?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks",02Sep2019,1

587,"I’m a junior in high school. Last night while my girlfriend was over my house was egged and I know who did it. It’s happened before and i want to send a message to them to fuck off. It took a really long time to clean up.

There’s 3 people who I know that did it, so getting into a fight would be 3v1 and I would probably get my ass kicked.

So far I sent a message on Snapchat to one of the kids saying “you have fun last night?” They responded acting like they don’t know anything.

High school social dynamics are tricky, I don’t want to get the school or parents involved or else it would further damage my reputation.

Should I ignore it? Should I confront one of them at school? Any one of them I could humiliate in a fight but I’d be hopeless if I was outnumbered. The penalty for fighting at my school is only a 1 day suspension, my parents would be happy that I stuck up for myself, and I don’t think one suspension would do too much damage when it comes time to apply to college.",02Sep2019,1

But for some reason I keep doing impulsive things that have negative consequences. Some recent examples: I visit my bf instead of working weekends, so I have less money than I need. Two weeks ago I wanted to “parkour” so I tried to flat foot jump onto this ledge and I fell scraping up my knees. I accidentally hit a parked car while backing out of my spot. I chipped my front tooth Saturday night trying to do a stupid lighter trick. 

I don’t understand why I do stupid stuff like this, I feel so guilty and upset by my choices, but when I’m making them I don’t think about what might happen.

602,"I’m using a throwaway because my partner uses reddit and have also kept this post rather vague. Feel free to ask any questions and I will try and clear things up! Also I’m on mobile so sorry in advance. 

Me and my partner moved to a new country together almost a year ago. We moved because we both wanted to travel more and thought that living in a new location would make this easy and be a cool experience. It was tough to get set up with bank accounts, jobs and an apartment but we did it. He’s very much settled now and we’ve been to plenty of different places and that’s been fun. The problem is I really don’t like my day to day life. 

I don’t think I like living in such a big city, I’ve lived in small town before and seemed to like that much more. I’m having a hard time making friends and while I’m capable of keeping myself busy with hobbies I’m at the point now where I just feel lonely. I recently quit my job because it was a bad situation and was stressing me out and in the time off have gone home to visit family. I’m only home for a week or so but the closer it gets to me leaving the more I don’t want to go back. Family and friends keep asking what I love about this new country and I don’t know what to say, I feel awkward and sad. 

Ive spoken briefly to my partner about not enjoying where we live but he loves the travel opportunities too much to want to leave. Also because we are on a visa we would only be able to stay in the country for another 11 months so in his mind I should stick I out until this time. Part of me wants to just stay here with family but my partner can’t sustain the apartment we’re in alone and sending rent money home seems ridiculous especially with the exchange rates. I don’t know what to do and the closer it gets to me leaving the more miserable I get.

Should I just stay home with my family and try a long distance relationship? Or should I go back and continue to try and make the most of a life I don’t like? Maybe someone else has been in a similar situation?",02Sep2019,2
603,"Hello!

About a month ago, I talked to this girl on Tinder. She even followed me on Instagram a while before replying to me on the app, it looked pretty promising. I actually enjoyed talking to her and the fact that she has a passion she’s working on and is pretty determined.

Fast forward about 5 days later of talking to her on Instagram and I asked her out the next day. I was going through a bad period of time at that moment and wasn’t really prepared to go out with her. Sometimes I wouldn’t reply in time, too. I shouldn’t have asked her out in the first place. So, very smart me decided to act triggered at something she said just to cancel the date. I could have literally said that something intervined or just tell the truth that I was not in the mood. So, she unfollowed me, I unfollowed her and the next day I told her that I acted like a ‘little bitch’ and I am sorry and didn’t want to hurt her. Very smart me also said “kbye” at the end. Not so unexpectedly, I didn’t receive a reply.

About 2 weeks ago, a friend of her watched one of my Instagram stories, I don’t even know if that should be a good thing.

She is starting uni in another country (probably in about 2 weeks?) Maybe she’s already there.

I fucked up big time. I’m still thinking of her after 1 month. What would you recommend me to do? Do you think it makes sense to try to talk to her after all this time? I wouldn’t even know what to say without sounding like a completely insane person (which hopfeuly I’m not)

604,"I’m taking a biotechnological education right now because I have a passion for animals and I hoped to become a veterinarian. You have to have really high grades though and mine has gotten a bit worse due to some depression/anxiety I used to deal with. It’s common in my country to take a year off after school to work or gain some experience. 

I tell my mom I want to volunteer at an animal shelter for 2 months, but I’m not sure if it’s actually volunteering or if you get paid. But in my country you can get some money from the state if you’re studying etc. so I tell her I might get money that way, since it’s called an internship.

Her reaction is to get extremely mad. She was already mad that I wanted to take a year off rather than continuing school. But I have no idea what I want to do. She expects I’ll stay home all day doing nothing. Now she freaks out and says people who get money from the state are losers and I’ll be send to do low paid cleaning jobs. (It’s a little hard to explain the laws). That’s not the kind of money I would get though, since I would be working. It really hurt that she didn’t support it though.

I also got really excited about maybe going to Africa to work in an elephant shelter or to take care of poor children for a couple of weeks or months (not sure yet) I just wanted to tell her about the idea. She once again says “pft, I do not care, you’re not going to Africa or India or anything.” I’m 19 and I expect to pay for it with my own money, and I’ll be going with my best friend.

Anyway, I say, “... India? Who talked about India?”

And she kind of repeats herself that “I would definitely not be going to Africa to do anything.” 

I shake my head at her because at this point I’m starting to cry. She only says “pft” in a really mean way and talked about my plans that I’m really passionate about like it was stupid. 

I want to save up for a drivers license and my dad (who always complains about driving us around, even tho he only drives me around like once every month and it’s usually to go to his place.) gives me lessons. He will sit there and say it’s a dumb idea and it’s a waste of money.

At this point I feel unsupported no matter what I do in my steps to becoming more mature and independent. I don’t know what to do about this because every time I try to explain and defend it I just get such negative and such unsupportive responses.

They are well aware that it upsets me. These were just some examples, I hope I don’t sound like a spoiled brat, but it’s hard for me to explain",02Sep2019,1
605,"Hey everyone,

I want to give you all a little context before I ask my question:  I’m 31, about to be turning 32 in a couple months.  I graduated with my doctorate a couple years ago and have a mountain of student loans.  Currently single, had a rough breakup a few months ago.  I bought a house a year and a half ago, but decided it was too much house for a single person so I sold it a few months ago.

I thought moving into an apartment would be easier.. less maintenance, expenses etc.  Wrong.  Neighbors are terrible and I’m breaking my lease.  I’ve provided the property management with enough evidence of my direct neighbors breaking multiple clauses in the lease agreement so they’re letting me break my lease without any fees.

I’m considering moving home to my moms for a few months to regroup and save some money and consider buying something smaller or renting in a better location.  I can save along the lines of $3500 a month if I were to move home - so if I could stick it out for 6 months I’d have a great down payment for something.

But I’m 32 and single.  Does moving home to gather myself sound reasonable, or is this basically a death sentence for trying to find a partner - which I’m actively seeking.  Again, it would be temporary, but it has me worried. 

Thoughts?",02Sep2019,2

610,"My main goals in life is to provide entertainment value for people. 

I got a large investment and offer from someone that I really can't refuse (it's a good thing). As to where I would be COO of the company until he felt comfortable with me running it then would step down. It would be for a game studio. 

However, I'm in the military so I can't simply just leave like any other job. So in the meantime I was thinking of focusing on music, writing movie scripts, and getting a bachelor's in software Engineering. 

People say they really like my music even strangers that don't have to front. The best thing is I do everything myself so I don't have to rely on others (just have to figure out marketing &amp; monetization). I know touring is where artists make the most money. Although like the other situation my predicament is it can't effect my 24/7 availability for the job. (Also my good friend has been using me to make an entire album for him just on the gist that we are friends. [It took me until now to realize it, yeah I know I'm dumb]. So there's that stress of trying to explain to him how I don't appreciate being used and having to do LITERALLY EVERYTHING for ""his album"" [I developed all the concepts, produced, engineered, wrote, recorded, drawn all the pictures, filmed and edited the videos] then he just wants to slap his name on it acting like he did any work. He didn't even pay me anything.) 

*Now this is the part where I start freaking out...*

I feel like I have to satisfy each and everyone one of these ambitions I have. I always wanted to start my own business (I can not work a normal 9-5 anymore of something I don't enjoy. [I would gladly work 12 hours a day on something I enjoy.] I'm just tired of not being used to my full potential and capabilities). 

Although, I keep feeling the pressure build. I have the stress of the military and the stress of this. I have no one to talk to in real life about this cause it can affect my job and everyone that I can talk to wouldn't understand what I should do. I have large ambitions that no one seems to understand. I know you can want to become so much that you become nothing. I just feel so lost some days. I try to keep my mind straight like I lift 5-6 times a week, I eat right, sleep is okay. It's all this pressure I'm putting on myself to do this shit I think, but I'm not too sure. I need to be remembered as great not just average. I see people around me just chillin' and that's fine, it's just that's not for me. And then sometimes they just want to waste my time. 

Another area that is making me emotionally drained is my love life. See I am attractive and nice, but every girl I get seems to just ghost me so I can never build an actual relationship. It's just girl after girl I don't know wtf is wrong. I have a lot of female friends and they say they don't understand why I can't find a girl. Then all my guy friends are telling me ""I need to get some"" and putting a shit ton of pressure and making fun of me that way too.

With all this, I need to keep my brand clean cause I want to become a public figure and I know it only takes 5 seconds to destroy a brand that took 20 years to build. 

Also I don't see my family, and the other 80% of my family I hate cause they always want to use me. (That's a big reason why I joined).

611,"I keep hearing from my older family members that junior year is the hardest year of high school. I hate school but I still work hard to get passing grades. For sophomore year I had the hardest time getting through APUSH work. I would spend hours in my room reading the textbook, which I later gave up on during second semester, and doing as much work as I could finish. For my high school, we now have International Baccalaureate classes. They’re very hard classes and there is a large work load according to the upperclassmen. After school I will be going to work as well, which will limit the amount of time I can use for homework and studying. I was wondering if anyone had tips or tricks I could use to help me become more organized and efficient. Please and thank you.",02Sep2019,1
612,"I'm a temp worker at this warehouse I've been working at for the past 4 months. My department is goods in, I bring goods into the warehouse and put them away on shelves. I use a hand scanner to put the goods away, so it shows on a system virtually where the goods are stowed. 

The problem is I put stock away, when someone goes to pick it, sometimes it's not there. It gets lost and goes missing. But when I put stock away, I always double check and verify. I know for a fact that when  I put something away, it is in the exact location I put it into. 

Today a work colleague told me, the previous guy who use to do the same job as me had the same problem. He even handed in his notice because he thought it was a conspiracy. He believed people was actually moving the goods he put away into different locations. So that guy left.

This is happening to me now. 

So I lost two parts today, I recovered one it was underneath the location I put it in. The other was towards the end of my shift. I couldn't locate it, I couldn't justify myself, I even said to my manager I will start having to take pictures everytime I put something away. He disagreed on the idea. They asked me to come into work at 5am to look for the missing part. When my shift starts at 7.30. 

I know I am getting paid abit extra, but I know regardless whether I go in early or not. I won't find it. 

These parts that went missing are from 2 months back. It keeps happening frequently. I know it's not my fault that the warehouse is poorly supervised and  disorganised. 

The warehouse works in the way if your name was the last regarding the goods, you automatically get the blame.

What should I do?

Go in at 5 or do my scheduled hours?

Regardless I know they will lay me off soon.",02Sep2019,1

Last night I was drunk (I don’t think my friend was) and he was joking around making fun of me so I meant to do like a playful slap just like a joking kind of thing but I hit him really hard and it was loud and left a mark for a few minutes. I really did not mean to hit him that hard I don’t know how I did. At the time everyone just laughed and I said sorry I didn’t mean to hit him that hard but we all were laughing and he was a little bit but looking back on it he was probably forcing it out to not feel awkward. I feel so bad because obviously it really hurt and because he was probably embarrassed because I slapped him in front of everyone. Then he left early and my friend told me that later he was pissed and said that he pretty much hates me.

626,"So I just got a new job. I told my new boss that I wouldn’t be able to start for two weeks. She tells me that’s fine, and that my first day would be the 3rd of Sep (tomorrow) two weeks from then.

She tells me she would send me something through email for me to fill out. I fill out a bunch of online documents. And then that’s it. The email she sent me told me what my first day would be like and what I had to wear and stuff. It pretty much went over everything but the exact time I would have to be there. So I just assumed that the day before or so she would call me or email me to tell me when I should come in. 

Well today’s the day before and it was noon and I still had not heard from her. So I log onto indeed which is how I applied to the job, to find her exact contact info. I see that she messages me over a week ago on there to ask me if I could stop by last week to bring in ID. I didn’t think to log on to this because it’s a job searching website and I already got the job. She already has my contact info so I figured this was the last place she’d try to contact me. So I reply to her and apologize for seeing it just now. 

She doesn’t reply to that. Instead she calls me. I miss the call because I’m working my last day at my old job. I call her back as soon as I got the first chance. She tells me she already left for the day and that she was hoping for me to come in today and bring ID (even though she told me tomorrow would be my first day). She said she wasn’t sure if I was still going to accept the job because she never heard back from me on indeed. She also said she wasn’t sure I was in town or something like that, like maybe I went on vacation. 

To me it seems like she’s making a lot of assumptions and it makes me very nervous to work for her. Why would she assume that indeed is the best way for her to reach someone she already hired, who she already has full contact info for? Why would she assume I was out of town and that I didn’t want the job when she told me my first day would be tomorrow? 

I just feel a little overwhelmed and worried that I’ve already made a bad impression but I don’t really feel like it’s my fault. She doesn’t seem like a very good or logical communicator. I really wanted to make a good first impression and now it seems like I’ve ruined it without even knowing.

I am a senior in HS and I am looking for 2 letters of recommendation, and I have narrowed down the list of potential teachers to 4 teachers, and I am honestly stuck in deciding who to chose; so I made a small pros and cons list, and I want to see what outsiders would think(basically people not in my environment, because they may have a new perspective on who I should choose).

Ps. I used my exact thoughts and words when describing every situation also all teachers are from the core subjects.

1. **Teacher A-** Why yes: I was engaged in her class and I never did anything bad or so, I was always respectful and she didn’t seem to mind me(have a problem with me, in terms of attitude or redirection) and has written great letters before. Why Not: She has already warned the class about asking her and I do not know what letter I will get(template or good) but she has given a bad idea about asking.
2. **Teacher B-** Why yes: I was always nice and I did all my work and I was a good person, and he has seen me also outside of class he is the basketball coach, and I went to some open gym runs. My grades drastically improved and my finals(I needed a 100 on the final to get an A and I had a free exemption where I can settle but I took the test and made a 100) also help. Why not: I am not really sure I trust his writing and prioritization of my letter.
3. **Teacher C-** Why yes: I did really well(5 on the AP and 93both sems) in his class and I got all my work done properly, and I was kind and I gave him that letter(letter of me thanking him, as a reply to one he made to every student) may go off in a good way. Why not: I did not display any character not school-related. 
4. **Teacher D-** Why yes: She is a teacher in the field I am interested in, and I did good in terms of progress(80 first sem, 85 second sem), but nothing too special(did average in class), I was respectful in there too. Why not: I did not do exceptionally well, and only got a 3(on the AP exam), additionally I do not really like her, and I think she is cold, and this may be reflected in her letter.",02Sep2019,1
636,"Hi! 
I am in college currently, not the college of my choosing (that’ll be touched on later), and am having a difficult time at home. To start when I was younger I was in and out of hospitals with an illness that required invasive surgeries and hospital stays lasting months at a time. At that age I was never allowed to go out with friends or even ever have a sleep over unless they came to my house, even then it had to be planned weeks before. Made it through middle school got in trouble for having a crush/gf and having my first kiss in 8th grade. Of course it was innocent but I got in major trouble at the time losing all rights to the little access to technology I had and friend privileges. In high school, I snuck behind her back and had a girlfriend. Of course, they found and out I got in major trouble, even threatened to be kicked out and brought to police for lying to parents. Looking back I wish I hadn’t lied about having a gf but I knew I’d be in just as much trouble if I just told her. Her faith rules everything and if I’m not doing gods will I’m awful and etc. I can’t even have a girl upstairs with door open or anything because she only thinks we will have sex. Only had a gf over once and I had to break up with her after because of how mom acted. My moms convinced me all my exs were just had people and they were needy and them wanting to hang out at least once a week or every other was too much. She rarely let me see my gf over the summer (the one I’m serious with right now) because we only have one car (two but my father drives the other to work daily) so my mom can not drive and brother is too young too so I had to drive them everywhere and when they had nothing going on (most days didn’t) I had to be home because I go out too much (it’d be two weeks since going out and still got this answer) so it puts stress in current relationship as well. My poor gf can’t take this we just want time together. We always had plans to go to a single college (even before meeting her I planned on attending that college) except my mom didn’t help me with any paperwork I didn’t know family worth or any of that and instead stuck at a college I do not want, until next year at least. She won’t let me ever go see my gf and say I’m ruining the family by wanting to. She babies my brother beyond belief and he’s like a little her. She’s lied, she’s manipulative, and seems to not care about my feelings at all. Her and my father were divorced and now they are getting remarried and my dad doesn’t do anything in the family, he can’t make any decision always ask mom since I can remember. My dad works two jobs as my mom does not work. I just want to leave this house and start my life as they hold me back and make it seem like my job is to be her and my brother care giver. It’s really starting to bother me as my relationship is on the line because of it and it effects my school work etc when I have to drive them all around kingdom come.

My roommate is somewhat racist (he believes black people are louder, for instance) but he's also the person I spend the most time with here at college. Which means I worry about my view of the world getting distorted. I rarely get offended, but this morning he said (not an exact quote) ""short people tend to be whinier, more annoying and more insecure,"" while looking at me, and stating it casually like it's obvious. He also googled heights of celebrities the other night and when he found one at my height (5'3) said, ""See, you can make it too."" Plus one of the first things a new female coworker asked me the other day was how tall I was, out of nowhere. Online dating was rough in part due to my height, and one or two of my exes have given me a hard time about it. 

Most people don't give me a hard time about it. But is this because it doesn't matter to them or because they're simply being polite to spare my feelings?

I've struggled with many things, and I am finally starting therapy tomorrow primarily for other problems, but am I overreacting here? Is this stuff actually insulting? Is it accurate? Because it hurts, oversensitive or no.",02Sep2019,1

I feel really bitter about this, but I wanted to know if that's normal or if they're being unreasonable and petty. Isn't it not really a holiday if all they do is force you to have that day off instead of your normal day off?

644,I feel like my life is going to shit. So to start from the beginning. I have a boyfriend who I’ve been dating for almost 2 years now. He’s trans and this plays a big role. His parents are quite transphobic and he’s been struggling to get them to accept him. So his mother found out he was trans and then immediately blamed me because I’m bi. We eventually got over it and the mother was still okay with me. I went overseas for a month and is being teens of 17 got horny and ya. We sent each other one nude each. His mother happened to go through his phone that night and through our chats and found the nides which she then told my parents about and she tried to split us up. She stopped us from talking to each other and seeing each other outside of school and even at school. And threatened that she’d take him out of our super accepting school and put him into an all girls school to “fix” him. He told her that he’d stop going by his name and pronouns and go by she and his deadname at school which calmed her down for a bit. But one of our teachers emailed his parents asking what name and pronouns to use and now the mother is incredibly angry and is saying that she’s going to take him out of the school because it’s a “toxic environment and forcing you to be someone you’re not”. I just need general advice on this situation for both of us cause if he is moved I won’t be able to see him again.,02Sep2019,1

654,"This is one of my deepest and most hurtful personal shames. Sometime growing up around my pre teens I just became very attracted to white women. I had grown up in a lower income neighborhood in Chicago and then my family decided to move out of the city into a more rural part of Ohio. Once there I just started to really like white girls, eventually it went from a fascination into a preference, and now it's to the best of knowledge a full blown almost exclusive preference. I'm in my late 20s now, I've been like this for a while. It took me a very long time to admit it to myself and I have never and probably will never admit it out loud to another person.

When I'm even seen dating a white woman I catch so much shit that I just try and avoid the conversation, so even talking about a whiff of a preference is unimaginable. I dated a few black women to throw my family and friends off the scent. I felt enormous shame and fear that one day they'd put it all together. It makes me miserable, but I have tried so hard to change my mind, to make myself not like white women anymore and it never works, it only makes my attraction to them stronger. I tried going to a therapist once but chickened out before telling the therapist, he was a black man, what would he think of me? That I was less of a man? A race traitor? I went for weeks paying over $200 to basically dance around the subject.

I have nightmares people find out. I don't know why I'm broken this way, why I see the world this way. Why I like them so much. It's not self hate, I love being black, I love my culture, my family, my friends but when it comes to a romantic and sexual connection I have a preference that seems to fly in the face of all this. I feel like I'm evil, like something is morally wrong within me to be this way. I had to make this post because it's been eating me up inside for so long and I had to get it out even if it was to complete strangers.

I've been talking to folks on reddit and it's helped I expected anger and rejection but people have been so kind to me and have encouraged me to live my life and love who I love. But does anyone have any advice on next steps? Should I see a therapist again or something else?",02Sep2019,6
655,"So basically, ever since I was a child, my parents have been sorta hovering over me. They’ve let me hang out with the very few people who actually give a shit about me, and they’ve pestered me about my school schedule for my entire school career and never given me any opportunity to make my own mistakes or make any decisions on my own. They didn’t even let me have a say in choosing the current school that I go to, which was a big school transition in 6th grade, a decision which ultimately took me away from more than 95% of my elementary school friends. 

On top of that, they keep track all of my homework assignments, tests, quizzes, will email my teachers if I don’t do the work, and until recently, they even turned off my wifi usage abilities at 11pm every night. Shortly upon getting a new phone, they installed Life360 on my phone and began to monitor where I go at basically all times. Every time I was let loose at a school football game or a social gathering, i would have to text my parents every hour or so to let them know i was okay, which for a young teenager of like 14 or something is understandable, but an 18 year old who’s going away to college next year? You’d rather monitor everything I do on a device than teach me how to do laundry or wash dishes? 

When I confronted them about this shit, it turned so much more wrong than it should’ve been. I was yelled at, sent away, and they didn’t even offer me a chance to explain my reasoning. There’s so many more layers to the story but I don’t wanna get into them right now. This is just a basic idea. Help would be appreciated.",02Sep2019,2

You are all gorgeous, beautiful women.  Of course, a man will want to be with you.  He may even chase you until you give in.  Just know that the moment you do, YOU CHOOSE HIM.

F-boys just don't find you.  You have to allow them into your life.  We make the choice.  The best question to ask yourself on this journey is ""what part of me resonates with f-boys?"" ""What parts of me attract these men?"" ""What do I have in common with them""? Believe it or not, men have the same insecurities we do.  The same traumas.  The same emotional issues.  They just choose to handle them differently.

As children, life just HAPPENS to us because we often had no choice in the matter.  So it's easy to carry the same feeling and operation into our adult life and not realize that we make the choice because our inner little girls are still powerless.  Allow your adult to step in and take over. But in order to make better choices, we have to be aware of the ones we make not and that requires some brutal honesty.

And you may not like the answers.  But it is part of the healing process.  The choice to face the good and the bad and make peace with it all. So while you may choose them make peace with it and vow to make a better decision moving forward.",02Sep2019,0
659,"As the title might suggest, this is a bit of an identity crisis. I am apologising in advance for this massive text, but it is the first time I am trying to put my situation into words. 

I am a 25 year old student in the Netherlands. 
I was born and raised in Germany but my parents are from Syria. 
Every year we would go to Syria for about 6 weeks. It was just part of my life. I was 16 the last time I have been there.  

I was raised bilingual with Arabic and German.
My parents are really cultural and religious people but nevertheless I had a mix between a German and Syrian lifestyle. 
We lived in a small village where we would be one of the few immigrants. So back then I already wasn't really feeling welcomed. I got bullied at school and even friends started to turn backs at me during puberty. Even though, I still managed to have my two best friends from my time there. 
One of them moved with me to the Netherlands to study (now we're in separated cities though). At that time I started to discover that I was gay. Of course a no go for my parents. Even though my siblings are really supportive. 
I accepted the fact that I won't be able to tell my parents. But that also made me realise that I wouldn't be able to build my life around them or even close to them. Now that I am finishing my study I am starting to think where to go. In Germany I never felt understood, also in big cities people and friends would treat me as the Foreigner (for fun or serious ).
The Netherlands is way more understanding in that department. But still, if I stayed here I'd be the German foreigner, which also was a big struggle until now. I feel like there will be always a culture and language gap between me and the dutchies. My friends here were mostly internationals which are going back to their country eventually. 

I am looking for master options around the world, but I don't know if I am able to risk everything I've build so far (relationship, some friends and all the documents of staying here) to start somewhere new where I wouldn't feel at home either. I am also thinking to move to the city where my best friend and bf lives (Rotterdam). But I am scared to do and still feel not welcomed. My other solution would be moving to Berlin where my sister lives. But that also would be a fresh start and id lose everything what I got here for a city I know I won't be happy I'm for the long term. 

Long story short, I want to be somewhere where I can start building my life, my work, my friends. A home, where I feel comfortable and welcomed. 
I know you won't be able to tell me where to go, but at least an advice how I can find out.",02Sep2019,1

661,"I will try to make a long story short.

I'm 22. My mom has stalked my social media accounts, as well as my friend's, ever since junior high. One of my friends found one of my mom's social media accounts several years ago, and I checked up on it a few months ago. All of her interactions online are with middle-aged men, where they basically tweet raunchy adult humor. Whatever. But there is one guy in particular with whom I believe she is cheating. Tons of kissy faces and whatnot, couple pet names, etc. I thought maybe it was just a silly online thing.

I recently moved for grad school, and this guy only lives a few hours away. My mom came to visit me without asking if the dates were okay, which I found weird because she would never visit me in undergrad without asking. But then I read several interactions with them today about how they had a great weekend together.

This account overall makes me uncomfortable, but now I feel awful for my dad. He is not as well-versed with technology, so he will likely never find out. On a side note, she has posted my first name on this account as well as the institutions I have attended. This makes me uncomfortable because I do not need creepy men knowing what I do, and I don't want this association to potentially jeopardize my career (I realize this is unlikely, but the account is public). 

I plan on texting my mom telling her that I signed up for a new Twitter account several months ago and stumbled upon the account in my ""suggested"" panel. I want to tell her that what I have read makes me uncomfortable and to ask if everything is all right between her and my father.

I don't feel great being the social media snooper, but this is going to bother me. And again I'm also concerned about these weirdos knowing my identity.

667,"As the title reads. I'm just at a loss for what to do. This is kind of a lot so thank you if you do read it all. 

1) I've been addicted to porn since I was about 15. I have a very specific sexual niche for bigger women who are at lest 35+. I'm ashamed of this attraction, and while I crave something serious and to be able to date a girl closer to my age, there just is no sexual attraction to girls my age. Because I don't see myself having a serious relationship with marriage/kids with a wo man who is 35+, I just end up resorting to porn. 

2) I work as a server in a restaurant and I have been at this job for the last 7 years. The coworkers are generally okay to work with, the clientele that comes in isn't terrible, and the money is decent. But I feel like just a slave. I'm not doing anything that really means anything at this job. 

3) I graduated a year ago from university with a degree in Philosophy. Yes, I know, I should have picked another degree. Hindsight is 20/20. I was severely depressed and suicidal in college, and while I should have taken time off for my mental health, I didn't think it was an option. So, I studied philosophy as my own form of therapy. I wish I would've majored in a more practical field and had an actual trade. 

4) I find myself really drawn to the arts: music, literature, film, painting/drawing, etc. That being said, I'm just an observer in all of these areas. I have tried to pick up instruments and it doesn't fulfill me, I can't draw for shit, I guess maybe I am decent at writing but I just can't come up with anything original or anything I can passionately write about. 

I have done things that I should probably be a little more proud of. I went on a solo 3 month road trip across the country when I was 18, I stayed in South America for 3 months, I went to Europe, and I'm planning a 3 month trip to Asia. I'm moving to another state when I get back from Asia. I've been to an ayahuasca retreat. I haven't fully gotten over my depression, but I would say I've conquered 80% of the depression and I am not suicidal at all now.  All of this being said, I just feel so useless in the world. I'm happiest when I am travelling, but it just feels so selfish. I travel for myself and it's not like I can make a living off of travelling. And while I like being alone, sometimes I would like to have somebody in my life, and my whole sexual attraction thing just throws it all off. 

  
I have people tell me a lot of the time that I am very self aware for my age and to not worry so much because I have a good head on my shoulders and will figure it out, but even if that is true, I don't know how not to worry. I feel like I should worry. I don't want to be 30 and still trying to figure all of this out.   


I feel so lost and I just don't know what to do. I just need some advice I guess. How to get over addiction, how to find creative outlets, how to feel fulfilled - anything. 

TL;DR - addicted to porn, attracted only to older bbw women, feel like I'm not doing anything important at my job, regret studying philosophy and staying in college while I was severely depressed/suicidal, no creative outlet, I have done things I should probably be more proud of but I feel so useless, only happy when travelling.

I procrastinate by doing chores, I get lonely, find an excuse to run errands instead, and then kick myself at the end of the day, not having done much, hating what I did manage to produce, and feeling absolutely helpless, to the point that the vision of the life I want feels like a fever dream from another dimension.

I almost don't want to succeed because I'm terrified of the responsibility. No boss, parent, manager, etc. will be there to help me when I fuck up. I feel so incapable of doing anything that would be required of me to live the existence I actually want to wake up to everyday.

679,"I have been working as a specific type of scientist since I was 21. I have been at my job for almost 3 years. I have a BS degree in this field.

The work done in this industry is often done in government labs (county, state, federal), but, there are some private labs out there. I started working at a private lab, that has a small department dedicated to this discipline. 

When I started this job, my salary was $33k. Not much, but for a recent college grad, I was happy to take it. It was a job in my exact industry, after all. 

Since I started, I was given two raises. After a year I went from 33k to 38.5k, because that increase was tied to a change in title: scientist 1 to scientist 2. From my current position, there is nowhere to move up, unless my manager were to leave, which is a legitimate possibility.

A year and a half after that, I received another increase, to 41k. Despite this, I am still very underpaid as far as the industry is concerned. If I were to start at the local county lab, the starting salary, entry level, is $45k. After a few years, you're easily making 50, 60, 70, etc. 

Now, money isn't everything to me. I am not struggling by any means. I have an apartment I'm happy with. I have a reliable car. I have enough excess funds to treat myself now and then. But, sometimes I get very embarrassed by my salary. Of my friends, I did the best in school. I graduated at the top of my program. I completed my BS in 3 years. In most cases, I was working full-time 1-3 years before my friends finished school and got full-time employment. Because of this, and because of the industry I work in, they expect me to be making a lot. Instead, all of them have started at their jobs making more than I do. (50+) Which is fine, it's no competition. But, sometimes it does make me insecure.

Now for the reasons why I haven't gotten out to pursue a government job: I really enjoy my workplace, and there are a lot of perks and flexibility with it that I would not get at a government lab. Our dress code is extremely casual. I don't have to dish money on business-ware. We can wear jeans everyday. I have very flexible hours- I can choose whatever 8 hour shift fits my needs. 6am-3pm? 7-4? 11-7? Doesn't matter. I could even work overnights if I wanted, 4 10's, etc. It's easy to get any time off I want. We have a very relaxed work environment. If something is going on, it's no problem to take a personal call and take care of things. Bad winter weather? I can just work from home. And, my personal favorite perk: the travel. We have clients for all over the country and Caribbean, so because of that, I often have to travel (at the client's cost). Because of the travel component of my job, I've had the opportunity to go to Bermuda, Hawaii, and many mainland states, all of which I'd never have the means or reason to go to otherwise.

My family members and friends always talk in terms of salary. They deem a good job to be a good-paying job. I know I'm underpaid, but I also love my work environment and the travel and the general perks. Am I wrong for being okay with that for now? Plus, my salary going from $33k to $41k over the course of  years isn't too bad of an increase, right? I just feel like people are disappointed in me for being ok with where I'm at, even when I'm making so much less than those around me.",02Sep2019,1
680,"For starters, I know I have OCD and that my self esteem isn't great.
I've always placed precedence for myself in my academic ability since that was what made me proud and happy, but I've always had an issue with procrastination. Things such as showering, brushing my teeth, etc.

 Recently, it's hit me especially hard in academia. I've never been great at getting homework done, it's always been a weakness, but recently I've noticed that after I slumped in a mock test at school that I've been writing off my desires for success almost as an excuse not to have to study, to the point of thinking that if I became homeless it would be fine because ""oh well, that's in the future, who cares"". 

Since the mock test I've been very low, with a severe spike in OCD and of course a knock to my already low self esteem and this procrastination isn't helping; I just can't seem to force myself to do things, and, with this being key, I feel like no matter what I try and do or study or whatever, I'll just end up giving up or not persevering and sticking with it, which leads to me often not even starting.

Is this predominantly a self esteem issue? Or is it mainly procrastination? Or a combination? Does OCD come into it? Or is it something else entirely? I'm just looking for some advice to know how to tackle this because I'm really getting a bit hopeless and that I just can't improve, and that I'm abnormal. 

Many thanks.",02Sep2019,0

682,"I've been with the same company for about 1.5 years now. I started part time in sales and when a fully time position on the operations team opened up, I was asked if I'd be interested and when I said yes I got an interview and got the position, despite having not handed in an 'official application'.

This was about 5 months ago, now a supervisor position opened up and my ops manager randomly dropped the question of 'when do you wanna go to the next level?'

The thing is the position is an overnight position, the pro is that it comes with consistent hours.. All other supervisor positions come with open/mid/close shifts whereas this has a sort of steady schedule, despite being O/N.

I know the store manager and HR both like me and appreciate my work ethic. My direct manager and supervisor also know I am a hard worker.

The question is: is it worthwhile working overnights? This would be the first job were I work nights, I've stayed up to 4am somedays working like 12-14 hours when coverage was low(my current schedule is 2-10:30pm), but never did a straight 10p-6:30am.

683,"My friend Kate has always been desperate for a boyfriend cause most of our friends already has one and she felt that she was missing out. 

Then two months ago, Kate told everyone in our friend circle that she has finally gotten a boyfriend! Thrilled, we invited him to our annual hangout party where we just hang out by the pool and chill and it was then that we saw how she treated him.

Constantly beating and punching him in public. Biting his arms so hard they bleed. Pushes him into a pool even after he told her he couldn't swim and using sharp objects to piecrce and scratch his skin. The worst thing about all this is how no one is telling her off on this behaviour.

I got into an argument with her 2 days later about how this was abuse but she said he never once told her no so she is not in the wrong. I got very angry and told her this isn't a relationship and she shouted back that i shouldn't be dictating her love life. We haven't talked since then.

My friends also agreed that i should not have interfered as it is their relationship and that he may have consented to this. What i need advice for is do I continue to allow this abusive relationship or is there a way to help my friend to not be abusive to her boyfriend? Or am i just being too nosy in their relationship and should just let this continue?

Also sorry for the weird format and english as i am using my phone to type and english isn't my first language.

685,"I have been working as a specific type of scientist since I was 21. I have been at my job for almost 3 years. I have a BS degree in this field.

The work done in this industry is often done in government labs (county, state, federal), but, there are some private labs out there. I started working at a private lab, that has a small department dedicated to this discipline.

When I started this job, my salary was $33k. Not much, but for a recent college grad, I was happy to take it. It was a job in my exact industry, after all.

Since I started, I was given two raises. After a year I went from 33k to 38.5k, because that increase was tied to a change in title: scientist 1 to scientist 2. From my current position, there is nowhere to move up, unless my manager were to leave, which is a legitimate possibility.

A year and a half after that, I received another increase, to 41k. Despite this, I am still very underpaid as far as the industry is concerned. If I were to start at the local county lab, the starting salary, entry level, is $45k. After a few years, you're easily making 50, 60, 70, etc.

Now, money isn't everything to me. I am not struggling by any means. I have an apartment I'm happy with. I have a reliable car. I have enough excess funds to treat myself now and then. But, sometimes I get very embarrassed by my salary. Of my friends, I did the best in school. I graduated at the top of my program. I completed my BS in 3 years. In most cases, I was working full-time 1-3 years before my friends finished school and got full-time employment. Because of this, and because of the industry I work in, they expect me to be making a lot. Instead, all of them have started at their jobs making more than I do. (50+) Which is fine, it's no competition. But, sometimes it does make me insecure.

Now for the reasons why I haven't gotten out to pursue a government job: I really enjoy my workplace, and there are a lot of perks and flexibility with it that I would not get at a government lab. Our dress code is extremely casual. I don't have to dish money on business-ware. We can wear jeans everyday. I have very flexible hours- I can choose whatever 8 hour shift fits my needs. 6am-3pm? 7-4? 11-7? Doesn't matter. I could even work overnights if I wanted, 4 10's, etc. It's easy to get any time off I want. We have a very relaxed work environment. If something is going on, it's no problem to take a personal call and take care of things. Bad winter weather? I can just work from home. And, my personal favorite perk: the travel. We have clients for all over the country and Caribbean, so because of that, I often have to travel (at the client's cost). Because of the travel component of my job, I've had the opportunity to go to Bermuda, Hawaii, and many mainland states, all of which I'd never have the means or reason to go to otherwise. And I adore it. I also get a small bonus ($175 total) for every trip I have to take.

691,"I just graduated this past May. I had been interning at a small company (\~50 people) since last August and they hired me full time in April. However, I have an intense desire to move. I've done my research, and the combination of cost of living, environment for my thick coated dog, and culture have led me to Oregon, which is across the country from my East Coast city.

I have a lot of reasons to move, but the biggest obstacle is how moving could impact my career. I made a pro's and con's list of what would happen if I move

**Con's**

* I've cemented a pretty good ""reputation"" for myself professionally in my city. Not the best, but I've been interning around the same industry/people for the past 4 years. I know a lot of people, and those people also know my father, who introduced me to the people who gave me my first internship. If I move, I suddenly lose the network I've created.
* I wouldn't move until I've been at my company for a year. It just works out like that with my lease/saving up money. I don't want this to be seen as a slight to my coworkers. It's a small-knit group, so we're all pretty close.
* Since the company is so small and close-knit, I could move up pretty quickly since I have such a personal relationship with my director and CEO. This would be harder in a large company, which I may become employed at if I move.
* My job is pretty flexible - I can work remote on Fridays, and can leave early to work remote most other days.

**Pro's:**

* The network I have made in my city is based off who I was at 19 - and being taken seriously as a young professional woman in her early/mid 20's is harder when most of your professional contacts remember when you were 19 and wore sneakers to the office. I could reinvent myself in a new city.
* At my previous internship, I worked closely with a specific director, who I ended up becoming involved with after we both left the company. He wasn't who I thought he was, and it ended with me having to file a police report against him for sexual assault last year. Everyone I work with knows this man, and I sometimes have to hear them talk about how good of a guy he is. I haven't gone to court yet and refuse to speak to any of my coworkers about what happened. If I move, I won't be able to leave what happened, but I can leave our shared network. 
   * On this note, when/if I do go to court - my reputation with my colleagues could change drastically.
* Since my company is mainly remote, I don't feel as engaged as I could be. I take certification courses, finish my tasks, create new initiatives for myself, but at times I don't feel like I have as much direction as I need as a young professional. This, along with the fact that I'm the youngest in the office with the closest to my age being my own boss who's in her early 30's with a child, makes me feel sort of ""othered"" from my coworkers.

Should I take the plunge, move, and accept whatever career changes may happen? Should I wait it out a couple more years to give myself more experience and hopefully move up the ladder? Do any of you have advice from your own young professional experience?",02Sep2019,1
692,"Hi my guys, English is not my first lenguage, bla bla bla, throw away account btw (maybe, im really lazy), sorry if the story is confusing but, ya know, not first lenguage and stressed by school

So I have always been sort of introverted around girls, some of my best friends are girls, but I just i can't get to joke and treat them like I treat my male friends, whatever, this girl (we'll call her G1 so it doesn't get confusing) I was friends since 1 and a half years ago just started to show signals of having a crush on me (quite obvious ones) and one way or the other, a friend of her, thru her phone, confessed to me that she had a crush on me (not a surprise) and stupid me replied to her telling how I felt and that I didn't wanted a relationship at the moment and it wasn't her, it was me, you know, the cliche, THING IS, friend of G1 deleted the messages so G1 did not know I knew about her crush, she read my messages and deduced what I was talking about and what had happened, few awkward moments at school but after some days everything went back to normal.

Next part and here's the problem, G1 situation was about a month ago and another girl Im friends with (we'll call her G2) started directly telling me she likes me and we should be together, she acts like a 12 year old and is very very childish, so I just keep telling her that she is to old for me (just 2 years) in form of joking, kind of chowder and panini friendship (remember that show? Yeah, good times) the thing is, I really like her but I've mastered not showing emotions so I'm 99% sure she doesn't know I like her

Here's where I need your advice, I would actually like to be in a relationship with G2 but, the way I told G1 I didn't wanted to be in a relationship in general, not only with her, thruth is I only see her like a Friend but universe's perfect timing has made it so I have a chance to be in a relationship G2 (i always thought of it like a platonic love, jus a fantasy), G2 doesn't know about G1 crush on me and that I rejected her nor does G1 knows about G2 liking me. What do now? I could not hide G2 relationship with me from G1 and I think G1 would feel pretty hurt if I did this, loosing contact with any of G1 and G2 is not an option and I don't want to lose any of these friends

Pd: G1 and G2 don't have that type trust and contact to coordinate a trap for me

I’ve had my share of hurdles, a lot this year specifically, but it’s nothing that has ever brought me down to where I couldn’t recover.

I’m completely okay living out of a tent and backpack. I’m actually okay leaving my family and friends behind. Honestly my biggest fret is leaving behind my student debt which would go to my parents. 

I just don’t know why these thoughts are here. I would love to have normal aspirations of a house and a family and to be financially stable, and to a degree I do want these things but that duels with the idea of wanting to be free and roaming wherever I can go.

700,"My friend (M22) has a 3 year old son with his now ex (F23) who I used to also be friends with. I state used to because...

She's manipulative. He was never happy when with her and when she broke up with him it was a weight off his shoulders. He was treated badly but ultimately having their kid mate their relationship complicated.

Since then they've mainly been OK with each other - but here's the problem. My friend gives and gives - he gives her £200 a month on the slide so it doesn't interfere with her benefits, he lets her use his car all the time - not just for the kid, but to do things like go hikes with her friends and stuff.

I wouldn't have too much of an issue with this if all was good because of it but she has once again tried to use the kid against him. I had a night out for the first time in months and had just came back for the weekend as I live in another city just now and seeing all my friends would mean a lot.

We go out and it happens to be that his ex is out in the club that we are in. I still get on with her so I'm nice and say hi. My friend lasts about five minutes before he's having a full on discussion. That lasts the whole night.

The summise what was said, she wanted to get back together with him. He doesn't want to. She said if you want to see him three days a week rather than 2 (bear in mind he gives her a chunk of his modest wage every month and he is working offshore for three weeks and home for three weeks). He currently on average gets to see his kid once a week over six weeks as he's 3 weeks on, 3 weeks off in work. He doesn't get to see him any more than usual when he's back, just the two days despite the ex often using her mum to offload the child.

The biggest problem is, he's a pushover. He's too scared of rocking the boat in case she tries to stop seeing the kid altogether. But I believe he holds most of the cards. As a friend it is fucking killing me to see his kid being used as a pawn to see her get her own way. I don't know what to do or if there's any advice I can give him.",02Sep2019,2
701,"This may be a long post, sorry in advance. I always thought I was fine and that depression and anxiety was apart of every day life in America however I’ve noticed my symptoms develop. I’m now literally scared to even be outside. I get panic attacks on the way to work, I feel light headed, and get headaches, it’s summer so I have no idea if the sweating I do is a symptom or not, I’m scared of people now, I think a lot of people are evil and I don’t even want to take the risk of being around them, I think of every possible situation that’s dangerous, I’ve taken a clinical survey and I marked the highest in the charts for depression.  A little bit of back story here is I ran away from home at the age of 16 from an abusive life in general. Both home life and the neighborhood I was in was ghetto. When I ran away I made the decision that life would be safer Honeless then anywhere else. For a few years life was great after I got out of homelessness. I even got married. My wife cheated on me in the military and that’s when I really started to decline. I had thoughts of revenge, suicidal thoughts came back to an extreme. After awhile of calming down from that I got into a new relationship that was ok. She also cheated on me a year later. We got into arguments I started to drink a lot more. Funny story there as well is she confronted me about cheating asking if I was cheating because she got a sexually transmitted disease. So we both were pissed with each other I got tested and I came back clean. So cats out of the bag, it was you. After I moved on from her she started to stalk me. I took matters into my own hands and kicked in her car door. Told her to stay the fuck away from me. She then got a restraining order on me and I asked her why she was lying and that got me in big trouble as a violation of the order. So now I have a lot of no trust in women as well. I’ll find myself just scared to be around people. I’m in my own mental prison where I’ll just cry, shiver in a corner for hours. I end up not feeling like doing anything in my daily life.

703," Hello everyone,

tl;dr - at the bottom of the text.

I have to make a really hard decision in my life and the time is running out. The decision doesn't just impact my career but also my relationship. I got a job offer from Toronto, Canada and I'm not sure what to do. Whenever I think I made up my mind I start feeling horrible and I start second guessing my decision. This has been going on for over a month and is just draining my energy and will to do anything.

What made me realize that this is a very hard emotional decision for me is when I asked myself what would I do if lets say I received a 30% raise on my current job. Would money make my decision easier? I came to the conclusion that this is something I just can't mathematically decide. I'm leaning towards staying in Germany out of rational reasons but emotionally I'm drawn to the adventure of doing something new and being in a more open minded society.

**My story**

I'm an EU citizen living Germany. I find the quality of my life to be quite good. I'm earning an average salary considering my qualification and work experience as an engineer and I'm enjoying a good work-life balance (6 weeks of paid leave and no overtime required). My girlfriend works in the healthcare sector and also enjoys good benefits. Although we are both fluent in English (C2 IELTS level) we quickly noticed that we must speak German in order to develop our careers and build our social network. We gave our best to learn the language but we're not close to our English level which does cause subtle and not so subtle inconveniences from time to time. Financial-wise we're doing quite well. If I don't have any major investments I am able to save more than 50% of my salary but I guess that I'm also living very humbly.

On the other hand sometimes I feel like I'm not really a part of the local society due the language barrier and living in city that doesn't have that many immigrants (compared to Toronto). Some people are welcoming, some are not but I can't escape the feeling that we would be better of in NA. Almost no month passes that at least one of us doesn't hear somebody here rambling how immigrants will destroy the German culture. The entire rise of the right wing extremism in the EU is just fueling the problem further.

Canada feels exciting and welcoming but I don't want to be emotionally dragged into something that I will regret later. What attracts me to Canada is the language and the notion of living in such a cosmopolitan city. I visited the States a few times and I've been once to Toronto. I found all those experiences quite satisfying but looking through tourists eyes is different than actually living there. If I decide to move I'll be on my own for at least a year until my GF gets her papers sorted out and then she would probably need some time to get her degree assessed and find a job on a completely new market. I'm afraid that long distance relationship might be harmful to us.

When I put everything on paper, Germany offers better work life balance, stability, lesser cost of living which leaves more money at the end of the day considering our current salaries and my GF doesn't have to go through any exams to work in her profession. Long term prospects are grimmer compared to Canada.

Canada on the other hand is more welcome for immigrants, we both speak English on C2 level and offers more money for seniors in our professions.

My GF's take on this is that she support whatever my decision is and that we can overcame any obstacle in our way. For her this is also a hard decision but she is slightly leaning towards Germany for pragmatic purposes.

Your advice is appreciated

**tl;dr**

Can't decide should I stay in Germany or move to Canada on a new job offer. If I decide to move I have to separate myself from my GF for at least a year. If we move we both would be making a step back in our careers in hopes of getting into a more welcoming culture.",02Sep2019,1

708,"I met this girl and I was charmed so after a couple of hours I summoned the courage to make a move. 

I ordered two cups of coffee and when she brought them over (she was a waitress at the place) I told her the other cup was actually for her, and that me buying the coffee was a way of making a move. From there on I proposed that next time I'm around we should do something together, she liked the idea and suggested coffee and cake... yada yada yada.. after that I had to leave and I forgot to ask for her numbers.

So when I went back to the place 2 weeks later turns out she had quit, asked one of the waitresses to hook me up with her numbers, she told me I'd get them next week and she did me one better by convincing her to come around the following Saturday (week 3), but I was moving on Sunday so I did not make it... So last week I got the numbers but I don't know if it's still worth pursuing after so long... More specifically I assume she now thinks I'm an ass.

710,"I just made an reddit account now because I really need advice on something that bothers me a lot. I broke up with my ex boyfriend because he was a drug addict and he told me that ""he has no idea if he cares about me"" and I thought that I deserve better.

711,"So, long story short, I (19F), befriended a guy (21M), John, a senior, about a year ago. I have had a boyfriend, Charle, for 1.5 years, and John was aware of this the whole time. Because we have the same nationality (while studying abroad), we connected really fast.  Two months later we decided to open a student association for people with our nationality.

We became good friends, hung out a lot together, and because Charle and I live 1.5 hours away from each other, and Charle works and studies, I only saw Charle once a week. 

John, turns out, texted me yesterday night saying he was very stressed with the transition between grad school and university and that my friendship did not help. It confused him, because we hung out together often, but I had a boyfriend. He then blocked me, unblocked me, blocked me again, and now I am unblocked. 

Apparently, he expected more out of this friendship (according to Charle). 

Now, I am stuck in a paradigm. John, I and Peter, another guy with the same nationality, opened this student association, and therefore, each of us is the ""owner of 33% of it."" We have to often discuss on whatsapp, and on calls, what we are planning to do, and Friday we even have the ""new student welcome day."" We have not communicated after the incident.

I simply have no idea of how to react to this, as I believe talking to John after the incident will be extremely awkward. Should I leave the association to avoid awkwardness, or should I stay in it? Also, how would you act when you first met John in person again? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: John (21M), and I (19F) became friends 1 year ago, we had the same nationality so we started a student association for students of our nationality (we study abroad). John was aware that I had a boyfriend and proceeded with the friendship anyway. Sunday, John texted me saying he no longer wanted to be friends as my friendship confused him (I had a bf and still hung out with him often). Should I stay in the association? How should I react to John when I see him again?",02Sep2019,1

I was wondering if anyone knew of anything to fill it out - currently it's uncomfortable on the side with the smaller boob and the bra also looks uneven.

717,"Hey gang. A few months back I discovered my husband had an affair with a mutual acquaintance at a social club to which we belong. My husband and I have since started counseling and are productively working on ourselves and our marriage. For obvious reasons I have not attended/participated in anything at this club since learning of the affair. My husband has been there a handful of times since to participate in activities mandatory to maintaining our joint membership. I very much enjoy(ed) being a member of this club. It is a place shared with family and friends and I miss the fun and camaraderie I once found there. 

My question to you wise folks is should I attempt making this club part of my life again or should I accept that this facet of my life is over?

The woman with who my husband carried out the affair is still a member and we will undoubtedly come into contact at some point if I return. I wholly accept my counselor’s advice that confronting this woman would be fruitless and only serve to validate any ill notions she had about me that justified her actions. But I feel it is not fair to me that I have to cut this organization out of my life because her and my husband’s actions. I did nothing wrong yet I am the one missing out. My husband has professed his willingness to withdraw from this club if that is my wish. A large part of me wants him to do that but I am struggling to ask it of him because our mutual departure is sure to raise some eyebrows among our family and friends there. This affair has left me ashamed and embarrassed enough and the thought of our dirty laundry might be aired is sickening. 

I am not rushing to make any decisions as I know I am not to the point in the healing process where I could see her and not verbally confront her but I want to hope that some day in the future, should I choose to integrate this club back into my life I can walk in there with my head held high and reclaim something this affair had stripped from me. 

Some of you may be wondering what other members of this club, particularly our family and close friends have to say or think about this situation and the truth is I don’t know. To the best of my knowledge no one else knows outside myself, my husband and this woman. My husband stated their sexual encounters were very clandestine, taking place away from the club and out of view of other members. For those of you wondering how my absence has been perceived the nature of my job provides a reasonable excuse for now. 

I appreciate your time and input. Thanks!",02Sep2019,2

723,"So this girl, we'll call her  J, has been at my school for 3 years now, and she keeps picking on my friends and flirting with everybody. She's in my band class so there's no avoiding her.

She used to be friends with my best friend, S, and would drag her around anywhere she wanted to go, never where S wanted. She would always talk about her million crushes and always made up some lie to make her life seem worse than everybody else's. J is incredibly toxic, and everybody kept telling S to drop her and she eventually gave in. S was very honest with her and addressed every problem she caused. 

J did NOT take this well. She said she was gonna commit suicide because of it, that S was her only true friend she'd ever had, blah blah blah. The next day she was completely over it and never talked about it again.

That was last year. I've made friends with two very nice 7th graders (I'm in 8th grade) who are friends with J. I warned them about how J acts. They didn't know her true colors until recently, one of them (M) was setting up her music stand when out of nowhere J says with the meanest look on her face, ""why are you looking at me like that? UGH stop looking at me!"". M took one good look at her and said,"" I wasn't even looking at you, get your head out of your ass for once and you would notice"" and holy hell did J get mad.  She was bright red and fuming. Thank God the band director didn't hear it.

So they're obviously no longer friends, but I met yet another girl who was friends with J, and of course, I warned her. But she said she'd already found out. So I asked for details.

So apparently J likes girls too now and she asked this poor girl out. She put up with a relationship for a while but then dumped her. Now J believes one of the most popular guys in school is obsessed with her and won't leave him alone. On top of that she's constantly shaming my friends for dropping her and *tries* to flirt with everyone she comes across. What can I do to stop her? Is there anyway to know if something is happening at home?",02Sep2019,1

727,"Today, first year in university, in computer science, first day too. And I’ll go back tomorrow, with little anxiety. I’m 19. I had friends in High School, but now, we’re all in different universities. I’m worried to not be able to have new friends.

Mostly, because I’m 5’3. You can laugh, I'm used to it from previous years. Anyway, an acquaintance from last year, who was in my class, has already sympathized. From the first few minutes. Of course, he had to be 6'2, he obviously told someone about his height.  I have a feeling that my integration will be complicated. Knowing that I have to be one of the smallest in the class of 200 people.

I was advised to talk to everyone. I'm not asocial but not ultra-social either. I feel like I'm never going to get over this issue, which I almost forgot last year. Now, today, it comes at me all of a sudden, a reality blow in the face. 

Especially since I'm tired of taking the first step, I'm still the one who did it in school. I am always the approacher and never approached. It's wearing. Some of them are totally passive and have friends, but if I adopt the same behaviour, I'm sure no one will come to see me for years.

I'd rather talk to you about it because I don't want to bother my friends with it. Especially not my parents. I know how to show a beautiful facade to say and show that everything is fine, when it is not.

Normally I won't really see it as anything but the thing is that this girl is not someone I'm cool with. She just has this unfriendly personality. She's the kind of person you can't really joke with or have fun with, she's always frowning, only cares about her education, and stuff like that. Before her and my best friend started getting close, I've actually attempted to make friends with her, but it was a failed attempt. I remember cracking a joke one time and she looked at me like I was stupid and I just gave up. Even today, as I could be silly sometimes, I wore these slippery shoes to class and I couldn't help but pretend I was wearing rollerskates while sliding across the class. While other people were laughing and telling me to be careful lol, she just had this look of detestation on her face and my best friend was sitting with her. I mean, there are other people in my class who I'm not that close to but sometimes we still joke around together or have conversations but this girl is just different. So I confronted my best friend about it, but he said it's nothing and I'm just being jealous. Lowkey both of them have similar personality traits and that's probably why they bonded. My best friend and I are a little bit of opposites when it comes to our personalities but we still have a some things in common. In order to try and get some attention from him, we have this tradition of binge watching shows together and discussing about it intensely. So 2 weeks ago, I told him about this show that really meant a lot to me and that I really loved because it talks about topics both of us could 101% relate to and I thought it would be a great thing for us to bond over. I literally sent him about 30 text messages telling, begging and trying to convince him to watch the show and how much it would mean to me if he watched it and his response was ""I'll try"", but he never did. Whereas, if I had asked him the same thing 6 months ago I wouldn't even have to beg before he watches it. So basically he doesn't even have my time.

747,"We got my girl (a border collie mix) from a rescue group when she was 4-5 months old, and she was skittish then. But it's gotten worse. I can't take her out of the house anymore, or she'll go ballistic around other dogs. If I let her off leash, I am 1000000% certain she would bite, and that makes me so sad. 

She was brought to a shelter from a rough part of the inner city (an area known for dog fighting and abuse). She got a cold that turned into pneumonia at the shelter, and some of the other dogs (some of whom were used as bait dogs or in fighting in other capacities and had aggression issues of their own) would sometimes bite my dog or otherwise hurt her bc she was an easy target. Well, she had to be removed from the shelter, and then she came to us. 

I'm firm with her. I'm not afraid of her. I don't whine or dither around her, I just tell her to do something and she does it. I'm the alpha in the house. My mother, on the other hand, is a very submissive, nervous, uncertain person whose moods are completely unpredictable (my mom has Borderline Personality Disorder, so she will sometimes throw these absolute tantrums). And that makes my dog anxious af. Like, my dog yawns, puts her ears back, and barks CONSTANTLY around my mom. Like, constantly. My mom has been told by several dog trainers that her disposition is going to cause our dog severe anxiety, but she (my mom) just gets upset and makes it worse. Mom also has a habit of yelling, throwing things, slamming doors, basically being a teenager, and so I'm really the only stable person in the house. 

I'm not home a lot of the day, and my mom refuses to walk her when I'm not home (because the dog doesn't listen to her... no kidding). So, there's not really time to do much, except on the weekends. But I am really at the end of my rope. My mom is 63, she's not going to change. She won't seek therapy or medication for her own mental health issues, and she ends up basically unleashing all of her emotions on everyone around her. Including my dog.

I love this dog more than I have ever loved anything in my whole life, but I am starting to wonder if maybe I should look into rehoming her with someone who can give her the care and the socialization she needs, until I can A) afford proper socialization training and not just my friend who's a vet tech coming over every now and again, and B) live alone, where my mom's moods can't influence her. This doggo is not thriving where she is, and I don't have the tools necessary to allow her to do so. This is a really impossible decision to make, but do you guys think it might be the right one? I love this creature enough to want the best for her, I just don't know what the best thing is for her right now.",02Sep2019,1

So I got this co-worker, she got hired last december and altough we weren't that close then, I used her as a human shield to keep another drunk co-worker (office consensus is he's a closet gay) from feeling me up at the office party at a ranch, now we go out almost everyweek with some of the other people from our office, the funny thing is, she saw it as me hugging her from behind and did the same later in that party, going as far as following me around as I socialized with everyone.

Fast forward to Friday, I found out one of the guys at work from maintenance is going pretty hard on her, she's not interested but he keeps insisting on taking her out and trying to call her for a ""1 on 1 chat"" at the office afterhours, so I happened to witness this last night, he kept asking her aside and she refused him again and again, so I stepped in and asked him if he's aware I'm dating her, that I'm not jealous but if he keeps that up we'll need to have a chat ourselves, she went with it and he backed off.

Now keep in mind this bloke and I are ok and he's not a bad guy, we share a love for martial arts as he does Muay Thai and I fight MMA in the amateur circuit, so we talk about it every now and then, he just happens to be pretty blunt on that department.

As soon as he walked out, she thanked me and asked me if I was ok with keeping that story going, so the other guys wouldn't push the matter, another co-worker present said she could low-key spread the word, saying that people know I practice a combat sport and that it should be enough to keep other guys away (I disagree since I'm the guy in the office that gets along with everyone). I asked her if she didn't want to file a HR complaint and she refused, saying it's not that bad, just a bit annoying, so I agreed to it.

Yesterday I went out with another co-worker to have a beer and watch Fury vs Povetkin (boxing), and he laid it out on me that it was about time she and I hooked up, telling how obvious it is that she likes me, I'm as blunt as a butter knife so I haven't noticed shit, but looking back, I guess it could be seen that way.

755,"i'm fm 23 yo, my bff and her bf have been dating for about 9 months. they're in long distance and she likes him but isn't in love with him at least what she tells me. she's been my bff for like 4 years. i met her bf once when we all hung out together once about a month ago. since then we've been texting completely platonically just about random shit like the gym, relationship problems (not their relationship). i do not find him attractive at all and we've snapped about random shit. she complains about him all the time and i like him as a person he's cool and i like texting him. for some reason i never thought to tell my best friend and now she thinks ive been hiding stuff. but i swear i have not. she can read our texts. i feel like i have become close with him and i was just embarrassed maybe because she complains about him all the time. i shared some personal things with him about my life but we never talked about her or their relationship. i never gave advice to him about their relationship or anything..but when they would argue they would both text me about their arguments and i would be in a weird position. for some reason i never thought to tell her. he would complain about it but i would just ignore it or respond entirely neutrally. i don't know why i didn't think to tell her. i guess i thought it wasn't a big deal. but i definitely should have. she found out we've been texting casually and tells me she isn't mad at me but she should be. she feels like a fool. she should. i'm an idiot and a terrible friend. i've apologized but she said it's fine but i know she's still mad.",02Sep2019,1
756,"I'm 14F, they're 13 and 11 F. They hang out all the time with each other but whenever I try to join them they kick me out. They just did this and I'm crying because it hurts that they don't want me around. I hang out with my parents more than I hang out with them, but they hang out with my parents more than I do. So they're close to my parents and each other and I'm the outcast.  
  
I have mental issues and it makes social situations seem awkward and forced. I feel like I'm a burden to talk to so I usually stay in my room all day either scrolling through Reddit or playing video games with friends. When I'm not doing this, I'm working or hanging out with friends. It just sucks that I can't have the same connection with my family that I have (or think that I have, assuming I'm not a burden to them as well) with my friends. How do I make myself more likable? I'm nice to them a lot I think and try to do things like buy them treats and little things every once in a while with my pay. Today I bought my dad some food, and yesterday I surprised my littlest sister with some food (other sister already knew) but it's never enough. I probably come off as mean to them because of my mental issues but I try not to be.  
  
It's mainly a problem with my sisters, my parents and I are close but they all watch movies together without me because my mental issues make it hard to sit through a whole movie. I just feel excluded and want to be a part of the fun. Even better, a part of the family. Again, how do I make myself more likable?",02Sep2019,3

758,"Last Labor Day I bought a season pass on sale for around $180 ($90 for food, 90 for park). It came with free entry from last Labor Day until the end of this year. Free parking and free lunch, dinner, snack, and unlimited drinks. It also came with free hurricane harbor entry and free friend tickets.

I went A LOT. Not sure exactly how many times but at least 20 and maybe even 40 times. I had times I told myself I'm over six flags and promised myself to never go back, only to miss it like crazy and go again. Eventually I liked it again. I still enjoy it but mostly go to walk around and see people, but I do sit on stuff. Also, I had so much food and drinks for free there that the $90 dining pass paid for itself.

I go by myself all the time, I only brought a couple friends once. I don't mind going alone because I'm bored that day and it gives me something to look forward to.

The problem this year is that I don't have a job and much money. $180 is so little, but I get by on $20 a day and I have a $500 limit credit card that I'm $100 away from paying off that would be used to buy the pass.

A part of me is saying grow up and get over six flags this year, don't spend money you don't have right now. But another part feels like the park keeps me sane especially since I don't have a job right now. I always start missing the park like crazy after a couple weeks. I have friend who works and barely went 2-3 times with his pass, he doesn't seem to care. All my friends are too busy to go with me.

Should I get it? Or is there something else better?",02Sep2019,1
759,"So my dad has had OCD my entire life that has gone untreated and generally ignored by everyone as it was not super noticeable and didn’t really inhibit him in a major way. Everyone knows this about him but it’s not something that has ever been discussed especially with him. 

Within the last year and especially the last 6 months it has become entirely unmanageable. He is barely eating and has become very very thin bordering gaunt (I believe this is from fear of contamination, he covers his food with plastic wrap and lifts up the corner to eat when he does eat), he washes his hands excessively and has started hiding all the towels he uses for it, he avoids touching anyone in family in any way, when he feeds our dogs it takes over an hour as he counts the food on their plates repeatedly. Attitude wise he has totally withdrawn and is very irritable, I can really see he is suffering and it’s very sad.  My parents are divorced so my sister and I feel we need to try and help the situation as there is no one else in his life who is close enough to him. We also do not live at home but have been spending more time there to monitor things. 

Overall my sister and I are very worried about him and unsure how to approach him as none of us have officially acknowledged that he has OCD (it’s never been diagnosed but from general online research I believe this is what he has). I want him to seek help but I am generally uninformed as to what the best option would be for him. I have seen options for therapy, medication, treatment programs etc. I am also not sure how it would be best to approach him about it. 

Any words of advice or suggestions for next steps would be greatly appreciated! I want to make sure I am being sensitive to his point of view and want to make sure I approach this properly especially given we have never acknowledged it. I know this is a very sensitive topic and I don’t want to close the door entirely if I mess this up. Thank you all in advance and apologies for the long winded post!",02Sep2019,3
761,"I’ve been married for 2 years now. I have not been happy. My wife is a very good person and a nice woman, but I feel trapped in my marriage. She is constantly on top of me, doesn’t give me space and won’t even go to the corner store without dragging me with her. She gets annoyed when i want to hang out with my friends and hates the idea of me having friends all together. We separated a year ago for about 2 months and I was doing incredibly well, but she just came back into my life with promises that she’d change but all that has quickly gone out the window and we are back where we started. Also, the way she came back into my life was rather sneaky and underhanded.  I feel we have a very shallow relationship and we truly don’t know each other(which I know sounds crazy because we got married, but I was in a deep depression at the time and I thought it’d help). The better I feel internally, the worse I feel about my marriage. She is not willing to do marriage counseling and thinks that I’m overreacting about small arguments. I’m literally just going through the motions every day and I’m feeling kind of empty. Aside from our marriage, she’s a very nice and caring person and I don’t want to hurt her but I’m not too sure of my options(hence the proposed counseling). I’ve been told to just leave, but that’s easier said than done. Plus I’ve been there and it hasn’t helped at all.",02Sep2019,1

763,"i apologize for the long post, i know those aren’t fun to read but here we go. so i went to my first underground punk show last night, my friend’s band (we’ll call him jason) was playing there, among four other bands, and i invited this guy i‘ve been mostly talking to online (we’ll call him paul.) whom i’ve been flirting with back in forth for a bit. paul brought his friend as well. we met up a half hour after doors opened and there was barely anyone there. it was sorta awkward between me and paul at first so i mostly hung out with jason and his band but i felt left out because i didn’t know the rest of his band super well. 

eventually i got the courage to go back and talk to paul more and everything was pretty much fine. the show starts, it’s awesome. paul told me he had a lot of fun and was glad i invited him, and so was i. i felt the night went great besides the awkwardness at first and feeling left out. eventually we all tapped out and jason drove me home. he told me as he was driving, to either show up on time or late to punk shows or it’ll be super awkward. i agreed but kinda thought “duh, i told you this when i got there?” 

we were talking today about it. i basically said to him how great it was besides feeling awkward with paul, but that i was glad i brought him because we ended up having fun and that it was good to have him there when i felt left out with his bandmates. jason then proceeded to tell me that he just had a lot of friends there he hasn’t talked to in a while and didn’t mean to leave me out. then he mentioned that i was being loud and he had a headache. i apologized and then he told me that next time i go to a show i should “try not to give people dirty looks” and that i was judging people. i didn’t make any negative remarks about anyone, and the only judging i did was thinking of how cool everyone seemed. 

i’ve been told that i have a “resting bitch face” before by my friends, that they thought i didn’t like them at first, but i’m not trying to. i guess i just always look that way? i try to appear friendly but i don’t really come off that way, i guess. i told him that and he said “it just gives people the wrong idea and leaves a bad impression.” so, okay? i didn’t really know what to say. then he continues and says that people thought we were dating and that he doesn’t want a “bad impression” on him because i’m two years younger than him. we’re in high school but it’s just a two year age difference?

i’m a sophomore and he’s a senior, i didn’t think it was a big deal. plus, no one even knew my age. jason even dated a girl a year younger than me at one point and didn’t care then, so why does he now? at this point i was kind of annoyed. he said i was being really annoying and that i was acting stupid and weird around people and it left “a bad impression on him.” 

by this point i was kind of pissed and a little  hurt. i passive aggressively told him, “fine, i won’t go to your other shows since you don’t want to be associated with me. why do you even care? no one knows my age and it’s a two year age difference, i think you’re just embarrassed to be seen with me which makes me feel like shit.” he then responds with “yikes.” that’s the last i’ve spoken with him. 

i’m really sensitive and he’s one of my closest friends, as i am him. i’m crying in my bathroom right now. i really thought i had fun that night and got closer with his band, but apparently not. i’m worried that i’m THAT girl that’s annoying and loud now. i’ve always tried to not appear that way. i just felt really self-conscious the entire show and i was glad it seemed i was fine when i got home; but i guess not. he’s always kind of brutally honest with everyone but sometimes it’s a little too much. i guess i’m glad he told me but now i just feel anxious and shitty.",02Sep2019,1
765,"Hi everyone, like the title says I’m debating quitting my job after only being there a month. All in all I’m very anxious about this situation and curious as to what I should do with giving notice.


Some back story,


I’m going to school full time getting my bachelors and this job is related to what I’ll be going to graduate school for (think med school, law school, etc) Obviously I’m not doing the job I’ll be going to school for but I am working very closely to it and get a lot of good exposure. My reasoning for wanting to quit is to focus solely on school as I have some ridiculously challenging classes coming up that my academic advisors say “are 40 hour a week classes” that many other students find very time consuming and challenging. These classes are also prerequisite courses needed to apply to the specific graduate program I’ll be applying for, so I need to do extremely well in them. I see it as, this job, while I am getting great exposure to what I want to go to school for and very grateful for that, will not get me to where I want to go, my degree will. 


Also, not related to my schooling but another side note just encouraging my want to leave, my coworker (who is my trainer and has the same title as me, she was the only one in this position before I came along) I believe is also trying to scoot me out the door and has actually told me she wanted to be the only employee in our position when they hired me. She constantly belittles me and makes me feel incompetent when I ask questions and try to learn things. I can tell she doesn’t want me there and it’s overall uncomfortable. My thoughts on this are basically whatever, I want to leave anyway, but just goes to show I don’t think they’ll be too gravely upset. She’s been doing this job for a while with no help and didn’t want me there in the first place.


All in all, I didn’t realize this job would be affecting my schoolwork and grades as much as it is (my fault, I should have realized and thought it through more) and now I want to leave after only a month. I am still very early in training as this job takes a long time to really learn and get the hang of. I’m wondering since I am still such a new employee in training that it is required to give 2 weeks notice? If I didn’t give the 2 weeks I would absolutely tell my boss and not no call no show. I just feel that if I gave two weeks it would be spent showing me things/continuing to train someone who’s leaving anyway. Any advice or insight would be much appreciated!!! Thank you.",02Sep2019,1

768,"First of all, I am aware of r/quittingkratom but posting here for more help as this has a larger user base and this is perhaps more of a general drug quitting situation.  Have been taking Kratom for months and am addicted.  I am able to quit for a week, or two.  Then I go back to taking it.   I have overpowering ADHD and it is a struggle.  Kratom definitely helps, but it comes at a cost.  I just get bored or stressed and want to take my mind off.  I am slipping in my PhD work and now kratom affects my relationships and personal life and my critical thinking ability.

How to quit ""permanently?"" How does an alcoholic or a smoker quit when that stuff is literally right in front of you everywhere you go?  I can quit for a week or two, then it pops back in my head to take it ""just once"" and I get back into the addiction cycle.  I have not told anyone I use and I understand that having a ""social net"" may help, but I am not going to tell anyone.

Although the Kratom community is adamant about protecting their drug, and the doctors I have talked to about Kratom seem to indicate that it's ok, I absolutely want to stop this from existing where I live in order to live a healthy lifestyle.  Head shops advertising Kratom have been popping up all over the place recently which keep tempting me of buying it.  I see one of those then it's back to square one.",02Sep2019,2
769,"We found a stray wild rabbit in the middle of a busy road about 4 months ago. We took it home and milk fed it for around 3 months until it got bigger. We then bought a run to go outside in the back for it so that it could go outside when it got bigger. We let it out a lot in the back garden but it was walled off so that she couldn’t escape. ( we also tried releasing it back into the wild but it came running back to us every time ). There is a shed in the back of the garden and under it was a favourite spot of the rabbit where she would be safe from everything. Today I let her out at about lunch time and would check from my bedroom window on her every once in a while to make sure she was ok and nothing seemed wrong. However, when my mum came home from work she saw a cat in the back garden and we haven’t seen the rabbit since however the cat wasn’t carrying the rabbit and there was no signs of blood or fur. I am very upset by would like some advice on what I could do to find an answer. I would like to speak to the owners of the cat but don’t know a way to find out who they are without catching the cat and looking at its collar which is unlikely since it was the first time I had seen the cat.

770,"So I'm a 18 year old guy who has experienced some change in the recent year.. I'm not sure how I should react to all this and I'd gladly accept any of your advice guys.

So it's been around 1 year since I broke up with my ex, and I feel that I've changed really much since then. It was a tough brake up for me and in a way I still feel that I blame her unconsciously for some of my problems in life. 

 I've become more closed in myself and fear to just share sometimes things or thoughts that bother me. I have great friends and parents that listen and give advice, but I still fear to share it most of the time. (I think because I view it as a weakness and just force myself to get over it). This has effected me in some ways as I was the always happy, open, charismatic extrovert type of guy. Now I feel I'm more bland, less interesting and I've lost some confidence in myself. 

I've also noticed that my pick-up game has been lacking very much recently, or in general my interactions with girls are now pretty limited and I don't even spend time or talk much with someone of the opposite sex. This is really strange as I did not have such problems 1-2 years ago and now I'm just losing my confidence in myself. This should not happen because frankly speaking I'm atleast a bit attractive and I know people have told me that numerous times, but I just somehow lack the confidence to approach and maybe engage in a conversation or something. (i always fear i wont have a topic to talk about or i'll just embarass myself) - this has damaged my self-esteem and I've really grown this lack of confidence and unsureness in myself.

After talking to my mom about some of this, I've realized some of the problems and have been able to adress them somehow, so I feel that sharing this on reddit might also help.
I feel that it's a simple problem that I've induced to myself, but this has been driving me mad for a while and I really needed somewhere to share and maybe someone from outside analyze and give their opinion.",02Sep2019,2

773,"I told my mom about 5 months ago that when I was younger I didn’t feel like I could come to her about things and that I felt like she was too hard on me. I was simply telling her because I didn’t want to keep feeling like I couldn’t talk to her the older I got. I didn’t think it would be that bad of a thing to say.

She got really upset and yelled. Then we sat down and my grandma and aunt said that she has to try and understand me and She needs to accept that these are MY feelings regardless of how she feels and I can tell my mom took it as an attack. I can tell she felt like we were “turning on her”.

She has always said that while I was growing up. Anytime more than one person goes against her she takes it as them turning on her and she cuts them off. My mom was a GOOD mom and I know she loved me and did what she thought was right when it came to raising me , I just felt her delivery was a little harsh sometimes. She would tell me things raw and uncut and it honestly made me think I HAD to think and be like her but I’m my own person.

Soo basically at the end of the conversation my mom says “okay I get it. I was a bad mom. I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you or if I didn’t do enough. I f\*cked up” and then she gets up to leave. We all were supposed to have dinner and I asked her to stay and that she isn’t a bad mom at all but she lied and said she didn’t feel well and needed to go home.

My mom hasn’t called me, or my grandma and I’m aunt since that night. I’m scared to call her because I know she feels like I tried to make her seem like a bad mom. My aunt told me that she went to her house to talk to her about 2 weeks ago and she kind of went off on her and told her she knows that in life you by yourself so she doesn’t know why she except a child to be different.

It hurts me because my mom has been through so much pain and abandonment and the last thing I want her to do is feel like she is alone, like she’s been her whole life before me. I feel like I’ve betrayed her. She’s really good at isolating herself and masking her feelings. I can tell she wanted to cry that night but she didn’t. She thinks showing emotion is giving me or someone who has hurt her the satisfaction of saying they hurt her.

I’m the only person my mom has ever really opened up to ( and I still don’t know her full story) and I feel like I have analyzed her so well over the years and now I regret even saying anything (especially in front of my other family members) instead of just understanding that my mom had been through a lot of abuse &amp; pain so her being hard on me was just to protect me from going through the same things.

774,"I started my job a couple of months ago, and we’re a small team of 5 with my boss included.  I met my coworker R shortly after being hired, and he had only worked about two weeks prior to me getting there. I thought he was cute initially but thought nothing more of it. About the second or third time I saw him he asked if I was on Facebook, and added me right after getting off, and additionally added my Snapchat that was listed on my account.

He messaged me on snap after work and was instantly flirtatious. Comments about how attractive I was, how good I would look in a bathing suit, etc etc. clear flirting. However, multiple times at work I had heard him mention having a girlfriend, and it was known by other people who worked in the building as well, so I wound up asking “Hey, I’m sorry if I misheard you at work, but didn’t you say something about having a girlfriend?” and he wound up telling me that yes he did, but that she “didn’t care if other girls hit on him or checked him out” and that I “wasn’t crossing any boundaries” even though I clearly knew I would be by hitting on him and flirting.

It’s been about a month now and things just escalated quickly. It went from flirting, to more sexual and intimate conversations over text at night and him asking me to come over multiple times (I haven’t as of now) and I my initial thought of “he’s cute” has developed into a partial emotional attachment/ strong sexual desire towards him. I don’t know how long his girlfriend and him have been together, I haven’t pried at the subject since, but I know they don’t live together.

I’m not sure what to do about the whole secret situation. A part of me really enjoys his advances and wants to have sex with him, but another part of me knows it would get really messy fast if somehow we were caught. I’ve essentially developed a partially emotional partially sexual attraction to someone in a relationship who frequently brings up their partner at work and I don’t know what to do, or what the hell is going on in his mind or thought process right now.

TL;DR: I developed an emotional and sexual attraction to someone who pursued me while being involved with a separate partner and have started a secret sexual/ flirtatious thing on the side. We haven’t had sex yet but I know it’s going in that direction and my emotions are really conflicted.",02Sep2019,1
776,"I am a 17 year old guy who (other than reddit) does not use social media at all. I don't even have social media accounts for anything other than reddit. There's a number of reasons for this, but none of them matter to my question really.

So, I have finally decided to join at least one social media platform, but I don't know which to choose. There's so many options: Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. I don't take a lot of pictures, so I think that kinda eliminates Insta. I'm just sorta out of touch with my generation, so I don't really know what people of my age use to talk to each other other than texting and stuff like Discord. 

So I guess that the advice I'm asking for is: as a 17 year old American guy in today's world, what is the best social media platform to join to talk my existing friends and make new ones? Even beyond that, is it worth it to join? Like, do people my age actually use their socials as much as it seems like they do?

777,"So I've never really been the person to initiate a conversation over text. Probably because I didn't get my first phone until I was in 7th grade so already I was a little behind compared to my friends. I say friends but at this point I'm questioning if most of them are my actual friends because other than at school, I never really talk to them. I don't know if that is my fault or theirs or if we are friends or not. I am by no means socially awkward or shy. In fact if you were to ask my close friends about me they would probably say that I'm funny. Usually if I'm standing in a group of people that I know pretty well then I'm usually the center of attention or kind of leading the conversation. But I'm what some people would call a person that gives off NPC vibes, where you have to talk to me first in order to start a conversation. If no one says anything to me then I will literally sit there all day and say nothing. I think I'm like this because if you approach somebody first then they will tend to be more guarded and I worry that I will seem annoying. I tend to overthink everything but I'm not sure if that is what I'm doing here. I really would like to start talking to more people and hopefully get a girlfriend, which I know this sounds kinda pathetic but, I've never actually had (I'm a junior in high-school btw). I guess what I need help with is knowing how to initiate a conversation with someone that I haven't talked to in a while. For example, me and this girl that I've known since freshman year were really good friends throughout that whole year, but we never really talked outside of school. And now I have a really big crush on her and I want to start texting and stuff but I don't know how to initiate a conversation with her all of a sudden after two years of never texting her without it seeming like I am blatantly interested in her, as she has a boyfriend now. However, all I want to do is become friends with her again and I feel that the only way that I can do that is through texting her because we don't have any class together and I rarely see her. So please if you have any advice, it would be greatly appreciated.",02Sep2019,2
778,"So essentially I met this guy last summer and we hit it off and went on a few dates. My parents are really strict and I still live with them so they basically guilt tripped and threatened me into not seeing him anymore. I thought we could still get through it but he gave up on me and moved in with another girl for a few months that winter. He ended up breaking up with her and tried to get back with me literally a few days later. This pissed me off and I didn’t go for it. But he kept texting me from December 2018 to July 2019. In July I finally gave in because he told my mom how his ex had a baby with his best friend. This made me feel really bad for him because I imagined what if someone did that to me and I decided I wanted to not be afraid cuz of the way my parents threatened me last year and just go for it. I don’t think I was in love with him but probably obssesed. So we started talking but the whole time I was convinced he was going to leave or give up again with no evidence of him doing so. I was still hesitant about seeing him in person because I knew he wasn’t the “one” but I had really strong feelings for him idk if that makes sense. One day my mom told me that she found out that this girl I went to middle school with who is my age is pregnant. Something about this triggered me and I thought if I get pregnant my parents won’t be able to stop me from seeing him, he won’t leave me, it would fix the pain his ex caused him by having a baby with someone else. I also had the thought that if I had gotten pregnant last year I could’ve avoided all the pain of him leaving me, being lonely, and having my parents isolate me. I still hadn’t seen his in person because I was a virgin and wanted to wait but all these thoughts made me say fuck it. So we hung out a few times and then I slept with him not because I wanted to but because I wanted to get pregnant and I knew he was crazy about me and wanted to sleep with me too, he was also dumb enough not to use a condom but at least he pulled out. I ended up not getting pregnant but my period was late which made me think it had worked and I realized the reality of what I had done/tried to do. I cried for 2 weeks straight, couldn’t eat or sleep. I swear this isn’t fake. I literally don’t know what is wrong with me. Was this a manic episode? I normally would never do something like this or spiral into such a thought process. I almost ruined my life and his and the potential child’s. I barely know him and I don’t even know if he wanted a kid. I know this was seriously desperate, reckless, immature, and plain stupid. I’m seriously horrified at myself. I ended up breaking up with him because I realized that if I was willing to do something like this then I must not respect him and he deserves better than that. He was falling for me tho and I know this must have really hurt him and I feel so bad. I’m not sure if I should tell him that I tried to do this I think it would only make everything worse. How can I work on myself? I don’t even know who I am anymore and I am scared that I am capable of something like this. I’ve been very sheltered and naive and I know I blame my parents for a lot of stuff instead of taking responsibility. I should probably talk to a therapist but I don’t know where to find a good one. I don’t have friends because I pushed them all away and I can’t bring myself to tell anyone in my family. I am consumed with guilt and horror. How can I in good conscience move on or even try to be in a relationship knowing that I am capable of this? I realize this sounds incredibly stupid but this is 100% real and I really need advice. Like I am pretty self aware and always have been but then I am able to think like this. I have no one in my life but you guys on reddit to ask because I haven’t been able to hold up any type of relationship. I don’t even know what I’m really asking but yeah…",02Sep2019,1
779,"Sorry for the format, english is not my first language yada yada, I'm stupid.

Been in a 1 year relationship that ended at the beginning of this summer. 

In the last few months she started talking on a pretty much regular basis and hanging out with this guy. Both of us were suspicious that he was hitting on her, but I didn't think it was right from me to tell her who to hang out with.

What I did tho was to tell her that I was bothered by the fact that she was spending so much time with a guy I barely knew and didn't trust a bit. And even tho I wanted to make myself accept the situation I had some breakdowns out of jealousy which I'm not proud of.

After some time passed I'm feeling miserable because I feel that I could have handled my actions better and not tell her everything that was bothering me every time I was bothered. I just feel like I overloaded her with my negative emotions and I'm sorry for that.

Some people said that I was justified, she is saying that I was justified, I don't believe that I was justified.

So tell me, was I out of hand?",02Sep2019,1

782,"So I've been studying for the last 15 years and two months ago I graduated with an degree. The problem is, with this degree I'm only qualified to do 1 kind of job, which is... teaching.

So I'm 22 and teaching is my profession. I'm suddenly in the adult life earning money and doing my job. The thing is,,,, I'm not satisfied and I'm afraid that I've chosen the wrong study while I felt the pressure of making a life defining choice at the age of 17... 

I'm teaching my students, I don't have the motivation to make good lessons, to help them stay motivated and I'm not looking forward when I'm going to school. 

I'm not going to impulsively quit my new job, but I'm wondering if I'm really lacking the motivation or that Im actually scared to fail at my job or that I experience both if those things.

I've been thinking about thing I can do in life (with more passion) for a long time, even after my 2nd year of studying.... I never came up with something, but for more then a 2 years I think about turning my hobby of making art into a profession... and I just don't know what to do with my feeling about that and my feeling of teaching... 

Can people help me out? 

And combining the two to become a teacher in arts is not something that's going to work for me. I want to make art myself and not teach is 🙃",02Sep2019,1
783,"Title says most of it. When I was young i was in ""gifted and talented"" courses and found that I genuinely enjoyed learning and reading, and a lot of school stuff came really easily. I still really enjoy being a student. I had a hard time making friends tho, and have always felt like I have an abrasive personality. Since I had a hard time making friends and struggled in other areas of life I just sort of made being the ""smart kid"" my personality. 

But as I've grown up I feel like I've really stayed one dimensional in who I am and cant connect with others. If someone brings up something I relate to or know about I dominate the conversation and come across as a dick. I cringe thinking about those conversations and actively try to avoid joining conversations about stuff I'm passionate about anymore. But that's the only way I know how to connect with people who I'm not close with so I've just stopped talking to people, and im struggling to make connections. 

I've tried to branch out in my interests. Gotten into hiking and crafts, I've tried video games and cult films. And while I enjoy all of those things I never really feel good enough at them to engage with other people. 

Does anyone know how to branch out and stop coming across as a know it all in conversations and create meaningful relationships as an adult?

787,"I've just moved in to my new apartment for Grad school, my orientation starts tomorrow. The official move-in date was September 1st, but the office wasn't open that day, so I picked up my keys on August 31st. When I walked into the apartment, it was a disaster. The kitchen cabinets have no handles, there's drywall dust and cigarette butts all over the main room, the bathroom is covered in more dust, had no toilet, and had no shower head, handles, etc. I walked in as a contractor was painting.

I spoke to the property manager, and they said there must have been a mix-up, it should have been ready, etc. Now it's September 2nd, and the apartment still isn't ready. There's a toilet now, thank god, but the apartment was never cleaned after the work, and the bathroom shower is still unusable. 

What on Earth do I do? Today is labour day, and so the office is still closed. This is completely unacceptable. The apartment is part of a decently nice complex, and I was not expecting anything even remotely like this. Even if they do fix things up, is there any sort of compensation or recompense I'm due for this disaster?

788,"I worked in a team of 4 for a year on a contract, where one member was fired and another was investigated and put on leave for a bit before returning to the team (unrelated reasons). Months went by without any other issue, but then Admin called me on Friday right before the office closes to let me know I'm being given a leave too? 

The coworker that got fired was canned for harrassing and threatening people en masse even after they were fired (phone calls, stalking) - including myself and the last member on the team. Because of being harrassed the 2 of us had kept quiet, and then eventually came forwards as well, but only I'm being now investigated as potentially covering up for that person??

When we came forwards our union rep said we'd get protection but i'm the only one who was on a contract, so when I told union about the leave they said that admin just wanted me fired and that the leave is because union is fighting it. I had JUST gotten contract renewal too so this call came from nowhere? How was I allowed to re-interview and get renewed??

A lot of coworkers say it's sketchy union wasn't informed in the first place and that the leave was decided so late/etc. I just really have no idea what to do now or how to start a career from scratch with this job market (if I have to). Can I still use references from this job if I DO get fired?  Should I consider suing?

789,"This is my second year studying French. Learning this language had always been of my interest, and when I started to learn last year, I really liked it. 

However, I feel like I've fallen out of love with it. Learning isn't fun or interesting anymore. I only read/write/study this language while I'm sitting in class and I'm obliged to do it. I can't find any way to try and incorporate French into my life, I don't really like French music that much, and reading books has become frustrating rather than educational. Most importantly, I've been to France for the first time and it was somewhat of a disappointment. Traveling was my number one motivation to learn French. 

I don't want to continue studying, but I feel that if I leave, I'll be throwing two years out of the window. I've learned things, and I was able to apply some of that knowledge when I was abroad, but I just don't feel it anymore. I'm very disappointed on myself, I thought I would become a good speaker and actually get somewhere with this new knowledge. I feel like I'm failing myself and my parents, who paid for my classes. 

Should I quit my classes once this year finishes or just keep going and see if I change my mind again? I don't really know how to proceed about this and I cant help but feel very, very disappointed.

790,"So, about 7 or 8 months ago I expressed to my parents that I would like to try birth control as a contraceptive method + to shorten my awful periods. Instead of scheduling a doctor's appointment for me so I can get the prescription under my name, they decided to have my mom ask for birth control during her appointment w/ the gynecologist which was coincidentally that week. So, I take birth control under her name. I've been taking it for 7-8 months now, but I am going to be a legal adult in a few months and may leave for college. It would be much more convenient to have it under my name, but I don't know how to tell my doctor that I want to take that exact birth control brand and dosage because it works really well for me. My parents also still make me go to a pediatrician and I don't know if my pediatrician is able to prescribe me it.

791,"Looking for advice about obnoxious neighbors. I don’t really know where to start but here it goes. My husband and I moved into our neighborhood about 4 1/2 years ago. We live in a cul-de-sac and all of our neighbors are great except one. Its hard to tell how many people live here since it looks likes the house has a revolving door. The family has about 14 kids (mostly boys) who’s age ranges from 15 on up. When we moved into this neighborhood we got the skinny on everyone and most everyone has lived their 10+ years so has either had to deal with this family or has had run ins with them. Last week I kind of got to a breaking point. I was woken up at 2 in the morning by a car hitting another car so I got up and looked out the window to see one of the boys standing in his driveway while his friend tried to back up and pull out of his driveway. He ended up hitting my neighbors car and driving away. I screamed out the window and went to get my husband. He immediately called the cops and then we heard a huge crash. The kid ended up driving into a van parked at the end of the street waking up several people and totaling his car and the van. We found out the kid didn’t have insurance and that he was well beyond the level of intoxication. This has kind of been the worst of it. Mostly we deal with the boys lighting off fireworks (the big bomb ones that aren’t even legal), speeding, selling drugs (not conformed but three of the neighbors I’ve spoken to say the same thing), screaming and being rude and loud all hours of the night, having them and their friends doing donuts in the cul-de-sac and so on.  The cops have been called numerous times but nothing seems to happen to them but warnings. I’m getting tired of the kids and like I said the parents refuse to believe their kids behave like this. The dad is a truck driver, so he is rarely home and I never see the mom so I don’t even know if she is even there.

792,"To lay some context I am a senior at my University. I have been without a car since my sophomore. The weather ruined my previous one and I have money coming now that will allow me to buy something much nicer.

There is a lot (a very trusted lot and one that helps students) not far from my hometown. I have seen a few others but this lot and the guy who runs are very nice. I noticed 2 cars and both are in great condition but I am in need of some advice on which car sounds better. At the end I will provide my own opinion and my family and friends opinions.

1. Buick Lacrosse 2011 model: 69K miles, from a little town dominated by rich older people (so very good condition). 30MPG, Bluetooth, and white in color. I haven't looked at the car fax. The interior looks really really taken care of. $12999

2. Chevorlet Cruise 2014 model: 3 years younger than the lacrosse, 79K miles, 20 MPG, Bluetooth, color is bluish black, haven't looked at the carfax, interior also looks really well taken care of. $10099

Both are under the dealerships warranty. The cruise has a warranty under Chevy but that warranty is nearing it's 5 year end.

Both are very very nice cars. The Buick being literally nice and affordable for such a nice well taken care of and the Chevy Cruise being nice in that it is younger, cheaper, and a good college student car.

My opinion: the Buick. While it's 3 years older it's mileage is still less than 10000 compared to the cruise meaning it was probably driven rarely and catered to by someone with money. I like the interior more, hate that it's white, and for 2000 more it is just a steal.

My family: the cruise 2000 cheaper and just a really good car to start with. Might be able to get an extended warranty and I'd it tears up parts are cheaper. (All very fair points).

My friends: The Buick. Nice car, 10 more MPG (so more time before a fill up but more for that fill up).

Now I want some Reddit opinions and why. I am really up for any advice and this is in the air.

Personally I am biased towards the Buick. I have 4000 to put down as a down payment. I will probably only put 3 in case either car needs something. I have thought about the Buick all day. My entire family owns Chevy and I trust Chevy brands. My mom drives a Toyota and owned a KIA and both are fantastic car brands. Know one in my family has owned something like the Buick.

I am in dire need of advice and really want honest opinions. I'd the cruise is the better deal then tell me why. If the Buick is a better deal I want to know why. Either opinion is appreciated. Mind you this is before the price of haggling with the dealer ship (which my step dad is amazing at).",02Sep2019,2

794,"About 15 years ago, I was a single guy. I was in a  short-term relationship (4-6 months or so) but cut things off prior to a military deployment as I didn't want to put her through that. We met again after my deployment but I started dating someone seriously soon after. However, I essentially cut her off from all contact when starting my new relationship. No callbacks, texts, etc. Same with a close female friend who I had a long-distance fling with after a friendship of about 10 years. Cut off, no calls or communication whatsoever, even though they both tried.


So essentially, two of the sweetest girls who did nothing but help me through hard times and befriended me, were cut off because of my new relationship. With me being stupid, I lied twice to my new live-in girlfriend regarding other girls (not the ones in question). After piecing that back together (no cheating, I just thought it was better to lie than to tell the truth, which was obviously stupid), I figured it was best to go no-contact with every girl in my life to smooth things over. 


I know I'm an asshole. However, my question is this: Is it worth it (or even advisable) to send them a quick message apologizing for my actions and behavior. I'm happy in my marriage and I'm sure they've moved on and couldn't care less about me. I'm not looking to rekindle anything. And I'm not even looking for friendship in the future or forgiveness. But I don't want to open wounds or cause issues in their current lives.


I just want to say I'm sorry for being a shit human and wish I could have handled it like a mature adult, which I definately want at the time (I was a functioning alcoholic after returning from the last deployment when all of this happened, so a bunch of my decisions don't make me proud today).

This is a problem I have struggled with for all of my life essentially, where I pick up and lose interest in just about anything and everything so quickly. Every week or few weeks I'll hear about, see, or read something that sparks my interest and I'll fall completely obsessed with it. Random shit. Last week it was coin collecting, after becoming obsessed with r/Silverbugs. It bores my girlfriend because I can't help but talk continuously about whatever it is despite being really conscious and suppressing that urge to waffle a lot, but the worst bit for me is it always leaves me feeling really flat. Like will I ever truly be able to stick to something? In the moment it all feels so real, but I lose interest so fast. I can have a new hobby and overnight almost forget about it despite it consuming me the day before. I am afraid this aspect of my personality will feed into my career and relationship later on in life.

First I get angry and I act out, but not too hard. I don't scream, maybe I start to get more sarcastic and cold to this person. I hate arguing and avoid it at all costs so it never gets heated. We may argue lightly and then not speak for a moment.

Then anger gets replaced with sadness. Why this person did what they did? Do they not like me? Did they do it on purpose or not?

Phase three is I realize I've gotten angry and that I crossed a line and I get even more sad for starting an argument over something minor.

Final phase is realising that I'm acting all out of place and that I shouldn't have such mood swings but can't help it. This makes me even more depressed.

Then I need some time to relax and it goes away for a time. Fortunately it doesn't happen that often but is annoying nevertheless.

And do I even need to meet them in person? How do I make connections and get them interested in paying me through online communication/photos/videos etc? I also would like to point out that I’m not going to have sex with them as I’m hoping for the really old guys who just need someone there for them.

About a year ago, I asked a girl out (I had liked her for ages) but she rejected me. I wanted to just be friends purely because being friends is better than not being friends. I would just ask her to be friends and nothing more but I have no confidence but I really want to be friends with her

827,"I want to keep this as short as possible because there's a very long history between me and this friend. We are pretty close in age; I am 25 and she's 26. We've both lived in the same city for the entirety of our friendship and have been friends for around twelve years. We had one of those friendships where there were a few falling outs but in the end, it was kept intact. However, for nearly the entire friendship, it has been very one-sided. Meaning I was always the one doing favors, putting my safety on the line, etc. I stayed friends with her throughout the course of her being in a very terrible relationship and provided support the entire time. I even gave her a place to stay when things got rough with her family. After her unhealthy relationship with her ex ended, she continued on this path of self destruction. This led to her getting into a relationship after the toxic one and she ended up doing something very bad to her partner at the time. I was so fed up with her bad decisions that we had another falling out. Fast forward several months later, we reconnected and she seemed to be in a lot better place.

She's pursuing a career she's passionate about and has found a partner who can genuinely provide for her emotionally and financially. My issue here is, though I have always wanted the best for her, I find it hard to be happy for her that all these great things are coming her way. I know that doesn't sound all that great, but I have just been dealt the short end of the stick from her for such a long time and have seen how she has treated others. I also know that she has not changed entirely and that she's still somewhat manipulative and might also be dating this current guy for his money.

In the end, even though she might have not fully changed as a person, I just want to learn how to let the bitterness go. How can I make myself not as mentally involved in this situation? Am I valid for feeling the way that I do? My mind is just so foggy.",02Sep2019,2
828,"Hey, so first of some basic info

 I weight around 90Kg and I have 185ish cm height. Curently in 3rd year of HS. Im losing weight and putting up the musscle for last half a year and it kinda shows... well i have fallen in love with a girl about 2 years ago and she was the driving force behind my change.

&amp;#x200B;

I was too afraid to do anything until this March, when we started talking and stuff, we went for a ride or two together and everything seemed fine, as for being friends that is. The feeling was killing me from the inside... I guess she kinda noticed i was awkward, but that was normal for me really.

 I started talking and messaging her a bit and i liked her even more. Around April/May I had to go do something and one of my girl friends joined me on the way and we went together, which made this girl angry and me, the awkward dumb blind without experience guy, didnt notice, that she was jealous. She just brushed it off just that she ""overreacted"". After she was a bit flirty and stuff, but again, i was too dumb and scared to do anything. I asked her out a few times, but it crashed on either me not having time, or her ""not having time/not wanting to"" not sure really"" After that i tried talking to her but it wasnt quite the same... 

so jump to end of June and I started talking with her again. It was ok, normal casual stuff, kind of starting over... This went until mid of July and i got drunk. I texted her that ""i like her for a long time and a lot, and that I guess that she probably doesnt feel the same way, but at least I got it off my chest."" Before i could delete it the morning after, she already saw it, so it was kinda pointless... She msg me back saying ""Thats nice, sorry for not responding, I was quite busy."" and nothing much after that. I said my sorry for texting drunk and stuff like that... Then for another 2 weeks I couldnt even look her in the eye thx to shame. She smiled at me and we had a little conversations, but nothing else.

Then here comes the last few days, Ive been to party and we sat at one table, talking, having fun... you know, normal stuff, group of like 4-5 people. When i had to go for my ride, she offered to take me, then after that offered me to sleep over at her place, but that i need to sleep on the ground or in the net. I had to go home because of job tomorow so i declined the sleep but went with the ride... The ride was fun, we had caraoke ... nothing else happened after that.  We wanted to go for a ride but Im too afraid to even text her, so going up to her is just out of hand really. 

I just dont know what to do, Shes on my mind a lot, Not that i stalk her, but i think of her a lot. I saw her good/bad sides and Im aware shes not perfect and i kinda roll with the ""out of my league"" narative. I just cant see objectively anymore...

837,"TL;DR at bottom 
In about a month I will be returning home to the states after a year of traveling in South America. 
Along the way my clothes have gotten totally dirtied, tattered, and/or destroyed. I am very particular about my clothes &amp; have difficulty finding the right sizes. I do my shopping on a few reliable websites. 

Here’s my travel itinerary:
On Oct. 12th I am flying from Cartagena to Chicago with a 6 hour layover in ft. lauderdale. 

I will spend a week in Chicago participating in an orientation for a new job before flying home to Washington, DC on the 19th. 

I need to have nice business casual clothing by the time I land in Chicago since the company will be picking me up from the airport. I will be staying with a current employee. 

Here’s the predicament: 
The clothes in Colombia are terrible quality &amp; don’t fit me
My websites don’t ship to Colombia, only to the USA. 
I do not want to have clothes shipped to the address in Chicago since I barely know this woman with whom I’m staying &amp; that seems unprofessional &amp; it embarrasses me greatly &amp; this will be my first impression at this new organization. It will also be a bit late. Please don’t tell me to do this. 
I don’t want to ship them to states &amp; have a friend ship them to me in Colombia because i don’t know if they will arrive on time &amp; it would also be expensive.

What I want to do is pick up the clothes from somewhere in Fort Lauderdale during my lengthy layover there. 

However I’m not sure how to go about this. 
Would a hotel hold onto my package for me even if I’m not planning on staying there?
There are several close to the airport. 
There is also a post office close to the airport but as far as I know we don’t have package collection from post offices in the US. 
Are PO Boxes expensive? 
Do airports ever receive packages for ppl to collect?

838," I'm bipolar type 2, don't know if this matters but it may be contrinuting to my issues.

The title pretty much says it. I am in the best relationship of my life and have full trust in my boyfriend. But whever he has a female friend I'm immediately agitated and threatened by them. I automatically assume they want him either physically or in an emotional affair sort of way. I compare myself to them and I always feel inadequate. I don't fear he will sleep with them, but that he will end up falling for them or at least falling for the feeling of being wanted by them.

I was very ill (physically and mentally) most of my life and now I am functional enough to enter the real world. While other women have had time to get their shit together, I am just learning how to deal with having a busy schedule and stay on top of things. You would be surprised at the soft skills  you miss out on learning when you've been sick for a long time. I can't even remember to brush my hair every day, much less have a skin care routine and 9-5 job.

My boyfriend does everything in his power to make me feel more comfortable. He let's me know who he is talking to and about what, he invites me along to their hang outs, he lets me vent to him without judgment, all without me asking for these things. So I don't really feel this is his fault. I am just beginning to realize there's nothing more he can really do, it's up to me. It's not HIM that scares me, it's women. Really people in general, but in this instance it's specifically women.

I am in therapy and I am discussing these things with her, but I am just now sort of realizing I have these biases towards other women. Despite being a feminist and having female friends whom I love an support, it seems like I have this mental ""stamp of approval"" I've given them, but not other women because I don't know them.

This is all very exhausting. I want to trust women to respect my relationship, and I want women to feel warmth and friendliness around me, instead of hostility and mistrust. It's so tiring to be so tense at about any chance he might speak to a woman.

During that time, having seen each other around mutual friends, we both certainly know about our interest in one another, and I think she's absolutely great. We're going to be meeting up one-on-one soon, and I'm very much looking forward to that. 

However, there is a problem. She leaves for university in a couple of weeks, and I leave for a different university a couple weeks after that. Having already caught feelings for her, I feel a huge amount of stress about what I should do about this potentially good relationship. I am torn between a few options: I could talk to her now, before we meet up, and discuss what we want to do in terms of defining what the thing between us is; I could talk to her after the date about it, or I could wait until before she leaves (and after we potentially meet up a couple more times) to talk about it.

My current stance is that I would like the relationship to be a (regrettably short) 'summer fling', as it means that initial uni life, including making new friends there, isn't affected. I say this because, despite knowing online articles don't know everything, they usually say it's best to enter uni single because the time invested in your long-distance partner can get in the way of spending time making new friends, and all that jazz. It makes sense to me.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Potentially some reassurance too, as I'm quite stressed about it lol.

It's not the season yet (doesn't start till November) but we have off-season practices that we are supposed to go to. My coach understands that I can't make it to practice as often, but he still wants me to come practice when I have time. Season doesn't actually start till November. Our coach wants a 6th period wrestling theory class which is pretty cool.


There's already an issue with that. My 6th period class is an AP Language class. I treat this class with most care out of any other class. I don't want to fail. I don't want to leave an AP class for a sport. 

Grade-wise I'm fine. The only class I've always struggled with is math. Holy crap, I suck at this class so much. Now I'm not saying I don't know basic math. We typically learn algebra (not sure if it's Common Core) which isn't really my strong suit.

My teacher says by getting a job, I'd be putting a lot on my plate. My parents say that if my grades ever drop to a D or multiple Cs, I can kiss my job goodbye.  They also say that if I'm ever stressed, I have to leave that stress at school and at my job (if I get it), which pissed me off because that's a big contradiction on their part.

At any point, my grades could drop, I could stress out and just completely snap, or I'll be forced to move classes. Right now,I just want to focus on the present. Would applying at some fast food place be worth it? I'll still learn something (maybe I can learn how to take crap from rude ass people) even if it's not much? What should I do? If you've worked at the Habit, what was it like?",02Sep2019,1

849,"I dont call just anyone an asshole for no reason, he's a capitol A Asshole. Here's why. 

He's currently cheating on his girlfriend, he manipulated her by using her sick grandma as a way to make him the shoulder to cry on, he's 17 and hasn't even gotten a job or drivers license, he treats me like I'm just some random kid he can tell to shut up, he stole money (like over $300) from my parents to buy vbucks on fortnite, he got my entire xbox account suspended (he uses my xbox cause he broke his own) because he called a kid on fortnite ""retarded"", he sneaks out of the house to screw a third girl sometimes, he punches holes in walls when he's mad, and he's just a generally scummy person who hangs out with shitty friends. 

I love the guy dont get me wrong and he does have his good parts but I mean if you're messing up everything for yourself this bad in not sure it really matters if you have SOME good traits. I can sort of see why he's in the position he's in, our real mom is a druggie, abusive prostitute and I hate her (yes I'm aware that's terrible to say about my mom). And I'm not sure he's fully over her either, he still talks to her over Instagram sometimes.

852,"Ok, so my gf (18) and me (20) are (probably?) in a big problem right now. We’ve know each other for 2 years and dating for 7 months now. Some things to know about my gf that are relevant to this are: 

- She only has one ovary, the other one got removed when she was a child. 

- The one ovary that she has and functions is polycystic so it isn’t rare for her to skip a period.


So far in the last 4 months we have had unprotected sex from time to time (doing it outside of her *most* fertile days, I know there is still a risk but we decided to go for it anyways, dumb I know).

Usually, whenever she skips a period we go and test for pregnancy, just in case she may have gotten pregnant so we can react accordingly and get an abortion (it’s legal here in Mexico).


The thing here is that she has never skipped more than 2 periods in a row (2 being the rarest cases)  and it’s been almost 3 now (her period always comes in the last or first days of the month) so we’re pretty lost on what to do now. The first month she skipped her period we tested 2 times using the regular pregnancy tests and it came out negative both times, the second month it didn’t come we got a little bit scared thinking it may have been a false negative both times (super rare) so we decided to do a blood test and it came out negative so we calmed down and thought it was one of those rare cases when she skips 2 periods in a row.

Fast forward to 5 days ago and she tells me her period is not here again so she decided to go to her doctor and talk to her about it and maybe get an ultrasound or another pregnancy test but the doctor didn’t come because apparently she’s on vacation that week and didn’t tell her... so after my gf ranted about it for a few minutes we started to calculate how many days have passed since the first day she could have gotten pregnant (the first day of her most fertile days after her last period) and it would reach 3 months in about 11 days so we started freaking out thinking we won’t be able to get an abortion (unless we do it in the next 7 days) in case she is indeed pregnant. 

I suggested we go to an abortion center and get her checked there or maybe go get another blood pregnancy test or set up an appointment with a different doctor and get an ultrasound, we don’t know which would be the best option. 

We don’t really know what to do now. I don’t want this to be a case of ‘I didn’t knew I was pregnant until I gave birth, I still had my period and even did tests and they came out negative’ like my mom says it happened to her :/.

Her child lives with her alongside her family. Not sure how custody will be in the future.

856,"Hey Reddit, 

My best friend (M 21) and I (F 19) go to separate colleges (1000 miles away.) I have been there for him with with past girlfriends, always been the shoulder to cry on. I knew at the end they were no good, etc. He is a very sensitive guy.

He was with this girl for 2 years. Happiest I've seen him, she was good to him, no disrespect for him having female friends, had their boundaries, etc. If it wasn't for her scholarship, she would of moved into his apartment with him. 

Over the summer, he took me ring shopping for her. The ring. I knew that she was great, but i tried advising him to remember that this is their senior year. (I didn't want to be that friend, but always give him a dose of honesty) He went down to school with a ring, only me and his other hometown friend know. 

A few days ago I called, and he was devastated. She dumped him. I didn't ask why, he didn't propose. I just know that I need to be there for him. 

Reddit, what do I do. I cannot leave school and hop on a plane but I know that a phone call can only do so much.

857,"This is a situation I'm in but I'm the sick one.

Being ill makes things harder, we live together and I cant keep up with housework or be particularly active, I can do most normal things but I might pay for it the day after.

I'm asking cus he says I'm the love of his life but he is also saying that being with someone chronically ill is so hard for him he thinks if my health doesn't improve he won't be able to keep going with the relationship. He feels like things are unequal if I'm not able to work and contribute and do more around the house. Currently I am living off of my own savings but that will run out eventually and I can't get welfare as the government will consider his income even if I don't get any of it.

I just want some perspective, I personally feel like he could break his spine tomorrow and I'd still wanna be with him. It makes me wonder if he doesn't love me enough or if most would give up a relationship if one got sick and he really does love me but it's too hard.",02Sep2019,1

860,"I have no friends. None. Zip. Nada. 

It's been this way for a while and I just can't seem to fix this problem. Without friends (and with very limited money) I find myself sat in the house with nothing to do most days, it's not a conscious choice as I'd much rather be doing something or spending time with people - options locally are very limited, especially within walking distance and public transport is too costly. Obviously I'm lonely, I'm bored, I feel like my life is slipping away. 

I feel like having no friends makes it harder to make friends too because you're seen as a loner or weirdo, if I go places everyone else is there with friends so have little interest in the loner trying to force themselves into their social interactions. Also my partner knows thousands of people and as he works as a performer or in bars he's constantly surrounded by people, he goes out with his coworkers on weekends, and so I worry he's starting to look unfavorably towards me for having no life/no social life. If I do ever meet people they ask things like what I did on the weekend or what I do for hobbies, etc. but the answer is always 'nothing', which is off-putting to people.

Another issue is that I've not had female friends as an adult, it's not a conscious choice but I feel even less social connection with women than I do with men, the problem is too often guys only want to be friends with me up until they realise they're not going to get anywhere re. dating then they vanish...that shit hurts!

I've tried Meetup which was okay but an abusive ex is heavily involved with all the local groups and is friends with many members so it's off-limits now. I've no hobbies and struggle to find hobbies, things like dance classes I should have loved but I ended-up hating because it's no fun on your own...when you're self-conscious it makes a big difference to have a friend there with you being useless too, thus why everyone else in classes would be there with friends! I volunteer but I've been there over a year and not made friends, as I'm there to work and there's no one I'd really see myself socializing with. I've tried the gym, I go to free events, I go to the coffee shop, etc. For a while I used to go to my favourite bar occasionally but as a woman I stood out like a sore thumb being there on my own all the time. 

I'm beyond sick of being alone all the time. I just can't seem to connect to anyone at all. 

I suffer depression and this loneliness is a huge contributing factor. 

As far as I know people don't dislike me, I'm polite and know social rules for conversations, but I'm just not finding the opportunity to meet people or able to make connections. What am I supposed to try next?",02Sep2019,5

We did have sex last week and I was severely uncomfortable after because I was feeling a lot of pressure down under...for that reason I am still concerned about it idk if that's normal.
Now before we got docters orders we were having sex about twice a week and I found out he had spent 600 dollars on webcam girl sites for private shows/pictures in 2 weeks.We talked it out and came up with the agreement that he was stressed out about new baby ,living with his family, job security and other emotional distress.I suggested therapy so he could have a third party to work on everything and have a healthier mentality before our baby is born. He agreed.
Before I go any further I want to say I don't mind him watching porn... the only thing I have a problem with is him spending money on it when we have things we need to get for our baby.
I have since caught him twice paying for videos and pictures online and seen from his browser history on his phone that he's on webcam sites and porn sites when he's in public every day. Last night I found a conversation on his messenger between him and his ex where he told her that he is having to jerk off in a public restroom because I don't want to have sex....that really hurt me.I brought it up to him today and he just wants to write it off as stress but I think he really needs help with this.
I tried to shorten this down and keep all information needed.Am I wrong about him needing sex addicts anonymous or overreacting about the entire thing?

Now the phone is back, but I pay for the bill even though its in her name and she goes through it regularly. I also cannot search things without her knowing as she checks search history, cell provider history, and dns network. I am now allowed to have only an ista account that she monitors, my Reddit and tiktok accs are secret. Is she overreacting? Am I underreacting?",02Sep2019,0
886,"Over the last year with my boyfriend (who is lovely and caring and mostly patient) I have noticed myself becoming increasingly irritable and getting into horrible moods over the tiniest thing, which often ruins both of our days.

887,"So I work at a private country club as a bagmen. A rough example of my schedule would be something like 7am to 3pm on a weekday or 5:45 to 2pm on a weekend. Usually the first half of each shift involves setting everything up and sending the members out for their rounds of golf.  We get a rush of members from open to about 11am. Around 11-12 is when the members who went off at open start finishing their rounds. This is when they tip 95% of the time. Rarely do they tip before their rounds. We split tips evenly between each bagmen at the end of every shift.

Now here's what I want to bring up to my boss. Theres this kid that's worked there for quite a few years that's managed to only get 12 to close shifts. Conveniently right in time for the members to start coming back from their rounds. The morning guys do all of the work and then this kid gets to sleep in then come in and get to split the tips that we worked our asses all morning for. He then putz around all day and barely works too which pisses me off.

I cant tell you how many times myself and another bagmen worked our asses off all morning, get about $25 in tips before noon due to not many members being done with their rounds yet, and then around $150 rolls in from noon to 2 when the bulk of the members finish. But, now we have to split that 3 ways with the kid that comes in at 12 n barely works. 

I'm sick of it and I'm going to talk to my boss about it. What do I say? Am I even justified in being pissed about this?",02Sep2019,1
888,"It’s a heavily debated topic in the motorcycle  world weather you should run from the police or accept the ticket. I get it, it’s tempting. And you have a very good chance of getting away. I can admit I have run from the police before. I don’t recommend running form the police but if your going to run, run correctly.
If you get caught running from the police, you will get a felony and a 400 dollar fine (in most states). So try not to get caught.
First, pull aside, let the police officer think your going to stop. The police will get out of his car and tell you to kill your engine, (kill it) after he walks over he’s going to ask you to get off of your bike, (this part is important) turn your bike back on and tell the cop to “hold on” this should throw him off. Put your bike into first gear and full throttle the opposite way of where the cop car is facing. The cop will run into his car and turn around, at this point you should be very far in front of him. Now, cut into the woods. Go into the woods and stay there out of sight until the cop passes, then go the opposite way he you just went. What do you do now? Change outfits if possible, then go straight home and take a brake from riding for a bit, also make sure your face and body is covered. Don’t show your eyes, the human eyes are the easiest way of recognizing someone.

They suffer from mental illness — e.g., complex PTSD and dissociative disorders — and our being apart is taking its toll. Their family is toxic and emotionally abusive, they have no friends in their home country, and they are having difficulty managing day-to-day tasks. Professional help is unavailable due to the lack of specialists. They were in the U.S. with me for almost three months on a multi-entry visa, but had to return in July. They feel isolated, unsafe, and they are experiencing suicidal ideation due to persistent depersonalization and derealization (DP/DR), which rob them of their emotional connection to anything, and the feeling that there is no escape.  

I need to be with them ASAP, and I'm asking for advice on how to close the distance. I am technically a citizen of an EU country — Malta — because my father was born there. I need to supply a passport and an apostilled copy of my birth certificate to the Maltese embassy to register my birth in Malta. Once that's done, I can live and work in Europe indefinitely.

I was soooo excited for The Last Jedi... And then I watched it. Despite feeling something was off, I kept watching, kept hoping for things to get good. And then... Then Luke died. Never raised his X-Wing from the water. Never got to teach Rey. Never got to make up for his mistakes. He just died to save about 20-30 people. That\`s when the rest of the movie fell apart for me. Everything that had been nagging me in the back of my mind just came pouring out. And then the final realisation: this was it. The last chance to see Mark Hamill as an older Luke Skywalker.

This post isn\`t to spark discussion. I don\`t want to stop other people from enjoying it. It\`s about me not being able to let it go. Every time I see Star Wars, I just get sad. I read the Thrawn trilogy again, and the Darth Bane trilogy, but I just can\`t enjoy Star Wars in the same way again. It just keeps reminding me of it. I get angry, I can just feel this hatred that brings me from rage to sadness, to apathy. I need to let it go. But I don\`t know how. I know my girlfriend wants me to.

I just want to treat it like I treat the Transformers movies, or the Twilight movies. If you like it, fine, just not for me. But with The Last Jedi, it feels personal. It feels like a complete betrayal.

I know my problems might seems like a princess having to choose between caviar and gold. 
But hear me out. 

I live in France, the work system might be unknown to you, same for the average pay here might seems too low or too high compared to what the cost of life is up there.
Minimum wage is like 1200 here.

I'm confronted between two choices : 

Pursuing what could be a career in sound engineering, filled with traps and uncertainty but for an average work of 520+ hours a YEAR for  1900+€ minimum /month salary.
You really got to find those hours and everyone in the game is fighting for them.
(France special  entertainment tech support regime).

Or: 

Being a state soundtech worker in the festivities departement as a second of headmaster of festivities department (really nearby town 15+min by car)

39 hours a week for 1650€  but with an insurance of keeping your work for as long as you don't insult and hurt someone or being really bad at it.
(France's special stateworker's regime) 

One one hand, I'll have to deal with a precarious system but it will help me grow fast and meet various artists, known and to be known of the public, working with hundreds of people, meeting new persons every shows, travelling etc...

On the other hand, I'll be assured of a constant revenue, a safe place with people I can trust, the artistic side of it will be limited to local performers and associations, and stay safe where I live. 

My expenses are 1000+€ a month to keep paying the rent/charges/loan. The rest is for food and hobbies. 

What do you think. 
I'm asking because I want/need external thoughts about this. I think You guys and girls overseas might surely have an out of the box vision of this.

909,"  

In this post I will be writing about my personal experience with the three subjects mentioned in the title: overthinking, depression, and anxiety. I put them all into the same category because I believe they are all connected. I believe that these problems all stem from a rational place in my mind. This is quite scary… because it takes a lot of logic and reasoning for anybody to rationalize themselves into a metal state like the one I am in right now, which makes this line of thinking more likely of being correct. So, why am I like this?

Well, the overthinking part of this unholy trinity wholly stems from my fascination with cognitive dissonance and unrelenting self-reflection, from my constant journey into my own nature trying to figure out who I really am. At any point of the day I find myself over-analyzing the situations I’m in, however little. I try to find the best way of going about them instead of *just* going about them, possibly out of fear of *just* going about them. Nothing I ever do is ever good enough for me, because my own mind refuses to be satisfied with myself. 

You would think that this would be a good thing, but it is unbearable. Headaches are common. Stress over unmet goals amount over time. Self-imposed self-hatred cripple me, causing depression. The mind gets flooded with thoughts and they never stop. I can’t understand any of them. Sometimes I can’t understand those around me, because I am so focused on finding the best way to butter my morning toast. God knows how terrible it would be if the toast isn’t done correctly, the frustration that comes from it is incredibly immense! I try to decipher what people think of me, what people *mean* by what they are saying to me. I can’t enjoy anything because I’m trying to make everything better, as paradoxical as that sounds. Some of the reasons I overthink are perhaps still unknown. I have a deep love of philosophy, and perhaps I’m trying to take all of the validity I see the different schools of thought I read about and arrange them into one perfectly solid ideology, which is an impossible task. This leaves me with a hole in my life where a foundational philosophy should be, however reject because I don’t believe in one perfectly correct worldview. This is where my hatred of religion comes from, among other extremely solid reasons. Perhaps I should stop looking for one and just take the good advice where I find it and move on? But what constitutes good advice? Where does one get good advice? These questions plaguing my mind are unbearable, and indeed physically painful, and serve as a foundational basis for my anxiety. 

This is why I think my anxiety is so closely related to my overthinking, because the two share very many similarities. Perhaps they are one in the same. The only difference I see is that my overthinking for the most part comes from my own self, and my anxiety (though certainly a problem with my brain) is triggered by external forces- sometimes as small as a loud sound or constant rattling. When it is really bad, perhaps from the voice of my own mother- who I detest more and more by the passing day. The anxiety also seems to make me fear the world rather than just myself, another interesting difference. The anxiety and overthinking are also major causes of my depression which, like I said, I believe is completely rationalized.

My depression stems from yes, both the anxiety and overthinking, but perhaps from my longing for a purpose. Without a foundational philosophy, it is quite difficult to understand the world and find meaning in it- especially when it is so bleak and cruel. I unwillingly rationalize it by thinking about how I will never be able to achieve the best form of every situation that I seek. I rationalize it by thinking about how much trouble I cause to many of my schoolmates, the trouble I have caused to the world, and the trouble I have caused to myself (funnily enough). I think about the suffering I endured and endure at the hands of my family. Though I have never tried suicide, I have had suicidal thoughts relatively recently. The only thing holding me back is my close group of friends, who I do find a way to help and who in return seem to find a way to help me. I care little for my family. I disagree with them on religion, politics, common decency. Ethics. I despise the way they treat each other and treat me- but what am I to do. My friends, literature, and marching band are my only forms of oasis. Even those are being poisoned by my steadily declining mental health.

I hope you can understand some of the harder-to-describe concepts in this paper. Hopefully you can help me. I would be incredibly grateful and in your debt.",02Sep2019,2

Gloria had never dated much or anything, always been in her studies and doing whats best for her career. Until this guy. 

I get it, he's this tall, muscular, admittedly very handsome black guy who's a smooth talker... and Gloria fell for him instantly. Overnight she disappeared from our study sessions and does her work alone. 

I went to confront her once and I heard her screaming like they were having sex on the other side of the door and he was saying some grotesque things to her about feeling her stomach and she was agreeing! She would never talk like this before. I ran away immediately once I realized what was going on.

She always shows up to class and does her work but if she's not working, she tied up on this guy. She says she loves him, is always doing something for him and defends him to a T. 

Im worried he's just a smooth talker though. Her mom is worried, us her friends are worried and we just want her to not get so tied up into some guy who honestly is 26 and shouldnt be focused on some college girl.

He normally complains about work (we don't see each other as he works a lot), I told him he could tell me about these things as they happen but he's said he'd rather not have me associate him with whining about work...I pointed out the important thing is just hearing from him! But again this weekend he's not been messaging much despite having things going on he could have told me about eg. he moved Sunday and went to a club I used to go to after work on Saturday. 

He's busy but it doesn't take much effort to send a text message, when we were still jut friends we'd not talk often either but maybe would have a long conversation via WhatsApp every few months...I'm not expecting that all the time, not like I've much to talk about, but just short texts back and forth when we can. To me that's normal within a relationship. 

He's the one who wanted a relationship, he's told his friends and mom about me, but then...there's this.

(Where I need advice) Anyway now im an adult (22F) and if I feel a crumb or anything touch me in bed im awake shaking out my sheet and covers and it takes a very long time to calm myself down. Im starting to really struggle to sleep at night as quite often I randomly wake up or am just drifting to sleep, something touches me, maybe a crease in my cover brushes my leg and I freak. Then im up for hours. Please any advice to get over this stupid fear would be amazing, im starting to struggle with the sleep loss some days and I dont know what to do anymore. I wish I wasnt like this, I dont even understand why im like this.",02Sep2019,1
922," My fiancé and I are in a long-distance relationship: I live in the U.S., they live in Poland. They suffer from mental illness — e.g., complex PTSD and dissociative disorders — and our being apart is taking its toll. Their family is toxic and emotionally abusive, they have no friends in their home country, and they are having difficulty managing day-to-day tasks. Professional help is unavailable due to the lack of specialists. They were in the U.S. with me for almost three months on a multi-entry visa, but had to return in July. They feel isolated, unsafe, and they are experiencing suicidal ideation due to persistent depersonalization and derealization (DP/DR), which rob them of their emotional connection to anything, and the feeling that there is no escape.

I need to be with them ASAP, and I'm asking for advice on how to close the distance. I am technically a citizen of an EU country — Malta — because my father was born there. I need to supply a passport and an apostilled copy of my birth certificate to the Maltese embassy to register my birth in Malta. Once that's done, I can live and work in Europe indefinitely.

The issue is that we need to be able to sustain ourselves for the 1–2 months it takes to complete birth registration, because until that happens, I won't be able to legally work in Europe — I've been trying to find remote job opportunities.",02Sep2019,1
923," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",02Sep2019,0
924," So last night me [16m] and a friend [not important] went over to someone else’s house who was having a small get together it and it was pretty late (prolly like 10pm) We were all just sitting around a fire talking and then I hear a conversation between an acquaintance [16 or 17m] and a girl I’ve never met (I’m assuming she was either a close friend of his or his gf)

First, I really like this guy. He seems super sweet and he’s always been nice to me. He always says hi to me and I’m not the most popular kid so that really means a lot. He also seems to have a lot of friends and is well liked. Which is why I’m so surprised by what happened last night 

A few things about him:

He played a sport in the spring season but was injured most of the season so he was rarely there. He is in a sport this season (xc) and is not longer injured, but has rarely shown up in the 2 weeks since we started which was weird because I got the impression he liked running. 

I think he and his girlfriend broke up at the end of the year, sometime after she was diagnosed with breast cancer which hit him really hard. He came to practice that day in tears and was out crying pretty much all practice which made me feel awful for him. 

Last night when I got there he was sleeping on a lawn chair by the fire. When he woke up this is what I gathered from the conversation that ensued I just want to preface it by saying he wasn’t trying to hide the conversation, he was just casually talking to the girl next to him and it was very easy to overhear. However, I’m pretty sure I’m the only one who heard the entire conversation. The person next to me asked me what was wrong with him, she had heard some but none of the really bad parts, and I kept it to myself. So here’s it is:


He said he’s depressed, officially diagnosed

He said he was on meds of some sort, and changed meds yesterday morning.

He said he doesn’t really like social events. He’s just tired of them. He said he has not interest in friends or talking to people. He also insulted the other people there, but I didn’t quite catch what he said, I just heard him say “I’m not bashing you, just everyone else here”

He said he was told he had psychopathic tendencies. He said he doesn’t get emotional during high stress situations (which really surprised me b/c of the incident when his girlfriend was diagnosed and he was crying) but the person he was talking with seemed to agree with him that he’s cold and calculated during that stuff and she seemed close to him. 

The thing that really worried me was when he said “out of everyone I know... I feel like I’m the most likely to be a school shooter.” He also said the only reason he wants to go into the military is to go into combat.

The girl was really good at handling all this, she kept talking and didn’t make that big of a deal about anything he said and despite some comments she definitely could have taken offense to and left she stayed with him. She made it seem really casual. Eventually the conversation stopped. He made a comment that I didn’t hear and then the two of them went for a walk, I’m assuming it was so she could try to comfort him. They didn’t return until about an hour later. 

I don’t know what to do. This is someone I would never expect to do these things. He’s sweet and charismatic, and I don’t know anyone who doesn’t like him. Even last night when the girl asked him if he wanted to talk about it he said “I have like 30 people I can talk to, I don’t need more.” On one hand I feel like it’s none of my business. It wasn’t my conversation and he didn’t tell me. On the other... what if he try’s to go through with it?

Would me reporting it do anything? He’s gotta already be being watched if he’s on meds for this stuff right? I don’t want to do something I’ll regret. Reporting him could help, or it could just make things worse if he’s already getting the help he needs. Who would I even report him to? The school? The police? FBI tip line? What if it just makes him feel even more isolated? Or am I just overreacting? Should I just forget about it? 

I’m sorry if this is a mess... I’ll add anything else I can think of. Please ask questions if you need more information, I’ll answer to the best of my knowledge.

925,"Before I continue, I do not have real insomnia as it is, I just struggle with sleeping due to my heart beating a lot and quite frankly anxiety. Yesterday I pulled an all nighter because of this, has anyone experienced something similar, and if so, how did you beat it?",02Sep2019,2
927,"Now, I know that SOUNDS really selfish, (and it kind of is), but there are so few examples in which people that are not family members ask SPECIFICALLY me to hangout or talk or compliment me (and I wouldn’t care if I didn’t compliment other people a lot) or ANYTHING that it gets to me! Am I just a weirdo for thinking about other people so much that the second thing I do every day (if it’s off of school) is try to do stuff with other people, or is everyone ELSE just anti social? Am I unlikable? I’m just confused and feel so unloved, and I feel like nobody remembers I exist unless I make it BLATANTLY obvious.

To be fair, it’s a normal occurrence for people to ask me to play games online with them, but that’s only when they get something along the lines of a steam notification saying I’m online, or they’re already playing with others and need a fourth.

Seriously, it’s to the point where it practically makes my day if someone approaches me on their own, and it’s even worse if it’s a girl that does it.

Either tell me what’s wrong with me, or tell me how to fix it. Thanks.",02Sep2019,0
