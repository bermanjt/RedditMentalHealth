0,"All my life, every relationship (counting platonic ones and family) have had a lot of arguments and drama.


Now I'm out of this environment for the most part and I'm in a loving relationship. I just can't seem to be as emotionally invested as I was with the ones with drama. 

Though whenever I think that maybe that's because he just isn't the one, (and that causes drama)  I get really emotionally attached. 
(I've done that once, I'm not a terrible human being)

Now, this guy is really really great, and I do not want to lose him, and I just wish I could feel as emotionally attached as I did with other people. 

And I don't think you can say it still needs time because we've been together for 2 years now. A past relationship was abusive, but I was way more attached after a few months.

Does anyone have any advice?",03Nov2019,1

3,"*Hated my nose with an absolute passion all my life, it‚Äôs easy to look at someone and think ‚ÄúYou have nothing to worry about‚Äù but being in one‚Äôs shoes is different. 
This insecurity of mine hindered a lot of opportunities, I subconsciously felt inferior to others because of my nose. It sounds ridiculous, but unfortunately that‚Äôs the way it is with me. I am not seeking comments telling me to postpone my surgery*


Please note that I‚Äôm a student, so I can‚Äôt ask for more shifts. 

My original plan was to take 2 weeks off and then return. However, the more that I think about it, the less eager I am to return to work with a new nose. I do not want to attract that sort of attention. I don‚Äôt mind admitting I got surgery, but if I can avoid all the looks and gossip (unfortunately a large portion of my dept is very nosy. *no pun intended*), I totally would. I have been planning on quitting. And this is quite literally the right time. 

I am 19 years old, I will be paying this off myself. I do not have an issue with this. I currently live with my parents, so I don‚Äôt have very many bills to be paying off anyways. 

If I choose to quit, I don‚Äôt know how long itll take me to find a new job with a secured X+ amount of hours. Because of this, I would have to make up about $2000 worth of pay I would have made in the last bits of December and all of January in order to stay on track with paying my surgery off. 

I do not want to ask my parents for money. I just need advice. What should I do? How can I make easy money? I dread going back to my current job, but I guess if I can‚Äôt make $1500+ by December 10th, that‚Äôs the only option I‚Äôll have left.

19,"Title says it all, but heres some background.

I'm a ""final"" year chemistry student and I just finished a half semester lab for advanced organic chemistry. The dean of the chemistry dept is the professor, and she SUCKS.  Everyone was failing the class, and nobody had more than a 69% last time I checked. She won't respond to any of my emails with questions regarding when grades will be final and how she plans on not letting the entire class fail. They just entered my final journal article grade and I somehow ended up with 1 of the lowest scores (not a very wide spread point distribution, where I only missed 12 pts) but I know for a fact I worked longer and harder on it than anyone else I'd talked to. A previous score is still yet to be entered and I've emailed her, and my TA, multiple times about it. No response. 

I aced ochem 1 and 2 so I know my shit. The class was structured very messy and disorganized, to the point nobody, including my research team, had no idea what was really going on. She had very vague requirements for assignments, the entire grade was based on writing when we spent 8+ hours in the lab a week. Its very discouraging to receive a very low grade on every assignment after working my ass off in the lab and in class. I cared more about what we were doing than the rest of my research team and they still are a few grade points above me. Nobody in that class is happy about the way it went, what their grades are, or even the material since we are not gradute students who have mastered organometallic chemistry. 

Background of my outside of school life: I took a very light semester this year because I am dealing with a lot. I lost the love of my life a few months ago, I wanted to end everything then and there, just drop out and die too, but still pushed on in school because I need to finish my degree. My mental state is trash and the fact I even went back to school this year says something about my motivation for chemistry.  I'm left feeling like I'm not good enough or smart enough for this track because of this professor. And again, shes failing about 3/4 of the students. All chemistry students, all with a very deep understanding of organic chemistry, and they all hate her.

I need advice on how to deal with this professor. Do I email the chemistry department? Talk to my advisor? I already rated her on ratemyprofessor. Emailing her is out of the question because she wont respond anyway. Nobody in this department seems to be of any help. Im upset and don't know what to do anymore. It all makes me want to drop out. 

TLDR my professor sucks and is failing 3/4 of her students as the dean of the chemistry department, in a half semester advanced lab.. not a graduate course.  Give me advice on how to handle this bullshit.",03Nov2019,1

27,"I just started working at a government institution two weeks ago. I am very grateful for this job as I am a recent college graduate, but I am already having issues with my coworkers. A few days ago I posted that my coworkers had on more than one occasion been unnecessarily cross with the public/customers. Although I realize they've been there for 7+ years and even 15+ years, hence burnout, I still thought they'd sometimes be decent, but if a person is not enthusiastically smiling at them, they often make a big deal and openly complain. 

As for me, I am the youngest in the department. I am in my early twenties and all my coworkers are 40 and 50+ years old. I have been a little irritated with them because I'm still training and don't have clearance for all the systems and one day they left me in the office by myself for 25 minutes while they socialized with other departments. I would have been fine if I had access to the system, but I did not, and when they came back one of my coworkers logged in to check emails before they left *again* to socialize. So of course I used the system to help the waiting people, and now I'm restricted from ""touching anything"", although I made no mistakes. They also made various comments about my mood, which to me was completely justified given the situation.

Sad thing is my post isn't even about that. Last week we experienced a slow day and it was absolutely silent. I am not the best with small talk and I don't freely volunteer information about myself because I like to keep work and personal separate. However they've been there for years and share pictures and information very, very openly. Just to pass the time I asked them some questions about information they shared earlier. But it seems like the majority of things I do is misunderstood. So when I asked this particular question I could immediately tell it was taken out of context, so I tried to walk it back. Before I could walk it back one of them asked me a question that was more personal than what I asked. I deflected and then one of my coworkers said I was ""suspect"" and that I always have smart comments to say when asked something. They said I ask questions but never answer them. I could see where they were coming from, but it wasn't something I thought should be blown out of proportion. This one person then told me I had issues from the start. I said that I was just trying to make small talk and that I didn't mean to violate anyone's personal boundaries. They told me to only ask questions about work and I said I would. What's crazy to me is I went back to my desk and opened my phone to check text messages and while I was doing so that same person accused me of trying to film them??? It made absolutely no sense to me.  So I calmly said I care a lot about consent and that I wouldn't do anything without the other persons permission and they stood by their claim that I was filming them. I go to work tomorrow and I'm absolutely dreading it because on my first day, one of them said that they should ""warn me because they are petty"". That's literally what they said, which leads me to believe they are about to make it unreasonably difficult for me.",03Nov2019,0

Study sessions are when I have free time. I honestly want to use it to work on my programs or do my own school work. I seem to getting backlogged a bit and the time I spend helping I could use on assignments, programming, research etc.

33,"Hey there. So I'm a 19 year old female in college. I go to a pretty big state university and I'm a sophomore. I don't have one friend here on campus. My roommate doesn't talk to me and is hardly ever in the dorm. I don't leave my room aside from class or to go eat. I don't have a car so I can't leave campus, I'm pretty much stuck here. The person I talked to the most today inrl was the cashier at Starbucks. It's literally pathetic. 

I call my online boyfriend for HOURS everyday. Usually 4+ hours a day. I love him to death and I love spending time with him. I'm supposed to visit him in March for the first time and I'm so excited for it. My future with him is what's keeping me happy right now. Every once in awhile I'll call my parents or my two best friends from back home. (My college is 7 hours away from home). But aside from that, I get no social interaction. I've started feeling more and more sad lately. I'll cry multiple times a week for absoloutely no reason, I'm exhausted 24/7, I've lost my appetite, I have no passions, etc. I used to love horse riding and now I have no interest in it. It's too much work. And this past month when I've been calling my boyfriend, I've been faking and pretending I'm happy when I really just want to cry. 

Another big aspect is that I have a VERY suicidal online friend. I haven't been able to leave her for the past four years because I'm terrified she'll commit suicide if I leave. She's told me I'm the only reason she hasn't put a bullet in her head. It makes me anxious and tired and sad every day. She keeps telling me she doesn't know if she'll make it to 2020. It's so fucking stressful feeling like it's my responsibility to keep her alive. 

I'm at the point where I really don't know what to do. I'm not suicidal at all myself, but I'm just really sad. I just want to curl up in a ball and hug my boyfriend forever and cry. What the hell do I do? Thanks so much.",03Nov2019,1
34,"I've been friends with someone for a bit over a year and I've had fun exchanging memes with her and generally just being a friend. We met because I am friends with her girlfriend, but I became closer friends with her.  


She's not in the happiest spot in her life and she's told me some things dragging her down. I've been there to listen and sometimes I'd even tell her what's been dragging me down.  


About a week ago, I saw that she was going to start twitch streaming a game I haven't heard of (I haven't played the game and I don't watch twitch). I told her I would come and watch the stream and I told her I'd even make an account to support her. I watched for a bit, then switched over to to play outer worlds. She messaged me a bit later asking me to come back because she needs viewers.  


I came back to watch her play the game but she would keep having to respond to texts on her phone and she looked and sounded sad. Eventually she kind of abruptly ended the stream but she ended it on a positive note.  


I sent her a message later asking if she was ok and she said she was and asked why she wouldn't be ok. A few hours later I messaged her back (I guess I should have left her alone, but I just wanted to help).  


Her response? She said ""Fuck off"" to me.  


My first thought was that she messaged someone else by accident so I waited a while to see if she would said something like ""omg, I'm so sorry, that was for x"", or even ""sorry, I was just joking"". Nope, she meant it.  


I told her ""Look if i'm annoying you, you can just flat out tell me. That's a bit rude of you to reply back just like that."" and ""I'll note your message anyway"".  


She apologized a few minutes later and said that was mean of her and she didn't mean to lash out at me like that.  


However after thinking a few days, I decided that I didn't want to be friends with her and I removed her as a friend (I didn't block her) on Facebook. Within the last few days, I think that I feel that I hate her now. I was only trying to be there for her. She has more friends than me and I couldn't see her talking to her girlfriend or other friends like that.   


One of my biggest fears is that people secretly find me annoying so that really hurt. I wasn't trying to get anything out of being her friend and she ended up talking to me like that. I don't have a lot of friends so when I start feeling that down, I don't really have people to talk to.

I only graduated two years ago so it‚Äôs not that crazy but we‚Äôve been talking for a little over two months (ik this cause Snapchat streaks at 60) and a few weeks ago I invited her to hangout with me and she agreed and we planned to hangout one night. Well day of comes around and I get the ‚ÄúYoure gonna hate me..‚Äù text with a reasonable excuse that she wanted to prepare for a dance performance she had the next day. I thought nothing of it and brushed it off. But earlier this week I asked if she wanted to hangout again and we planned to go for a picnic and smoke on sunday at a park and I texted her tonight to see what time she wants to link up and she left me on read .

Am I not taking some kind of hint here ? She sends snapchats sometimes dancing in bras or she shows off a little bit of cheek in short skirts when she snapchats me . Also she was a Girl Scout for Halloween and I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the mood for a specific Girl Scout cookie‚Äù and then I apologized and tried to pass it off as a joke to save myself embarrassment and she said ‚Äúno I like‚Äù with a heart emoji and a smiley face... so I‚Äôm really just confused where I stand with her and don‚Äôt wanna straight up ask her and possibly make the situation worse.",03Nov2019,1

Sometimes she plays with my hair (which also is very short and thin and I'm also playfully insulted for that too but I take everything by the chin so it's fine) and pokes me and stuff. 

Idk she's alright? I mean, if she really does like me I don't mind having a relationship with her but idk how it works cos she'd be my first gf. Even then, I'd have to make sure none of my mates know or my parents know cos we're not people who would be expected to get together and ofc parents don't usually know about high school relationships unless you're open about it, which I ain't. Also her friends would never expect it and well a lot of them are bitches but a few of them are cool and I'm friends with them too.

So, do all these things she does mean I'm just small and ""cute?"". Or does she actually see something in me? I mean, the only traits I have are my humour, my sarcasm and uhh partially my intellect if that ever works? Idk I'm confused. 

So what's it mean? It'd be great to get help especially from the lasses out there cos they'd know what this leads to, I'd like to think.",03Nov2019,0

We understood what each other was going through, and Natasha supported me in a way that my more established friends didn't. We bonded pretty quickly and soon we started hanging out multiple times a week and texting each other multiple times per day. I know that Natasha has dealt with some mental health issues, like anxiety and depression. There were times in college when she'd be a bit more distant for a few weeks at a time, but I'd still see her and talk to her, just not as much. 
Since then, we've both graduated from college and live in different cities, a plane flight away from one another. In the approx. year that we've lived apart, we've visited each other twice but still were talking via text/facetime pretty much every day. Even though we didn't see each other much, if one of us was having a rough day and needed to cry it out or vent, we'd call each other.
I visited Natasha for an extended Labor Day weekend and stayed in her apartment with her. Things generally went well, but I think the visit was a bit too long, and I noticed as it went on that Natasha wasn't eating as much as normal and she seemed kind of tense. The conversation just didn't flow like it usually does. Over all though, I thought that it was a good visit. 
Since then, I've barely heard from her. We texted a bit for a few days after the visit ended, and then I stopped hearing from her. After two weeks went by I got more worried and I called her. She didn't pick up, I left a voicemail, she responded with a text saying she's sorry but she's been feeling overwhelmed lately and just can't respond to me. I said it's okay and told her I'm here for her. 
It's been two months. Since then, I've tried contacting her a few times over text and she hasn't responded. It was her birthday yesterday and I sent her a birthday gift, posted on her Facebook wall, called and left a voicemail, but didn't get any response. Last night I was worried and texted our mutual friend asking if he knows what's up/if she's okay. He told me that they've still been talking like normal and she seems okay, just maybe a bit stressed from work, and she hasn't said that anything is wrong between us. 
Now I'm even more confused, and hurt. I don't know if she's going through a rough time with her mental health, or if I did something that upset her. At this point, I'd do anything to repair the relationship if that's what's necessary. We're adults, and we're good enough friends that if something was wrong, we should be able to talk it through. I feel hurt and confused that she's essentially ghosting me. I miss talking to my best friend, and sharing our lives with each other. I have other friends, but not like her. I don't know what to think or do. Has anyone been through a similar situation?

Tldr; my best friend of 2+ years (who has a history of depression) has barely spoken to me in the past 2 months, but she's still talking to our mutual friend. I've reached out in numerous ways, numerous times. I don't know why she's doing this or or what to do.",03Nov2019,1

He would pay her $4,000 a month if she met up with him in a public place once a month and sent him nudes. She wants to do it and my sister confided in me that she was doing this but I was asked not to tell my parents, the police, etc...

44,"My twinbrother is addicted to alcohol and cocaine for about 5 years now. The first two years of his addiction he used to come home late and intoxicated. He would cause a scene for the entire night, and threaten my parents and I with knifes.

He now owes some drugdealers who he calls his friends money. A couple weeks ago I found about 80 grams of cocaine in his room, ready to be sold. Yet he begs me for money, steals my money, and never pays me back.

We talk sometimes, usually when he's drunk. He goes on about how fucked up his life is and how I have no idea. I can't get to him, he doesn't want to quit.

The fuck do I do? I've seen my mother in tears almost every day for 2 years, I don't want this again, I don't wanna keep his secret.

50,"Basically, I don‚Äôt know what the right thing to do is; the money would help me out a lot, but it doesn‚Äôt feel right, so I haven‚Äôt cashed the check.

Essentially, I‚Äôm in my early 20s and I recently moved states to live closer to family. My grandparents offered to let me stay with them until I find an apartment, but that has not been going too well - there just isn‚Äôt much in my price range, so I‚Äôm also looking for a better paying job. 

I have been slowly paying the debt off for a couple years while also saving, but it‚Äôs been difficult. I have $10,000 in debt, $4,000 of which is credit debt. And since I used most of my savings to move (money I was going to use towards paying off my debt) I decided to save all my money while living with them, and pay off the debt before I move out, so that I could afford to spend more on an apartment.

However, some things set me back, so I decided to tell my grandpa about my credit debt/situation and asked if I could stay with them a little longer. He said of course, and that I could stay as long as I needed. I told him that I have $3,000 saved up, and that I would be able to pay it off in the next month or two. But a couple weeks later he offered to pay the debt because he doesn‚Äôt want me to spend all of my savings on paying it off.

Of course I refused to accept it, but he was adamant, wrote a check, and told me I‚Äôd be stupid not to cash it. 

What should I do?",03Nov2019,1
51,"Before I start this post. I am a very naive teen at times, and I‚Äôve never really experienced situations like this.  I also know that this borders r/amIugly so if I need to move it there I will. Anyway, here‚Äôs the context. So I was lounging around when someone added me on Snapchat, I‚Äôm really bad with names so I added them back assuming they were a person in my English class. 

They began to hit on me telling me that they loved me and stuff, and of course I didn‚Äôt buy it, I‚Äôm an aloof quiet person and don‚Äôt really have any features that teenage boys look for. I began to question them to ask if they knew me, and once I was satisfied and could tell they were from my school, they called me to tell me I was a fat bitch and blocked me. 

I‚Äôve never met this person before, but the odds of them being from my school seemed likely (mutual friends, knew teachers etc.) I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm the most attractive girl at my school, and definitely more hot then cute, and thought I‚Äôm a bit chubby I‚Äôve never been called fat. Sorry I‚Äôm still a bit confused by the situation.

My point is- is this a sign that I need to change things about myself? Or is this just some guys messing with me. I usually wouldn‚Äôt ask about this stuff here, but I know my parents and or friends would freak out and I don‚Äôt want that.",03Nov2019,1
52,"I want to make an app for my physics class that solves for unknown variables and is capable of displaying small simulations to show what the equations mean in the real world. I need a gui for it. 

I can't figure out how to best do it because I want the app to be easy to develop (I only have a half hour to an hour a day to program) but at the same time be capable. I also want to be able to compile to an exe so my class mates can use it without needing to install extra stuff. 

I've thought about using c++, but that will take too much time and GUIs in c++ seem to be difficult to make. I then thought about Java but that requires downloading another thing. I also thought about electron but using html as a GUI feels clunky. 

I just don't know what to use, and I don't have the most knowledge to make a good decision.

53,"Im so heartbroken. I trusted him and valued our friendship more than anything. Ive been nothing but loyal and honest to him, always try and have his back and make him feel good. After a certain incident Ive realized hes been lying to me and manipulating me. I try to call him out on something shady but since I have no proof he makes me feel like im crazy or that its my fault. This one time I did have proof, turns out hes more of a liar than I thought... What makes it worse is all those other times I thought he was lying or acting shady was probably because he was. I trusted him so much and thought he would never do something like that to me considering how good I try and treat him and our long history as friends. I love him like my brother. Now to learn hes nothing but a narcissist and hes been taking advantage of my good nature, hurts more than I can bare. Im so torn on what to do. Hes my last, one close friend and I feel completely betrayed by him. If I stop talking to him Ill have no one. Ive made a new friend but its not the same.

55,"TL;DR: I've always had a lot of friends, but now they've almost all moved away, and everyone I try to hang out with just cancels on plans constantly.

I'm a gay, married woman turning 30 next week. I'm very extroverted (an ENFJ if you're interested), and without wanting to sound arrogant I've always found it easy to make friends.  I moved to the US to be with my now-wife 5 years ago, leaving behind an incredibly vibrant, close knit community which I worked hard to build, and many dear friends. I put a lot of effort into maintaining those friendships over the phone, internet etc, and whenever I visit my old home I have a wonderful time seeing everyone, I also host visitors from back home fairly regularly. All that is to say: having a core group of friends, an active social life and participating in the queer community is extremely important to me, and I'm confident in my social skills.

When I moved to my new country, I put a lot of time and energy into making new connections. I got rather lucky and clicked hard with someone who became a close friend, who introduced my wife and I to their friend group and we became a part of it almost immediately. In total there was 10 of us including my wife and I. I liked them all very much although I will say the connection wasn't as tight as it was with my friends back home, but those were mostly college friends who I lived with, so I know that creates a closer bond. Well, over the last year, 6 of these friends have moved out of state for various reasons- school, work, family commitments etc (there were two couples in the group). 

I am really, really struggling to make new friends. I work really long hours, as does my wife. She's very introverted and our friends were mutual so she doesn't have any friends independently of me that she could 'share' and doesn't feel like she has the time or inclination to make them, which is fair, she has very different social needs to me. I get on really well with my coworkers, but they're mostly at really different points in life to me and don't seem interested in socializing outside of the office. I've invited them to a few things but they usually cancel or ghost. I still have my remaining friends from the original friend group, both of whom are lovely but EXTREMELY flakey. I have a couple of other casual friends I would like to see more of, they're constantly saying they miss me and want to hang out but any time I try to plan something they're either busy or cancel last minute. To compound that there's been a handful of times when I've had to be the one to say no to proposed plans because I'm busy or out of town myself, but trying to rearrange leads nowhere. I've tried arranging chilled out group events and inviting friends of friends but again people just cancel.

It just feels impossible. I feel like I'm putting myself out there, meeting people, going to events, chatting online etc, but no one has the time or inclination to leave the house and socialize. I talk to the casual friends I have and they feel exactly the same way, come up with grandiose plans for us to all make more friends and then they vanish again. It doesn't help that I tend to click much more with introverts I suppose. My birthday is coming up and for the first time I have no one to spend it with (other than my wife of course) and I'm just feeling really really lonely and like I'll never have a group of friends again in my life. 

Does anyone have any pro tips for encouraging people to socialize in a pressure free environment? I feel really ready to leave my 20s, enthusiastic about my marriage, career and home, but this is really getting me down.",03Nov2019,3
56,"Hello, this will be my first post on Reddit (yay)! 

I work for a funeral home, and I'm coming pretty close to another year's mark at my workplace. 

My job situation is odd here; I was hired as a Staff Member who would take care of removals, clean, etc for the funeral home before a service would begin (and sometimes during a service depends how busy). I was a younger adult who was starting out college to grab my AS in Mortuary Sciences, and was obviously thrilled to be offered a position with a funeral home as it felt like I was getting an early head-start in my career to become a Funeral Director/Embalmer.

Well, fast forward almost 3.5 years later with my degree nearly finished (an ""AS degree"" is never truly a two-year degree), and my pay has remained stagnant of a whopping $10 (my state's minimum wage being $8.50) an hour to work 85-90 hour pay periods. That might not seem too crazy for someone's first full-time position -- that may be average. However, my family, friends, and my partner tell me all the time that I am not only being underpaid... but taken advantage of. 

My loved ones back behind that statement, because, instead of my supervisors hiring me in as an Apprentice at the start with a better pay (such as they did just recently with a new gentleman), they have kept me at the minimum wage position, while also requiring me to fulfill tasks that only a licensed Funeral Director/Embalmer would be able to do, with their reason being ""to help me practice for my future Internship"". The other staff are being paid $10 an hour to make removals and clean, while I'm being paid $10 an hour to not only make removals and clean; but to work on-call shifts (24 hour) during the weekends, embalm bodies, dress and casket heavy bodies by myself, direct late night services by myself when a Funeral Director should be present with me, etc. 

I've ask for a raise in my pay, but nothing has come from it. Brushed under the rug. It concerns me since I have to pay $700 rent, $260 in car and renter's, $110 a month on a school loan, and roughly $150 in bills -- equating $1,200 out of my monthly $1,400 salary which makes groceries and investing in my savings difficult. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love what I do, I really do -- however, I'm not sure if I'm just being used as a cheap, non-licensed embalmer for this firm? What are your thoughts? I really appreciate the comments, and I apologize if my post feels rushed and odd in formatting. I don't want to take up too much of anyone's time.",03Nov2019,12

hey, everyone!

i've an addiction. it's betting. i've been betting for nearly four years now. and i'm 22.

i really don't know why i'm betting. yes, money has a great charm, but that's not the issue. i gamble even if i have huge amount of money (for a student, of course). yes, i'm studying. i also work home office and make great money. but i lost all of my payment in 'two hours'. everytime i lose a bet, i become more sucidial. i don't think that i'll do that, but it makes me feel like a dead person. i cry, i yell, i sweat a lot. it's like a panic attack. but i cannot stop. i lose all of my money. every month. i just cannot stop.

as i said before, it's not about money. even if i win huge amount of money, i cannot satisfy myself. i keep going no matter what. and eventually, i lose. that's pretty much every single day for four years. i'm sick and tired of this. but i cannot escape.

i'm living with my family. their finance is not great, so they often ask help from me. i have no problem about giving them money. but since i started gambling, i cannot do that. because i do not have money. i cannot go outside. i cannot pay neccessary things about my school, daily life etc. i just keep betting. i do not know how i can get rid of this.

half an hour ago i lost all of my salary again. and i got my salary two days ago. now, for all the month, i'll be all broke. but i know that next month will be exactly same. i'm scared. i feel terrible. i started to develop anxiety for four years. and it's getting crazier each day.

sometimes, i look around of myself. some of my friends live at their own place, have great lives and spend their money on things they actually care. i really don't care if i spend my money in single day, but i do not spend my money, i 'lose' it to betting. it's not 50-50 situation, it's just only way. for instance; if i start with 100$ and win 10.000$ eventually in a single day, i know that i won't stop. i will not feel satisfied if i win, but i will feel depressed if i lose.

i'm not happy about my life. i have a great deal of problems. daily life, family problems, existensial problems. a lot of. but this addiction makes their effect even stronger. i lost all of my strength. both physically and mentally. i do not know how can i deal with this. it'll be all same. all, same. everytime.

my family doesn't even know that i'm addicted to betting. if they learn somehow, i think they wouldn't let me live here anymore. because i lost a great deal of money during last four years. i could even buy myself a cheap and small apartment. or a car. or, i don't know. i'm trying to focus on my home office job. i make a great deal of money for a student. but this addiction distracts me. i cannot focus. i have adhd, and this makes it worse. i start to cry or yell or deal with a panic attack every single hour. i cannot forget that i lost.

i really don't have any plan about how can i get rid of this loop. it's destroying my life. it actually already did. i'm just trying to survive. yes, i don't live. i try to survive. and that's terrible.

i just wanted to talk. i never do that about my addiction. so, i hope that it'll be a fresh start. thanks for reading.",03Nov2019,1
59,"Ok so today, I (20) was talking and my roomates (Spanish speaking) tell me someone came over or the neighbor had said something to someone about they‚Äôre car being hit. So today I walk over and talk to the guy, he says it‚Äôs on video and they‚Äôve got it recorded and that it was me driving the car and when his wife got home from work they would call or come talk. So fast forward a couple hours, him and his wife come and they show me the car, it is literally the smallest scrape, you could buff it out super easy, or just get it detailed and it would come right off. So they say they don‚Äôt want to let us inside they‚Äôre house to see the video, that if they are going to do that then they will file an insurance claim which they say can be far more expensive then just saying ‚Äú yeah I hit Your car, here‚Äôs 150$, go get it fixed‚Äù. Pretty much.. so now here I am in a situation where if I really did hit that car and they have it on video, I swear of it I didn‚Äôt hear or see nothing or even notice hitting a car, and something so small they are making a huge deal, saying they‚Äôd rather not file insurance claims and all that and that if they were gonna let us into the house to see the video that they were gonna do everything ‚Äú Top Dollar‚Äù ... I agreed to paying for it to get detailed or buffed out but now that I think about it I am almost sure they are trying to fool me.

60,"I live next door to an older couple who I believe are from India.  I hear the woman ringing a bell often, which after a Google search suggests that they're Hindi (excuse my ignorance, I'm not actually sure but maybe some cultural context would help in this situation.)

They have guests over today.  They often leave the front door open when people arrive.  I can see their front door from my backyard.  They drew my attention because I could hear something and wasn't sure whether it was a woman crying or laughing.  I approached my back door and saw a woman standing in the doorway, facing away from me, and then I saw her flinch as though she had been hit or slapped.  I didn't see the person she was arguing with.  The woman then moved further into the house.  

I can now hear that the woman is arguing with the man, and is clearly in tears.  They are speaking another language and both are clearly agitated, although they aren't yelling or out of control.  

What should I do about this?  I don't think calling the police would achieve much - firstly, because they will almost certainly know it was me and it will probably just make them more secretive, and secondly, I'm not even sure whether it is the woman who lives in the home or their guest who was assaulted (I believe their guests were another Indian couple).   Come to think of it, I've never actually seen the woman who lives there - only the husband, who is elderly.  Also, there is a cultural divide between us - I don't think this elderly Indian woman would appreciate my approaching her and inquiring about her marriage.

Does anybody else have any other ideas?  Is there perhaps an organisation I could contact that is culturally conscious and works with Indian women?  (I live in Australia)

71,"We bought a condo in a very small complex.  It‚Äôs a self managed condo association and there are only 8 units in the place.  We live on the 2nd floor in a semi-separate building.  Our floor and his floor have no side neighbors.  We even have our own elevator area so no one can get off on our floors (we can‚Äôt go to his, and vice versa, either). 

We moved in just a week after our upstairs neighbor.  He‚Äôs a younger guy that lives alone and we noticed he played music a bit loud.  We ignored it the first night, even thought it was a week night.  The 2nd night I was coming home at 9 and heard it again, so I went upstairs (he left the elevator unlocked) and asked him to turn it down.  He was so nice and apologetic and turned it down.  

Then at 11pm, he had an entire party that shook our walls.  So my wife and I both went up (elevator still unlocked) and again, apologetic and turned it down.   He swore up and down that it wasn‚Äôt normal, but it was homecoming week for his college and he had friends in town.  Whatever.  

Night 3, a Friday night but I had to go to work today at 7am.  He has an EVEN LOUDER party, but this time he locked his elevator.  I had no way to ask him to turn it down, so I sent the police to do it.  This time, he sends an apologetic email saying it‚Äôs not normal.  

To top this off, at the beginning of the week, he sent the entire complex a note saying that he planned on hosting a party on Saturday afternoon and it might get loud.  So, he warned everyone about the one party that he was having on Saturday mid-day, but not about the nightly party he throws.  

It‚Äôs Saturday night, 9:45, and a party JUST started up there.  

What do I do?  He‚Äôs so nice when we talk to him, but this is ridiculous.  I asked our association president what to do and she said ‚Äúwell, I wouldn‚Äôt call the cops.‚Äù  I did anyway last night because it showed no signs of stopping at 12am.  

It sucks because we moved from a rental situation where the upstairs neighbors had 2 toddlers that stomped around from 6am to 9pm.  Now we have a night club above us.",03Nov2019,1
72,"I want to make an app for my physics class that solves for unknown variables and is capable of displaying small simulations to show what the equations mean in the real world. I need a gui for it. 

I can't figure out how to best do it because I want the app to be easy to develop (I only have a half hour to an hour a day to program) but at the same time be capable. I also want to be able to compile to an exe so my class mates can use it without needing to install extra stuff. 

I've thought about using c++, but that will take too much time and GUIs in c++ seem to be difficult to make. I then thought about Java but that requires downloading another thing. I also thought about electron but using html as a GUI feels clunky. 

I just don't know what to use, and I don't have the most knowledge to make a good decision. I'm sorry of this question is wrong for this sub or if I sound stupid, I'm not knowledgeable about programming languages and their uses beyond basic Java knowledge (I know how to program, just not about different languages and finding a language for my use case).

73,"Sorry for some fragmented information. I was just trying to get this all written down. 

It all began the first week of tenth grade. We had identical schedules, took a while for me to notice. I just thought there was a lot of pretty girls. My one teacher constantly paired us up, probably noticed that I liked her. By the end of the first semester we probably spent around 500 hours near each other. 2nd semester comes around and we never really see each other because  schedules change every semester, I lost contact. During the summer I found her instagram and sent occasional messages. Only to end up what I believed was a disaster.

Now 11th grade begins, we have completely different schedules. And rarely cross paths. At this point I stopped texting her because education is more important. Second semester comes around and I start talking over Instagram again, she starts following me, I tell her my feelings, likes my pictures, and watches every story every day (almost a year it lasted doesn‚Äôt matter). Summer has begun and we were texting each other every week or every couple days or so. I asked her to hang out, she didn‚Äôt say no, but didn‚Äôt say yes either, she works over 40 hours a week, and goes on vacations. So we didn‚Äôt see each other.
 
Senior year begins. And she swapped schools, there‚Äôs two school in the one building. So I only have a chance of seeing her in the morning. And next semester we might have a class together (now I think she‚Äôs graduating early). We talk more frequently in real life, it‚Äôs hard because we don‚Äôt see each other. She kinda lost interest in my insta after I got her on Snapchat. going into the military soon and really don‚Äôt want to loose whatever I have with her right now.

I know y‚Äôall are going to be against the social media communication buts it‚Äôs the best I have. 

TL;DR: I met an amazing girl I would do anything for and I don‚Äôt think my relationship with her is that great.",03Nov2019,1

78,"I (27f) grew up in a small, wealthy, tight knit community. I have since moved across the country and live a good 2k miles away from my hometown. When I was in 7th and 8th grade I had a social studies teacher who was also my soccer and softball coach as well as my camp counselor....I received a lot of unwanted attention from this 40 + year old male teacher. He paid special attention to me, giving me neck massages constantly, standing very close behind me so that our bodies were touching, and occasionally hugging me. He would also do things like pay attention to who I was flirting with (I was a thirteen year old girl). And one day in particular I remember him asking me to sit with him on the school bus, where he proceeded to tell me that the boy I had a crush on was a ""wet blanket"" and that I should only be interested in older, more mature men.

It never went further than that...His attention was creepy, but I went off to high school and forgot about it entirely. Fast forward to yesterday. I wake up to countless text from people from my hometown, all sending me the same link. The same middle school teacher's face was plastered on the top of an article from a popular local website. It announced that my former school district was being sued for 10 million dollars, because this teacher had attempted to sexually assault a 13 year old girl. The disturbing details included him exposing himself to her in locked classroom. The student apparently got away, but described the same things I had encountered. The neck massages, the special attention, the standing too close. Obviously, I would believe this young woman in general, but her description of his behavior is so spot on that now I cannot sleep thinking that this terrible man is getting away with it.

Yes that's right, he is still teaching in the school. And ""investigation"" took place and because of a lack of evidence, the school wiped their hands clean of it. He is a very powerful man with a lot of friends in high places in that tight knit community. A lot of people do not believe this young girl and instead think its a ""money grab"". The fact of the matter is the parents and lawyers of this young girl have attempted to get him out of the classroom quietly for over a year. Suing the district is the only way to bring attention to it. People are saying she's a ""drama queen"", unstable, a stupid kid...etc. It's absolutely infuriating to me. I don't know what to do, besides speak with my therapist later this week.",03Nov2019,1
79,"Hello everyone, this is my first post here but still remains one important one. I am a 16 year old avarage person and I have aspirations to becoming an artist. Specifically manga, or video game concept art. Hell any kind of drawing as long as it came from me would be great. I started practicing near the end of summer but my progress has begun to dawdle. Part of the issue is my constant regression to playing Final Fantasy XIV, a never ending grindy mmo. And by god, do I love this game. But it's gotten to the point where I sacrifice my afternoons after school or after the gym to playing this game rather than studying techniques or practicing drawing itself. For example, today I played around nine hours since it is the weekend, time I couldve solely put to drawing. My point is, what exactly can I do to stop being drawn back to my favorite game. What can I do to force myself into practicing even if I dont want to? This is something very important that I want to achieve.

80,"I like people solely for their personality, regardless of appearance, gender or age. The perfect way to explain this would be if you think of it in this scenario. To me, the world is like an online game where everybody is just a character with different physical appearances so it's like it doesn't represent who they actually are. To me, it's just a body which holds a soul. I would have to talk to them and get to know their personality to fall in love. So in a way, I could fall in love with someone over the internet solely for their personality despite not knowing their appearance, age or gender. I also do not experience any sexual attraction.
I thought everybody felt the same way, until I spoke to my friends and they were very shocked. I feel quite lost. Do any of you know any people who feel the same way as I do or know of any sexuality that could describe mine?",03Nov2019,1
81,"I've been struggling over the past two years with friendships with guys and it makes me sad.

At highschool and for the first year and a bit of university, I had mostly guy friends and one close girl friend who moved overseas. Because of this I always feel more relaxed around guys and get on with them much better - every party I've been to I always seem to get on with the guys and we sort of gravitate together? I had a study day for my course the other day and although my good friend in the course is a girl, I went off with the guys to get food and really enjoyed being around them and had a good talk with them despite not knowing them too well. 


I find guys are easier to joke around with and don't take most things as serious as girls.


A lot of guys I've dated have told me that I'm different from other girls they've been with and they like that I'm more laid back and enjoy a laugh. Not trying to sound special or up myself as I don't even know if its a compliment not being like other girls hahaha.


The problem is...starting when I started mixing at on campus parties and with guys in a course that has a solid core group with everyone completing the nearly all of same subjects of the entirety of their degree, I've run into a lot of issues and struggles and it's made me really sad.


Every time I've tried to be friendly and get on well with a guy just on the basis of being mates, they see it as an open invitation to pursue, harrass and ask me on dates in varyingly levels.


Two guys in my course, one I was ""friends"" with and the other I  was just friendly with asked me on a date and wouldn't let up asking me multiple times until I just stopped replying, one got angry and blocked me and the other saw it as a possibility to harrass me to sleep with him and take his virginity, ""I want to be mates I just want to hook up too""...really? Although he told me previously that ""he wasn't interested in being friends with girls"" which should have hinted at his immaturity. Which we weren't afterwards although he spent months yelling at my window at night once a week after going out drinking and stalked my insta on different accounts until I just stopped posting.

 He also used to be nasty and make horrible remarks about the only guy who has actually been a friend to me in the course and out and we met the sem before and changed degrees together.


The other was a guy in my course I thought was my friend and we used to study together and I'd help him with his other major as we both lived on campus and he seemed nice and like he genuinely cared about me asking me questions and being kind.


Well that all changed one night when he harassed me to come over and ""watch a movie"" with him in his room. I must have said no about ten times as I had a big face to face assessment the next day. After the tenth time he replied really passively with a ""üëç"" and I didn't ever have much else to do with him except study for an exam a few weeks later.


Yet another instance, I was invited to a party with the best friend of one of the guys mentioned above and we had to sit on the floor under a blanket as it was freezing and tiny and he started feeling up my leg and ass and the other guy I met would message me to go on a date everytime he got drunk or high until I blocked him.


I also had a best friend from HS whom I met up with and hung out with one on one and with friends in our break (Hes at a different uni) and we had a great time going to the beach and a hiking spot/waterfall and for lunch. However, we shared a combined birthday bar crawl at the start of the year and slept on our friends lounge apart but when I woke up in the morning I was next to him with his hand on my leg and him touching my hair, even if he was still a bit drunk...idk


I've been asked for nudes so many times.


Tl;dr : its like every time I meet a guy and be friendly to them (I genuinely want some guy friends as I prefer them for some reason) they see it as me giving them an open invitation to pursue me romantically or offer their dick or talk about my body. I am paranoid whenever I see that look in their face when I meet a new guy and it increasingly leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.
I don't get it because I wouldn't consider myself pretty, just average...I guess guys might see me as lower value and easier?



**Am I like a duckling raised by a hen that has identity issues and am I asking too much? Am I being too ignorant? Can men and women truly never be friends and is this normal?**


I do acknowledge that dating/hooking up is an expected or common part of the human experience especially at my stage of life but surely we can be friends as well? It's really eating away at me and making me sad that I can't be seen as the person I am and not for my gender and body.


My female friends keep going on with the old rhetoric, ""guys are trash and just out to screw you over"" and I've always denied and blocked it out.


What should I do to combat this? I do have good female friends and enjoy hanging out with them but I love hanging out with guys, I can't help it, I want a mix of friends. Am I being to ambitious and unrealistic and doomed to failure?",03Nov2019,3

The 16 year old has been living with me since January of last year since her parents lost custody of her. I'm supposed to be going to court in a few weeks to get guardianship of her. Shes been amazing this whole year, and I haven't had a problem with her at all except for her fighting with her sisters, which is normal. These last few months though, out of seemingly nowhere, shes been getting progressively worse and it's gotten to the point where I dont think I have the tools required to help her properly. (She has a very traumatic past due to her upbringing with domestic violence, abuse, and neglect, she has anger issues, PTSD)

 I grounded her for her behavior recently (stomping around, getting an attitude, yelling at me, and acting childish) and she wrote me a letter telling me she hates me and everything about me, my tone, the way I act, I'm a hypocrite, I dont listen, I dont care about her, etc. I told her if I didnt care none of them would be with me and she would be in foster care. I told her I'm trying my best and I'm trying to hold everything together and keep the peace and help them grow up to be independent. She apologized and I thought it would get better. 

She didnt get better at all, she doesnt seem like shes trying and I have no idea what's going on in her head because she wont talk to me no matter what approach I take (one on one conversation, writing letters, having a therapist meditate, etc.) 
She avoids me like the plague, doesnt want to talk to me, always does small stuff she knows will hurt me, like taking back various art projects shes made me. She says she hates me daily now, slams doors, screams, cusses out her sisters and tells them to go fuck themselves, etc. My tone may be bad at times but I'm working on it and doing my best to do the right thing, I've tried everything, and I try to be everything her parents weren't so that she can thrive. 

I've helped her out in some ways--she went from Ds and Fs, always skipping school, smoking cigarettes, no medication for her mental health, to B Honor roll, no smoking, etc. 

So should I  sent her to foster care? I feel like I've exhausted all my options, can't take the stress anymore, and dont have the tools to help her any further. I really dont want to send her to foster care. I dont want her to think I dont love her or shes unlovable or that I'm abandoning her. I want to protect her from all of that and everything else shes been through and I want her to succeed.

93,"This is a bit of a long story so I will get to the nitty gritty of my dilemma as best as possible. Thank you in advance for reading. 

I [28F] was best friends with [28F] whom I will call Melanie for around 7 years. I considered her to be more like a sister than a best friend, considering she lived with my family and I (rented the downstairs from my mom and dad) for 4 of those years, and worked together for 4.5. In all of those years, we‚Äôve never gotten into any very serious fights, but there were some difference that we were able to talk out. I had never experienced that kind of closeness, joy, laughter, loyalty, secrets, pain, tears with any other friend in my life. 

Now, a bit of a backstory on me. I‚Äôve been dealing with serious anxiety, PTSD and depression for years. I am currently seeing a doctor and therapist and working hard on myself and taking responsibility for my recovery. Back in April on my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday, I was having a very bad day mentally and was not able to get myself to go out to his group birthday dinner. My boyfriend was very sweet and understanding about it and we decided to celebrate on our own on another day. I felt very guilty about it so I decided to reach out to Melanie, who responded with things like ‚ÄúI get tired too sometimes, but I show up for events like this‚Ä¶if you really love him you‚Äôd go..‚Äù I got really upset at these comments and said ‚Äúyou don't seem to understand so let‚Äôs just drop it.‚Äù

I was really upset that she reacted this way because I didn't skip the birthday dinner because I don't love my boyfriend or was feeling lazy, I truly felt horrible about not being able to go that day. And thats where mental illness can be terribly inconvenient and bad days strike at the worst times. But I try my 100% hardest to be available and present for my loved ones and thats why my boyfriend was very understanding that day.

Now, this is where I messed up. I took the comments very much to heart and I was too busy tending to what I was feeling at the time to address it and tell her how much it hurt me. I should‚Äôve told her I was angry. And so 3 weeks went by and neither one of us had spoken until her graduation day. There was the ceremony and a surprise dinner I RSVPed too that her mom threw her for afterwards.

I didn't have any details about the ceremony, and she hadn't reached out to see if I was coming either. So I decided that I will at least go to the party instead. My boyfriend and I show up to the party early, with only two people there since the ceremony ended up running late with traffic and all that. So we left to go wait in the car. While waiting I was scrolling on instagram and saw friends posting her at the ceremony and it just broke my heart that I wasn't there. I‚Äôd been by her side through the blood sweat and tears cheering her on and supporting her throughout the process. I ended up feeling so crappy I didn't go back to the party that night. I know I should have but it was a small room where I couldn't have just shown up for a little and snuck out. And plus at this point, I‚Äôd been crying and my makeup was ruined and down my face.

Once the anger from her comments died down, I started to grieve her absence. In July, 3 months after the birthday text incident, I decided to write her a long well thought out message. I explained why what she said hurt me, I explained how terribly sorry I was for not going to the ceremony and party and how proud I am of her and how much I cherished our friendship. I spent a lot of time writing it and putting my heart into it. 

It took a lot of guts to send the message in the first place and took me a few days. I know she started a new job working night shifts so I waited patiently for two weeks. It was nerve wracking to wait but I told myself she was busy and needed time to reply and think about it. However, on instagram I saw she was going out with friends and on road trips etc. so I knew she had some free time to reply. And after two weeks of waiting I followed up with a message, of something a long the lines of ‚Äúif you don't want to be friends anymore, I understand. I just wish we could've had a discussion and you would've let me know instead of keeping me hanging‚Äù 

Still no response for days. At this point, I decided to just block her on social media and her phone number (but only for a day and then I unblocked it, I was angry and grieving and acting on that). Now in this time she replied but the message only got to my Macbook. She replied with something along the lines of how she is stressed at work, has read my message many times over, of course she isn‚Äôt mad anymore, things happen between friends. 

I didn't see this message for two weeks since I don't check iMessage often, but I wrote back I am really sorry I didn't reply sooner, that I blocked her out of anger and thats why I didn't see the message and that I‚Äôm sorry she is really stressed with work, etc. 

This was at the end of July and I got no reply back. It was tough for me after pouring my heart out in the initial message I sent her to not hear back. I have always dropped everything for her and she has done so much for me also. She is a big social butterfly with a ton of friends and I am still going through a lot and don‚Äôt really have as many close friends due to people working crazy hours, having kids, moving, their own depression issues etc. I truly loved her like a sister but I don't know if its right to reach out to her again considering she didn't seem to put much effort back into reconciling our friendship. In addition, I‚Äôve seen her drop very close people to her and not seem to care much. It hurts to think I would be one of them. Should I let go or give it one last try to fix our friendship?

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short, I was friends with a super toxic person, we had a massive blowup, and I cut her off from my life. However, we do have a mutual friend. Although I use friend loosely solely because we don't talk often (often going several weeks without a word); however when I do see him he's always been super sweet to me. I met him through my toxic friend and I don't know how much he knows about our blowup, but I saw him several months afterwards and we hung out for a good several hours together. He never gave me the impression that something was amiss, although I know that he and toxic friend are still super close. 

Within the past couple days, I've started to grow increasingly paranoid him and toxic friend. Things like she's using him to look at my social media (which makes me even more paranoid about what I share), he actually secretly hates me like she did, etc. Even though he has NEVER given me any indication of this. 

I know this is totally on me and please don't think I'm going to act on this paranoia and cut him off or whatever. I just need advice on dealing with it, since I know this paranoia is really on me.

I realise that I‚Äôve never had motivation to pursue a hobby or interest which results in me having none now. I never studied for my GCSEs or A-Levels, have always been incredibly lazy, slept all day, barely can be bothered to go out and see friends, even the most exciting things for me were too much. This has been me from as long as I can remember.

I‚Äôve always suffered from low self esteem too, I hate myself to this very day and can only feel any love for myself when I‚Äôm caked in makeup with my tits out because it gives me attention. I have been suicidal multiple times from 11-17 with my worst attempts being only early this year. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve been depressed or are depressed but I just don‚Äôt enjoy anything. I never have really, I‚Äôve enjoyed doing things only if I would be great quickly and could show it off.

Anyway to the point of the title, a lot of my low self esteem comes from an unconscious idealising of my parents, thinking they can do no wrong, that they know all and as a result I‚Äôve always made myself the one who‚Äôs to blame. Furthermore, I have a crippling fear of disappointing them and watching my mother cry as she tried to clean my slit wrists really fucked me up. I haven‚Äôt cut since. In my most depressed stages the only thing that prevented that final blow was the sadness of my family. Every time I felt they didn‚Äôt care I had nothing to lose.

But now I‚Äôve just come out of a massive argument, I got upset over a comment and wanted to address that in a calm manner but it resulted in my parents blaming me for being over sensitive and misinterpreting everything. Which got me hysterical and leading down the road of bringing up my suicide attempts and how they‚Äôve told me I only ever did it to ‚Äúpunish them‚Äù. 

Well I can‚Äôt take it anymore, I‚Äôve sat here for hours thinking how the only solution is to get rid of the problem, me. I know longer want to die, otherwise this would‚Äôve been my final attempt as I‚Äôve never felt this lost and alone. I truly feel like I can‚Äôt handle living which I‚Äôve never felt so strongly before. So instead I‚Äôve come up with a solution where I effectively cut myself out of their lives. I still have to live at home for another year due to financial reasons but I‚Äôve explained to them how I won‚Äôt talk to them, will financially reimburse them for my expensive items, to not get any gifts or any recognition at events, I won‚Äôt join them for any outings, won‚Äôt be involved in family matters, just make myself invisible until I can move out. 

It upsets me but I just can‚Äôt be the disappointment anymore, I have 3 perfectly great siblings so clearly this issue is me. If I begin to cut myself out now then it won‚Äôt be as hard when I completely remove any evidence of my existence as I head to uni, never speaking to my family again. Maybe I‚Äôm just being upset and dramatic but this is the best I can do, literally two days ago we were carving pumpkins for Halloween and there was no laughter or happiness when I was there. As soon as I left due to getting irritable for no reason, lashing out, then leaving, I heard them all having the times of their lives, that was my final Halloween with them whilst I‚Äôm still living at home and I fucked it up as I‚Äôve always fucked up the family dynamic.

So I‚Äôm just here to ask, is this the right thing?",03Nov2019,1
97,"As of for the past few months I‚Äôve felt myself(20F) distancing myself from my boyfriend(20M). I moved in with him as soon as we started dating due to complicated stuff, so I didn‚Äôt have my own place and moved in.  We were super happy and in love in the beginning of the relationship (a little over a year ago now). For the past few months I‚Äôve felt myself just distancing myself. We both used to work for his family but then got temporarily laid off since there were bill troubles so that‚Äôs understandable, but he hasn‚Äôt gotten a job since we got laid off in July. 

It‚Äôs been bothering me since I‚Äôve been having to cover a lot of the bills, plus I‚Äôll come home after working all day and everything will be a mess after I ask him before I leave to at least clean up a little bit. I‚Äôve tried talking to him to see why he hasn‚Äôt gotten a job, why he missed sign up for classes (so he‚Äôs not in school), and just why he‚Äôs been so unmotivated. I don‚Äôt get anything out of him because he says he‚Äôs fine but I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs just gotten comfortable with staying home all day and playing video games.

When we started dating he had a really great job, was in school full time, as well as being super social with all of his friends. Now I‚Äôll go hangout with a few friends and they all ask me where he‚Äôs at and I just have to give a shoulder shrug. I love going to shows too and he‚Äôs only been to one with me and that was last year. It‚Äôs  like me asking him for anything is a chore even though I do everything I can for him. All I‚Äôm saying is after working all day I‚Äôd at least like some back scratches but apparently that‚Äôs a lot to ask.  We haven‚Äôt even had sex in like what... 3-4 months? 

I don‚Äôt know at this point, its a feeling of being trapped. I‚Äôve caught myself being interested in other guys and thinking ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù about others which I try and stop myself from doing that. I‚Äôm not really sure on where to take it from here. Sorry if this was pretty long, gathering my thoughts is pretty hard haha. Any advice would be incredibly appreciated!!

102," I've been feeling this weird feeling which is I hate time passing by, I always check the time and I'll think that time is fast, I am always comparing what happened exactly last week and say time is fast. I'm always aware of the time. This happened when I was brokenhearted and felt empty and this was only 2 months ago. I remember one time I felt that my whole system shut down because I was angry and ignore her for a day(maybe this is one factor).

103,"Hi, all. Sorry this might be long but I need to give the full background. 

So my mom has been dating this guy for like 4 years now. When they started dating, everything went good-- the ""honeymoon phase"" if you want to call it that. For the past 2 years, all they do is fight. Well, my mom always fights with him. He barely argues back at all. She always accuses him of the most minute things, like not getting her a napkin at dinner if he got one for himself, or of cheating on her or talking to someone else. I forgot to mention, they're both heavy drinkers which doesn't help. Lately, my grandmother died (Mom's mom) and she has been accusing him of ignoring her/not being there/etc. She threw his phone, some sort of ranch dressing across the room, and hit him. That was the end to that argument. She always justifies her side of the argument and why she's right and why I need to side with her. There's some sort of yelling every night that goes on and on.

I am in my senior year of HS and am wondering if I should move into the dorms to leave the environment because I think it has become toxic. I have a cat and Hedgehog, but my friend who is a police officer and wildlife rehabber can take care of them for me since I wouldn't be allowed to take them. I trust her to do that. 

What do you think about this all? Is my house toxic? Should I leave for college instead of staying like planned? I really need advice. 

Thanks in advance!",03Nov2019,1
104,"My roommate (22F) and I (22F) have been friends for years and recently moved in together. For the most part we get along, but one issue that keeps coming up is our different preference for the AC. She prefers it cold (like 69) whereas I like it about 74. For the most part, I've let her run the AC because, while I am slightly uncomfortable, it's not unbearable. However, it's cold outside and we live in a drafty old house. She refuses to allow me to turn on the heat. In her defense, it does seem to blast hot air in her room more than the rest of the house which makes her uncomfortable and ""sweaty."" But, it's getting to the point where its now too cold for me to be comfortable with - I have to cover myself head to toe in clothes and still need a blanket to walk around to not shiver. So, a few days ago I turned on the heat. She wasn't home, but showed up about ten minutes later and immediately turned it off. We played tag with it for another ten minutes until I finally ran into her as she went to turn it off (for maybe the third or so time) and I literally begged her not to shut it off. She immediately popped off on me. She told me I was selfish and a host of other things. I asked if she'd be willing to come up with a solution so that this doesn't have to keep happening to which she said she ""literally"" will not budge and will continue to turn it off every time I turn it on. I realized we weren't getting anywhere, so I said we could just talk about it later because I had to leave for work to which she said ""This is such bullshit."" and called me a cunt as she closed her door. 

I left and came home a few hours later. I decided to take a bath and brought my little portable speaker into the bathroom to listen to some jams. I had it at half volume (plus it really is a tiny little speaker that doesn't give off much ""oomf"" if you know what I mean). My roommate was asleep. It was roughly 1pm. I should also mention that she works nights. As I was getting out of the tub I heard her banging full force on the door and screaming ""Turn the fucking music off."" I'm not gonna lie, I usually don't play music when she sleeps because I know working nights is rough, but she called me a cunt that morning over the AC when I was just trying to fix the problem so my state of mind at that moment wasn't very concerned about waking her up. Even still, I made an effort to keep it at a reasonable volume, but I told her no. (Plus, I was minutes away from getting out and taking it to my room where she wouldn't hear it.) Next thing I know she kicks down the locked door, comes in and takes my speaker, and smashes it on the ground breaking it all while yelling things like ""look at what you're doing to me/ making me do, etc."" 

We argued a good bit after that. I was obviously pretty mad, but in the end told her that I just couldn't do it anymore and walked away. She continued to be angry at me for days after. We haven't really spoken since it happened with the exception of me checking up on her a few days ago and asking if she was okay - like on the inside and what not. She said yeah and I left it at that. The part that is really conflicting for me is that I do care for her and feel like her outburst weren't really my fault - just her scapegoating all her issues onto me (she's not diagnosed with anything but she has a track record of outburst, losing control, going into rage fits). With the exception of playing the music, I don't feel like I did anything wrong, and even with the music I feel like not everything I do in my home should revolve around her choice to work nights and sleep all day. I don't mind accommodating her and being quiet most of the time, but I shouldn't always be expected to change my routine for her - especially when she verbally abuses me and shit like that. And especially with the air, as I pay the bill as much as she does so I should have the right to turn it on if I'm shivering and what not. 

But my main qualm i guess is that I'm conflicted about whether or not to be forgiving and let it go out of understanding that she has a problem. I feel like that's something a good friend does. This is arguably the time when she needs a friend the most, however I don't want to be treated like this anymore. It's not okay - I literally feel bullied by her and we're both grown women lol I want to be a good friend, but in doing so I'm maintaining a relationship that is incredibly toxic at times.",03Nov2019,2

119,"Hi all. I recently received a message from someone who claims to have been raised by my mother before I was born. The email was sent to an old inactive email address of mine from childhood.

Long story short, and all information put together from family history and the details in the message received: This person is 20 years older than me, now raising a family of their own, in the next state over. Neither of us were born or raised in the area. They claim to have been partially raised by my mother (as Writer claims, their stepmother) and some members of her immediate family during a difficult time in Writer's childhood. The email came from their work address. They also left their home address, direct mobile and work phone numbers and say their work and personal emails are monitored at all hours, with the request that I or someone at least acknowledge the outreach.

I am inclined to believe the story. My mother has confirmed parts of it. She knows the names involved and the timeline matches up.

Her family has a history of 'adopting strays' and making them family, to the point that i cannot fully distinguish who of my extended family are genetically or legally my relatives.

I am unsure how Writer found my information considering I am significantly less conspicuous online than any other family member, and have a different name than them. Writer seems to sincerely want only connection and/or closure due to their childhood turmoil. We have no legal association or obligations as far as i am aware. I ask for advice on two counts:

1) How to tactfully respond to the message considering the delicate relationships involved without revealing further personal information? 

2) Best way to fully erase my digital history?

Thank you.",03Nov2019,1
121,"I'm a 23 year old man who has never been to a funeral, fortunately. However, about two weeks ago, my uncle passed away, and while we didn't talk a whole lot, we were still friends and could always reach out to eachother if needed. We knew where we had eachother. We knew that he would pass away roughly a week before it happened, and he passed away peacefully with loved ones all around him. 

However, with his funeral coming up, I don't know what to do. I don't know how to dress, how to react, what to say, what will happen, I know nothing. I would ask my family for advice, but I feel like they probably think that I know how to react and behave during this time, and that I'll look stupid for not knowing if I ask them.

We're still mourning the loss of a family member, and so am I, but I'm afraid I'll do something wrong during the ceremony. If I were a kid, it would be much easier because my parents would be in control of what I wear, they'd tell me how to behave and stuff. But I've never been through this before, and I don't want to take up too much space during the whole funeral. I want to support everyone, and not make a fool out of myself.

125,"I'm currently an apprentice at a machining shop which makes the test samples for the laboratories of a big steel company.
The company makes all kind of steel alloys, from the simplest ones to high-end specialty alloys for the medical and aerospace industry.
As the last part of the process, quality control is ensured in all ways at the sample preparation center, for any kind of mistake, such as inadvertently confusing materials or messing up with the heat treating or dimensions of the samples could delay the deliver of a lot of steel bars, as they all need the labs approval to be released to the final customer.
So, as an apprentice you might be able to tell I get all the tasks no one wants to do, from the simplest ones like sweeping the floor and cleaning the computers to even more complex and/or critical parts of the operation, such as identifying the samples with a unique code that is generated at the beginning of the process once they're ready to dispatch to the labs. 
This last week, since Monday, I've been doing a very dull job of timing the cutting process so that my supervisor can present the data at a meeting he's going to have next week, and when he designated me to do this task, he explicitly told me not to take any other responsibilities from the co-workers and focus 100% on it through the whole week. 
I've been sticking to the plan till Thursday, when a machinist handed me two sets of samples and asked me to identify and dispatch them for him. Not willing to turn it down, I took them and proceeded to the pneumatic engraver (don't really know how it's called in English, since it's not my first language) and immediately noticed that both sets of samples were already engraved with codes that didn't match those on their files. 
I took them back to the machinist and warned him about it. He said he'd only machined it, but he hasn't been the one who engraved them, so he sent me to talk to the guy whom he thought had engraved them. This one says he didn't do it, but they were fine as far as he could see, as the code on them wasn't really that different from the file's and I should dispatch them anyway, as the guys at the lab would certainly discern it and understand this as a simple typo. I even went back to the first machinist and he reiterated this, so all I did was taking the samples to the dispatch desk where the lab guys took them later. 
Fast forward to Friday, and as I come into the supervisor's office to take the clipboard and forms to keep doing the timing task, he worriedly asks me if someone had told me to identify samples this week. I say yes, and I took them even knowing I should have focused on timing the operations... He said this wasn't the problem and asked if I remember something being off in the samples I engraved. I told him about the divergence between what was already engraved and how it was different from the file, but I made it sound like I took the decision to dispatch them by myself. He then asked me if I really did it without consulting anyone, to which I broke down and told him all of the story but reassuring him we didn't do it with bad intentions, we really have a good reason to pass it ahead an believe everything was OK. He told me that the lab tested the samples and the results matched a whole other material, and they had their code different from the one in their files. He then told me to go get the machinist to his room, and asked him the same questions. Luckily he was also sincere and didn't try to get rid of the trouble. Turns out the sample that got rejected had been dispatched 3 days ago, in a day I didn't even touch the engraver, so it wasn't my fault at all. But as this same machinist had dispatched them, he was considered guilty for not checking the right codes both in the samples and the files. 
After lunch, the supervisor called this same co-worker to his room and, I later found out, explained how management was stressing him to appoint a culprit, so he had to give a formal warning to him, which he had to hand to HR and sign some papers acknowledging his mistake and reassuring it was not intended as sabotage or anything. 
Anyway, this is haunting me, especially because I can get into work this Monday just to face it all over again and this time it'll be my fault, and I can't do anything because I've already told my boss everything...
TL;DR: Did something stupid as a team, tried to wash it off and take all the blame myself, couldn't resist mild pressure from boss and pointed out the culprits. Turns out it wasn't even my fault but coworker got in trouble, now I'm afraid of getting in trouble too because boss knows how weak and easily corrupted I am.",03Nov2019,2

137,"So I have lost everything. My education, friends, and the prospect of a fruitful future because of one mistake. I want to kill myself every morning I wake up. 

I could have gotten away with it but it was just a secret I didn't want to keep. I felt so horrible about it. I confessed. Unfortunately I can't talk about it on here because I don't want more legal stuff to come from it as I'm still in the midst of dealing with it. But then boom. Charge. Fingerprints. Court. Everything.

I'm extremely heartbroken by the selfishness of my actions. I have lost all credibility. I had wholesome thoughts and memories but now all I can think about is suffering and dying. No one wants to seek advice from me because I broke trust with someone and did something awful to them.

I am so alone. I don't know how to think of anything else. I am told all I can really do to make decent money is risk starting my own business (however the hell I do that).

I disappointed SOOOO many. I have a relative who is a criminal. That's what he does. I don't honestly feel disappointed by him. It's just what I expect. But for me? Of course everyone thinks I'm a fraud now. That I deceived them. One mistake.",03Nov2019,2
138,"This is all the same night. I met her at my kitchen flat 'party'. I vibe with her really well throughout the next 3-4 hours both of us gradually get more drunk until at one point we both needed to pee at the same time so we're in my flat room , I use the toilet she ends up not, eventually we make out but then she suddenly stops and repetitively says ""I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry"". I told her that you shouldn't be sorry, ""what are you sorry for, I liked it"". 

She then ends up going to my friends room that she knows to go to the toilet. I assume she felt it was too quick kissing without hardly knowing each other or/and maybe doesn't want to regret it next day if it escalated to other stuff? (though we only missed for like 30 seconds and I definetly wasn't planning to have sex) when she leaves I kiss her on the cheek instead of the lips (maybe this is where I fucked up??) In case she didn't want to kiss me since she stopped last time.

Anyway, she leaves and my flatmate (the one that she went to the toilet to) tells me that whilst she went to her toilet, they talked and she said that she really likes me but she just doesn't know what to do because she just got dumped by this guy that she's been dating for 3 weeks. So now things make sense, she didn't want to further our short intimacy because realisation hit her I might be the same as the last guy or something and she doesn't want to be dumped again etc.

 I text her the morning if she's fine etc. 
So now I'm here in a pickle of not really knowing what to do, do I back off for like a week or couple days so she can have time to decide whether she wants to pursue something or to completely forget about the night? Do I text her and say if she wants to grab a coffee sometime and if so what do I say? ""I want to get to know you better, can we also take things slower? (Should I say that I know about your recent breakup and empathise with her?

Usually I would never post anything like this but I really really like her based on the first encounter and I never wanted to not f up so badly.",03Nov2019,2

It‚Äôs a rpg for teenagers where a majority of the stories are about high school drama and young  adult living (getting married, cheating, sex, pregnancy etc). I thought this was a bit odd, I‚Äôve only known high schoolers and young girls to be playing this game.

141,"So this girl in my college class wont leave me alone. Lets call her Chloe. I had recently broke up with my girlfriend when Chloe and I started talking,  we talked for about 2 weeks and ended up having sex. This was on a night out clubbing and we were both very drunk. I literally stopped during the sex and left. I made up an excuse as to why I had to go, but really, I didn‚Äôt even want to have sex with her. I regretted it so much and wished it never happened because I knew I still loved my ex at the time. After that happened I gradually stopped talking to Chloe over the next week on Snapchat. Since then me and my ex have gotten back together. Chloe never knew about my past relationship and she doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm back in it now either.

She has already brought it up to me in the class and I kinda acted stupid to what I was doing and changed the subject. I cant tell Chloe im in a relationship now because she will get so angry and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if she texted my girlfriend and told her we had sex. This really wouldn‚Äôt go down well and would fuck up my relationship as we weren‚Äôt broken up too long so it will seem really bad. Chloe is a bit psycho too so i don‚Äôt want to have to deal with that for the rest of the year.

142,"I'll keep it simple. I came home unexpectedly and found another man in my bedroom with my girlfriend.

Due to our circumstances, I felt it necessary to move all my belongings out that same night. My ex-girlfriend was not intent on leaving herself, and I didn't want to argue.

Both our names are on the lease, and I am legally still a tenant in our one bedroom apartment for another two months.

I have already made it clear that I may show up unannounced, but I don't necessarily want to be putting myself in the position of finding him there again.

I have an air mattress and may be staying in a friends room while working full time. I've considered sleeping in the apartment on occasion as to not impose. Can I put up cameras facing the doors, or somehow legally monitor activity in the apartment? Otherwise, I'm more than open to suggestions on how to keep this guy out of my house.

If you do something small wrong on the damn assignment, she literally gives a ZERO!? These assignments are worth 300 points each and she gives a zero if you even get one thing on the assignment minority wrong. Most normal professors would give like 290/300 or whatever if the assignment is mostly correct.

She is driving me absolutely insane. She keeps saying that I didn't have a project ""approved"" when literally all we have to do is type that it was approved. I typed that the thing was approved and SHE STILL is giving me a zero. Graduate school is important for me and my major is not English so I don't think it would effect me as much if I get a B, but it is still my GPA!!!!

I want to get A's.

I am so tired of dealing with her. I emailed her to try and get this figured out. I can withdraw from the class but it has to be by Monday night, which I do not want to do that bc I am almost finished it for the semester.

150," Im a 21 year old guy who‚Äôs normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‚Äòawwww‚Äô (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don‚Äôt say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I‚Äôm a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‚Äòohhhh....how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there?‚Äô in a smiley way I didn‚Äôt Say anything. she‚Äôs started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she‚Äôs referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

159,"Hey Redditors. I hope this won‚Äôt be too long. I‚Äôm feeling anxious/angry and I don‚Äôt really know where/who to resort to. The title pretty much explains my current situation, I will elaborate however. A 21F coming from a muslim/middle eastern (ME) background, which obviously discriminates against women and that didn‚Äôt take me long to figure out. Didn‚Äôt take me long to want to break free either. Into the main problem: my parents aren‚Äôt abusive nor oppressive in any way, quite the contrary. More open minded than most of my friends‚Äô parents. I went abroad to my home country in the ME for university and i‚Äôve been living alone for the past 3 years. I was able to change my ways of thinking and formulate my own worldview which is very contradicting to theirs, and it makes me feel like I can‚Äôt be my authentic self or express my genuine opinions around them. That applies mostly my father.  There is also fear incorporated in me and my father‚Äôs relationship which stems back to a couple of reasons. Anyway, I‚Äôll be done with my degree within the next half a year, and I set a mapped-out plan for myself (which i‚Äôm totally fixated on) that I would be continuing my education and pursuing my Master‚Äôs degree in Europe. I spoke to my parents about it and they were openly supportive, but only with words. All their actions indicate otherwise. Wether postponing the conversation itself, or proposing other plans, or even claiming to not being able to pay for my language courses when there are so much other less important things that they are paying for at the moment. (I started learning online on my own). This is also accompanied with their knowledge of my relationship with my S.O who lives in the country I‚Äôve chosen, and yes him being there definitely influenced my decision and I did to an extent make my decision based on that, because it‚Äôs what I truly want. To be able to build our futures together (something I can NOT tell them because of their fear of the ‚Äúgod of virginity‚Äù). And I don‚Äôt want to stop at anything, not even my parents. They have conspired behind my back several times into manipulating me into what they want for me, but now I see it, and now I know what I want, so they won‚Äôt be getting their way. I know they will be a roadblock down the line at some point, and i‚Äôm trying to direct all this angst into facing them when reality hits, and maybe shit will hit the fan when that happens. I grew up in a community where family was everything so I was always subconsciously seeking their acceptance and blessings in everything i‚Äôd do. That led into a relationship where they always have the upper hand and are the decision makers of my life, and i‚Äôm continuously scared of disappointing them or telling them no and facing them, and I just don‚Äôt want that anymore. I‚Äôm sick of it. It‚Äôs my turn to take my life‚Äôs wheel. All these factors compiled have led to severe anxiety triggers when it comes to talking to them about something major about my self/life, anger at myself for not being stronger and able to stand up for myself and for what I want, a grudge against their conspiracies, and fear that has somewhat morphed into emotional damage with a dash of hate (though I hate to say it).  I‚Äôm really torn apart and i‚Äôm hurt by my own feelings because they never did me harm, but then again I wouldn‚Äôt be feeling these out of nowhere would I? I just feel like I need guidance as to what to do next and how to handle the situation on my own, and communicating with them isn‚Äôt as easy as it sounds. They guilt me and twist my mind until I freeze up and when the conversation is over I burst into tears over what I should‚Äôve said.  I know I should build a stronger me, but can this happen without permanently damaging our relationship? I‚Äôm just trying to build my life the way I want to. Thank you for the read!",03Nov2019,2
160,"Yesterday, a friend who I haven‚Äôt seen in months invited me to go to church with her while she was in town. We are of the same faith, but I had reservations about attending this particular church which I am about to explain. 

A few years ago, I attended this church each week with my siblings. My uncle also attended this church. He is physically and intellectually disabled and my mom (his sister)  helped him with the things he needed to live on his own (ie: bills, home health care, budget, and anything else he needed). 

Another thing you need to know is that he has narcissistic personality disorder and believes the universe revolves around him. If you are not benefiting him, he could not care less what happens to you. He does not have the capacity to love anyone.

He got it into his head that my mom was stealing money from him. In his head she was stealing and deserved to have her life destroyed. So, he called the police and they took his statement.

They brought my mom in for questioning, but couldn‚Äôt prove anything - mainly because she never took any of his money. She was informed that someone else was going to help him manage his finances from then on.

When a friend of my mom‚Äôs confronted him about what the consequences could have been for her, he smirked and admitted he wouldn‚Äôt care if she was locked away forever. That was it. When she heard about this, my mom said she could not let him be a part of her life ever again. And he hasn‚Äôt been. Today was the first time I‚Äôve seen him in four years. 

When I went to church, I saw him in one of the Bible Studies - the same one I had planned to go to. That‚Äôs okay, I turned on my heel before he saw me and went to another.

After church, my friend invited me to have lunch at one of her friend‚Äôs houses. I agreed and went home to change. It turned out that the friend had invited the whole Bible Study over to her house. My uncle was not there, so I stayed and got to know people. 

By the end of the afternoon I knew I wanted to become better acquainted with these people. I wanted to attend Bible Study and church with them. I haven‚Äôt really had friends since I moved back from the town where I met my friend. I tend to be very quiet and tend to need an outgoing friend to introduce me to new friends. 

I want to keep going to this church and bible study, but I don‚Äôt want to be worried about my uncle the whole time I‚Äôm there. Should I go back?",03Nov2019,2

166,"CONTEXT :
PEOPLE INVOLVED 
Me - 25, Male
My Little Sister - 21, Female
Bro-In-Law - 19, Male
Nephew - 7months, Male

My sister and brother in law have been together 2 years and have a baby together. We all live together in a small 3 bedroom house along with my mother. 

Normally me and my brother in law are best friends. I see him as a little brother that I never had. 

THE STORY :
So for a while I noticed my brother in law sneaking off to the bathroom or bedroom and noticed I was hearing noises that go along with certain activities men get up to.

So I thought it would be funny to catch him at it so I stayed in the bathroom and could hear him in the room next door.  Normal stuff. Panting etc. But then I heard him talking. 

My mind went crazy and I assumed it was a girl on facetime. This made me panic as I instantly thought of my baby nephew having no stable family all because his dad is stupid and talking to girls online. 

So I decided to find out. I confronted him and he acted like nothing was happening. But I wasn't satisfied so I created a fake Instagram and talked to him as a girl. He took the bait and it went a lot further than I expected. He went beyond fantasy and started arranging to meet the girl. 

Obviously I've kept all the screenshots 

A few days went by and I couldn't hold it in anymore so I confronted him and he cried. He said he thanked me for not going crazy and for giving him a life lesson. He said that he knew it was wrong and it's the only time it's happened. He even said that I showed him how much he stands to lose. 

I told him I'd deleted everything and that I wasn't going to say anything as at the time I believed him.

But now I'm starting to notice him running off again and hiding in the bathroom way too long. Hearing stuff. 


 I want to trust him and I want to believe he is telling the truth. Like I'm a guy I get it, a bit of adult entertainment is no sin, but when it's a live girl on the other end that's cheating. 

I'm so torn as I want my nephew to have a mum and a dad happy together. And I don't want to be the one to ruin it. 

Plus I don't want to hurt my sister by telling her. Or risk her saying it's my fault for poking my nose on

But I don't want to lie what do I do",03Nov2019,2

174,"So to start off, I‚Äôve never really had any big dreams on where I wanna go to college or what I wanna do.

I know they don‚Äôt pay the most in the world but if I‚Äôm helping kids and doing what I love it will be worth it.

I thought it would be nice to go to a chill school like the University of Idaho. They have a secondary education degree and I can major in art. It has a nice campus and it‚Äôs not crazy expensive. A part of what lead me to look into going there is my girlfriend of almost a year. She wants to go there for psychology and I was like huh.

When we are down at the track he is always behind me hugging me and when we do our laps he stays next to me even though he knows he can go ahead and already be done. He always walks with me to 6th period and when its time to go home he walks me to my bus. People always ask if we are dating we always say no. I never thought of him as a ""boyfriend"" before, but yesterday I kind of wished he was my boyfriend. Yesterday I had to stay after school because I was working as a gate guard for a football game. He walked me to the band room and left to drop off some of his friends. As I was waiting for him to get back he calls me and asks if I want anything from McDonalds, of course I did. When he gets back to the school we eat together and hangout until I had to go get ready for the game, he had to too. He's a drummer for the marching band. Around halftime I get to go and watch the rest of the game. So I sit down near the band and watched the rest of the game. After the game they marched back to the school and I went with them. In the band room I go and give my friends hugs and then I go up to him and help him with his uniform. We are both cold and sniffling but we had to leave as we walked outside I realized that he had a tshirt on he didn't have his jacket, I started to tell him that he needed to wear his jacket so he doesn't get sick.

181,"This may be the wrong subreddit, so if it is just tell me and I‚Äôll delete it. So there was an AskReddit post earlier today about the most obvious signs that a girl was into you that you have missed and it got me thinking. 

There was this one girl that I was super into from like 8th grade til I graduated high school. She was *so* out of my league. Like she is a model now and I would legitimately not be surprised I found out she became a Victoria‚Äôs Secret model.

She was flirty with a lot of people so I think that is why I didn‚Äôt look into it too hard), but she was extra flirty with me and would always comment on my body because I was always in really good shape. Like, **frequently** commenting to me on my body. When I was a sophomore, I had braces and when I finally got them off, I was ready to party. Don‚Äôt remember if I told her I was getting them off or if she found out elsewhere, but she texted me like an hour after I left the ortho.

We chatted for a little bit, probably about some drama that went down at school, and then she asked me how it felt to have them off. Obviously I was super stoked and was telling her about it. Then she asked, ‚ÄúSo do you have plans to make out with a ton of hot girls this week? üòè‚Äù to which I replied, I‚Äôm guessing, with something along the lines of ‚Äúoh I don‚Äôt know we‚Äôll see what happens haha.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know how much longer the conversation continued that day.

And then we had PT conferences soon after, and we both had the same teacher in one class but in different periods. So I was sitting with my mom and teacher going over grades, and at the end of the conversation he made some comment about how I was a hit with the girls. Me, being obviously insecure and oblivious, asked what he meant by that. And then he informed me that (girl) had written in sharpie on one of the desks, ‚ÄúFIRST AND LAST NAME IS HOTTT.‚Äù 

I figured she was just joking around. But now thinking about it, I feel like she may have been into me. And then I started to think about when we went swimming at her friends house (freshman and sophomore year, shared a mutual friend who was the homie) she followed me into the pool house where I was alone (happened twice), but obviously I didn‚Äôt consider the fact that she may have liked me.

And then I thought about the time junior year where she asked me to go with her to a school magic show (kind of with the purpose to make low-key snarky jokes to each other) and I didn‚Äôt make a move. But she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so cold my nipples could key a car rn.‚Äù I thought she was just making a joke. And the other time where she asked me to go hunting for bugs because we had a wildlife bio class together. And the time she asked me to come help her study for our test at her house. I was the brainy kid so I thought she may have just wanted help...

I‚Äôm still oblivious and have low confidence so I can‚Äôt say for sure. But did I miss a chance or could that still be interpreted as friendly joking...?",03Nov2019,2

183,"throwaway

i knew this was coming, because it always does. and i let it happen. i've always had dependency issues i just can't seem to avoid. at any point in my life there is one person that i am absolutely fixated on, whether it be a boyfriend/girlfriend, best friend, online friend. i need to see them, i need to talk to them. their validation is what fuels me. i can't make decisions without talking it though with them to some degree. i absorb their personality to some degree (although i've gotten a lot better at that specifically and find it less of an issue now).

i've been telling people recently that i don't date/don't ""do"" romantic relationships. i really in my core believe that the way modern society does dating is totally toxic in it's entirety, that 1. human relationships never meant to be in monogamous relationships, 2. the concept of ""romantic love"" is kind of made up. conveniently enough, before and since having this philosophy i've had a consistent fwb. a *best* friends with benefits, if you will. and i became very quickly attached. i view(ed?) our friendship as perfect, we had very regular intercourse, are very intimate and close with one another, spend a majority of our free time together. he's unlike anyone i've ever met and i know i'll never meet anyone like him again. i can tell him anything and he truly understands every aspect of my being. 

twice now, we've tripped on acid together. and agreed that we feel very strongly connected to each other, like a very powerful connection that has drawn us together. on the second trip, we realized we felt like to halves to one whole being, a sentiment we had touched on the first trip and i knew he had felt as well. these feelings were not just the drug, more a 'realization.' a few days after the trip i mentioned to him i felt like he was my soulmate, we say 'i love you' and very cushy stuff about each other all the time, things that 'just friends' really would never say, so i didn't really think twice about saying it. he said 'think what you want,' but his tone was very loving and he was playing with my hair. but it made me think. and ever since then i've kinda been slowly feeling like he only does all the extra stuff, like the sex and the intimacy, because he wants to make me happy but he doesn't really... enjoy? doing it. 

we lived together for around a month and have been trying to be able to do that again, as we both ended up having to move back home for financial reasons. we were sharing a bed and everything. i was texting him today about how i don't feel like i'll be able to be happy until i'm sleeping next to him again and he said... 'yea you should do something about that.' i asked him if that made him uncomfortable and he said no, and i asked him if i was too clingy and he said he was just speaking from the heart and that one day he'll disappear eventually and that he fears for me when that day comes. i told him i'd work on being less dependent on him, and then he said 'just understand that one day we can only be friend friends.' that... did not feel good to hear. my heart felt crushed. it felt exactly like every break up i've ever had, that my heart just felt ripped in two. then he said to not read into it, and that he's 'just crazy.' 

i don't know what to do. i don't know how to feel, i don't know how to stop loving him as much as i do. i want to protect myself but i don't know what that means in regards to this. and i absolutely cannot stand to lose him. if there's any advice any of you can give me please do... feel free to ask questions because there's a lot of details in there i didn't include",03Nov2019,2

     I am 22f, my first real therapy session was about a year ago. When I was in middle school I had a few sessions but didn‚Äôt really talk much for some of the same reasons. Last year, however, at the advice of my mom, I started therapy for myself, with the mindset of taking it completely seriously and really trying. After 3 sessions I found that I felt worse than before and I was crying in the way home every time I left. Every session just kind of hit me like a train, (mostly because of the subject matter from my life).I was told I was suffering from PTSD from trauma in my life and could deal with anxiety for the rest of my life if not dealt with. All of this culminated to me quitting therapy at that time. 

Fast forward to this year and my mom wants me to give it another try... 

       it‚Äôs definitely nice to get years of trauma off my chest, but I have fears about going back. My number one concern my sound ridiculous, but I have a major fear of being judged. 

My last therapist was quick to tell me that what I‚Äôd been through was not my fault etc etc, but I still felt like I hadn‚Äôt even scratched the surface of what I‚Äôd experienced and I don‚Äôt know how anyone could wrap their head around it all....I‚Äôm scared of feeling crazy after telling someone.

201,"(P.S sorry this is so long) Hi there, I am currently 16 and have a very strict parent. Probably not as bad as the rest of you but I'm put in a bad position. 

So when I was about 8 my mom decided to get a separation from my dad and move to the big city with me. For years I had disliked my dad for a stupid reason when I was 3 so my mom was forced to take me. My parents knew since I was at a young age that I had mental issues and tried to take me to doctors and councellors but nothing got fixed. At about the age of 9 my mom was consistently leaving me home alone all night and calling to say ""she had to work late"" or ""she was meeting up with a friend."" I always found something to get into as I was bored out of my mind. But I liked a boy in my class and on valentine's day they were throwing a little dance. So i brought a box of chocolates and asked him to go to the dance with me and, not surprisingly, he rejected me. But my 9 year old self got very mad and threatened to kill him. I set up a whole group of girls and in the end got in school suspension for a couple months. But because of that event I got sent to a doctor who diagnosed me with a couple disorders. Around this time my mom started bringing a man and his son around the house and he would often buy me gifts. He was nice to me in front of her but when she wasnt around he would act rude. They set me and his son up on facetime often for us to talk and his son ended up liking me. Not too long later he asked me and my mom to move in and so we did. He lived in a shithole but was building a nicer house in front of it, which he was just finishing up. His son often would talk to me and hang out with me but I never thought anything of it. I didnt particularly like the man my mom was seeing but I was also 10 so I didnt understand why she wasnt with my dad. I acted rudely towards him often which later on caused him to lash out at me and throw glass plates, smash my computer, and much more. But within many years his son was grooming me and making me believe we were in a relationship. He would hangout with me and sexually assault me often but my mom didnt like him so he ended up moving a state away to live with his mom. My mom and her boyfriend called me fat a lot, and it made me feel self conscious to the point that I stopped eating. But another factor that caused me to stop eating was the fact that they put locks on the pantry and fridge to stop me from eating. My parents would always say particularly rude and obnoxious things to me but I always thought it was normal and never said anything to anyone until one night I read a book my mom hid away talking about emotional abuse and everything the book said sounded like how they treated me. So I confronted them and they got really mad and yelled at me that I'm the one emotionally abusing them and they should call the police on me. So my moms boyfriend ended up moving back in and the sexual assault continued but at that time I had a girlfriend and one night when he assaulted me he told me I'm cheating on her and it's all my fault. So I called her and cried so hard telling her im sorry for cheating, but then she told me that I didnt and he was doing things to me that were not right. She forced me to go to the counsellors office and they called the police. The police questioned me and I told them about how he would unlock any doors I locked and would threaten to kill me if I told anyone. They questioned him and he said that it was consensual and they believed him. They told my parents I'm lying with no proof at all and forced my parents to sign an agreement that I wouldnt live under the same roof as him. I was put in foster care where every night i had night terrors and would wake up crying or have a panic attack. I got really bad depression and my girlfriend broke up with me because my step brother told her that the police ruled it consensual. My mom bought a house just out of town but as soon as we moved in they were pretty much living with us again. His son was over every night as well as my moms boyfriend when they promised it wouldnt be that way. Everyday my mom would say terrible things to me about how it was my fault for wearing tank tops and shorts around him even though it was summer. She would also say that I'm trashy, a whore, fat, ugly or stuck up. At that time I was being blackmailed by boys at my school to send them nudes and was in an abusive relationship. When my mom found out I was sending nudes she took my phone away and the name calling got worse. When she gave my phone back I started talking to a 20 year old and he would invite me to his house while I was supposed to be in school and would take advantage of my child mind. My friends got worried because he was playing with my mind and making me severely depressed. They told the school to check my records where they saw I had skipped more then half the school year. They called my mom and she went through my messages and called the police. The police started a case and he ended up going to jail. After that incident my mom put a camera in the house and an app on my phone so she could read all my messages and block whoever she wanted. I decided I wanted to start a better life as I was going in to grade 10 and blocked all the guys on my snapchat and instagram. My mom would still say terrible things to me and call me a slut and tell me to lose weight. A couple weeks after grade 10 started I got into a relationship with an old friend from grade 7. He was a year older but a very nice guy. My mom would read our messages and yell at me for saying provocative things to him and we also ended up starting to have consensual sex and we would talk about it which made her even more angry. She forced him to come over to our house to tell him about my past and claimed I was lying about who I was and said he shouldn't want to be involved with someone like me. We ended up moving back in with my moms boyfriend because his son got in a fight with him and he chose to go live with his mom. Things were okay for awhile but me and my mom never talked. We stayed in our rooms and never made eye contact or conversation. But when my dad filed for divorce things got really bad. She started going a little psycho and put the camera back up, began claiming I've been lying to her about things I wasnt, and made me stop seeing my councilor because ""she was putting bad ideas in my head."" Me and my dad still dont have the best relationship and when we went down to see my family one weekend me and him got into a fight. I came home miserable and got into a fight with my mom. On the drive home the next morning she yelled at me and said I'm disrespectful and she doesnt have to do anything for me. She said if I wanted her to drive me anywhere I had to pay her $45. I have a job, I have to get to school, and my boyfriends parents wouldn't allow him to drive me home because they thought the highways were dangerous. So I have to pay her to get everywhere as I am too young to drive. She even takes my money without my permission. She forced me to transfer all my savings money to her account because she didnt want me to spend it. I have no access to the account and it seems everytime she tells me how much is in it, the number gets lower and lower but I'm not taking anything out. She started telling me that I'm less important than my brother (she had a son and then adopted me because she was infertile) and that she wishes she would have took him instead of me. I have straight A's and she yells at me that I'm useless and I will never go anywhere. I told her I want to be a chef and she told me itll never happen because I'm not capable of doing anything on my own. Shes threatening to take my phone away because I told her I'm closing our joint account that my paycheck goes into (because I have to pay $85 for my phone bill.)  She hits my cats and makes them scared of her and says its because they need to be disciplined. She has also slapped me and my brother and then claimed she hasn't?She also wont let me have my phone after 10Pm or my laptop in my room and her reasoning was because she doesnt want me to send nudes but I haven't done that in 2 years? Her boyfriend wont even talk to me or do anything for me so I cant ask him for help if I need it. I've called social services begging for them to put me in a group home instead but when they come to visit she tells them that I'm a liar and a drama queen. My boyfriend graduates in 2020 and his parents are offering for me to live with them when he does. I want to take it but I will only be 17 and I'm not entirely sure if I'll be ready to be on my own. I want to get out but i feel like shes put it in my head that i cant or i shouldn't 

I dont think my mom is as bad as everyone else's parents but I would just like some advice on how I might be able to improve our relationship or be able to move out quicker? If you have any question I am willing to answer anything.",03Nov2019,2
202,"So there‚Äôs this cat at the animal shelter I have been volunteering at for a year and it‚Äôs the COOLEST cat I‚Äôve ever met there, it‚Äôs the perfect personality and it‚Äôs weird but we just connect. I‚Äôve never connected with any of the other cats really, just brushed them and pet them but never really bonded. I‚Äôve always loved animals (hence volunteering at the animal shelter) and have always dreamed of having a cat or dog but never felt it was the right time. So basically this cat is pretty damn special to me and is making me rethink it. 

The problem is I‚Äôm in college, I currently have a pet friendly apartment but I go home in the summers, and I couldn‚Äôt take the cat home with me because my mom has sever cat allergies. I COULD get an apartment over the summer and just get a short lease, and then just have an apartment for the rest of my years at college but I don‚Äôt know if that would be really dumb or not. I have always been the ‚Äúgolden child‚Äù of the family and always did things by the books and never really did anything for me without wondering what others think, and this is the one time I finally feel like saying screw it and do what will make me happy. I could live with my grandma over the summer but I don‚Äôt know how willing she would be to take me and a cat in since she already has animals of her own.

203,"I really don't know any good place to post this, but, I have a friend of mine which I recently learned that almost everyone I knew someone got the idea that I liked her, not to be mean, but I wasnt really into her. but as soon as multiple people started asking me if I liked her or if I did like her in the past, I figured things out relatively quickly, and at the same time I figured out why she was being so distant with me for a long time, she thought I was into her. thing is, I'm Muslim, so I wouldnt have asked her out even if i did like her.

anyways, I was recently invited to a party with her and we a had a good time (no drinking or drugs we literally were playing Mario kart and CAH) and then I started finding myself accidentally catching feeling for this girl, usually I'm not a shy dude, I have no issue with awkward situations like asking someone out, but the thing is, muslims cannot date, so me saying anything at all would be pointless, and as soon as a certain guy left they figured out that ""guy"" liked this girl (I honestly would've never thought she would ever say yes to a date in her life, she rejected so many dudes and has yet to go out with someone). but then we started talking to her and she said if he was to ask her out, she'd prolly say yes. and now I feel like I'm just suppressing so much crap right now, I cant focues on anything, and honestly at this point uts actually starting to physically hurt.

207,"This is going to be a long post but I really hope that someone can untangle what is right and wrong with my situation. If not, I hope this doesn‚Äôt seem as though I want validation, if it does tell me.

I turned 18 recently and on my birthday I let someone back into my life, he‚Äôs 17. We met each other online - and saying that the word love probably comes off as the misunderstandings of a kid with hormones but all I know is that all I want for him is to be safe and when he isn‚Äôt my heart hurts and I struggle to think of anything else until I know he‚Äôs okay again. 

I had previously broke up with him in a manner that was almost traumatic to him, I blocked all ways for him to contact me and suddenly. We had been in close contact for 5 months up to then, calling every night and having the longest, deepest conversations with each other. It was during these conversations I learned of his struggle with bipolar and the patterns of his lifestyle which include going to many parties with access to schedule 1 narcotics, his wild sex life, and his dependency on alcohol. Being from a small town and having the parents I do, I never did so much as kiss another boy on the lips (I am gay) or even dare to drink. 

And so our relationship was turbulent, I was met with constant cognitive dissonance, on one hand I love boy, he‚Äôs extremely smart and caring and talented and funny and so damn sexy; but on the other hand he‚Äôs done things and continued to do things that hurt me to even think about. And we struggled to stay exclusive, add long distance with his libido and easy access to other boys, I was so insecure. But he told me he loved me and my struggle to trust him was almost insulting. But at the same time when we had fights he‚Äôd leave me alone for me to find out he‚Äôd kissed someone else, gone out drunk, and had even hooked up with someone. But I saw him through it all, I had even got him to go home one night he almost got black out drunk by only calling him and convincing him I was coming over to his house.

I by no means was a perfect person in this relationship, I had a bad temper because I would get worried and I‚Äôd doubt his honesty.

We broke up one day after he was indifferent to an issue I was having. I felt like he just didn‚Äôt care about me and so I had finally had it, after 5 months of passionate conversations, both arguments and love, I stood up for myself and left. I was gone for two months, but even though I blocked him I would still check his page to see how he was doing, and I couldn‚Äôt stop myself. I unblocked him recently.

When he called me on my birthday he was crying, he was under influence but he was coherent. He had just told his mother that he struggles with suicidal thoughts, something he‚Äôs had for a long time ever since childhood. He says he has voices in his head constantly telling him to end it. When I first picked up the phone I was unemotional but by the end I was telling him that I loved him. He needed to hear it, and to be honest I didn‚Äôt mind. I love him.

He told me he‚Äôs tried every single drug out there from heroine, to ecstasy, to shrooms, LSD and cocaine. He especially struggled with an addiction to meth. Currently he‚Äôs still having withdrawals even a month after getting clean. It amazes me how much substances and people he did in my absence, as judgmental as a person as I am (you can call me out on this) I accepted him because he wanted to stop. He wanted to stop and for the first time we agreed and I knew my love for him could only help him.

For the past few weeks we quickly got back to talking like we did, we talk into the night in bed together. It took awhile for him to come home, but when he did I was so proud of him. He still depends on alcohol and craves anything he can get his hands on but he‚Äôs been fighting.

But tonight he went out, and I am just so tired of worrying about him. He lives in a big city and he likes to go downtown to get drunk. I admit I was really emotional, I just couldn‚Äôt deal with it anymore, he was getting better but now he‚Äôs just putting himself in danger. He‚Äôs 17 and I know he‚Äôs done a lot but he‚Äôs still a kid and he should be at home, not trying to sneak into the bar district. 

He called me manipulative for threatening to leave again, he called me childish for the way I was behaving and desperately wanted me to tell him I loved him. I admit I insulted him because he said it maybe be goodbye and said the next time I‚Äôd meet him he‚Äôll be addicted to crack and would have done every faggot in the city. I was so angry. And I was so worried and sad. I just want him home.

I conceded though, I told him I loved him, he tried taking the high ground, telling me that he was trying to stay at my level while I was talking down to him. I feel like I humiliated myself. I wanted to leave, but I couldn‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt know if that makes me weak. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm wrong for doing what I did. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm disillusioned, I worried I‚Äôm not telling this story as it should be.

208,"I‚Äôm 23 years old, 2018 college grad male. 

Been working since June 2018 in a high paying job. $85,000/year. Based out of Chicago. 

Something isn‚Äôt doing it for me and I feel the biggest gap between me and my future career are skills the military would offer me. 

Discipline, confidence, mental toughness, leadership, ability to say yes to anything, precision, execution, accountability. 

To name a few.  

My likely path would be 3-4 years, followed by an MBA, followed by a career in finance. 

I went to a good school, a top 100 university, but by no means an Ivy. 

Given that I have a comfortable job right now as far as compensation and such, is this an asinine move?

Initially, fianc√® (let's call him Max) and I agreed to let housemate (let's call her Jane) pay only 1/3 (rather than half) of the rent in exchange for her doing more cleaning because I am disabled and can't do my share very easily.

Jane is getting almost the same amount of income as Max and I from her parenting payments.

Since moving in together in August, there have been constant excuses about why Jane can't do her own share of cleaning (let alone the extra), and the house is a complete mess.
She has almost finished paying off all of her debts, which is why we were initially trying to be helpful, but now we're feeling a bit taken advantage of.

She is my best friend, so I don't want to ruin the friendship, but I don't know how to bring up that she needs to pay more rent if she's not going to follow through on her end of the deal.

Is it fair to ask for half the rent because she has a toddler?
It's a 4 bedroom house, Jane has one room, toddler has another, Max and I have our room, and the office is shared.

221,"After an almost 2 year relationship with my gay partner I broke up with him Friday, after a political discussion. He is 23 and Canadian, with American citizenship, and I‚Äôm 29 and Mexican, with American citizenship. At first he mentioned that he was economically conservative, then that his parents were loyal Trump supporters, and it wasn‚Äôt until several months that I realized he was actually a hardcore Trump supporter. He got on board from that first racist press announcement, I found out later.

People are complex and I‚Äôm not without my faults, so I looked past it, for the most part. But, growing up in a very conservative home, in a conservative community, and surrounded by mostly conservative friends, he‚Äôs fully caught in the bubble. 

He came out to his family during our relationship and it went surprisingly well. There was a lunch with his parents where he was arguing that because the intention of the civil rights law didn‚Äôt mean for sex to mean gender, it shouldn‚Äôt protect gay people. His dad had to call him out on it, telling him he should always look out for his interests. It‚Äôs hilarious because he‚Äôs abiding by the rule of law, but at the same time approves and supports whatever Trump does however unlawful it is. 

Now that things are pretty much indisputable when it comes to facts and Trump, I wanted to get his take. He studied polisci in a good Canadian uni and is about to graduate from law school. As usual, he backtracked, contradicted himself from earlier, and spun things with no logical basis. This really struck me and the next day I broke it off. We live/d together.

I really love the guy. He‚Äôs responsible, adorably timid, great in the sack, and a loyal family man. He doesn‚Äôt ever drink or do drugs. If it wasn‚Äôt for the Trump thing, he‚Äôd be quite the catch. He‚Äôs also insecure about himself, growing up trying to portray himself as straight to others. Which I can relate to and I sort of understand how this Trump thing is a show of strength.

He went home to his parents that day without seeing me in person, he didn‚Äôt want to see me move out. But, I explained to him yesterday that I didn‚Äôt give us a chance to look for a solution before I called it quits. I told him I‚Äôd like to try to see if we can somehow come to terms with things. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do. Sometimes I feel silly that I made a life decision based on politics. Other times, I‚Äôm ashamed myself for putting up with it. There‚Äôs times where he‚Äôs racist, but unconsciously; like he‚Äôd say that I‚Äôm not a real American and he is because Canadian culture is just like American culture. He believes that he‚Äôs supposed to look out for the survival of his culture. He stops short of saying white culture is superior. Shit, sometimes this horrifies me. The standard republican talking points nowadays.

We get along very well, we‚Äôve formed a life together, and we really only fight about politics. He‚Äôs very supportive and helpful as I am with him.

He‚Äôs coming back tomorrow. I asked him to talk before I move my things. They‚Äôre packed and ready. It‚Äôs incredibly confusing for me, and it almost seems like Trump took him away. My mom is very religious and I see an even more extreme cult phenomenon with him. I love him, and I know it‚Äôs hard to see someone you love get  involved in a cult.

I want him, but should I take him back if that‚Äôs proposed tomorrow? It feels like I‚Äôm betraying myself either way, destroying the life I had built one day to the next or accepting to be with someone who unconditionally follows duche con man Trump. But we do love and care for each other and that man will one day die (he‚Äôs old) or be imprisoned or something. Maybe he‚Äôll see the light soon?

There were a few other families that came over too, and the kids and the dads were on the couch watching the game. The host kept asking his son hard questions about the college that players and coaches attended, and he was almost always right. Then I asked out loud when the Super Bowl was and if our home team was going to be in it. My dad gave me this awful look of disappointment as the host‚Äôs kid answered both my questions

Let‚Äôs call him adam. I have a thing were  I don‚Äôt like being told no so I assume other people don‚Äôt either. So I was just agreeing with Dave. I forgot to mention that Adams cousin was talking with us to. So I was just agreeing with Dave even though I didn't. Adams cousin told Adam that i agreed with Dave. This led to a whole fight with me and Adam. Now my life is screwed up and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Adam has been my friend my whole life and I‚Äôm gonna be honest, sometimes he does annoy me. Call me a bad friend, but when ever I try to explain to him why I said it he doesn‚Äôt care.

233,"I developed a big crush on a girl I know. We are great friends and we game all the time. I enjoy her friendship more than anything. She's single but she's never seen me more than a friend. She use to know that I liked her but she thinks that I moved on from that crush. I did get over the crush but recently it came back and more than ever. I've only known her for a year and we've only hung out in person a handful of times.

I've started having dreams about her and I feel like that's really weird. I don't wanna weird her out. We get along very well, and we talk almost every day online. She usually doesn't find me too funny. She usually likes to correct me because I'll usually say insensitive things by making jokes. She'll usually say that it's racist, sexist or insensitive. Most of the time I'm just saying something off the top of my mind, and she'll just correct me. I'm not racist or sexist but she'll find some of the things I say as such. She's very PC. 

I don't live in the same city as her at the moment as I left for college. She really wants me to go back for the christmas break. I dont wanna go back to my hometown but she's making me wanna go back for a bit because she's just so cool, and I really wanna see her again because I like her. 

What should I do? Right now I feel it's best to try to get over the crush but I honestly have no idea how. Should I just suck it up. I thought about telling her but I dont wanna ruin the friendship or talk to her less. She's the nicest person I've ever met. She was also one of the few people that checked up on me when I was in a bad place in my head. She would even ask me if I've eaten. No one has ever checked up on me like that and its nice that she cares. She still asks me if I eat. Sometimes I'll say no because I'll get caught up with my schoolwork and tend to put off eating. When I tell her no she'll just call me stupid. I try my best to talk to her in a way where she shouldn't notice how I feel about her.",03Nov2019,1

Regardless of if the public shares this opinion, I always get weird looks when I get excited over a cute baby or a child who radiates innocence and potential to make the world a better, more innocent place. 

Am I being paranoid due to the narrow mindset of my mother, or should I be colder in the presence of children?

236,"Hey, so this is all a bit difficult to explain, and I'm kinda posting this at 1AM, so I apologize if it's a bit weird and rambly (and possibly slightly inaccurate, may correct myself later), but here goes:

So I have this friend. We'll call him... Turner (he's on reddit so there's a chance he's reading this but whatever). Turner has been a decent friend of mine for a while, but we've never been extremely close, considering he's not the most social guy overall. Lately I've been getting pretty worried about him for several reasons, including, but not limited to:

1. He's been rejected twice in a row within a very, very short timespan. These were both people he was very much interested in, perhaps a bit too much. It's clearly taken a toll on him.
2. Stuff he's let me know one way or another has led me to believe he's got some serious mental health issues. I don't think he's a serious danger to himself atm, but his family allegedly isn't really interested in getting him treatment, despite severe signs of depression. I'm no doctor, of course, but I've struggled with the same issues in the past, and I'm pretty sure I can pick up on it.
3. He's generally been pretty avoidant with talking about these issues. I mean, he normally isn't a guy to talk about his problems much, but this is worse than I've seen considering what he's dealing with.

Now there's definitely more, but that's all I can get off the top off my head. So considering al this, what should I do? Should I try to find a way to get him treatment? What if he continues to avoid talking about it? What if he begins avoiding me altogether (which I fear may be already
 happening? Help me out if you can, I'm a bit lost in all this.
 
Also, please keep in mind I'm really, really busy and have a lot of problems myself. I can't mentally or emotionally take the burden of everything, nor can I spend all of my time trying to fix things for him. Not that I don't care, it just wouldn't be feasible or healthy.",03Nov2019,1

239,"Okay, so back in early May of 2019 I made a comment on a post on r/lonely that wanted you to share some details about your self in hopes to make a online friend. Well I did that, and this girl was interested and wanted to chat. We chatted for a week or two before switching the conversation over to Discord. We talked almost every day and the conversations usually lasted for a good amount of time. We even shared our music playlists together and she even liked my music. Since she lived in California there was a three hour time difference from where I live so that did make things slightly complicated on when and how long we could conversate. Also another issue was with her always having homework or projects to do. I felt like this might have been an excuse that she wanted to stop talking or something, but I doubt it as she was the first girl I've talked to who would actually message me first a lot and would even ask me how my day was going and often sent me good morning and good night messages to me. Suffice to say, it really did feel like she cared about me to a good degree. The whole relationship if you will, started to take a decline as she stoped talking to me as much. Apparently it was due to finals and having projects to do, but I had some suspicion that it was because I wasn't as good looking as she might have hoped I was going to be (we shared pictures of each other even though I was very hesitant to do so). Because of my suspicions, and frequently bringing up the fact that we aren't talking nearly as much as we used to or in the way that we used to (I'm pretty sure she would flirt with me a lot), I started annoying her about it and I ended the relationship and stopped talking to her over it. Right before I did that, I asked her if there was even a point to this anymore (the relationship) after a few days of not talking and she told me that she'll move on with life (granted she told me in the past that she never wanted to depart). I deleted our conversation and unfriended her. I still kind of feel like I might have been used as somebody for her to talk to when she was alone or in a rut when her friends would treat her like an asshole and then finally dumped off when she didn't need me anymore. I know I should have not acted like a child and constantly ask her why she wasn't talking to me as much anymore, but I was nervous about the relationship tanking over that and wanted answers. The relationship ended in late June of 2019. I still have her Discord tag and Reddit username, so I could get back in touch if I wanted to and if she wanted to. I still think about her every so often to this day and wonder if my suspicions were correct and if she even had real feelings towards me as I did towards her. If she for some reason is reading this right now (for all I know she could be keeping tabs on my account) I wish you success in life and appreciated your company. I'm sorry if I hurt you although I kinda doubt it with that last response I got. So, should I try to get back into contact with her?",03Nov2019,1
240,"So a little background, my brother(11) whom I shall call Y, has an insatiable addiction to games. Ever since his exam has ended, he's hogged the ps4 to himself. 
This morning, he told my brother(8), Z, he wasn't allowed to play the ps4, which upon hearing he threw a fit. My father confiscated the controllers. Y couldn't find the controllers and threw a bag of food on the ground. Arguments between my mother and Y caused Y to pick up a knife. 
This threatening using a knife is the first time, but Y has a long history of provoking the family including constantly bullying Z, constantly being a pig on the sofa while making my mother do everything for him, causing my sister to be really pissed off, and constantly pissing off my father doing stuff like singing, smacking him, touching him. He has no eq at all and just doesn't care.
 He took a knife today, threatening my mother and brother Z. There was a glass door between us(the link between the living room to the kitchen) which kept us safe.

241,"I am a straight man. A few years ago I was sexually assaulted, or I guess raped. I was forced to have a man‚Äôs penis inside of my mouth, and I could do nothing but accept it out of fear of what might happen if I tried to do anything. I have never in my life told anybody about this. 

Recently I was told by someone that they thought I‚Äôd only be useful as a cum dumpster. That‚Äôs how little they thought of me. Because of that experience years ago, being told that really struck me hard. I told my closest friends about it, and they told me I shouldn‚Äôt be taking it too seriously. But the thing is, they don‚Äôt know why it hurt me so badly. They don‚Äôt know I was raped. 

I feel like I should tell them I was assaulted so that they can understand why those words impacted me so much, but I don‚Äôt know how to tell them. It‚Äôd be the first time telling anyone really. I‚Äôm afraid of what they‚Äôll think when I tell them. What should I do?",03Nov2019,8

245,"Background knowledge in case it matters: 

I‚Äôm an 18 year old girl from South-East Asia. I am from a middle-income family and have never done anything rebellious in my life, like smoking, taking drugs, staying out later than 10 pm even when I don‚Äôt have a curfew. Never dated, never kissed, never had sex, never talked to the opposite gender for more than 10 minutes. I guess the only rebellious thing I do is procrastinating. My mom used to be a tiger mom but has calmed down for the past 7 years (meaning she‚Äôs less restrictive and strict). She doesn‚Äôt really have friends, she says her friends are us. My dad is away at work most of the time and is very mild when facing my mom. He is the most social social butterfly I know and gets along with his superiors and the people working for him. Both my parents are very strong-minded people in the sense that take no shit from outsiders. I personally want to be like them.

I have a younger brother, age 16, and a younger sister, age 10. My younger brother is another social butterfly and he is constantly the leader of many class projects or events. He is also very smart and understands concepts many times quicker than me. Great memory, remember almost everything that happens. My younger sister used to be like a tiny reporter when she was 4 and would question us constantly ‚ÄúWhat are you doing‚Äù ‚Äúwhere did you go‚Äù ‚Äúwhen are you coming back‚Äù. So she usually is the one who knows everything that‚Äôs going on in the family. She used to be a tiny boss but has become much milder now. She has a great memory towards things she care about. She often has a tsundere image, inside she‚Äôs ecstatic you‚Äôre here but she plain out ignores you on the outside. Then she gets sad when other kids don‚Äôt like her. But I did tell her that this is wrong so she‚Äôs doing it much less now. And probably another social butterfly in the making. 

I‚Äôm not the smartest, but definitely not dumb. I‚Äôm pretty introverted. The number of friends I‚Äôve had over my entire life can be counted on one hand. I can‚Äôt carry a conversation at all. When I go out with anyone that is not my direct family or close relatives, I get emotionally tired after two hours and just want to hole up in my room for the rest of the day. 

Now I‚Äôve recently been noticing something off about me. I think I first noticed it about two years back, but didn‚Äôt think much about it. Two years back, when I graduated from secondary school, my friend told me about the class all hating on our teacher. I remember I used to be scared shitless when that teacher first became our math teacher in Year 3 as I‚Äôve heard rumours that she was extremely fierce. Then, slowly, I became to like her as she made it a monthly thing to celebrate the students‚Äô birthday and give us each a notebook. Though I didn‚Äôt get one as my birthday month is also exam month. She cared about any conflicts that‚Äôs been going on in class. She was attentive. She was nice.

After graduation, my friend mentioned that that math teacher was not liked at all by the class. I didn‚Äôt even know and my friend was surprised, saying that she though everyone knew. Apparently the math teacher looked down on students who came from overseas and constantly made things difficult. She had a lot of biases and even picked on many students in front of the entire class. I didn‚Äôt really notice and didn‚Äôt believe my friend at first. There wasn‚Äôt much evidence. But after a while, I kept thinking about it and agreed with her. I thought, maybe I‚Äôm really unobservant and don‚Äôt really care about my surroundings. Which is true, to be honest. I lived in my cousin‚Äôs house for a while and my aunt bought a table and placed it in the living room while I was living there. When they asked me whether I thought it looked good, I just looked at them in confusion and said ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt this already here?‚Äù So yeah.

In my current school, I attend an afterschool activity. There was a girl, I‚Äôll call her A, she held an important leadership position. She is very outgoing and talks loudly. She seemed very popular. I look up to popular people because they seem very charismatic, something I‚Äôm not.

Then an acquaintance was talking about how A was hated. I still don‚Äôt even know why till now, but now I dislike her.

Now the thing that brought this problem to my attention only happened two months ago. It‚Äôs so ridiculous. I always bought bubble tea from a particular shop. It‚Äôs a popular chain and it‚Äôs close to my house. One day, my dad bought one of their recommended drinks (fruit tea) and told me he hated it and he had thrown it away after drinking half of it. I just told him maybe he bought the wrong drink, I‚Äôve never tried their fruit tea either. 

But now I don‚Äôt buy from stall anymore either. I somehow dislike it now. Just because my dad mentioned that it was bad.

Is this a personality disorder?",03Nov2019,1
246,"I don't know where shes gone. She has not been active on social media in at least a week.
She has not contacted me at all.
None of her profiles are showing any activity.
I have contacted her Facebook friends (I'm not mutual with any of them.) None of them will respond to me either.

Our last conversation was a fight, unfortunately. She was calling me a control freak because I didn't want her to go to Mckamey Manor.

She had been on this self destructive binge since a good friend of hers died, started drifting away from me and snapping at me a lot. I tried being there but she's not the type to talk about issues, shes the type to lash out at you if you ask if theres a problem and then get upset when you try to convince her NOT to destroy herself.

We had just gotten engaged, it felt way too soon but part of me thought I could fix her the closer together we were and I didn't want to just say no. I wanted to hold off the marriage for a few years.

 I don't know what to do. I don't live with her and I don't live near her.
I've been checking the news in her area for any reports of someone missing or something happening because lately she's been with the wrong crowd and had already nearly been arrested.

Honestly, things started off wonderfully but she has brought so much drama and pain into my life. The last time this happened she was baker acted but at least she had told me before she went in. The time before, she was in the hospital after provoking a cop and getting beaten up.

It's really hard to be with her. Its like being with two people. One person is this sweet, loving human, the other is this fireball that can't be tamed.

I don't want to be with her anymore, I can't handle the stress and I don't think I can be what she needs me to be. I just want her to be okay.",03Nov2019,16

251," 

Well a few weeks ago I and my mother got into a big nasty argument because my grandmother just had cancer surgery and that night my Grandmother requested to see me personally, it was around 9:00 pm when I learned that my grandmother wanted to see me which tugged at my heartstrings so I asked my mother could she drive me to the hospital and she said no because my grandmother would be sleeping at the time, so I was very emotional and I asked her to provide a Uber ride for me because I didn't have money at the time she refused so I decided to walk the hospital it was only a 2.2 mile hike away.

So as I am walking I call my mother to let her know what street I was on and it turns out my GPS was sending me in the wrong direction and she came and picked me up and drove me to the hospital, during the drive we are arguing because she says I have no sense of direction and what not and I told her I really didn't want to hear her bickering at the time so please just take me to the hospital.

So when we leave the hospital my mother is really cussing me out she called me a Dumb Stupid MFer about 10 times because I was walking in the wrong direction and I just snapped and I yelled all of this could have been avoided if you would have driven me to the hospital or loaned me 20 dollars for an Uber ride you B--TH and it broke her heart she said don't call your mother a B---H and I said that's what you are acting like right now and we started crying and were silent for the rest of the way.

When we got home she went off the deep end and threatened to stab me and everything imaginable and as of today I think she hates me, when I called her a B--TCH I was very heartbroken and emotional because my grandmother requested to see me after a serious surgery and I thought my mother would understand how that would make me feel and take me to go see her but instead she said she was tired and my grandmother would be sleeping and my grandmother was up reading the newspaper the whole time and was doing well and delighted to see me.

So had a letter come through the door saying the tax office had re-calculated my tax rebate wrong and that I owed them nearly ¬£500 as a result, payable by 31st January 2019. 

I only earn ¬£20,000 a year as a auxiliary nurse for NHS so finding ¬£500 is going to take me working 5 extra shifts to make the money back.

259,"This has been on my mind for a while and I really want to talk about it! Kind of a longer one cause I have lots of feelings on this. 

So over the last year and a half there's been 3 guys. The first one, we started dating, but promptly broke it off because we realised we didn't actually like each other. Long story. Anyways, something I remember was that we were sitting in a hammock together and our faces were pretty close, and his eyes are those strikingly blue colour and I told him, ""Your eyes are beautiful,"" and he said, ""Thanks?"" and seemed kind of put off. It bummed me out. I asked him why he seemed uncomfortable and he said the word choice was too feminine. I didn't know what to say because I didn't know what other word to use. 

The second guy, I told him his eyes were beautiful, and he had that same, ""Thanks?"" response. (I swear I don't have a thing for eyes, these are just the main points.) I told him his eyes reminded me of the amber coloured stained glass mural in the church that we attend, and he said, ""Alrighty then."" It was really sarcastic and I just felt even weirder about it and that ""relationship"" dwindled out quickly.

The third guy handles my comments even worse. We were having a heart-to-heart recently and I told him that he made me feel like I was *home* when I was with him, and he said, ""Umm... Okay. I don't know what that means."" I felt so crushed. Another time we were having a heart-to-heart and I told him that he makes my heart feel like the colour of the sunset when it's the softest orange before it's blue, we were on a walk so I actually pointed at it and he just said ""That doesn't really make sense."" 

I just feel so crushed whenever I vocalise my feelings. I always feel like I'm holding back. I have a journal where I scratch down these kinds of things because I feel like the people that they're directed at think they're creepy. I want to say things like ""The way you laugh makes me feel like those high notes of Claire de Lune,"" but I don't know how *else* to say it.

261,"I'm in a confusing and emotional state at the moment. Here is my situation:

Last year, I moved to a different, bigger, way better town. The amount of things I can do for fun around is great. The mountains are close by, bigger and better parks, and more places to eat and go shopping at. The thing is, I've been feeling more and more lonely. I've been experiencing all these new things alone, which is fine, but it's starting to wear off. I've tried to get coworkers to go out with me, but it seems they're just there to be work friends. I even tried social apps, and none have worked out. It's difficult to make friends with other's at new places once you're finished with schooling.

Now the town I moved from was my hometown, which is 6+ hours away. I lived since birth for 20 years. I visited my hometown and stayed for a week, twice in one year, and now, I'm starting to realize what I've had back there: My people. My best friends. I recently visited again, and when I was driving back where I live now, I got very emotional. I started to realize what I've left behind and noticed just how much they miss me, and how much I mean to them. Other's even got emotional from me leaving.

I also have a friend there offering me to come back and I could stay at a pretty nice place to stay at. He's also offering me a full-time job just at, sadly, 9.00$, but I could work my way up easily there with prior experience. 

I have a co-worker that's transferring to another job, so she's closer to home and school, but she's not exactly excited or happy about it. She told me that she doesn't enjoy the people there and she's going to get a totally different job. When I asked her why, to keep it short, she basically told me that it's the people who make you stay at your work place. Of all her thoughts she told me, it really made me think about my friends and the town I'm living in.

I've been having these thoughts more and more often, but I'm not entirely sure what I should do and what I should go after. Of course, if I talk to my friends about this, they'll beg for me to come back, but I'm seeking some good advice. Should I keep living in this new town that I enjoy all alone, or should I move back and be close to the people who made my life worth living?

I have a friend, that makes everuthing about her life seem very dramatic and only talks about herself. I was feeling really sad one day, she knew that and texted me that I annoy her, and I asked why. She answeard with ""you're in a bad mood"" and I am not the kind of person to talk about my feelings, but I thought that I should open up more, so I began to tell her why I was in a bad mood, she answeard with ""well fucking watch a good movie idk! It's ok to be sad, but you need to fucking sort things out"" I told her ""look who is talking"" and that she can't just tell people to watch a movie when they tell her that they are sad. (She got out of a relationship a month ago and the whole month she ONLY talked about that) She said ""just let me know when I can talk to you, until then I let you to cry alone"". The next day I confronted her about that, she apologized, and things turned out to be exactly the same as before. I really don't know what to do about that, I am still mad at her, but I miss her, we were friends for 7 years, and best friends for the last year. Should I forgive her, or not?",03Nov2019,1
265,"I just turned 23. It was a normal day. Nobody wished me. Nobody remembered. It just reinforced how big of a loser I am. 

I am in a shitty job that has long hours so I can't really focus on building skills during the week. I try it on the weekend but it usually flies by without I having done anything.

 People constantly look down on me, it's not in my head btw. I am a very ugly person too. When I try hard to improve my looks, like spend an hour a day on makeup, I turn out looking below average at best. 

Sometimes I feel like the universe is conspiring against me like how I can be brought down every day. 

I tried going to therapy too. But the therapists in my country are all people who just want money without really listening to their clients. So therapy is out of the question too.

How do I get by in this life happily for once?",03Nov2019,1
267,"I am pretty insecure about being smart/capable and have always been told I'm too sensitive toward jokes at my expense/being singled out and made fun of. I know I can handle well meaning teasing but sometimes jokes affect me, or I don't know if the person is joking and get hurt. 

Someone I was seeing joked a bit about me being ""dumb"". He has now made it clear he doesn't think I am but early on he'd say things like ""If you actually understood molecules maybe you'd understand determinism"" when we were discussing it (because I'm not a STEM major) and then was like ""I think we have different understandings of what determinism is"". He once made a series of jokes about not being sure if I was dumb or not - ""I'm not convinced you're not..."". I guess it could just be his way of being playful but it made me upset and tired. He made a joke(?) about thinking I'd get mixed up about how to take my own birth control so he double checked with a female friend that I was doing it right and used to call me weird/autistic a lot. Like a LOT and in moments where I was just being myself. I can handle being called weird but it was a fucking LOT. I'll tell him a story and he'll say something about how when women tell stories they're leaving out details and blah blah when I just want to be heard and acknowledged. Instead of sharing his opinions in response to mine he'll just be like ""that's a pretty basic argument"" which I feel isn't bad, it's just honesty in discussion and not personal and I'd say similar things to him so idk why that hurt. I don't need everyone to agree with me of course.. 

I've definitely projected my own insecurity onto him but I don't feel cut down by everyone all the time. Maybe just a matter of incompatibility and he's better off with someone who is more into that kind of banter. His communication style has really exhausted me because it's like there's always a joke at my expense to respond to and it's fucking boring. I can't think of the ""best"" examples especially cos a lot of our early time together was spent drunk, but a good chunk of our interactions are just me defending myself or rolling my eyes. I know I'm not humourless and definitely need a thicker skin in general,but fuck seriously so much of our interaction was me putting myself down in response to him putting me down/joking",03Nov2019,1
268,"I think this started a couple of years but I have only realised it in the last few months but basically I have lost interest in all my hobbies like gaming, films, TV, drawing &amp; sports. I still do most of these things but its like I watch a TV show because I already started it, I play a game cos I already bought it on Steam, draw cos of my college work **not because I enjoy** **them** but I don't necessarily hate them either there just, meh. The amount of times I saw a trailer for a new game, bought it, played it, quickly lost interest in it, then proceeded to play it since I already through money at it is just sad at this point.

I do not like anything a part from laying in bed. I have tried new things like music (i didn't really listen to music before) and gym but even with those I don't enjoy them like i'll listen to music cos it makes time go fast and am constantly changing artists and genres. I'll go to the gym 4-5 days a week to stay fit but that's a hobby I don't really enjoy.

270,"I ordered something back in June off of the Super Groupies website. Because it would be an international order (I live in US and it would ship from Japan), it would go through the website Worldshopping.

Because I realized that I no longer want/need what I ordered (and also don't want to pay that much money), I tried to cancel the order. On their website, it says they have a ""no cancelation"" policy which has me freaking out.

271,"Just recently I got back in contact with a girl I talked to a few years back. We hung out and I noticed she wasn't really messaging as promptly as she was before we hung out. I thought it was because she was busy and maybe I was texting her too much so I said my two cents (I basically said that I noticed she was texting less frequently and asked her if I was texting too much and that I could stop if she wanted me to). She later confessed to me that she's not really ready to be close friends and that she has trust issues due to friendships in the past.

When I found out, I told her that I understood what she was going through and said she can do this and that I always considered her a close friend and I meant it and I asked her if there was anything I could do to help. She said thank you to me, but then she said she didn't want a ""forced friendship''.

At this point, I am confused as to where I should go from here. On one side, I don't want to keep bothering her if she truly doesn't want to be my friend. On the other side, I don't want to abandon her to confirm that her suspicion is true--. In general, I want to help her without being her therapist and have fun together as close friends. With that being said, we seem to be communicating less and less, and I don't know if she'll ever talk to me again if it continues like this. What do I do!?",03Nov2019,1
272,"i have these two friends that i‚Äôve been close friends with for 8 years, ever since the beginning of high school. they‚Äôve always been close to each other but at the same time we were a little trio

basically two weeks ago my 2 close friends went and hung out with each other by themselves. basically it‚Äôs always been us three, and i never invite one without inviting the other. 

i felt a little mugged off so i asked another friend of mine (my actual childhood best friend) as to whether or not i should talk to them about it and she said yes of course. the advice she gave me is that if they were truly my close friends then they would be ok with talking about it with me and i agreed. 

i very civilly talked to one of the girls about it and essentially she said it was a last minute plan, THEN said that i never told her what days of the week i was free (this is because i talked to her a few days before about going out to eat). it really felt like she was trying to blame me for not inviting me. 

i basically asked her what that had to do with her not inviting me and she ignored me completely for two weeks. completely ghosted my message, hasn‚Äôt been talking to me on social media or sending me anything. i had my law school admission test this week and we had both been slicing away at this exam for about a year and she didn‚Äôt even wish me good luck, or ask me how the exam went, or anything. it‚Äôs almost like she‚Äôs ignoring me because i decided i felt close enough to talk to her about something that was bothering me. the other one if my friends hasn‚Äôt been responding to me either. 

i really have no idea what i did wrong? they have always been very close for years and sometimes i felt like a third wheel around them. i‚Äôm kind of stuck in a position where i DO genuinely like them as friends, and ever since i moved back to college i haven‚Äôt really had friends from my hometown here any more. at the same time i don‚Äôt really want to be treated like dirt just because i felt comfortable enough to talk to them about something that was bothering me. 

Anyways now they are posting photos of both of them hanging out together on social media and it‚Äôs honestly just irked the shit out of me, seeing them and they just completely leave me out of plans and ignore the shit out of me for no reason. i really want to get this off my chest and tell them how annoyed and upset i am with them but everyone is telling me that i should hold off.

I have so little hope for myself. I‚Äôve been thinking about killing myself for the past 7 hours and it‚Äôs not new, probably the 10000th time I‚Äôve thought about it for a long duration of time.

279,"I just gave a really bad power point presentation at my college. My power point was just blocks of text that I read off of really fast because I was so nervous.

280,"I'm kind of a mess right now. I'm sick of changing between jobs I hate. I'm 28, and I feel like I've wasted so much of my life, not achieving any goals I had when I was in my late teen years. Before, I thought that something would stick and I'd be in that job for a few years while saving for the one thing that I want the most (own business or continue studies). But I usually got bored of the job within 6-7 months and had a new one in line and the cycle repeats. 

I worked mostly in customer service &amp; sales before (retail, restaurant, real estate) for about 6 years. But those aren't my type of thing. I'm actually an extreme introvert. I'm deathly afraid of people but I just suck it up and do it. I can do customer service a bit as it is quite routine but not sales very much (I do get lucky sometimes, but I cant rely on it). I only applied for those jobs because I don't think I can get the ones that I want as I didn't have the education for it, which comes from my root problem: I don't know what to choose. I didn't further my studies because I simply didnt know what major to take. And also because I didn't want to add any unnecessary debts when I didnt know what to study in the first place. 

Here's the thing; I like a lot of things. Like, A LOT. And sometimes I feel like I want to do and achieve ALL of them. Here's a list: fashion, science, architecture, coding/programming, web design/development and writing. I also want to improve a lot of things in my country but first and foremost, developing better public transportation and build more bicycle lanes &amp; pedestrian sidewalks in my country (we rely too much on cars). I hate it. But I don't know how to go about achieving that. I can't even walk or cycle a small distance without feeling safe from too much vehicles around. 

Anyway, I probably like fashion the most. I really love clothes, styling people and stuff and I think that I actually have the skills for it (just not the education) but I'm also constantly thinking about the earth and the future. I'm a science &amp; science-fiction junkie, I like outer space, machines, technology, dinosaurs etc, and I watch a lot of shows/movies related to them, but I'm not gifted at all in maths. If I do decide to continue in this, I really think that I can work harder to understand maths. If I pursue fashion tho, I'm thinking of combining something like wearable sci-fi/geeky clothing (I love these) which not many people have done. The thing I'm concerned with fashion, even though I'm very passionate about it, is that a lot of people are already doing it and we don't need more clothes produced unnecessarily. We already have a lot of it. I don't want to contribute to more pollution. I want to do something more useful for the earth and for the people. As I stated above I watch a lot of sci-fi movies/shows (usually in the future), there's always a scenario which there were less resources available so those not needed are usually gotten rid of. The ones kept are the ones like doctors, engineers, etc aka the ones that keep it going. I want to be one of them. I want to feel like I am useful. I always have this scene in mind, so I thought about this wherever I go. 

As for the other interests, I probably like them all equally. 

\- Architecture: cause my country has ugly, all the same, uncreative, uninspiring buildings with stupid floor plans and idiotic exterior plans (neighbourhood/town plans) that always result in major parking problems, I think I have much better ideas. 

\- Coding/Programming: I do love feeling like a hacker lol. And feeling like I could create anything from scratch. 

\- Web Design/Dev: Did these when I was younger before, loved it, would like to do it for a living but I only know HTML &amp; CSS. 

\- Writing (English): I've written tons of blogs before and will probably continue regardless and I think I can write fairly ok and I have an epic fantasy/sci-fi story that I have been developing in my head for around 6-7 years. I just needed to fill the plot holes and other details, which I'm not sure I can squeeze my brain for. Also thought about doing educational childrens book in my native language since I think we dont have much of those. 

I'm really conflicted right now. Sometimes I feel like, screw it, just do it and then when you're successful enough, you can afford to change or add the other things you want to do. But then again, what do I START with? 

What do you think?",03Nov2019,2

 these messages are from simple threats of physical violence to threats of killing me/the people around me. i'm almost 100% these messages are from him and his friends to try and intimidate and instill fear or something, but they're just high school seniors. this has been going on for about a week, most recently they've sent me this email with a bunch of ""information"", like my SSN, my address, my number, etc. half of this info is completely wrong, and the right parts they got from my brother

originally i thought it was just empty threats, but they seem pretty insistent on the whole thing, and i am worried something will happen to my mom/younger sister while i am away at college and i'm not there to help

they've started showing up at my door back home and putting the ""threatening"" messages in the mailbox, which just tells me they're trying to push the lines, and i have no doubt that my brother would unlock the front door and let some idiots into the house to smash shit up. 

when i went to the local police precinct they said that they cant do anything because we cant prove its some high school idiots (not sure why that's our job) and they can take a report (also not sure what this does to stop a crime), but that's really it

Other than this our relationship is great and I'm not after any relationship advice just a good excuse or reason for this purchase.",03Nov2019,1
300,"I desperately need advice or help to determine if my tragic incident is normal and I should let it go or if it really is an unjust situation I should look more into.

In 2015 my 16 month old baby girl drowned at an in home daycare.  Apparently the lady was in her garden picking vegetables when my daughter climbed up the ladder of a 24' by 52"" above ground pool and fell in and the daycare worker did not notice until it was too late.  

We also found out that the lady had too many children in her care at the time and this not the first time she has done this.  The department of human services found her to be neglectful and told her she can never have a registered daycare.  We then found out that in our state of Iowa, you are not required to register your in home daycare .  This meant this lady CAN still have a daycare and was rumored to still be watching children.  Upset by these findings, we asked the district attorney if she was going to file charges and she stated she saw nothing wrong and it was just an accident.  We also found out the sheriff's office did not really do an investigation.

We contacted the state's attorney disciplinary board and was told I have to respect the decision of the county attorney.  We then reached out to senator Grassley and was told there was nothing he could do.  We did not know where else to go.

Then the medical and funeral bills came.  We had assumed her insurance would cover the cost but got denied.  We were unaware that in Iowa, in home daycares are NOT required to have insurance.  The bills were higher than what we paid for our house.  I was never a big fan of suing but if we didn't, we would have to file for bankruptcy. 

The lawsuit dragged on for over a year until we came to the point that it was hard to pay for our basic needs like food and shelter.  We were told that if we took the case to court, we would most likely end up with nothing because they would file for bankruptcy.  So we reluctantly agreed to the settlement just so we could pay for food and pay back some of the bills.  The settlement amount was 1/3 of the cost of just the medical bills.

Our family is trying to get back on our feet but to be honest, we are really struggling.  I feel so defeated and like a failure.  My life and mentality have been so warped that I now cannot tell if this is something that I should or should not complain about.  I would really appreciate others opinions and feelings on this.",03Nov2019,955

302,"Ok, first off, I am sixteen and a girl. Sorry for english, ain't my first language.

Last month, I had accidentally send a wrong picture text at one of my classmate. It said something about having a crush. He blew up and cursed at me. I was shocked and quickly defend myself saying that it was an accident but I didn't swear. I top it all off with a ""grow up and act like someone with a brain"". The fact that he didn't question me first before blew up on me made me so mad. I admit that it is my fault that I didn't check it again because I had to do some chores and didn't have time to check the phone again. He blocked me.(not surpised but I was about to block him) Then, the first day back at school, he kept glaring me with death stare and kept insulting me with his friends. I just glared back, avoid eye contact and pretend like he doesn't exist.

This is where the problem comes rolling in. A week after furious glaring war between us, he just looks at me normally and even I look back at him, he just looks away. I was weird out but just shrugged it out. My friend had pointed it out that he had look at me a couple of time and when he caught by friend, he just look at my friend and look away. I just laugh it off. One time, we were in the meeting room inside my school library watching presentions. He made an obnoxious joke and almost all my classmate laughed. My friend laughed the loudest and he quickly turn around and looked me like I was the one laughing. I was daydreaming at that time and wasn't really paying any attention. I only noticed that he look at me when my friend who was laughing pokes me and said that he was looking at me. I just ignore it and continue daydreaming. The another time, it was art class. We had to paint some fruits using watercolors and stuff. It was a messy job but I was the only one who had a pack of tissues. A lot of my classmate end up using a lot of my tissues until it had all gone. I didn't care because I have a lot of tissues. Suddenly, P's (the classmate I have the problem with) friend pokes me and asks me for some tissues. I just shrugged and pointed at the empty pack. I don't if he looked at me or even glance at the empty pack but he said ""Come on dude, P wants use it. He had some paint at his arm."" At the point P spoke up and said ""Stop bothering her or else she will get mad."" softly then went to the bathroom with his friend. I just shrugged it out and continue painting because I had the correct shade of bananas lol and was proud of it. Also, another time is that his friend from the another class came to our class to gather some donations. He came to table to table and I was doing something else at that time so I who was feeling generous at the time, confidently turn around to the boy. That is when I realized that he was at the table with P. The dude realised that I was looking at them and quickly smile and poke P saying ""Hey it's her."" P ignore him and continue sleeping. I just got annoyed and turn back around.

The pay is good and hours aren't rough, but I absolutely HATE coding. I always knew this in the back of my mind but because of external pressure and financial reasons chose to pursue the job anyways. 

I'm the type of person who feels fulfilled through human interaction, so this job is literally killing my soul. I rarely talk to people and instead spend most of my time in front of a screen.

I also have a side gig going on that requires me to interact socially. This gig should be able to support me in a few years (2-3 I hope). Here's where my dillema lies - my day job is ruining my side gig and I need to quit sooner rather than later for my sanity. That being said, I need to have some job to support myself while I work on my side gig. A job that will pay the bills AND allow me to socially interact.

I am so conflicted cause sometimes they make me feel like shit without them knowing but ive shared a lot of good memories with them and for the most part i enjoy chillin with them and somewhat contributing to their passion of music.

315,"My life for the past year has been consumed by my constant use/abuse of alcohol, drugs, breaking the law etc. I'm at a point now where I realise I am throwing my life away and have little hope for the future.  I don't know how I can turn myself around and try to shape up for later in life, because currently I am really struggling to see my future. (I'm not suicidal in anyway btw)

I used to be a straight A's student. I made the top classes and put an effort into school. I had good relationships with my family and had things going for me such as football which I was good at. My whole life up until recently has been pretty good -- I was brought up well and haven't had many issues. 

Things started going bad in January of this year. I was out with mates and we were going to a shop to buy vapes (they were heaps popular at the time). I kept coming back to buy more (they were disposable vapes) and had spent around $80  after a few weeks. I guess I got adrenaline or something from vaping (its illegal u18) and from here I started sneaking beers out of the wine fridge at home. Maybe 1 or 2 few weeks. At this time, my behaviour at school was deteriorating. I would always turn up late to class, give attitude to teachers etc. I had 17 detentions by the end of the first semester. 

Over the summer I got into cigarettes and would have 3 or 4 every day. Sometimes I'd go out with my girlfriend and we'd go through a pack while drinking on the beach till 3am in the morning. Then I'd come home and sleep till 12pm. My girlfriend got weed off her brother and we'd smoke it together. I think this was the gateway for me to get into more hardcore drugs. I started doing caps and then acid and poppers. I tried ket once but it must've been laced because I had a really bad trip and was paralysed for an hour or two afterwards. This experience put me off hard drugs and I've been mostly clean for 2 or so months now. During all this I've been going to parties and getting wasted.

I'm barely passing school now and have been suspended twice. 

Its been really easy for me to do all this as my dad travels a lot for work and is constantly overseas. My mum also works full time. I have an older brother who is the complete opposite of me, so my parents don't suspect anything. 

I've tried getting help from a counsellor over a phone call, but they said they were reporting what I said to the police. I've been in trouble with the police before (shoplifting and getting caught with drugs and alcohol).

Its really common for kids my age to be drinking, doing drugs etc. I know heaps of people who do similar things to me. 

This is my attempt at trying to turn my life around. I hope this is the right place to post.",03Nov2019,0
316,"I want to start by giving a quick backstory. My dad died of a heart attack when I was really really young. Ever since then she hasn‚Äôt been the same. She‚Äôs severely depressed but won‚Äôt admit it or get help. Also is overweight but NOT super obese. Everyday she lays on the couch and goes on her phone. Nothing else. Only gets up for food, bathroom breaks, and to drive me to and from where I need to go. Never leaves the house for herself or goes out with friends either. Also no exercise at all not even walking unless it‚Äôs to do the things listed above. That‚Äôs it. Now on to the story.

My mom refuses to eat anything remotely healthy. Every time I try to offer her something that‚Äôs not artery-clogging she declines. Every time I try to tell her (in the nicest way possible) that maybe she should try to eat healthier, she freaks out and starts verbally abusing me. Calling me a bitch, saying that I‚Äôm an ‚Äúevil awful daughter‚Äù, and also does not believe that I‚Äôm trying to help her either. She legitimately says that I‚Äôm only saying that to her to ‚Äúruin her meals‚Äù and to ‚Äúput her down‚Äù. A lot of other nasty things are said too but that‚Äôs the gist of it.

No exaggeration at all, every single meal she eats HAS to have some sort of animal product in it. And most of it is processed meat or cheese or carbs or an excess amount of sugar. I‚Äôm talking fried eggs + hot dogs for breakfast every morning, greasy pizza for lunch and then a tortilla with butter for dinner. Also she usually drinks punch or super sugary soda with every meal. She‚Äôs literally killing herself.

What worries me the most is the fact that she hasn‚Äôt been to a doctor in 6+ years. Her cholesterol alone must be through the roof. Hell, she could even have diabetes or heart disease for all I know. And that scares me a lot especially since my dad passed away from a heart attack.

Even growing up she only fed me unhealthy shit or got me fast food every fucking day after school. Never encouraged sports or exercise. Never encouraged healthy eating. I was chubby til high school where I took my first nutrition/health class. 

This past year or two she‚Äôs been complaining about frequent dizzy spells, being out of breath, constant exhaustion. Also only breathes out of her mouth (super heavily, might I add). 
Gee I wonder why? What ever could be causing this?? .-.

I‚Äôve literally been trying to help her for years now and she still doesn‚Äôt fucking listen to me. Still doesn‚Äôt believe me that I‚Äôm trying to be nice &amp; have her best interest (aka living) at heart. I offer to take her on walks around the block, to let me cook/try some healthier alternatives, to take her to a vegan/health based restaurant. Nothing. She doesn‚Äôt fucking listen. 

And the worst part is she‚Äôs extremely controlling and doesn‚Äôt let me eat the way I want to either. She insists on doing all the grocery shopping and always buys junk. Then I feel terrible for wasting it so I have to eat whatever she buys. It sucks because I‚Äôm afraid of turning into her. Sometimes there‚Äôs veggies in the house or fruit bc I bug her about it but even then I‚Äôm forced to eat all of her shit that SHE chooses. I‚Äôve tried asking to go vegan or vegetarian but she just makes fun of me, verbally abuses me, or refuses to drive me to a health foods store/ let me pick vegan stuff at our normal grocery store bc ‚Äúit‚Äôs too expensive‚Äù or ‚Äúbeing vegan won‚Äôt let you get protein!!111‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm 19F and still live at home. Can‚Äôt drive either. I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôll become just like her. As of rn I‚Äôm at a pretty healthy weight. I worry about my own heart every fucking day but I‚Äôm also stuck in her mess too. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Any advice is appreciated. I feel trapped in a cycle of abuse and unhealthy-ness &amp; it needs to stop.",03Nov2019,1

319,"So, I am a Sophomore, and there is this girl, a Freshman, that I'm honestly not into, but I think she might be into me, but I also think I'm being paranoid. btw, I've never had a girlfriend, and I don't know how to do this sort of thing, so I'm hoping you guys can help.

Exhibit A: she sometimes looks over at me. I had thought this was one of those things where you're just looking around aimlessly, and if you make eye contact with someone, you instantly look away for... Some reasons. Anyways, that's what I thought at first, but then I realized it started to happen too often to be a coincidence. And recently I started to do this; once I look away like I would normally do, I looked back with the corner of my eye, and she's still looking at me. Now she isn't putting on any face of sorts, just blank. Not a smile, a frown, or hardly even neutral. Just blank.

Exhibit B: Our history is not necessarily the best. In the past (like, elementary), I haven't liked her much, and I'm sure the same went for her. She was somewhat mean, although she's had family issues, so I forgive her especially since we've both grown up since then. Speaking of growing up...

Exhibit C: As I said, we've both grown up, and as we grow up, we mature, some more than other, but since we've matured, our feelings or options of each other can change. I can think of a few people that I didn't like or they didnt like me in the past but that has changed to us being good friends today because we've grown up(some; still not an adult yet)

Exhibit D: So as I said, I'm not entirely into her. I'm not saying she's not a bad person or unattractive, it's just that I don't think that we'd be a good match. However, I would be willing to possibly give it a try. But, like I said, I don't know if I'm being paranoid or what, and I don't want to embarrass myself.

So redditors, what do you all think. Am I just being paranoid, or might she be into me?",03Nov2019,3
320,"We lost my dad to a motorcycle accident a few years ago, leaving my mom to take care of me and my younger brother, he‚Äôs 14 I‚Äôm 16. Tho we both can be difficult, my brother more so, but my mom‚Äôs doing an amazing job. 

(Just for context I‚Äôm an asexual panromantic girl with a tomboy-ish style) Every now and then there are these moments where my mom says something and I don‚Äôt know what to say or how to react. Like, she‚Äôll comment something nasty about a persons appearance or voice. Or say something unbelievably close minded, and when I point it out she brushes it off. I know this is pretty minor and it could be much worse, but I‚Äôll never forget when I first told her I got a girlfriend and her response was ‚Äúare you sure?‚Äù. At first I didn‚Äôt quite register what she meant so I just said ‚Äúyeah‚Äù but looking back on it now, I don‚Äôt know how to feel.

It‚Äôs not that she‚Äôs not supportive, because she is, it‚Äôs just this underlying tone that I can‚Äôt quite put a word to. It makes me a bit nervous and uncomfortable. And I guess the moment that really prompted this was when we were watching an artist I really like, and because of the music vid and her lyrics my mom said ‚Äúshe almost seems like a man-hater‚Äù. And that threw me off, because she sings about female empowerment but says nothing that warrants being called a man-hater.

324,"Title really explains it all but I‚Äôll give some context. But before I start I want to preface this with that my husband is wonderful, loving, supportive and truly an amazing husband and father. He works very hard to not only provide for our family but also be supportive and engaged with our family‚Äôs life. I couldn‚Äôt ask or want anyone better fitted for me in a life partner. 

That being said, I have always wrestled with depression, albeit successfully where it didn‚Äôt really interfere much with my life or functioning besides the errant self depreciating thought here and there (some other more physical symptoms in the winter but manageable). Since having kids, my mental health has declined in that I‚Äôve never had anxiety in the way that I have before and depression that can sometimes be SCARY. When my second kiddo was born in November a couple years ago, I experienced post partum depression in a nasty way. Never mind the sleep deprivation, a challenging challenging three year old also adjusting to life with a sibling, and post partum recovery, there were many factors coming into play for what I was going through. 

Fast forward to now, 7 months pregnant, baby girl due in January. I‚Äôm doing everything I can to prepare for this baby in our family and prepare myself for post partum. I‚Äôve recently started therapy, which has been great! However, I‚Äôve been looking into other options like medication (nixed that) and post partum support in doulas and cleaning services, etc. When I brought up my ideas to my husband, my interpretation was that bottom line is cost (obviously, we need to feed our family and pay the bills! But don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre quite comfortable) and that people have been kids for thousands of years and we‚Äôre able to get by just fine, so (again, my interpretation) what‚Äôs wrong with me that I can‚Äôt hack post partum and parenting three kids?

332,"For context, my (28f) bf (37m) lost his brother to a drunk driver almost 2 years ago and it still weighs very heavily on him. To distract from feeling that pain at work, he complains. All the small things, big things, and stuff that doesn't even matter, he complains about. And he can get pretty heated about it. He insists its just his way of not thinking about what's really hurting him, but it's just hurting me instead. 

He is in therapy, so it's a work in progress. I'm very nonconfrontational and him being angry makes me nervous. Idk how to help, any attempt at soothing or rationalizing doesn't work. 80% of the time we work together, we leave in a bad mood. If I'm by myself, i can leave and go about my day a fairly happy and energetic person. But this drains me. 

Am i wrong for just removing myself from his presence when he's like that? It's only at work really or if we talk about work, which we try not to do at all. The anger or frustration isn't directed at me, he's just venting, but i feel it and it effects me.",03Nov2019,1
333,"My baby brother who is 1(23 months) has been living with my husband and I on/off since February. I care for him while my mom was trying to get back on her feet. Now it's to this point my mom has me keep him when he becomes too much. Well my mom feels like she can take care of him now and asked for him to come back, permanently. She is living with my dad now. They just got back together almost 2 years ago and break up every weekend. So we came up and I stayed to spend Halloween with him. 

Now, I'm panicking on leaving him after seeing the way they take care of him. Most of it is my dad, and my mom allowing him to do it. I should say my dad is an alcoholic and mentally unwell. Also my brother is not his but from another boyfriend she had before. Legally he does not have a father. 

The first day I was there, my dad at 4pm was drunk in the back seat and removed my baby brother out of his carseat. He sat him on his lap both with no seatbelt in the middle of busy traffic in a city. I started having a panic attack because he refused to listen and put him back. I thought if one car hit us my brother is gone. My mom was driving and also telling him to put him back. I told her to pull over so I can put him back and make my dad sit in the front. She didnt want to and treated it like I was being dramatic. He never listened and they drove the entire way with no seatbelt. 

He never seatbelts him correctly. I've had to tell him and do it everytime. It has two buckles. The one over the chest and the one between the legs. They are both useless without the other. He only buckles the bottom. My mom never checks to see if it's right. 

 I was visiting my other brother and came back in the afternoon to him crying his eyes out. I ran upstairs my mom was hungover still asleep and my dad just at his computer.  He had a bump above his eye because he climbed the chair and tried to grab my bag of chips I had left on top of the guest room shelf. He lost his balance and hit one of the lower shelves. It was really heartbreaking because none of them fed him breakfast or lunch so he tried to feed himself. 

Then the worst was coming back to my brother being left alone in the bathtub in water just below his shoulders. He's not even two yet. I still hear about 5 year olds accidentally drowning in bathtubs. My mom had left my dad to take him a bath while we ran to Walmart real fast. We came back and my dad was downstairs watching the baseball game. My 1 year old brother was up there alone in the tub. I immediately ran upstairs and turned off the water. He didn't even know he left the water on. My mom and I chewed him out. He just said he left him to play but he didn't mean to leave the water on. 

I told my mom you don't leave an alcoholic to take care of your child. I told her I don't trust him because of this and among other things. It's very obvious it's not safe. My dad is spirling down everyday. He doesn't have a job. He's very selfish and wreckless. He drinks morning until night time everday. I'm worried he's going to take my brother with him in this because he's a vulnerable baby. He has to trust the people who take care of him.  Even after this my mom says she trust him. I don't know what to do. I could call CPS but I don't feel like it's a case because there is no way to prove these things. My mom does love him and when they've given him back to me he was always fine. My mom said lately my dads been doing and acting worse. Hes suppose to take care of him for TWO WEEKS until he starts daycare. I begged my mom to let us take him until he starts daycare and she refuses. We live 3 hours away from them. I understand she likes the idea of coming home from work and he is there because she misses him. She works from 6-6 everday. So that's to show how many hours a day he'd be taking care of him.

337,"So I'm m 18 and I'm having a particularly difficult situation that I'm trying to figure out. One day one of my best friends, Chris, got a new girlfriend. Of course I was happy for him and didn't think anything past that for a long long time. Me and her started to get more and more close and it wasn't until they started having issues in their relationship that I realized how much I cared about her. She helped me through a lot of rough points in my life and gave me more hope than anyone has ever given me. She kinda became a light to me that I really looked up to. When I've had panic attacks (which I'm kinda prone to) she was there for me and helped mw through it. Recently she held me for at least an hour messing with my hair and hugging me to calm me down. When I put too much blame on myself she helps me take away the weight. But I'm nagging a little. Within a few months of her and him dating me and her grew close and became friends. When her and Chris had their rough stage and things were looking bad I offered her to come and live with me. She did and her and Chris broke up, but it was a mutal understanding and we all stayed friends. Chris has been controlling in the past to unnecessary levels. He's a good friend and a good guy, but I can't look past some of this stuff. I want her to be happy and I don't wanna add more weight onto her shoulders by telling her I like her. I don't want to ruin our friendship or my friendship with Chris. He's a great person and I've seen what he goes through every day. But I also don't wanna keep this on my mind.

I‚Äôm starting to care less about him? Or I‚Äôm just feeling tired of him reaching out with no effort to help himself?

I just don‚Äôt want to feel responsible if he kills himself. I want him to seek help or figure out how to help himself. It‚Äôs so hard to work on myself, and it feels impossible to work on myself and him at the same time.

I was thinking of sending a message along the lines of:

‚ÄúWhen I hear everything you‚Äôre going through, I get scared. Scared for you and scared for me. I‚Äôm scared for you because I think you might kill yourself. I‚Äôm scared for me because I think if I don‚Äôt speak up or cure you, then I‚Äôm the reason you died.

I‚Äôm telling you this because I‚Äôm trying to be my best self right now. I‚Äôm trying to work on my depression and my own suicidal thoughts. It‚Äôs hard for me to put in the effort to help myself. And I can‚Äôt help both of us at the same time. I am just not that strong of a person. 

I‚Äôm telling you this because I need to focus on myself. When I hear everything you‚Äôre going through, I feel responsible. I think if I say the wrong thing, you might kill yourself. I don‚Äôt want to be responsible for that type of situation. I‚Äôm not equipped to be responsible for it.

I‚Äôm not anyone special. I‚Äôm just a person born into this world like you. I don‚Äôt have the answers.

354,"Hi guys,

I‚Äôm looking for advice before I talk, or don‚Äôt talk, to my upstairs neighbors. First off: I don‚Äôt know a lot about children‚Äôs development and when they are able to learn and understand things. I also don‚Äôt know a lot about parenting, and I‚Äôm not going to pretend I do, which is why I‚Äôm asking here. If I get the advice to not do anything, I will follow it ‚Äì I want to be a reasonable neighbor.

My upstairs neighbors have a 2-year-old child who runs around a lot. Being a small child, this of course makes a lot of noise. We hear the kid many hours a day, and the noise usually begins between 6 and 8 in the morning and ends at around 9 pm.  A few months ago, before we knew what the source of the stomping was a child, we asked our upstairs neighbors to keep it down ‚Äì they were visibly annoyed and explained to us that it was their child and that they were opposed to limiting their child‚Äôs running in any way. Unsure of what to say because we know nothing about children, we said ‚Äúalright‚Äù and haven‚Äôt pushed the issue since. 

Now, we are unsure of whether we should talk to them again and if so, how. I know apartment living is noisy, but are also really bothered by listening to it all day. There are seldomly 5 full minutes without stomping - or balls or toys being bounced and hammered against the floor. The problem is, we don't know what is reasonable in this case, and we don't want to be jerks. What bothers me the most is the noise in the early mornings ‚Äì I have been woken up many times at 5.30 am-6.30 am, which sucks since I am studying from home, and thus can sleep in, and don‚Äôt go to bed at 10 pm. This happens during the weekend as well.

In their defense, I think the floors are of really poor quality, because the child running is almost as loud as if someone was stomping in my own home. Because of this, it cannot be drowned out by television noise or music set at an everyday volume, so it isn‚Äôt easy ignoring. I can‚Äôt wear earplugs as I have loud tinnitus which I‚Äôm still struggling to deal with, and I get full-on panic attacks if I have to listen to it without any other noise to drown it out, especially at night. This perhaps sounds crazy, but that is how it is at the moment.

I have no idea what you can explain to or ask from a two-year-old. Of course, I don‚Äôt want the parents to wander the streets with their kid between 6 am and 8 am to keep me happy, but is it reasonable to ask the parents to redirect the child‚Äôs attention to keep it from running in the early mornings? And can I ask for over-all less noise during the rest of the day as the constant stomping and hammering is slowly eating away at our nerves, or is this just what is expected from living beneath a small child? 

TLDR: My upstairs neighbors two-year-old stomps a lot through the day, and we don't know if it is reasonable to ask them to limit their child's noise, or if this is even possible.",03Nov2019,1
355,"I need some outside non emotional advice.

Basically my Situation is a bit tricky. Quit school at the age of 15 leaving me with no degree (abusive + mentally ill parents). Many years were wasted doing nothing productive. At Age 20 I reentered school, Age 23 I finished High School, decent degree though Maths was majorly bad. Having finished that goal I went on to start an Apprentice Ship in the Biology field just recently. Now facing Age 24, I'm simply unhappy with where I'm and going. I get 0 pay for what I do. I don't really like what I do. Love Science, but what I like, I can't do and finance has become so much more important for me. I've 3k sitting in stocks averaging 18-24% so far (started investing a couple months ago). And roughly 1k in Savings. My Credit Rating is in the upper range, tho working to get it to the top.

Where's my income coming from?
State support and a side job.

Future Income prospects
25k a year (EU citizen). After tax I'd be left in a similar financial situation that I'm in now.

My Goals are to invest in Real Estate soon and keep growing my Portfolio. To ultimately build a future for my family and security, an Aspect I've never had. Plus to ""undo"" the damage done by missing those years. I also finally want something to show for. Feeling like a disappointment to my family, my gfs family, even myself but most importantly to my Gf. Also receiving a lot of pressure from my parents.

Should I stick through with what I'm doing? Studying in the Biology direction afterwards, again getting barely any income and having to delay my Investing plans?
Or should I look for new opportunities. Going into Business or Real Estate Agent for example.

Also as a side Note I do feel overwhelmed by being unable to study Real Estate, follow + study stocks and study Biology all at the same time.

Earlier this year I got a promotion to working in a office routing trucks to different loading facilities, after the first day I absolutely hated it.
Second day in I told the manager how I felt and he gave me two options,step down, or take a few days off and think about it,I stepped down that day
A few months later I applied for a trainer spot and a management spot got a interview for both,got the trainer spot
They say the trainer is supposed to train people of course,but they should also be learning how to do some of the managers job for the day they become a manager,kinda like prepping them for it.
Any way as of last week I applied for a manager spot and was told they wouldn't give me a interview because of the incident that happened earlier this year with the office job.
I understand completely,but at the same time it didn't hold me back from the other interviews I got.
I'd like to know how I could have handled the incident better, I wanted to leave that position,but I didn't know the best way to.

I'd also like to know how I should proceed with this, I feel as if that's a pretty stupid reason to not give me a chance when it wasn't a problem before. Is this a problem I should take to HR? Can they really not give me a interview over a reason that wasn't a problem before?

360,"Here's a wall of text of background info

We're not poor, just to get that out of the way. We're just as average as any other family. But I'm kinda worried our money may slowly dwindle as the years go by. 

 I'm a 17 year old, self-taught artist(I guess?) who is in the middle of my first senior high year. I'm currently studying in ICT as I recall them having a subject about animation but it seems I may get those classes in the second semester as the classes I have know seem to be generalized like junior high.

My parents (around 50 but not mid) have announced to us about a month ago that they are likely to retire after 3 years from now. This shocked me greatly than my two brothers as that meant no one could replace my parents in the working status after their retirement since my brother has just dropped from college and would have likely finished it after my parents retired. I pleaded to them about reconsidering but they seem adamant about it and they said me once that god will find a way for us to succeed which honestly kinda bugs me. 

My older brother, 19 years old, dropped out of college midway during his first year around a year ago so he's been a drop out for at least one and a half year. He goes to a doctor along with my parents for some sort of mental evaluation (idk) and goes to some mental improvement class every tuesdays and thursdays. Other than that, he is always found in front of the computer doing god knows what and fanfiction. He seems to have no interest in going back to school at all.

My younger brother, 15 years old, is in the ninth grade. He is just as as worried as I am about out future but shows his worries lesser than I do. He plans to finish to college and, according to him, usurp our father's position in his workplace. I don't know if that works. He's also hoping that the loyalty fund(is that what you call it?) of my parents from working in the same company for a long time is enough to get him up till college. 

I want to know what I can do from here since I've been stressing this out since two months ago. I honestly believe I shouldn't go to college and proceed to go to work already to save my parents' money and help out with my younger brother's education and even then I have doubts since I don't think my art skills can cut it enough just yet.

Tonight I had this very bad feeling about it, so I went onto his phone while he was asleep (he trusts me with his password) and did a little looking around. A little bit of porn here and there, but I don't mind that.

Three years of this behavior that carried on right under my nose.

369,"I'm a 22 yr old Computer Programming Student and Business Developer who's sick of modern life.

I wake up everyday to study something I'm not that into, just so I can get a well-paying job I probably won't like either.


I've been an athlete most of my life, and I'm growing fond of the outdoors. Politically, I'm a libertarian.    
I'm mostly a carnivore (which contrary to mainstream medicine, which is bullshit anyway) has helped my health tremendously.  
I'm also about to learn Boxing, Kickboxing and BJJ.  


I think we don't really need jobs, because we (mostly) don't really need money.  
One can live free from them, although that requires complete self-reliance.  
Get your own food and water, learn how to protect yourself, and build and fix shit.  


I want to live mostly off the grid, although I don't think that requires living in a mud hut eating bugs.  
I want a good house (maybe I'd even like to learn how to build my own as I like carpentry and that kind of stuff), with solar panels and maybe a backup small gas generator, hunting my own food.

I want to move to a place where:

- I can have guns and Hunt Animals (Deer, Elk, Moose, whatever)  
- I can run, cycle, hike, climb, etc.  
- Near water (I like sailing, and I'd also like to live off rain, or fresh water sources, so I don't need to buy it.)  
- I'm around Nature (to enjoy the beauty and peace)  
- Not fully isolated (I hate crowds and traffic, but I'm very extroverted and like people. I'm thinking some village of sorts).  
- Internet Access (I won't use it often, but some connection to the rest of the world is needed, and if I'm in a bad spot, I can just go online and make good money coding).  
- Preferably low taxes, gun rights, and a overall good country to live in.
- Climate, I'm adaptable. I'm not just living in scorching heat or freezing cold. Deserts and the Arctic are not Options.  
- Big Mountains and lots of Greenery. I'm not really into semi-wild tiny hills with bits of brown bushes here and there.  


I've thought about:

- Switzerland (but lots of tourists in the alps, expensive, and maybe few animals to hunt, no sea)  
- Rest of the Alps  
- New Hampshire  
- British Columbia  
- Colorado (but I hear it's being taken over by hippies and SJWs)
- Australia  
- New Zealand  
- Scandinavia (although I don't like how Sweden is turning SJW)  


I also want a place where I can find the right girl and raise a couple of strong and healthy boys, try to be the father I never had.

Any advice? Thanks!",03Nov2019,0
371,"Some backstory: I basically have fallen really hard for this guy, who I'd say is a pretty close friend. We have seen a few movies together, we went trick or treating together and to a haunted house, and we've walked around town after school before we went to drama. We get along pretty well. And ~a month~ ago I started to find myself really liking him. The thing is, I am about 90% sure I'm friendzoned, or he just doesn't like me that way. We do message, but more often it's just memes and less talk. Even though he sends emojis as replies to my Instagram stories a lot, like a photo of our city lights I took when we were out together he sent a blushy-smiley. But theres little conversation. And I know for a fact he liked a girl for a while, because he told me about her and he also told me I was the only one he was talking to about it and he trusted me. Mega friendzone. He ended up getting rejected, and I really did feel bad but I guess my hopes got up again when they shouldn't have. Because we did hang out more and he seemed to compliment me more, but then recently (yesterday) at homecoming it was really uneventful. Neither of us had dates, but we ended up in different groups of people so we didnt cross paths so much. He came over and said hi for a few minutes but that was like it. And later he was dancing with another girl, so I could pretty much tell by everything that happened that night that he doesnt like me. We were making eye contact a lot, but probably because I was just always looking at him. He seemed to look at me during one of the slow dances when he was with that girl, and I was standing alone just singing. And I know that means nothing, because he literally had a date and had so obviously friendzoned me. So why does my brain keep turning it into something more than it is??? I just want to forget about the crush so I stop spiraling and hurting myself. I know it's my fault he doesnt like me because I kept getting scared and distancing myself a little bit or seeming uninterested when I really didnt mean to. Or just sounding stupid.Is there any way I can just get over it?? At the same time I dont want to just stay his friend but theres nothing I can do and its gonna get worse for me if this doesnt stop.

373,"So, a lotta context before we get to the actual issue.

Context: My partner and I are on a break at the moment. Not one of those Teen Movie breaks, we've decided to go into an open relationship (my idea, because I love her and want another chance to be with her).

I moved back home to move in with mates and become independent so I can stop relying on her when we're together. Also, we lost our v-card to one another so I'm here to get more experience in case I do get into a life relationship (I'm 21, she's 20 so it's definitely a bit early to assume that'll happen).

In the first week of being back home I managed to strike a FwB deal with a close friend of mine (Sorry if you're reading this dude) and that's going alright. Still looking for other people to experience it with as well.

My partner and I are in close contact with one another and I am trying my best to support her to get the same experiences (especially because she is Bi and I am Straight so if she never experiences women that would be trash).

Situation: My partner managed to find a guy. Did some stuff with him last night but they went all the way tonight (which I was glad and disheartened to hear). He was pretty bad though (w00t and damn) but there was one part she enjoyed (motherfucker, good on her). She is left dissapointed and is now going through Tinder to invite someone else over to finish the job good (Yes! You go girl! God fucking damnit).

As you can read in the brackets I'm very torn. I want to support her but I feel like shit when she achieves these things despite the fact that I am doing the same thing! I am being a hypocritical asshole. What should I do? Get her not to tell me that stuff anymore? Not go into as much detail? Cut contact altogether? Any other ideas?",03Nov2019,1

Me being bisexual would change nothing for us and I know she'd be okay with it but is it worth saying anything? I'm in two minds about it because;

1) Telling her changes nothing so what's the point in even gently rocking the boat.

2) I feel I should tell her because she deserves to be told as we're partners in everything.

As I really like the the machine learning and artificial intelligence stuff, as well as programming (I‚Äôm yet a beginner though) and as I like business and have a dream of becoming my own boss and starting my own company, I thought that double majoring would do me what I want. 
The study program would take me around 3-4 years to finish both of them.
Then I would work as a consultant or in some company, where I work on AI / Machine Learning and/or programming. Thereafter I would start my own business someday. Or at least, a small online business (or something like Freelancing) after normal job hours.
I wouldn‚Äôt have too much time to chill and go out or have a great social life during my studies, I know that.
I will also need more time to study.

391,"For background, my soon 6M nephew is 5 months older than my daughter and a only child. As we all live in the same town, both kids are pretty close and often have playdates. 

My Husband‚Äòs family side (BIL and his wife) speak our country‚Äòs language only as a 2nd language and therefore the kid is bilingual (my daughter also, no issues with that).  Country is Germany, they are from a former USSR state.

My nephew has always been different from other kids, rarely communicating with others, not interested in playing with other kids (except my daughter but sometimes he wont even play with her). Always talking with himself and being content that way. He also sometimes pees his pants when immersed in playing and won‚Äòt tell anyone, which sometimes causes tension. He never shows his accomplishments but will tell you all about his fish tank and his fish. 

He began Kindergarten at the age of 4 and has not been able to intergrate at all. He is an outsider and never tries to participate in anything.
The teachers there told him that he may only speak German and so has stopped talking to all family members in Russian and will only respond in German. My SIL is pretty upset with this and this has damaged her trust with the Kindergarten.

The parents were told to check with doctors and child services because they can‚Äòt see him being able to attend school next year. My SIL told me the doctors said everything was fine and he only needs some speech therapy (she visits therapy with him). He has not improved, it is getting worse as he speaks less and less (and only German, but understands Russian just fine)

It is obvious that my SIL doesn‚Äòt know what she can do to further improve the situation. BIL works a lot and is not as much involved.

At a recent family gathering BIL has had way too much to drink and spouted insults to his son and his wife. He has a lot of mental issues. I told him to shut up but this didn‚Äòt help. This was further aggravated by my nephew wanting to go home and BIL/SIL not wanting to. I offered to leave with the kids to let them sleep over at my house but nephew refused. So he was screaming about one hour until my daughter managed to entice him with playing fetch. During his sons screaming BIL made stupid drunken comments about him, the wife, his life. BIL keeps saying that he wished that his kid were more like our daughter. 
We left soon afterwards at 10pm but don‚Äôt know when BIL, SIL and nephew left. 

When I see my nephew playing with my daughter only it is normal kids interaction. Sure, sometimes a little odd, but every kid has its quirks. I understand SIL worrying that the kid will have issues in school and was wondering was there something we could to to help them? Are there some games, some kind of therapy which could improve this? Forcing social interaction seems pointless, when we organize playdates with more kids besides my daughter and nephew, he will always keep to himself no matter what we do.",03Nov2019,1

So I am having an existential crisis. I have an undergraduate degree in Interdisciplinary studies (International Politics focus) and a Master's degree in Liberal Studies (which I've determined was a total waste of time and money that I only did because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do.) Doing this racked up around 65,000 usd in student loan debt, which are now 68k after 2 years of interest. After these bad decisions, I decided to move to China to have a better chance of travelling/making money with a low cost of living. I taught English here for two years and decided it wasn't the path for me because I don't really like it/ have a passion for it. I'm not a bad teacher, but it's just not the career path I want.

While in China, I received the chance to go to University here on full scholarship (tuition, room and board, and a monthly stipend). I decided to study a Master's in International Business. I'm in my first semester of a 2 year program.

However, now I'm thinking that the longer I study, the longer my US student loans accrue interest. I could go back to teaching here and make an OK living and save to pay back my loans, but I think that if I spend to much time in that career path, I'll be too old to ever start a new field. I plan to work in a company here, but my Chinese isn't fluent yet

400," I recently graduated from college with the Bachelors of Science in Mathematics in June. About a month before I graduated I started applying for jobs to begin building a skill set to eventually begin my career. Granted I was split between my choices of working as an analyst for a company or going towards education.

I have experience in both having done research for an extended period of time with different analytical software. I also was a tutor for 3 years at my University helping students of all ages and even creating workshops for individuals who were seeking to become educators for public schools in my state. 

Since about March I have applied to upwards of a hundred jobs since I have been applying to about 7 to 10 postings every week since the beginning of June. I have been applying to jobs at universities and companies for both education and analyst positions for since I wanted to keep my options open. However I have yet to receive an offer and more often than not do not even hear back from any location whatsoever. 

I have tried multiple versions of my resume I have tried multiple versions of my cover letter and still yet I cannot managed to land an interview 90% of the time. What am I doing wrong? Is there something I'm missing this is my first time really in the real world in a really. I have always been a student until recently. Is there something I am missing or am I really just not that great of an applicant?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated since I currently feel stuck. The past couple of months have definitely taken a shot at my self-confidence since it feels that I'm not wanted anywhere.",03Nov2019,2

403,"I have a friend who is about to start renting out his current home when he moves. I intend to sign a lease with him. He's trying to keep things sorta casual so that I don't get offended by him insisting on getting everything in writing. But everything in writing is precisely what I want. It's good protection for all parties involved. So I'm laying out things that need to be addressed in the lease. 

So far, I have rent amount, security deposit, notice of departure, carpet and appliance depreciation, and utilities all either addressed or on the list to be addressed. It's going to be a generic form lease aside from that, so things like quiet enjoyment, etc. will be taken care of.

I won't cover everything because it would take forever to write and you'll all get bored. 

I had a rough childhood. Moved home around 18 times, my mum got into a relationship with an abusive man and  forced my dad out of the picture when I was 3. I've managed to build a great relationship with my real dad over the past few years which I'm grateful for. 

My stepdad and mum would physically fight on a regular basis. It was absolutely more from him but I can recall times when my mum would start this with him for ridiculous reasons. This happened up until I was 9 so I have clear memories of this.

When she finally left my stepdad that's when things got worse. My mum started drinking a lot. Even with my sister who was 16 at the time. She began hitting us and mentally abusing us. My sister left home at 16 because she couldn't take it. All of this continued for me up until I was 17 when I finally moved out. 

Fast forward 11 years and she acts like this never happened. She comes across nice and judges my sister on her perfectly good parenting skills. The only thing she mentions is that my stepdad used to beat her. It's almost as if she's erased the abuse against my siblings and me. She now suffers with really bad arthritis and struggles financially so I support her a lot.

She's alone and I can't help feeling guilty. I help her as much as I can but she's never once said sorry for anything that happened in the past. I know I should just get over it and move on but it's always in the back of my mind.

Has anyone experienced anything similar?

I‚Äôve been speaking to this guy over snapchat for months (he‚Äôs a friend of a friend), and on Friday we finally met after a long time of making plans and cancelling. We just hung out and went to see a movie. I was a bit nervous so not much between us happened, but I had a lovely time regardless, and it seemed like he did too.

He seemed the same on message that night when I text him, and most of the day after, until that evening when he seemed a bit off and wasn‚Äôt messaging me the same things as he usually does (wasn‚Äôt flirty, a bit more blunt and most without the ‚Äòx‚Äô he always sends).

I asked him how he was and he said he was great (and he did seem fine), so I know that it wasn‚Äôt his mood or anything affecting it. He also didn‚Äôt send me the usual goodnight that he does basically every day- he was really blunt about it.

He‚Äôs a lovely person and was understanding about my nerves when I mentioned it on the night, but maybe he just thinks I‚Äôm not that interested in him? I haven‚Äôt been acting or talking any different to him than usual. I‚Äôm just not sure how to approach this or if it‚Äôs too soon to ask.¬†

412,"Here's the backstory, I met my friend at the start of this year. I was introduced to her by another friend of mine as we all had the same Anthropology class. Let's call her June. 

Since that day though June and I have become really close friends fast, I've become more comfortable with her than any other girl friend I've had. Even though we have only known eachother for 9 to 10 months she has told me her biggest secrets and also felt comfortable sharing what time of the month her cycle starts. She tells me everything and I support her with all the help she needs because of her medical issues ( those are the secrets that no one outside of her immediate family knows about). She worries about her brother a lot as well but he seems to be causing her a lot of grief and I've been listening and helping how I can without being intrusive as best I can as it is a very delicate subject.

She's been a great friend and I like to think I've done my best to be a great friend as well. She's been trying her best to set me up with some of her other friends and I've been game for that as they seem like nice people. Be also been encouraging her to be less shy around new people ( I find it crazy as she is the furthest thing from shy when we spend time together) as well as encouraging her to speak to her crush and get closer to him. I feel like it was a great mutual support thing going on between us.

The plan for me to date one of her friends has not been going too well unfortunately (lol) as none of them are really easy to speak to (that's my point of view though). If we head back about a week and a bit ago I had a cook out night at my place with a couple of friends over. While I was in the kitchen I was speaking to June. She told me that she had sent a message to her crush and told him that she liked him. He he let her down nicely at least. I was really happy that she did such a ballsy ( couldn't think of an appropriate synonym) move even if it didn't go her way. Well I was leaning on a counter with my hand in my hip she came and put her arm through mine and stood close to me for a while like that.

Later though during the cook out I had to quickly get something at the shops down the road so she came with me. In the car she told me that her friends think that we are dating ( I've been asked that as well). We then got to the topic of if we had to date, June said that she thinks we would do well almost jokingly, unfortunately no matter ho hard I think I can't think of what she said next and I'm kicking myself for it. The best I can remember is that she said she has to love herself. I know it sounds corny and cheesy but it was along those lines I'm being honest. 

Anyway that small conversation in the car triggered something in me immediately. Ever since then I have not stopped thinking about if we started dating and I realized that it would make me extremely happy.

She always goes on about how she is shy and can't talk to new people but I don't see her that way at all. I see her as someone who is upfront and says what they mean and means what they say. So to me I take everything that she says at face value and I feel like most of our friends do that as well. So when she says she doesn't want to date me but thinks we could be a good match I take it as such. So I don't know how to continue. I literally cannot stop thinking about if we had to date, I have no idea what to do.",03Nov2019,3

I'm the type of person that would find the most unconventional solution for something and keep doing it until it works. The obvious solution never crosses my brain until someone points it out,after which i feel super dumb for not seeing it. Let's imagine there is a locked door and I was holding the incorrect key. I would keep pushing the wrong key until the metal bends and deforms to the point i can open the door,and the thought of looking for the correct key never crosses my mind the whole time. If there were trousers i could not close,i would take the time to put a pin through the cloth to close it without even considering trying to locate the button /zipper/rope.

418,"Little back story: I came to live to the USA for studies and mostly because I fell in love with my current husband who is an American. I left family and friend behind. My husband struggled with alcohol abuse before we got married, during our marriage he became very abusive (mentally) and things got really bad between us and I eventually ended in a mental institution for attempted suicide. After this I went back home (to my country) and he got the help he needed. Got a permanent treatment and he is currently alcohol free (6 month already). He is planning of getting the treatment again to keep alcohol free for at least a year then see from there. The alcohol abuse was mostly because of depression. I am still in treatment for my anxiety and depression. 

Current situation: a few weeks ago (maybe a month) he started smoked pot, we discussed this and I told him I wasn‚Äôt sure about it since the alcohol abuse and all and that I don‚Äôt know if I can trust. We got into an agreement in which he would only smoke on the weekends and asking me but he broke it and started on the week too, we fight about it and we got to the agreement again that it was ok as long as he ask. I still felt unsure about it. I have nothing against pot. I have done it myself and he doesn‚Äôt change or act different. He actually sleeps better and still helps me around with everything. He doesn‚Äôt neglect his work or ‚Äúduties‚Äù. Still I feel very uncomfortable about it and I do not know why. When he ask is just how I feel and flat out I have in a way ‚Äúno reasons to say no‚Äù. Recently I found him smoking almost all day, since he wakes up till late at night. And i don‚Äôt like it, makes me unsure and troubles myself inside. Makes me so anxious because I don‚Äôt know how to feel or how should I feel. I struggles with this all my life. My biggest issue and, please bear with me because is not so easy for me, ‚ÄúI do not allow myself to feel‚Äù is how my therapist tells me. I shut down my own emotions (unintentionally) and ‚Äújust see how should I feel‚Äù I stead of just feeling. (Sorry if it sounds complicated). How would you guys handle the situations? How can I handle this? I don‚Äôt want to share this with my other support lines because I am ashamed that I am again making a mistake or feel stupid. I know I should discuss this with my therapist but I just can‚Äôt right now.

419,"Ok, ill try to avoid unnecessary details. It's been over 4 years since I broke up with my first serious boyfriend, I literally have no idea when this is going to go away, I rarely never see or talk to maybe once or twice a year and for the first 2 years we didn't talk at all as he blocked me on everything (we had a REALLY messy breakup).

420,"Okay. This has been going on for a few days. Day before Halloween, to be exact. Here's the nitty-gritty. The last few days of pooping I've noticed a few worms in my poop. At first, I happened to catch it because I looked in the bowl as I flushing. I saw what I thought were little worms in my poop. But I thought to myself: fuck that shit! It must've been some non-digested pasta or rice.

Before I brought the kids trick or treating the day after, I pooped. This time I did not flush right away. I looked. Sure enough there were little worms in my poop. I think there were like three or four. Maybe five. I decided I would go to the hospital, but--first--I had to bring the kids trick or treating. That's what I did.

Later that night, went to the ER. Had to give a stool sample. I pooped, there wasn't a single worm. Was sent home. But I knew what I had seen. Next morning, forced a poop. There were like six or seven--maybe ten--of these wiry white/translucent worms in just a little bit of poop. Only one piece of poop.

I went back to the ER after work that day. Same ER doc. Didn't even have me provide a stool sample. I mean, all this girl did was check my vitals, tell me I was healthy, ask me if I'm on medication for anxiety, and sent my ass home. So, for whatever reason, I convinced myself that I had been seeing things or something. I even pooped again, and didn't see a thing. I thought I was in the clear. After all, the doctor lady told me I was in the clear.

This morning I woke up, not even thinking about worms in poop, but when I stood up from getting out of bed, I felt severe extremely uncomfortable pulling at my ass hairs from dried up shit in my briefs. I could hardly take a step without a sever pull on the hair that surrounds my butt hole. Went to the bathroom. Started to clean up; A lot of poop was matted to my ass and underwear. I saw a few worms. One was still alive. It was wagging around crazily, and it was very long. Looked like the color of uncooked rice, but was way longer. Thinner than angel hair spaghetti.

What can I do to get rid of these worms in my poop? I've been to the hospital twice, and they're not taking me seriously. I don't even take me seriously after the doc tells me I'm fine. I just don't want to go back. It's embarrassing. Uncomfortable. And seemingly useless. Would cranberry juice rid me of these worms. After googling around, I think I have horsehair worms in my poop  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematomorpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematomorpha) . But these worms don't really ever live in poop. At all. So I don't know.

435,"This is super long, so bear with me. I felt like I needed to write the entire backstory to help understand the situation now. I needed to get it all out once and for all. The last paragraph is where I ask for advice. 

In middle school, I met a guy who was a grade older than me. We hit it off instantly and started ""dating."" I think it lasted all of two weeks, because middle school drama. However, he was my first kiss and the first guy I ever loved. I left that relationship thinking that every time you kissed a person you liked, it felt like electricity. We didn't interact much after our break up. I'm going tk refer to him as my middle school love, MSL, for brevity from here on out.

Fast forward to high school, I've kissed my fair shair of people, and none came close to the physical sensations I felt kissing my MSL. I just chalked it up to being my first relationship. In my junior year, I have lunch with a new guy. He's kind of cute and into me. My friends have all started having sex, so I'm feeling the pressure to reach the proverbial finish line. The new guy is nice, funny, and we get along well enough so I continued seeing him. We start dating, and I found out the new guy is best friends with my MSL. We all start hanging out, smoking, and doong stupid teen shit daily and very quickly I realize I still have feelings for my MSL after all these years. At 16, I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to hurt the new guys feelings by dropping him for his best friend, and I didn't want to risk being rejected by my MSL. Looking back, I should have just been honest. My long distance best friend comes for the summer, and thinking it would help ebb my feelings, I encourage her to pursue my MSL so we could essentially all have fuck buddies for the summer. They got serious, started dating long distance, and I stayed with the new guy because at this point we were a tight friend group. I decided I could live with my feelings if it meant we were all friends.

Things didn't go well for my best friend and my MSL. She didn't really treat him well, and they fought constantly. Her being a 7 hour drive away didn't help. My MSL and I bonded trying to help each other through our respective relationship problems. There was even a time we took that 7 hour drive together to see my best friend, and the whole drive I felt so guilty because I wanted to tell him I loved him. They finally broke up months later, and my best friend jumped into another relationship like she had always done. I'm still dating the new guy, and while I don't love him like I should, I don't break up with him because he lives with me and I would have created a whole mess asking him to leave. The new guy, my MSL, and I are a tight group. They graduate and a year later so do I.

Flash forward a year or two, I have graduated now too, I finally admit to one of my friends, out loud, that I love my MSL. Things between the new guy and I are strained, we live in an apartment together, and he's become manipulative and violent. I don't know how to leave. It takes a fight where he left palm shaped bruises on my arms for my parents to finally step in and end the relationship for me. I don't understand why, but I kept sneaking around to see him. I think it's because I didn't think anyone else would want me, and I deserved to be treated that way. My MSL stepped up big time for me, disgusted by the new guy. He did everything he could to keep me away and  distracted. He was incredible. I knew I still loved him but I was, and I can not stress this enough, really fucked up. I still don't think im the same after the number the new guy did on me. I was hard to be around. 

I'm getting to the end here, I promise. I finally, stupidly, tell my MSL that I have always loved him. That I hid it all these years. I find out he loved me too. I tell him that I have far too much damage right now to jump into a new relationship, and I wanna stay the friends we've always been, and take things slow because I wanna do this right. I tell him I'll spend my life with him if he let's me, so there's no rush. Around this exact time, my long distance best friend calls him, she's in a relationship of her own but she tells me she still has feeling for MSL and wants to try again with him. I don't know what to do. I tell MSL. We have a long talk one night, he doesn't have feelings for her anymore, and he genuinely wants to pursue this with me. The whole conversation would have been great, except, at some point, I butt dial my best friend, she hears enough to lose her shit. I'm devastated because that's not how I wanted things to go. 

My MSL tries to help me through it. But quite frankly, I was inhuman at this point. Between trying to cut all the cords with my abusive relationship and essentially losing my childhood best friend, I'm a shell. Knowing what I know now, I think I was leaping back and forth between manic and depressive episodes. MSL and I kiss during this time, and I can't believe the electricity is still there. He even nervously says something about it, and I let him know I felt it too. I should have been firm with my boundries and kept MSL at a healthy distance, I didn't. In the weeks following, while in a hostile battle with my best friend, I slowly push my MSL away. He kept trying to make dates and do romantic things, and I loved him, but it scared me. I let all of my anger out on him, and we would yo-yo between days where I wanted to try and be receptive to where I couldn't even look at him. I hated myself for it. He takes me horseback riding, and we have sex that night. The next day we go in a hike, and my best friend starts blowing us both up, it tipped me off a ledge and I express that I've been thinking about suicide. MSL is hurt and doesn't know how to help. He angrily leaves me alone in the woods and I get stung in the face by a wasp. He feels horrible and I resented him. 

Not long after this, he tells me he got a month long position in the summer for a work opportunity. Instead of being happy and encouraging him, I lost it because I thought that meant he was going to abandon me and that I would lose him. I got cold despite everything he did to reassure me. After two days of fighting, he messaged me and told him we weren't good for each other and he was done. He wouldn't answer my calls, blocked me on everything, he just vanished. A month or so later, I called him from a new number and he answered, realized it was me, told me no, I'm sick of your shit and hung up. We have not spoke since then. I heard a few months later that he would show people our texts to show how crazy I was. That hurt because I still had the texts where he promised he wouldn't abandon me. 

I grieved for a while, let myself heal from everything, started therapy, and ultimately met the man I'm with now. No electricity when we kiss, but I wouldn't trade him for the world. I'm happy, I'm comfortable. If my MSL knocked on my door and begged for me back today, I'd laugh in his face. Sometimes I still miss my friend, and I think we could have spent our lives together if I had been honest from the very beginning, but I've accepted that our history made us permanently incompatible. I know that I pushed him away. The only hurt that stays with me all these years later is the abandonment. He closed the door on my face and never looked back after all those years and that's been the hardest hurdle to overcome. My current partner knows all of this, and has been amazing in the discussions we've had. 

Now to the whole point of the post, I still have dreams about my MSL. They vary from me breaking his nose, to confronting him for abandoning me, to us having sex, to him coming back years later to apologize. In the immediate aftermath of us falling out, they happened alot. That made sense. But it's been 4 years, I don't think about him like I used to, and yet every couple of months I have a MSL dream. The last one was six months ago, but I had one last night that brought up so many old feelings that I couldn't sleep. 

How do I stop dreaming about him? It hurts and it's so hard to wake up in the morning and essentially relive everything just because of a dream. I talk to my partner about them, but I feel guilty about having the dreams at all, and I don't want to one day make him feel threatened by a guy who basically isn't even real anymore. Of course I still love my MSL, I think I always will, but it's not the same. I love my memories, but not necessarily the real person. What do I need to do to finally lay my MSL to rest in my brain? Has anyone else ever experienced something like this before? Am I somehow holding on? I just want that chapter to close entirely but my brain has kept it alive and as painful as ever.",03Nov2019,2

I'm a mid twenties male been diagnosed with EUPD for several years now but 
have avoided therapy and just been surviving on antidepressants. I used 
to self harm quite badly and had quite an awful drug addiction. I'm off 
particularly dangerous drugs but cannot exist without some kind of mind 
altering substance.

I have jealousy and possessiveness issues around my partner. My problem is this
 extends to my son who is 4. I have an underlying paranoia that he wants
 to ""posses"" his mother, my girlfriend. This has lead to constant 
paranoia and a deep hatred for him which clearly shows in the way I act 
and treat his siblings who I love very much and show it.

This has gone on for a long time ever since he breastfed which felt 
extremely sexual to me and caused me to permanently consider him an 
enemy. I have worked hard to limit his contact with her and shown that 
she is mine to scare him off.

This issue is really affecting my life and I don't know who to get advice 
from that's actually productive and not just anger or ignorance about 
the issue. How do I get over this or am I not even paranoid?",03Nov2019,2
437,"I come from a blunt home. I think my upbringing was so blunt it might have been abusive. I think this was mostly a cultural thing.

For example, weight was not something my family spoke about with discretion. We spoke about it basically the same way different families would speak about having a cold. Being sensitive about this kind of topic was not something that my family ever really cared to do. I don't think they did it on purpose. Culturally, no one could give a shit about being sensitive on this kind of matter.

""Oh my God you're gaining so much weight"" is something my mom once said to me in front of all my friends. I don't think she meant that to be hurtful. I think that's the kind of curt dialogue she just grew up with.

I have a few soft spots on things that really hurt, and I can't handle backseat drivers. Other than that, I can take pretty much anything. I have heard the harshest criticisms, and almost nothing irks me.

This might edge on a lack of self-respect. I have two roommates. One of them spent a year constantly making attacks calling me ""privileged"" and ""entitled."" I genuinely didn't care. That roommate wasn't my friend though.

I have had a few friends as well, who have been ridiculously rude at times, and I have just taken it because it didn't even set off my ""this is disrespectful"" radar. For example, I once had a friend get really mad at me for asking a simple question about his job. I had asked ""when you get paid, are taxes already taken out of your paycheck or do you have to pay them yourself?"" He was really irked and said ""stop being such a fucking idiot and don't ask me this kind of shit.""

Of course that was really disrespectful and I don't think it's indicative of a very good friendship, but it barely even stood out to me.

Otherwise, I think I am a confident person. I have aspirations, I stand up for myself when needed, etc.",03Nov2019,1

442,"Hi. During my first year of college I had a girlfriend who I spent several months with, but she wasn‚Äôt interested in a sexual relationship so I broke up with her. It was my first relationship so I was a bit naive and didn‚Äôt have a standard for how I would be treated. Anyway I‚Äôm single again and looking to get a girlfriend or at the very least get laid.

I (20F) have a group of friends that I was friends with for over 15 years. I literally grew up with them, laughed with them, cried with them. But it feels like they‚Äôre drifting away from me. I have one friend out of the group who still talks to me and sometimes makes an effort to invite me or hang out with me. But they do regularly see each other a lot. I‚Äôm never invited. I use to make comments like ‚Äò‚Äôoh wow thanks for the invite‚Äô‚Äô in hopes that maybe they‚Äôll start inviting me. But they don‚Äôt. I see them mainly in the summer when they have a lot of free time so I guess I‚Äôm not a priority. Also lately, I‚Äôve noticed they‚Äôve been keeping small secrets from me. And when I‚Äôll ask them about it, they‚Äôll just stay quiet. It‚Äôs honestly humiliating and kind of annoying. Like for example a friend‚Äôs boyfriend was apparently cheating on her with multiple girls and I was told by ‚Äòaccident‚Äô by a different friend who thought I knew. And then another instance a friend of mine was seeing this guy and didn‚Äôt tell me (not sure why, maybe it‚Äôs because I once previously warned her about dating guys like him but I wouldn‚Äôt outwardly shame her or anything). But basically they‚Äôd have these like inside secret conversations and front of me. And when I‚Äôd ask what they were talking about, they‚Äôd just quiet down. Honestly not sure what to do. I don‚Äôt want to let go of 15 year friendships but at the same time this has been going on for about 2 years where we just continue to drift apart. I‚Äôm sort of already depressed and I guess this just adds onto it. I think letting go of friendships like these are much harder than people portray them. I doubt they‚Äôd care or miss me if I did cut them off. I have a few other friends from school and other things. I‚Äôd like to work on finding a new friend but it‚Äôs hard especially when you‚Äôre use to a certain group. I think all of the behavior is pretty childish considering I‚Äôm an open book now and I‚Äôm really nice to them.

447,"Okay, so first off, I know this sounds like a fishing post but I'm not. I won't be posting any pics of myself or anything like that. This is just something I genuinely want the answer to, because I can't find anything about it online. 

For some reason, I tend to attract about a third of the men I meet. For example, I had a driving instructor who I told that I wasn't very good at being coordinated, and then he started telling me not to worry because I was smart and beautiful, etc. This went on for several times, and wouldn't have been an issue if I were being self depreciating about my looks. But I wasn't, I was telling him about my bad driving skills. He then proceded to ask me to go for a scenic, hour long drive, to which I declined. And all of this was after I had casually mentioned my boyfriend. 

Another example is how I was at a networking event and how I started talking to another small business owner. He asked me to hang out, and my EXACT response was that ""I'd rather work on my own business, or do anything else"" but he still kept asking. I mean, when someone says that they'd rather do anything else than hang out with you, I thought that would be enough of a hint, but I guess not. He only stopped trying to convince me after I mentioned having to take a call from my boyfriend. 

And here's a crazier example: I was at the mall, when I noticed a man following me. I thought that maybe he was just going in the same direction, but after about half an hour, he was still behind me. Now, this is a 6 story mall, so it's not like we were cramped within a small confinement. He then proceded to come up to me and ask if I was lost, and needed help. I was confused and politely declined, until I realized what had fully happened afterwards.

And all three of these cases were just what happened within ONE WEEK. I get stuff like this happen to me all the time. It's not like I'm even attractive or anything, I'm just a regular 20 year old, and I wear normal clothes. My looks vary from month to month, because I like to switch between hair colours, and even from wearing to not wearing glasses, so I don't think it's because I look like a particular celebrity or whatnot. Also, I know that some people confuse being nice with flirting, but in every conversation I'm in I always mention my boyfriend, which is only 50% effective. That last guy I didn't even talk to, he just started following me out of no where.

It's been happening for so long that I'm starting to get anxiety over it, and I haven't left my apartment for several days (which is pretty bad, because I have classes and work). I feel sick and have started cutting parts of my face and body in hopes I'll look unapproachable. Since my friends, both male and female, have no advice for me and somehow NO ONE ELSE has had this happen to them, I'm turning to Reddit for help. Could I please get a brutally honest perspective as to what I'm doing wrong? Why does this keep happening to me? How do I make it stop? :(

452,"My little brother (18) is in a rut in his life. I'm 24 (m) and I moved out of my parents house when I was 18. Since then I've had multiple jobs, moved around the city 4 times and eventually circled back to my parents place for a short time whilst I save up enough to move city. During this time my brother was growing up through his teenage years and eventually to the age he is now. We were never very close but we always tried to hang out and would play online games together. He used to idealise me, as younger brothers do, but as he grew older he started adopting his own ideas of success and happiness, as he should. 

He's jobless and isn't very academic. He's definitely got a bit of autism along with depression and chronic OCD. His problem is that he has a very large lack of motivation. All he does is hang out with his deadbeat friends, get drunk, smoke weed, play games and sleeps from 6am to 4pm on a daily basis. Granted, we've all been in a similar place in our life, I know I have.

I know he's miserable because he has no direction in life and I want to help him but I don't know how. My parents were constantly on his back to get a job and sort his life out but have slowly given up, I really don't want to take this approach. I also want to help him out for my parents sake.

To some people it might mean something much less serious like ""hey I like you, you're pretty cool and we get along""

And to other people it might mean ""I'm *in love* with you and want to spend the rest of my life with you""

For me it means the latter and It would normally take me a long time to get to the point of saying it in a relationship. But when she told it to me, I said it back.

I‚Äôm a kissless virgin.And I  noticed over time I get stared at like iv got 3 heads and treated poorly by most and it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm ugly. I don‚Äôt leave the house and havnt for 4 years  except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. I used to enjoy it and it made me excited to go out and do something with my day for once , but other times it‚Äôs very difficult. I always get picked for the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there‚Äôs times I blatantly get stared at because I‚Äôm ugly. Last week some young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking, and girls who stare me down because I‚Äôm tall and slim. I don‚Äôt ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job around a lot of people  and a girl and her dad was standing drinking and the girl looked at me with a blank glare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face and said ‚Äòewwwwww god no‚Äô (I lipread her) it was ok for her as she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask covering her face tho. it really got me down tbh as I was having an anxiety free day for once.

Sometimes when it‚Äôs cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh. I have bad depression because of my looks too so it‚Äôs difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when it‚Äôs a women and they‚Äôre always snotty and dismissive I take it personally.

468,"Sorry for this long post, but i really tried to shorten it as much as possible.

A quick description of what happened to me in the past years so you have a good idea about why im being like this or if its related to it or not.

Since 2015 i started school in a foreign country. It was all good till my father started acting like a d**k to my stepmom. She is a great person that made our life (me and sibs) better since my real mother was the opposite. And when my father started his acts we started having really huge family fights/problems. The thing is that when he starts arguing with my SM, because he is the wrong one, we side with her and that makes him angrier.

Now to me, last two yrs i didnt do very well on school. During class my brain starts remembering all the bad memories i have had in the past and i wont be able to focus on the lesson. One time during an exam i almost started crying but i held it inside me.
I feel like i have been holding my feelings inside me for so long that i cant bear anymore. I also didnt go to school for the entire last year because i was feeling so low and sad. But now im frequenting a new one.

During the summer, I tried to motivate myself to do well in school if i want to leave home and a better my life + myself. And it quite made me happier thinking about the future better me and that if i succeed i will go away from my family.
I dont have any problems with my classmates this year. They're all great ppl.
The problem is that i cant focus to study. Whenever i start studying i simultaneously start to think about all the bad stuff that happened in my life. I try to motivate myself but right now i cant move forward.

Sometimes when im just sitting, out of nowhere, i get the urge to cry very hard. Start feeling so depressed about myself and that im inferior compared to other people. Also when I see my family sitting around the table, having a fun meal and being happy. I HATE that look on their faces so much that i start to cry to myself. The term of ""happy family"" (if applied to my family) disgusts me so much. 

Another info to add is that I cant say no. I really really cant say it. For example when my stepmom asks me to do her a favor or help her in something, but im busy or willing to study, i cant tell her no. Because i feel like she did many great things to us that i cant refuse when she asks me. We are a big family of 10 ppl ( 5 kids under 4yrs) and i started hating kids so much that sometimes i start to imagine and laugh about ""what if i kicked this kid. What will happen...ha ha ha"".

I thought about consulting a psychologist. But i always get the thought that im trying to reach a physocologist just for the sake of excusing myself and in reality nothing is wrong with me.

Idk what to do anymore. So im seeking help from this sub. Any advice is much appreciated.",03Nov2019,1

474,"A long time friend from third grade, now 5 years and going, has recently changed a lot. We all are in our teenage years, so I get the mood swings and all, and I am not mad at that,but now it has just turned into abuse. So i'll start.

He has now for like 6 months started acting quite abusive, putting me down, as in talking behind my back, and telling some other mutual friends how to annoy me, beat me in stuff, just shit bout me. Not like that's anything that crazy, I am usually a chill person, who doesn't really care what others think, but it just breaks me a little.

We both have a really good mutual friend ( We are kind of the three friends ), he will be refered as ""B"". He def is a closer friend to me, I tell him secrets, he tells me. There is a mutual trust between me and him, which I just don't have between ""A""(abusive friend). I talk with him, and when we have classes where I am just with him I feel a lot safer, and more open.

There is also another big problem. ""A"", usually laughs at my mistakes, but when we laugh about his, he auto turns toxic, and angry, a massive hypocrite to be honest. A massive problem is that there just isn't much friendlyness, more like just acquitences, he doesn't tell me anything, only ""B"", all the trust is gone there, and I have no idea why. Like literally he has exposed many of my secrets, but I have never his.

Now there has showed up a new problem that. I have never told this anyone, so this is also kind of my first coming out. I'm gay, and he makes a lot of homophobic jokes, and a lot of them are at me. I don't know why, I literally am not the typical gay, but whatever. As I am in my teenager years, and can't admit to this, it's really hard to do something. Literally everyday, every hour, it's draining me out. I am not sure how much I can hold this longer for.

Many times, I have helped him out by making school presentations and stuff like that, but I do sometimes not do that well in tests, and then he laughs at my mistakes. It annoys me a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

The other friend is also close to ""A"", and I feel like if I leave ""A"" friendship, my close friendship with ""B"" will also fail. It's a hard job keeping ""A"" happy, while enjoying the company of ""B"" more.

So my question is, what do I do in this situation?

475,"So, long story short, my boyfriend has had some issues with thinking I‚Äôm manipulating him and don‚Äôt really care about him. He‚Äôs gotten into this paranoid state of mind twice in the six months we‚Äôve been dating, both within the last month and a half. Within 24 hours he usually is more rational and reasonable again and apologizes. This past week, I found out he‚Äôs struggled with suicidal thoughts and I had no idea. He‚Äôs very happy and stable other than those recent outbursts. It‚Äôs been bad so he is staying with his parents for a bit while he gets on some medication. In the meantime, I just took a pregnancy test and it was positive. I thought I was just really stressed out because of everything going on with him, it‚Äôs pretty typical for me to be irregular if I‚Äôm stressed out, but that‚Äôs not the case. I want him to focus on getting better and I think if I told him he would have those paranoias that I‚Äôm trying to be manipulative. Also obviously the most important thing is that he‚Äôs able to get better so he doesn‚Äôt think suicidal thoughts or try to do anything.

476,"I am one of thoe people that everyone, including strangers, feels the need to confide in. This time it was a friend of the family 

What he told me has left me so stunned that I can't think of a way to help. So I need you to help me help him

""Fred"" has been married to ""Jo Ann"" for almost 20 years. They have a nice home, 3 kids, a dog- they are the picture of a happy family

He and his wife still really love each other. They have had their ups and downs like anyone else but they have a great relationship.

Fred has to travel for his work. He goes all over the country and is usually gone for a week at most. JoAnn jokes that Fred being gone is why they have such a strong marriage

The first shocker he laid on me is that he has been having an affair for as long as he and JoAnn have been married. Looking at his marriage and his family no one would have a clue. I am sure I looked like a landed fish when he told me.

In short, she is a girl he was in love with when he met JoAnn. He fell totally in love with JoAnn and they got married. Then he realized that he was still crazy about the other girl, too. He was caught in the middle. 

When he got his current job, things got complicated. When he would go out of town his GF would fly to the same city and they would have their relationship there. *That's* why no one ever had a clue about what was going on.

Now, this was not some sleazy motel no-tell affair. Fred and his GF were as seriously in love as Fred and JoAnn. JoAnn never knew and he never hurt her. It did not impact his family or their lives. For all intent and purposes, it didn't happen

So please don't say ""he made his own bed"" or ""this is karma."" He is a genuinely good man who has managed to keep two women and one family happy.

Now here is the thing that still has me gasping.

He recently found out that his girlfriend has cancer. It's lung cancer. It can't be operated on and, so far, the chemo is not touching it. Of course, she can no longer travel

Fred is her man. Essentially her husband. She needs his support more than ever. But he cannot give it to her. 

There is no way he could account or being away for long periods of time without explanation.He could not explain to JoAnn how he suddenly has this dear friend out of the blue who has cancer and needs his support.

While she has to fight the battle alone, he is tearing himself up inside. He can't be with her. He can't hold her hand or comfort her. 

And he won't be able to go to her funeral

We talked about some alternatives. 

I suggested he just come clean with JoAnn. That he lay it all out on the table and take his medicine. 

There is absolutely no way he would even think of it. He loves JoAnn and would never hurt her. Plus he has the kids to think of. This would blow up his family.

I suggested some fake business trips (sorry but I felt this needs some extreme measures). He will not take the smallest chance that someone who knows him would see him on the street while he was ""out of town."" Or that his work would call the house looking for him. 

So that's where we are. I have volunteered to take his GF flowers and gifts he buys her. And I will be reporting back on her condition. It's not much but at least they will have some communication

My friend is being destroyed. A woman who has been by his side is fighting for her life against a painful disease all by herself. And I have no clue what to tell him

There has to be a novel or a movie with this kind of situation. Maybe I could find it and see how they fix things

I did some research and realized that I can negotiate a pay-for-delete. So I contacted the collection agency and they agreed to delete the account from all three bureaus in exchange for a full payment.

I made the payment and within a few weeks, the negative item fell off of all three credit reports. I told a friend about this and they told me that what I did was shady because my collection account was supposed to stay on my reports even though I made a payment. He said that by removing the account, my credit report no longer accurately reflects my past behavior and that it isn't fair to people who have never had an account go to collections.

I graduated last June and was taking a little time to figure out exactly what I wanted to do with my life. Prior to graduation a lot of the thought process was centered around my now ex girlfriend. It sucked but at least I have a clear head and was able to come up with my plan. Tell me what you think.

*1.* I‚Äôm currently in the process of Enlisting in the Army. I got a very respectable score on my ASVAB and am able to get any job I please, thankfully. I‚Äôve decided i‚Äôm going to enlist in a networking occupation. 

*2.* While in I plan on taking advantage of my college benefits and pursue a degree in networking as well. I figure I can be almost done with my bachelors if I work hard enough by the end of my 4 year contract. 

*3.* Also while i‚Äôm in I want to try and save at least 35% of everything I make. 

*4.* At the end of the contract I plan on attempting to find a networking job in the city of Atlanta. This is just mainly because I‚Äôve always liked the state of Georgia and have wanted to live there. So this is a big goal of mine as well. 

I also hope to use my VA Loan at some point for a home, but that wouldn‚Äôt be for awhile. 

But, you know what they say. Hope for the best but plan for the worst. So that‚Äôs why I have a plan B.

Points 1 -3 remain exactly the same. However, in the event i‚Äôm unsuccessful in finding a job with my degree and skills, I will then pursue a job in law enforcement. Military background and college will make it very ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to get a job with a local police department. Again, this would be in Georgia however that‚Äôs not really relevant.

During this time, the tailor covering the store in my home town quit so that she could be home with her new baby and toddler. I was asked to cover both stores. This was fine for me and I didn‚Äôt ask for a raise since splitting my time meant that I didn‚Äôt have to drive as much. After a year and a half, the company found another tailor whom I trained to take over the store that is 40miles away and I took over the store close to home. It has been one full year since my base store has been the one close to home and now the tailor in the other store is quitting. 

It‚Äôs very likely that they will ask me to cover both stores again. This means that:

1. I‚Äôll be driving 160-240 miles/wk

2. I will have the work of two stores to complete in the same amount of time as a normal work week.

Many are incredibly smart, talented, or have a ton of potential, but they are all apathetic, lazy (not the best term but fits for the moment), and cynical. They don‚Äôt value anything they are getting from school and so they never put their effort into anything. 

I think there is a huge issue with students that have a fixed learning mindset vs a growth learning mindset.  Students believe deep down that they are simply not good enough and will never get better so why try? ‚ÄúSome people are just born smarter or more talented‚Äù.  ‚ÄúWhy work so hard at something that I can‚Äôt be successful at? ‚Äú

I‚Äôm trying to reach out to these kids and changing their belief system is paramount to that. I would like to tell them about a different person or story each week that reflects that ANYONE can learn/grow/succeed if they work at it and try their hardest.

He also does not have a file of many photos of his ex on his phone or computer, it was just the one.

I am extremely hurt and it feels like he chose his ex over me. Once I found out, he offered to immediately delete the phone conversation with his ex and delete her number off his phone.

So it‚Äôs not an excuse, but I‚Äôm a 21 year old girl, I‚Äôve been depressed probably since I was nine. (I think I was put on Prozac around then.)  I struggle with several things. Anxiety, depression, my weight, motivation.

I have congenital hypothyroidism. I was born without a thyroid, and I use to be a decent weight when I was younger. (I did gymnastics, ballet.) but my life went to crap around 7 years old. (Neglect/family drug issues, moving, didn‚Äôt go to school very often.) 

It‚Äôs hard for me to exercise since I feel like I have no motivation. I feel like a child, I feel helpless. I get tired easily and I hate myself on a constant basis. When everything feels like it‚Äôs going better, something happens and breaks my happiness. 

I feel like the only reason I can smile and feel like it‚Äôs all okay is because I have my boyfriend, my grandparents and my dog. 

I dropped out of college because the stress was pushing me to limits, I had to be put in the hospital. I have debt piling up, and it feels like I‚Äôm trapped, lonely, ugly, stupid, fat, worthless..

506,"Hi r/Advice people!

I‚Äôm at a place in my life (19 NB they/them) where I‚Äôm confused about everything I‚Äôm doing. Here‚Äôs the context:

As a student I was placed in the ‚Äúgifted‚Äù program from grades 4-12. I got honour roll (average above 80%) in grades 10-12. I never really felt like I had to study or do homework to succeed in high school, and I always procrastinated until the last minute when I did. I pulled an all-nighter or two in grade 12 to keep up. 
I graduated high school when I was 17, and went to university in Toronto the September after because I felt like it was what I was supposed to do. 
At the time, I looked up to my high school teachers a lot, and I wanted to be like them, so I entered a mathematics honours bachelor of arts program with the plan of getting my bachelor of education afterwards.  
Also, I started dating a girl (let‚Äôs call her Penny) I knew from high school right after I graduated. She was very sweet and we had a lot of common beliefs. 

In my first year of university, I lived with my family. I was living 1.5 hours away from my university via public transportation. I worked once a week at a caf√©. 
I was taking plant science, law and morality, calculus, statistics, and linear algebra as a full time student. 
I was really struggling with my maths because there was so much at home practice I needed to be doing, but I just avoided it as much as I could.
There‚Äôs this really cool side effect of the gifted program that makes me and a lot of my friends feel like an anxious failure if we can‚Äôt understand things right away, so I would often find myself crying over maths homework and getting too frustrated to continue. In fact, the only time I‚Äôve been drunk enough to fall down a flight of stairs was the night I had taken my calculus exam. üòÇ
As for plant science and law and morality, I did well in those courses because I only really had to show up and listen to perform well in tests and tutorials. 
My university went on strike during my second semester, so I ended up dropping a few of my courses. I used the strike as an excuse to do so, because I was feeling overwhelmed and wanted to drop them anyway - I was given an easy way out!
Also during this year, I would take public transit to go see Penny every weekend, because she lived and continued to go to high school in the suburban town we grew up in, a few towns over from Toronto. 
She would come visit me occasionally, but I was usually the one to travel. 
I finished my first year and gained from it: one university friend, and less than a year‚Äôs worth of credits. I ended up getting a A‚Äôs in plant science and law and morality, a B in statistics, and a C in calculus. 

After I struggled so much in my first year, I thought I was in the wrong program, so I decided to switch to a history HBA. I was also feeling extremely isolated and lonely. 
Part of this was my relationship with Penny, as we had certain rules that I had to tell her a week or two in advance if I was going to see friends so that she wouldn‚Äôt feel freaked out when I was unable to text her back. I had to build a habit of checking my texts constantly to try and take care of her when she would feel this way. 
To try and make things better for myself, I decided to live on university residence for my second year. Penny had also graduated and applied to universities, and she ended up attending the same university as me, and living in the same residence a few floors below me. 

When the year started, I was very excited to do frosh week events and residence events and try to get out there and meet people, while also balancing spending time with Penny. I ended up spending a lot of time in her residence room. There were a lot of days when Penny wouldn‚Äôt want to leave her room, so I stayed with her there and missed a lot of the smaller frosh events, but I made sure to go to the big ones like the carnival and beach trip. I made some good friends during frosh that lived on my floor in residence too. Including a great dude who we‚Äôll call Jacob, he comes up later. When the normal routine of school started, I felt like I was almost living in Penny‚Äôs room. There were many times that I slept on her floor. My room felt dark and unused because of how little time was spent in there. 

As the first semester went on, my relationship with Penny got worse and worse. I had found someone on campus to sell me weed, and I started smoking way more than I ever had in the past because I didn‚Äôt have my family around to have to hide it from. Penny had been worried about my relationship with weed for a long time, and instituted the rule that I had to tell her every time I was going to smoke before I did, just so she could ‚Äúknow‚Äù about it. Of course, this turned into her telling me not to smoke, and when I would smoke anyway because it‚Äôs my body my choice, she would get upset with me. She believed I was a suffering addict, and made me promise to quit. I lied to her over and over again and smoked behind her back, though she would notice when she kissed me or was near me, and she kicked me out of her room once for it. 

Also, Penny was very jealous of the time I spent with Jacob. Me and him got very close very fast! We‚Äôd smoke together and hang out in the evenings a lot climbing buildings and shit on campus, and when I told Penny about a funny moment when Jacob was getting changed in front of me and how I had to look away to not see his junk, and Penny‚Äôs response was ‚Äúso you‚Äôre bragging that you didn‚Äôt cheat on me?‚Äù. ü•¥

Penny also convinced me to go back onto Prozac, which I had taken in the past for anxiety issues. As well, she convinced me to go to therapy, which ended up being a few unproductive sessions with a social worker. 

She would borrow/ask for money a lot, and I would oblige because I loved her; buying her ubers to/from her work, food, clothes, gifts.... Which was all my choice. But the way she relentlessly asked for these things leaves a bad taste in my mouth, saying that gifts were her love language and without them she didn‚Äôt feel loved. She had borrowed &lt;1K to pay her credit card debt off near the start of our relationship, which she would pay back and then borrow and then pay back, rinse repeat. 

Living on residence, all of our food had to come from the cafeterias and other food stores on campus. A lot of the time that I spent with Penny, she would ask me to go get food for her. Often, I wouldn‚Äôt want food myself at these times because I have some weird undiagnosed stomach issue that often makes it hard for me to eat a complete meal, if at all. So, I obliged her again and again until it started to feel lonely doing it. And it began to be embarrassing, as my friends would see me walking around campus with bags from 1-3 different food stores, ask about it, and I‚Äôd have to say that I was getting food just for Penny. I began asking her to come with me, and refusing to go alone. Penny would say she didn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt just help her, or she‚Äôd say that if I didn‚Äôt get the food for her then she just wouldn‚Äôt eat. I would also do similar things for her such as her laundry, but the food trips were the biggest issue like that. 

Eventually our relationship degraded and we went on a break during winter reading week, which for me, was a week long weed &amp; depression bender in my residence room. During this time, I got the phone number of some random 20-something guy on omegle to sext/send nudes for a night. I blocked him the day after. I told Penny about this when we were considering getting back together, but for her it was the final straw and we broke up for good, after 1.5 years. 

Now this was all a pretty big distraction from school. I didn‚Äôt do any homework. I dropped courses.
After I broke up with Penny, I got to spend time with my new university friends as much as I wanted to. I didn‚Äôt have to text my girlfriend all the time anymore. It was a change that my friends noticed. Jacob brought it up on his own, saying that he was elated that I had nothing to do with Penny anymore, and how it was nice to spend time with me where I wasn‚Äôt looking at my phone constantly. It was pretty big shock to me, because the whole time I was dating Penny I was convinced that I was receiving the best love that I would ever get, and that all of our problems were my fault. But more friends kept saying things like what Jacob said, that the way Penny treated me made them uncomfortable, worried, and/or angry. It gave me a lot of clarity. 

I spent the second semester of my second year living life with my new university friends, processing everything that had happened, and just kind of hanging out. 
I dropped courses again. I finished the year with two D‚Äôs in Canadian and Greek/Roman history, and an F in my online Indigenous history course. Not very impressive. 

I spent last summer working full time and finding a place to live for September. Me and Jacob decided to find a place to live together off campus, and he was away all summer working so I did all the legwork. üòÅ
I found us a cheap two bedroom apartment, and we moved in around the end of August. 

I enrolled as a part time student for this year, so I can work and go to school at the same time, so I only have two courses to worry about. I work in a caf√© 10-25 hours a week right now. I pay for all my tuition, rent, and bills myself, except my mom still pays my phone bill for me. I owe 11K on my student loan so far. It‚Äôs the second half of first semester now, and I haven‚Äôt done any readings or projects because I can‚Äôt bring myself to focus on it. 

I‚Äôve been thinking for a long time that I have undiagnosed ADHD that is causing so many issues for me (as a child I got into fights, sent to the office over and over again for not paying attention, etc etc). So maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on but I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm also still in the habit of smoking on a daily basis, which is probably affecting my brain and energy too. 

I‚Äôve also become more of a coward than I used to be. I like living and being alive VERY MUCH, and I can‚Äôt get the worry out of my head that if I become a high school teacher, I‚Äôm putting myself at risk. People get assaulted/murdered for being trans all the time, and I‚Äôm worried about getting hurt by a parent or a student, since there‚Äôs no way to hide being nonbinary unless I want to be misgendered for the rest of my life. 

I feel drained. And like a failure. And it‚Äôs hurting my self-esteem. I‚Äôm tired of school and I want to get out and start working and living or close to it as soon as I can. 

I applied to the Automotive Repair Technician program at the College of the North Atlantic in St. John‚Äôs, Newfoundland. Mostly for shits, but I kind of want to do it. 

If I did, it would be a big year for me, as I‚Äôd be moving to another side of the country, probably all by myself. 

Here are the questions I‚Äôm asking myself:

Should I drop out of my university courses now to save money? 
Should I stop whining and stick to university until I‚Äôm finished, likely 6-10 years from now?
Should I go to college to see if I succeed?
Should I go to college here, near my friends, or in another province near the ocean that I‚Äôve always loved but never lived in?
Am I doomed to change my mind yet again about what I want to with my life do every time I settle in????

Any and all advice or comments are greatly appreciated. üíõ",03Nov2019,1

511,"Hi,

I recently just got out of a almost 9 year relationship. The only relationship I had been in my entire life. We met when I was 19 and he was 27.

He was an artist and 'app developer' with a game soon to be released to the app store when I met him. 

Now, we got into a relationship, I would say out of love and somewhat survival for me. My mom had just left the state over night with some guy she just met, making me effectively homeless. I worked full time and went to school full time. At the time my EX and I were very good friends. He always wanted more but I had emotional problems with men/sex/relationships bla bla bla and was never ready, but i did truly love him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I expressed those feelings to him many times of not being ready to be in a relationship that I needed to get my shit straight because I was lost. He would always feed me some hippy dippy stuff of life passing you by and when a relationship appears its meant to be.

So after having to drop out of school to work full time and living in my car. I caved began a relationship with him and he let me move in. At the time he lived in a family home with 2 of his younger brothers. They were not happy that I was there, even though the youngest brother and I were the same age and had mutual friend group and WERE always friendly to one another before hand. I had limited access to everything. I could not cook, clean, go out with them, limited use of the bathroom. EVERYTHING i did was monitored and bitched about. So thinking about it maybe i was extra cautious and had more self imposed limits? I even remember some nights having to go sleep in my car because i had stayed 3 days in a row and they bitched about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I lived out of boxes in my car for the first 3 years. Then the 4rth year one brother moved out. Making an open room for me in the 3 bedroom house. No, I was not allowed to have a room for me or my stuff and my EX was not going to clean up or make space in me for his room. 5th year the last brother moves out. NOW in all this time im still not allowed to have my things out, even though as you can imagine living with 3 brothers who are ANTI cleaning how gross a house could be.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways after they had moved out things for me had gotten better. I finally convinced my ex to allow me to work. He never worked because he was still 'working on his app and couldnt be weighed down with a 9-5 thats beneath him' But I could, got a pretty decent job that allowed to me to work with animals and then I got into rescuing dogs. Now while I'm doing this he is leaving the country maybe every 6 weeks to go 'work in japan.' I dont really question him. I assume his family is paying the tickets and giving him money. But he says that this job is going to be for him animating games and pay around 10g a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

That sounds great. He is going to Japan now all the time, NEVER coming home with money. I demand to see a contract or what hes been working on or any proof. Emails between him and his fellow employees. He says thats not how it works and I am dumb dont understand the industry and how everything is done by phone call. I said ok show me a call log... and I was again told how dumb I am.

Eventually he caves and tells me his grandparents are going to sell the house unless he starts paying rent or gets a job. He says there is no job in Japan, but he does look for one when he goes and I should be thankful because when he goes the lies buy more time for us and the dogs to continue living at the house.

I feel an immense amount of guilt at that point because his grandparents are in their late 80s. He is their golden boy who they think is going to come back rich and famous. They are also incredibly upset because the lie the told them is that he goes to Japan, does all this work and then they say they are going to deposit the money in his account, but then shocking they never do. So he has to fly to Japan to get the money then he gets tricked into working for free again is the cycle .

&amp;#x200B;

So last January while he was in Japan, I told his grandparents everything. That i was leaving him and there was NO job and that he needed mental rehabilitation because to behave like that is something is wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

He comes back begs me to stay with him and that he will make it right. Well he didn't he left for Japan 4 more times since January this year and he left last weekend. He didnt even tell me he was going. He just texted me while I was at work said his plane was taking off, he loved me and he would see me next week.

I asked my work to transfer. The next day. Packed up all my dogs and stuff and drove to an office in another state 6 hours away. Currently staying at friends, while my dogs are boarded at my work.

&amp;#x200B;

He said that I am just copying him to punish him and that all these lies were for me and our 'family' 

&amp;#x200B;

I am having a very hard time transitioning. I hate him, I miss him, finding a place to live has been a nightmare, he always said i couldnt make it on my own and maybe he was right.

&amp;#x200B;

He was so supporitve and destructive for me. Im so confused hurt and lost. I dont know what to do or say.

How do i get out of this feelings. I just want to call him and cry and ask why he would do this to me? But all he says is that I did it to myself and I could have stayed.

But with all those lies, i dont know what was real anymore.",03Nov2019,2

I go back to work tomorrow and i stupidly pulled an all nighter again tonight. Should I just stay awake today and go to bed early? Would that fix my sleep schedule?

525,"Following the title. My parents are both trying to head out of Florida and start residing there. It's A LOT cheaper than living in New York. 

I had just started my dream job as a Veterinary Technician at my company a year ago and would like to make at least 2 years before I transfer to a company in a different state. I also have a boyfriend that I'm planning to move in with shortly. We are just waiting for his money to come in from his late grandfather so we can get a home, start a family and just live. 

I am fully aware of the fact that it's a little easier to move out to Florida but I am not ready to just drop everything and start new. I have things to take care of here and I would like to remain in the relationship I'm currently in without it being 'long distance'. My boyfriend is taking care of his grandmother who's health is basically depleting. So he is in no shape to leave either. 

I'm unsure of what to do. Any advice? I don't mind moving to Florida later on, just not as soon as my parents would like to. They've struggled for quite some time and I can understand the rush but for me, to just be starting life and my dream career, I'm not ready.",03Nov2019,2

She said how she's generally not a super affectionate person and how sometimes I can get too clingy. The example she told me is how like I'll see her one night and the next night I'll tell her I miss being with her and she finds that to be too much since she needs like a couple days to properly process the act of missing someone.

531,"   Hey everyone, I don't really post much. However, this been on my mind. Sorry for the format, I'm on mobile.

  So I want to explain a few things about me and my love life. I haven't dated in almost 5 years, with my last one ending really badly. I want to get into dating, but something about it I just can't. Love makes me really uncomfortable and any physical interaction makes me nervous and anxious. I don't know it is about it, but being in a relationship to me is mentally exhausting. That and I just been trying to figure out my sexuality, with me coming to the conclusion that I'm sexually fluid.

   Anyway, there's this girl in my grade. I'll call her Tyler, for the sake of privacy. She seems to be mentally unstable and has issues at home from what I observed. I also notice she falls in love easily, we be friends for around 2 years now. For awhile now I been noticing small signals from her. She would occasionally touch me, like putting her hand on my thigh. Or laying her head on my shoulder. At first I thought nothing of it till a few days ago, when she started saying things that I was absolutely sure she had a crush on me. I also want to mention, she had a crush on my other friend before me till she rejected her. I mentioned all the things that been happening to that friend and she said it sounds like all the things she did when she had a crush on her.

  And surprise, it turns out Tyler does have a crush on me. She ended confessing to me about it. Without really thinking, I ended up getting carried away and asked her out. She said yes. I told her I'm uncomfortable with people touching me but she still occasionally touches me. I told her if I still don't feel anything for her by the end of the week, we have to break up. I said that cause I do want to give her a chance, but I don't think my feeling will change for her. However, I really don't know what to do. It's halfway in the week, and I realized it takes time to fall in love and get to know a person. I thought a week isn't really enough time, cause apart of me does want to make this work. But as I mentioned before, I don't know if I can handle a relationship.

   I know this sounds kind of dumb, this whole story. But I really don't know what I should do, I'm not good at saying no and confrontation. Should I give it more time and stay in the relationship to try to make it work? Or should I just end it? It's so confusing, and thinking of it makes my head spin. I don't know what it is about physical interactions, but it makes me uncomfortable. Especially if it's romantic or sexual; I go into a panic and intense fear when it happens. Even small things like handshakes, holding hands, arm wrapped around me is a nightmare. I might just have social anxiety, idk.

   If anyone has any questions, I'll try to answer them as soon as possible.",03Nov2019,1

Been wanting some advice cause I've gotten to the point I dunno what to do.

My older brother lost his job two years ago and him and I are roommates, I pay for food and bills and he also begs me every other day for smokes and alcohol every Friday.
I haven't been able to save barely any money and its getting harder to pay for things. Every time i refuse to buy his habits he either guilts me or punches n kicks things, which I try to avoid and cave in.

He says he's putting in applications but he has standards even with no money, he refuses to work fast food and demands a certain pay as he says he ""deserves"" it. Since his old job paid decent till he was fired. We live in a small town so there's not much to work with and he gets angry whenever i ask if he put in any applications or called em.

I just dunno what to do? I wanna help him but he stresses me out, i wanna move but my parents tell me i need to wait till he gets his life together. When will that happen though ynow? 

Any advice or ideas are welcome. Thank you",03Nov2019,1

Few days later, I went over with a gift... I know I shouldnt have... and I regret it. But I did. It was a book about acting.. he wants to be an actor. 

So I went over and he wasnt home. But his roomie was... who told me I could wait inside. I felt like it was a bad idea but I did it. I went inside. Waited. He came home and was obviously surprised about me being there. 

He wasnt happy. Told me I was crossing boundaries.... 

I left and cried all the way home. I felt like a creepy stalker. I felt horrible about crossing boundaries. Felt like scum... it really wasnt my intention. It was sunday evening and I thought he would be home. Ive been to his apartment many times, so it wasnt like I googled his address or anything.

544,"#Basic outline
I'm a single mother to a toddler and I have another on the way in a few weeks, same father. He pays $25 per week in child support, I pay everything else. I am the sole custodial parent by mutual agreement, half the time he's in another state entirely and he likes to be free to come and go as he pleases.

I broke up with him about two months ago after he yelled at me in front of our son yet again, but I've effectively been a single mother since our son was two months old. I had to leave because he was physically aggressive and abusive. I excused his behaviour in the intervening months due to him having mental health issues, but I've had enough.

We're still friends though, and I don't interfere with him seeing our son. He can see him any time he likes, the only condition (mutually agreed on) is that these visits occur at his mother's house with his mother present because of his temper and instability. He can go from completely charming to downright aggressive and violent and threatening in an instant but he won't do it in front of his Mum (which tells me he does have an element of control over it).

#My query
Given this background, I'd like input on something that happened yesterday...

Due to the upcoming birth, I have to travel to the city once a month at a cost of approximately $600 each time. I've been paying that myself, haven't asked him to share the cost. Next month I have to stay in the city for the birth and took a loan for $2000 from my brother to pay for the accommodation for that period.

Ex offered to help with that expense and I accepted. He contributed $300 which I then put into the bank to use toward the October trip (since I had already paid for the final stay).

I didn't end up going to the city in October due to becoming seriously ill and being hospitalised so I thought ""to hell with it"" and spent $42 on a haircut since we're coming into Summer here. For context, my last haircut was February.

He cracked it at me when I told him (I'd gone to his Mum's to pick up our son). According to him I should reimburse him the $300 since I didn't go down this month, even though it was actually given toward the final stay. He didn't actually care about the money until I told him I'd had a haircut.

I feel that how I spent it was none of his business since I have *paid* the $2000 for the final stay, which that money was offered for.

So I'm looking for some input from men on this one; is he right that I should reimburse him, or should I stand my ground on this?

Currently house prices seem to continue to rise and my fear is it will get to the point that I cant afford one.

564,"( Throwaway account ) ( Sorry for english errors )

So a little backstory : My boyfriend ( 17M ) and i ( 15F ) started dating about a month ago . I will name him Alex . We had been friends for around a year before this , and since we began dating we spend all of our free time together . Alex and me , we are very close despite our new relationship and being young , which i know is what most young people say but take my word for it . We both value communication a lot and we discuss everything we can , but because of how i grow up it is difficult for me to express my emotions which my Alex is very understanding to . 

TW --- Some months ago there was a boy ( 15M ) who we were not ¬´ boyfriend and girlfriend ¬ª but we were more than friends ( i know now that this was a bad idea - it is embarrassing for me admit ) . I will name him Sam . Sam was not too kind to me and i often just do what he said because i have severe anxiety for telling people no ( Recently , i am a lot better at this ) . Sam would message me random things which made me not comfortable like ¬´ condom or no condom ? ¬ª when before i have said i did not want to have sex with him .

This happened until Sam told some classmates about our relationship , so i was angry at him and i did not speak to him until before the summer vacation , he apologised sincerely and i accepted it . Sam asked me to hook up a couple of times over the summer as well but i did not want to , so i just said to him that i was busy and we did not talk after . 

Three weeks ago Sam , he asked me again to hook up and i said that it won't happen because i have a boyfriend now . He apologised to me and said he did not know and he wished us the best . Then again last night Sam messaged me to ask if i can make him lose no nut novembre . I asked him if he has forgot when i told him about Alex and he said he had and apologised again . I thought it was strange for Sam saying that because my message about my boyfriend was right above when he messaged me , but i chose to give him the benefit of the doubt . 

I have some friends that I tell about Sam and they say to block him, but i feel mean to block people .

I would like to talk to Alex about Sam , Alex knows about Sam harrassing me before but i didn't tell him about three weeks before because i wanted to be able to defend myself and i didn't want to make it a big deal if it was not . 

I feel guilty if i tell Alex about it because it will seem like i am boasting about another boy wanting to hook up with me or i'm trying to make him angry and jealous . 

Also , sorry if this post seems like i exaggerate , please understand as well i have anxiety that makes these decisions very difficult .",03Nov2019,1
565,"I have a suicidal online friend.. he's 18. He's extremely mentally unstable and depressed 24/7. I've known him for about 4 years now. The only reason I didn't leave him 4 years ago is because he's super clingy and suicidal, and I was afraid that if I left he'd commit suicide and I'd feel the guilt for it. He once attempted suicide because he thought I was becoming close friends with another person, and didn't want to be replaced. 

Not to mention I haven't been entirely truthful to him about what I look like. I've been catfishing him for 4 years and I'm unable to leave. I wake up every morning and feel nothing but extreme guilt for lying to him for so long. It's no excuse for lying about my identity, but I was 14 at the time when this all started. I'm now 19 and in college. I want to move on with my life, but there's absolutely no way I'm able to end our friendship calmly. He's madly in love with me and thinks we're getting married. One time, I told him I didn't love him romantically and he had a mental breakdown, cried on the floor for 2 hours, etc, etc. He comes to me daily about how depressed he is. I think I've came to his rescue for 200+ mental breakdowns. There's only so much I can do. I know if I just abandon him, he'll likely commit suicide. He's told me I'm one of the only reasons he's still alive. He told me a few days ago I'm the only reason he hasn't put a bullet in his head. I told him he shouldn't be dependent on a person to stay alive because that's unhealthy. It affects my own personal life so much. I feel trapped and miserable, because everyday I wake up to a ton of texts about how much he hates his life. I try to give advice and come to the rescue and make him happy, but it's exhausting after 4 years straight of this. I'm not really sure how to go about this. I've tried every excuse in the book to distance myself, although I always reassure him I'm gonna be there for him if he needs someone to talk to.

His suicidal thoughts have gotten way worse the past few months as I've tried to distance myself. His parents are going through a divorce and he tells me he doesn't know if he'll make it to 2020. If he doesn't tell his therapist about his suicidal thoughts next week, I think I'm going to message his mother on facebook, show her some screenshots of him saying he wants to kill himself, and then just leave. I'm exhausted. Although I'm terrified if I tell his mother, he'll feel betrayed and kill himself because of me. He told me there's no way in hell his parents could find out about his suicidal thoughts. He thinks it will destroy his family even more.

I'm also scared to message his mother on facebook because I don't want to be investigated and tracked down by the police if he kills himself. Since I'm his friend (and I've been catfishing him), I'm afraid I'll get in trouble even though all I've done is give him love and support. 

His mental breakdowns and suicidal thoughts make me anxious 24/7, keep me up at night, and I'm losing my ability to function normally. I'm so lost. My life would be really happy if he could just get help and move on and stop relying on me. What do I do? Is there anything I even can do? 

Thanks so much.",03Nov2019,1
567,"Hey everyone, 
So I have a 6month old pup and it‚Äôs almost time for him to be desexed, however when I think about it getting done it makes me sad for him, like ‚Äúhe‚Äôll never have puppies of his own‚Äù type of feeling, I know obviously he won‚Äôt be having puppies either way because I can‚Äôt support a bunch of puppies and their are no dogs around for him to mate with, but I feel cruel taking that away from him,

568,"Last year I caught my BF of 5 years with a pair of panties in his pocket. Long story short, he said they were his and it has been his secret thing for a long time, never told anyone. Now, I am all about dudes in yummy undies but I have never knowingly had the chance to meet someone with this fetish or life-choice or whatever. My first reaction was ""this dude is cheating"" but I gave him the benefit and we moved on. After that night I did some research and found a few posts that tell a similar story but with the men who were cheating just keeping up appearances by wearing panties all the time and pretending to be into it. It's been about a year and I have had no one to consult about this because I will never expose him if it's a sincere thing. I just don't know how to figure out if it's real or just a mask. I have deep seeded trust issues from my childhood so I am alway suspicious of every damn thing and I would hate to misplace my distrust. 


Has anyone here had a similar experience? What did you do? Is this a common solution men use to avoid being caught cheating?",03Nov2019,1

573,"   I have a friend who I haven‚Äôt seen in 2 years coming back for Thanksgiving. She moved away for college with her family so there was no opportunity to really drive out and see her. She recently texted our friend group‚Äòs old chat and said that she wants to get everyone back together and hang out. Unfortunately though, she is the only one unaware that there was a falling out between me and another friend and I don‚Äôt know how to approach this.
   I‚Äôll try and keep this brief.
There was only me, two other girls, and a guy left in the group after she moved away for college.
Me and the only guy in the friend group had a failure of a hookup. The hookup actually hurt me deeply because he was a really good friend that I trusted. I told him how I felt leading up into it and he reciprocated these feelings with his own and at the time it made sense. I was a virgin and he wasn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know if that actually means anything from an outside perspective but to me it means that it was easy for him to end things in the middle and ignore me and play video games on my PS4 lol. Needless to say I was angry, and everything that he did before just became so easily unlikeable. I was the one to constantly drive. We made plans around his comforts. He refused to go camping or do things that he didn‚Äôt like- never got out of his comfort zone. But anyway, I liked driving but he assumed that I was the designated group driver all the time. Me and him were the only ones with our own personal cars. My car was a two door cobalt with those joint backseats. You, know? You had to pull the front seats forward and scramble into the back. He had a four door with actual back seats. I was still the one to drive. Even if he it more than two of us. He never paid up for it, which frankly I don‚Äôt mind, as long as you kind of showed you appreciated it. My other friends would offer me food or coffee (which I preferred honestly). They would show their gratitude and I noticed that he would rarely, if ever do that. It wasn‚Äôt required all the time but at least show me you appreciate it a little. Also it didn‚Äôt help that he banged up my car a couple of times and didn‚Äôt give a shit. That car was my baby wtf. Let the doors swing open and hit whatever was nearby, forgetting that they were heavy and gravity exists. He also scratched up my dash because he forced a giant cooler in between it and the seat. Not thinking to move the seat back or, you know, ask to open the trunk. I‚Äôm sorry, but I really loved my car and these were the only times where I actually yelled at him. 
    The best part which I have to share is that I hung out with him after the hookup to try and give him a chance. Understand that I was still angry as everything was still kind of fresh and he was on thin ice with me. He wanted to go to the mall and I was really disinterested in driving him. He said he would pay me gas money. Holy shit, I thought, really?! So I obliged. Told me he won‚Äôt pay for my whole tank which, again, I was still baffled that he was giving me gas money at all. (even though after all these years of not paying he owes me a whole gas station lol) 
He gave me two dollars.
I‚Äôm not joking.
Two whole crisp ones. I was livid.
    But here‚Äôs the thing, I could say all this shit to my friend when she comes back. Be honest with how he made me feel and share everything else that pissed me off. Completely unload everything that made me so upset. But, he was also one of my best friends. We were all friends, and after everything happened the two remaining girls immediately took my side and are telling me to just drop him. I can‚Äôt. As pissed off as he made me and how it makes me now there was a lot of good stuff too. He helped me when a very important person in my life died. We were so open with eachother and I can‚Äôt bring myself to just look at him the way they do. I feel responsible for essentially ruining their opinions of him. I don‚Äôt want to do that with our friend when she comes back to visit. She wasn‚Äôt involved when any of this went down and I don‚Äôt want her opinions of a friend she knew to be influenced by some drama that I can‚Äôt figure out. The worst part I think is that he doesn‚Äôt even know that the other two girls don‚Äôt like him, which is %100 on me. However, I was told that he never hung out with either of them when I wasn‚Äôt around. It was never just him with another one of our friends like when it was just me and him hanging out. They never really texted eachother outside of the group chat. So they claim they weren‚Äôt close with him anyway which I kind of want to see as bullshit in a way? But I know it‚Äôs not. However, now my friend wants to meet up and there‚Äôs all this awkward bad blood. I want to put up with everything and ignore it for the sake of seeing my friend but I don‚Äôt know how to approach everyone and ultimately I know that‚Äôs not a good idea. Should I tell her the truth? Should I try and be friends with him again after how he made me feel? I know I could just drop him as a friend because I can accept that we all move on.  But, I still really can‚Äôt. I know I should probably let him know about the other two girls or at least try and get in contact with him before we actually make plans with our old friend. But I really don‚Äôt know how to approach this. The few people I talked to all said leave him and that everything he did constitutes him as being a shitty friend (trust me, there was a lot more that happened but I didn‚Äôt want to make this longer than it needed to be) But I can‚Äôt let go of the good, because I still don‚Äôt know if the bad even outweighs the good or if this is something that can be worked through. Is it worth repairing the friendship? Also he did try. He was open to my feelings. But it seemed like he was very apathetic when it counted. Maybe I should have communicated more. This is probably the last time she will ever see us together and, I don‚Äôt know, maybe we can just drop everything and pretend like it‚Äôs fine for this visit and her sake. 

TL;DR
A long time friend is coming back from college for Thanksgiving. She doesn‚Äôt know I had a failure hookup up with the guy friend in the group which ended up hurting me deeply. She also doesn‚Äôt know that the rest of the friend group doesn‚Äôt like him and wants to get everyone together. I still want to be his friend but at the same time I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. Is it? What do you propose I should do?

 ALSO: If you want more context feel free to ask. If I need to clarify let me know because I really need to hear outside perspectives and I tried to share the two sides. It seems very ranty though, which I apologize but this bothered me for a while.

But whatever happens, I am not driving his ass ever again. That I know.",03Nov2019,2
575,"I'm 23F. I have mental health problems (depression and anxiety disorder). I never thought that I am good enough for anything or anyone and I never really need to care about it much as well. Recently I met some online people that I like (as a friend of course) but I feel like I am not good enough for them. I feel sorry that they had to meet me and all I do is bringing more problems for them. I felt happy for a while, having people to talk to, but then I start thinking that I sucks, boring, stupid, etc, and I don't deserve having them around. I can't make them happy and my solution to this is to leave them, ignoring them if they text me (not blocking them). In my head, I am sparing them from disaster, that is me. I also barely text people first, just in case they don't wanna talk to me again, I don't want to bother them. I tried to change that and sometimes I text them first but I can't stop thinking how annoying I must be. They probably don't want to talk to me or they have things to do, and then there's me, asking for attention. I thought I was doing a bit better but lately it's been very overwhelming. I guess maybe I just feel a bit down but idk. I do kinda want to keep these people around but at the same time, I think they don't deserve this as well.

578,"So just some background information: Im in grad school for physical therapy. It‚Äôs my first year. I‚Äôm having a really hard time transitioning to a professional program. 

There‚Äôs this one professor who is extremely cold. He‚Äôs intimidating and likes putting students on the spot. 
I receive the worst grades in his classes when compared to my grades in other classes. I consistently fail all the clinical evaluations that he marks. He knows that I‚Äôm struggling in his courses and he treats me like an idiot. I had this huge issue with public evaluations, public speaking and had to get on medication. He knows I‚Äôm on beta blocker from it. He knows that I‚Äôm in student accessibilities and counselling for this stuff.  

I asked him about specific hand position for this specific assessment, it was on the neck. I asked if it was correct and instead of telling me if it was correct or not he kept quizzing me about the vertebra I was on. I was put on the spot and I was frazzled so I didn‚Äôt answer them correctly. To top it off, he had to tell me that he didn‚Äôt understand what I was saying and that I have to stop mumbling. He made me feel like such an idiot and super incompetent when all I wanted to know was if I was in the right position. It seriously killed my mood for the rest of the lab and I didn‚Äôt end up really picking the rest of the stuff up. 

There‚Äôs a few other incidents that happened in the last few months. 

It‚Äôs sort of a chicken or the egg thing. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm struggling because of how he treats me or he treats me this way because I‚Äôm struggling. It‚Äôs probably both because I can‚Äôt stand to study his material and I don‚Äôt ask for help because of the way he treats me. I‚Äôm consistently going to office hours for other professors and other classes. I‚Äôm also doing consistently better in those classes and passing all the clinical assessments.",03Nov2019,0

580,"Hey everyone,

I (20M) have started crushing on a friend of mine (19F) and for the past two months or so and I still haven‚Äôt made a move. She recently got out of a serious/long relationship and doesn‚Äôt seem to be ready for anything else. Another one of my friends was telling me a few days back that now she wants to rebound and wanted to hook up with someone (which if that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôd just be turned off from her immediately), but she hasn‚Äôt done anything yet.

My gut is telling me to just go for it and tell her I like her, but another part of me is saying to take it slow because it doesn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôs ready for anything yet and I don‚Äôt wanna wait it out, as well as the fact that I fear running the friendship. What‚Äôs the best option here?

584,"After living with my parents for about year and half after college, I finally found a great full-time job about 45 minutes away. My dad (who is pretty well-off at this point) was so excited and proud that he wanted to entirely pay for an apartment nearby for me for a year. My girlfriend lives in my parents guest bedroom and also has a job kind of close to that apartment. We have always intended to move in together but my dad is STRONGLY opposed to cohabitation so we just avoided the conversation for too long. 

My dad was disappointed when I told him my girlfriend wanted to come with me, and he even cried about me moving out. At the time I thought he was sad about the change, but I recently learned he was just that disappointed in my choice. He told me he didnt want to make those decisions for me though, and it was ultimately up to me.

Yesterday we started moving my stuff into the apartment and my dad didn't talk to my girlfriend at all. He wasn't acting like himself and he got worse and worse as the day progressed. I went with him to pick up dinner while my mom and girlfriend did some decorating stuff, and for the entire car ride he asked me questions like ""is it my fault you are doing this?"", ""did I rush you into this decision?"", ""do you understand that either of you can always stay at my house?"". And that's about when he started crying again. When we got back to the apartment he said everyone should stay at the house tonight and I agreed. 

I talked to my girlfriend on the way home and we decided that she shouldnt live with me or sign the lease like we had planned. Instead, I will move in to that apartment and stay there during the week and she will visit me after work every single day. She'll leave whenever she wants to. We decided we couldn't put my dad in a situation where we was a party to something that he is extremely opposed to. It just wasn't fair. And really, my parents house is almost as close to her work as my place is, whereas the apartment is like 10 minutes from where I work.

When we got home we told my parents we needed to talk. We said we intended to live together but we just couldn't do it knowing how my dad felt about it. If we were paying for the place it'd be different, but saving money is more important to us than having our own place. We told them what we planned to do with her visiting and that I would come home frequently. Then we had a really cool, fun conversation about premarital sex and shit like that. It was extremely awkward, and while my parents feel more comfortable now, they have implicated themselves into my sex life and it feels so gross and weird for both me and my girlfriend. 

How do I get back to feeling normal? I'm not excited about my apartment anymore, and I'm not really excited about the new job either. While it does make me sad to leave my house and it makes my parents sad, I feel like I can't just grow up. While I want to get married to my girlfriend, it's not really a high priority for either of us and now it seems top of mind. But right now I feel weird sitting in the same room as my parents, and it feels awkward to touch my girlfriend in any way. She feels the same way - like we're being supervised.

588,"I‚Äôm in my first year of college right now and the transition has been rough. In high school, I had a really close group of friends and the 6 of us did basically everything together and got along really well. Now we‚Äôre scattered across the continent and I haven‚Äôt seen most of them since August and won‚Äôt again until thanksgiving. In addition, shortly after I went to college my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me over text because of the distance. Neither of us were satisfied with the relationship at that point but I wasn‚Äôt willing to throw away 2 years of building a relationship without trying to fix it and she was.

I‚Äôm a very private person with people that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with, and that makes it difficult to make friends a lot of the time. People tend to get weirded out and not stick around long enough for me to actually feel comfortable expressing myself to them. The reason I‚Äôm like this is because I‚Äôve had a lot of bad experiences opening up to people that I shouldn‚Äôt have trusted and I‚Äôm not willing to do that again. Basically everyone that I‚Äôm friends with (friends being a loose term here) I met because of forced social interaction in my scholarship program, my freshman seminar, or the a cappella group I joined on campus.

It‚Äôs been really difficult for me because there‚Äôs really nobody that I feel comfortable with in the way that I was with my friends in high school. We had built up relationships over the 4+ years that I knew them and so I felt very confident whenever I asked them to do something that I wasn‚Äôt bothering them or interrupting something that was more important to them. Ideally I‚Äôd like to build up those sorts of relationships with people at college.

I‚Äôve met only 3 people at college that I‚Äôve felt really comfortable with. The problem is that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable asking any of them to do something for a variety of reasons. One of these people in the vocal director of my a cappella group and she‚Äôs a very kind person but she does a million different things and spends a lot of her free time with her boyfriend who I also know and like being around, but I feel really awkward third wheeling. I‚Äôd feel weird asking her to do something without her boyfriend because I know both of them, but I‚Äôd also feel weird asking both of them to do something with me so I really only see her when I run into her. Another of these people is also in my a cappella group and he‚Äôs a similar story. He‚Äôs an engineering major and has an insanely tough schedule this semester and is in a long term relationship that takes up a lot of his free time. The last person is someone I met because we‚Äôre in the same scholarship program, have the same two majors, and a ton of other things in common. She was the first person I connected with on campus and instantly made me feel really comfortable around her. After my girlfriend broke up with me, I also began to have feelings for her. I go out of my way to talk to her as much as is reasonable and when we do talk it‚Äôs the highlight of my day but she‚Äôs very independent and spends most of her free time by herself and doesn‚Äôt want to change that. As much as I‚Äôd like to be closer with her and potentially ask her out it doesn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôd want either of those things.

The advice I‚Äôm asking for is basically what should I do? Most of the time I feel super lonely because there‚Äôs a huge hole where my social life used to be and I‚Äôm not sure whether I should try to pursue better social relationships with the people I mentioned or fill the time with other things or find ways to cope better.",03Nov2019,2

i was 15 at the time, i have a part-time job working as an art assistant for an art institute; this was my first ever job and it‚Äôs fairly new since i started this summer :) ; the job requires me to also take classes at the institute so i was pretty much busy everyday all summer lang while all my friends travelled... 

btw i‚Äôm not rich ive just worked so much that i can‚Äôt StAnD

i currently studying abroad in japan on a semester exchange program i left around (August of this year)

while working 8 hours a week for my job,
i‚Äôve been attending Japanese Class at a community college so i could get extra credits + extra language learning. My class was about 20 hrs a week on top of my job and art classes so i was a pretty busy person.

(btw, please excuse my poor grammar i haven‚Äôt been using english for a while)

so it all starts when my friend (who i didn‚Äôt know also liked me at the time, invited me to join a band at another art institute, while school was still in session, I was just finishing up my Sophomore year of highschool (2019).
I decided to join the band and become a vocalist because i wanted more things to add to my college resume. I‚Äôm in the band for a while, and i start to get closer to all the members in the band; there is only one other female member asides myself, but, she just became a freshman so there‚Äôs a small age gap. Little Did I know person who invited me to the band, really only invited me bc his one friend let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúC‚Äù was pressuring him to. This friend and I have been close, since, he became a vent for all my anxiety and depression; i made it clear i wasn‚Äôt looking for any relationships due to my mental instability, from my tough childhood, I‚Äôm the daughter of a HELLA Catholic, Mentally Abused, Marine Core Gulf War Vet, with severe mental and physical health issues, along with a Carefree Immigrant uncaring mother who is waiting to collect my Dad‚Äôs Death Pension. 
My only goal at the time was to get tf out of my home which is literally a hoarder home (Why I am studying abroad) , We got CPS called one time because my dad texted suicide hotline saying he was going to.. ya know... and CPS got involved because of the mess in the home and unregistered weapons my Dad had from before you needed a license to possess firearms. (Btw for anyone worried about that my dad would never harm anyone with a firearm, they were all locked, and in cases in the ceiling crawl hole, you need a long mass ladder to get there. )
I was also bullied and mentally abused by my catholic school teachers as a kid, but that‚Äôs another story and i‚Äôm taking up too much space.

Anywho, back to my friend who had the pleasure of knowing all that.. He knew I wasn‚Äôt going to date him so he basically, was being a good friend and got over his feelings... Now, C had supposedly been eyeing me too but he supposedly backed of because of my friend.

Time passes on and I and C get to know each other more.. He plays Piano for our band and I think he‚Äôs pretty cool ig... 
He then asks me to play LoL with him; and never having played i agreed... More time passes I get to know C more and more... And I grow this feeling of iMMeNsE Admiration; This was by the time summer ended.. Meaning I had my Job, and Classes... I wanted to spend more time with C so I ask him if he wants to take classes at my Job and he was like OkaY.
I take a day off work and class to help him sign up,  etc. And that evening I had to go to my Cousin‚Äôs Play; My Cousin also has a messed up family but i won‚Äôt get into that... 
So, When I said I was going to the play C tags along.. Btw I forgot to mention this but C is vegan and I am not ( this will become relevant soon ). He basically told me we should ditch the play, EVEN THOUGH I bought flowers for my cousin and paid for an uber to the next MF county.. Okay, Okay, so things move along and he told me he liked me and I said Oh Okay... I kind of did too ig...
Keep in mind I‚Äôm hella busy so I. don‚Äôt have time to talk about stuff like that since my schedule is super tight... I proceed to carry on with my life until it‚Äôs finally my scheduled break which I planned to go to anime expo, and spend tim with all my friends, before I left for Japan... Now C says he wants to come with me etc. SO GUESS WHO BUYS A $150Something Dollar Ticket (4day) Ticket so he can hang out with me and my friends since he is broke, and jobless, and older than me, and the guy.
Now i wouldn‚Äôt mind if HE ACTUALLY LET ME ENJOY THE DAY... But No. He dragged me to LoL EVERY DAY... I was sick but bc I liked him I didn‚Äôt say anything... Last Day of AX... I was mad but i. denial so I asked him is we were dating and he said no; SO ME BEING A MF Dumbass says ‚Äúwill you go out with me?‚Äù; TAKE INTO THE COUNT IM YOUNGER AND NAIVE AND STUPID; I was in a toxic middleschool relationship for like a day.. That‚Äôs the only experience I have... 
He was like ‚ÄúSuRe‚Äù.
A month passes in the relationship and i‚Äôm buying EXPENSIVE (WholeFoods) VEGAN food and Presents and buying uber‚Äôs, and trying to be nice and hoping that he would return the favor maybe once or be nicer and more caring etc. but no... THE ONLY THING HE WANTS IS FOR ME TO HAVE *** WITH HIM.. MF PIECE OF ****... *SeLfDeStRUCtInG*
If he was nice, or considerate, or ya know A DECENT PERSON-

Anyways to continue the story... 
I was about 1 month from leaving for my departure to Japan, I‚Äôve been busy going to class and work; and C tells me to ditch my job which is supporting both of us financially as if we are married and shi*. 
And I‚Äôm like... WTF; but I am going to be honest I was such a dumbass I felt this way but I was like maybe things will change...
He then tells me he got 2 black kittens and that he‚Äôs taking vegan rights activist trip to Guatemala tomorrow..I was like WTAF... But all I said was I hope you have a safe flight ‚Äú:)‚Äù...  
HE KNOWS HE WONT COME BACK UNTIL AFTER I LEAVE... He doesn‚Äôt wanna say goodbye to me... 
He does crazy drugs and alcohol i Guatemala; tells me he wishes I was there, and then tells me he doesn‚Äôt want me to judge his ass for doing drugs and shi underaged + unknowingly hurting my feelings... 
I was just like WtF...
OH AND HE LEFT his card unattended at his parents home... He was like OH my brothers will take care of them and some bs. 
anywho.. I finally take off for Japan...
And, I call him once I get to Japan saying I won‚Äôt have internet for a couple weeks bc i‚Äôm trying to get settled etc. HE THEN CALLS UP MY FRIENDS AND TELLS THEM THAT I HAD NOTHING BETTER ELSE TO DO IN JAPAN AND THAT I SHOULD BE CALLING HIS A**; Like Wtf happened to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy for you ‚Äú:)‚Äù‚Äù... My whole friend group is shook, I‚Äôm shook, And a week later I finally IN NICEST WAY I COULD Broke up with his disgusting scum... I told him the it‚Äôs me changing for the better statement etc.; he responded with; oH You better not jusT be DoinG thiS beCause you think your not worthy. 
I FLIP MY SHIT ON THE INSIDE... And stop responding, after I finished the deed. 

it‚Äôs been a month since then and I still can‚Äôt believe how much of a nice dumbass I was wtf was I doing... 
But to explain this whole ass stories‚Äô caption... 
Whenever I look back and reflect on that; I am disgusted not only by him but by the mf cats... I always think that they are foul since they are associated with his scum...

Btw I‚Äôm so mf Lazy i don‚Äôt block people I hate on Ig so he stalks my profile even tho idgaf bc i‚Äôm in my dream country which i worked hard to be at; with classes, grades, and scholarships...
BUT MY FRIENDS SHOW ME VIDEOS FROM HIS STORY OF THE MF CATS AND I WANNA THroWUp so help me :,(",03Nov2019,0

One day I borrowed my mom's phone and when i looked at her contacts she was talking with a girl named grace and they where ""sexting"" and she was also talking to other people. my father isnt around a lot mostly once every four months and when i was a kid my mother would talk about what my father is going through for us, but now she cheats on him just like that.

594,"I'm back again.

&amp;#x200B;

I  (21F) currently own a DROID MAXX that was built in 2016. My dad has a bunch of phones back from when he was working at his tech job (not going to go into details because it's a bit personal, but I assure you he didn't steal them, everything he did was legit). About 2 years ago I dropped my old phone and broke it (can't remember the model - but it was definitely an android). My Dad got a bit mad about it but hey - shit happens - and he gave me one of his back ups. It works fine, but I'm beginning to notice that I can't obtain some apps anymore. Like tumblr for example - I uninstalled it once due to reasons, and now I can't get the app anymore because it says ""Your device is not compatible with this version."" I've updated Google Play and my phone, and everything is up to snuff, but still no luck. Another example is tinder. Same problem. And when I downloaded Instagram successfully - every time I tried to open the app it would crash.

I'm not sure if my phone is just outdated or there's something else going on. I'm thinking about doing a factory reset, but I have a feeling that won't fix it either. I'm afraid to ask for a new phone because I don't want another hand-me-down. I would like something recent but not too expensive. I have the money to buy myself a new phone - but if my dad finds out I feel like that would hurt his feelings. I know it sounds a bit odd, but since Christmas is coming up I feel like it's a good opportunity to ask for a new phone. 

Sorry if this seems disorganized. I'm just not quite sure what to do. I tend to overthink some things. Thoughts?",03Nov2019,1
595,"Okay, so there is this one girl that I've known for 4 years now. She's the closest person to me and to be quite honest, I'm in love with her. I've confessed to her in the past and she said she felt the same which made me happy.  However, the problem here is I said things I shouldn't have and really hurt her. We're still friends and she knows I never meant them, but wants to get back together. I really do too, but the one thing I've never mentioned to her is I'm dealing with depression, anxiety, and past trauma and I just don't want to take it out on her. I have a tendency to ruin the good things in my life (self-destructive behaviours we'll call them). I love her too much to make her deal with that. I keep rejecting her because I'm afraid I'll say something to hurt her again. She thinks it's because I don't feel the same and it's killing me that I might lose her. Whenever I talk about what I'm going through to someone they treat me like a freak. So I generally have trouble opening up to people. I don't know if I should just let her find someone more deserving of her, or what. All I know is I want her to be happy. Any advice would help. Thank you.",03Nov2019,1
596,"So I've been talking to this guy for a while now and we've been considering getting in a relationship. The only thing is that I found out he's anti-vax. He said it's because of a video he once saw about a girl who ended up with autism and other disorders. I told him that, if the video was real, that she probably already had those things before she got vaccinated. I offered to send him a different video that talked about the actual side effect of vaccines compared to what diseases can do, and he agreed to watch it. We didn't really fight over it or anything. I'd like to think it was a more mature conversation. My only question is what is the best way to proceed with this conversation?",03Nov2019,0

 Last night my mom had to come up stairs because I was coughing so loud and wake me up. I hit her last night because I was so scared. Then I started crying and just hugging her for like a solid 30 minutes while hyper ventilating.

 I don't know what to do. I don't watch anything scary. I can't remember the nightmares. I just wake up scared or crying. Does anyone know how to get nightmares to calm down?",03Nov2019,13
598,"Hello :) Teenage girl here, since Saturday i have been having this weird feeling on my stomach. Im thinking i could be bloated which is fine ya know whatever, except i dont really get bloated that bad and its never made me feel this way. If i could describe it i would say its like feeling really full, or like someone is putting pressure on my abdominal area, plus my stomach looks a little bloated.

I thought it was cramps since my period is due soon, so keep that in mind. My sister thinks that its cause Halloween is just over and that maybe i ate too much but in reality, i didnt go trick or treating so therefore i didnt haveuch sweets.

And finally the day before Halloween i had a 24 hour bug so idk note that?

602,"Title. My girlfriend has serious jealousy problems. We're both 18 and in senior year of high school. She will hit me, yell at me, and threaten to break up with me over little things like bringing up a friend's date the night before. 

The most recent example would be when my friend (M) came to me for advice on what to say to a girl he likes. I told him my honest opinion and wished him luck. A few days pass and he texts me how everything went. I was happy for him so I told my girlfriend. I told her how he thought she was really beautiful and just his type. He said he really likes her because she is latina, I relayed this to my girlfriend and she got jealous here, and started saying things like ""maybe you should be with her then"". 
She hit me a few times, threw a couple ""are you f*cking kidding me""s in there, then told me to get out of her car.
I'm laying in bed typing this.

I know this might be a simple fix to just break up with her, but she's really good. I do love her, I'm just more worried for if this would continue, how would it effect the relationship in the long run.

This happens everytime im doing something that makes me feel nervous and is normal to me. I start shaking and i feel very nauseos(dont know how to spell that but my stomach hurts).

I need advice. How can i get this feeling and throwing up thing away from me. I really dont want to screw this up.",03Nov2019,1
604,"Ok so the story goes as follows: 

So last week I was having a regular text conversation with a really close friend. As we were texting I decided to say a few things on my mind but rather discreetly because this person has thing for twisting words to play the pity and victim card. So I told the person how they‚Äôve change and how I felt and they grilled me and asked for details. I straightforward but still a bit vague. After that conversation the person spoke directly to their friend (whom I don‚Äôt know, but know of). Let‚Äôs call this person Toxic. Toxic has many issues of his own but I knew that this person would defend my friends place and give them the backbone they need cause the rest of friend group will refuse to take sides. For the reference Toxic isn‚Äôt apart of the friend group, he‚Äôs a a friend they met online. Toxic proceed to tell my friend to cut me off and how my friend was reluctant to do so and told him they‚Äôd inquire further about the conversation which they thought wasn‚Äôt a conversation. ‚ÄúOk, fair enough,‚Äù I said. I also have been told that in that conversation the friend said ‚ÄúI really didn‚Äôt want to care at all about what she said.‚Äù So, you do care? Even a little bit? So then fast forward the person called two people, one of which was already close to me and the other which I began getting close to (they too are their friend). They told them their side and then it was my turn again. I was in a very... ‚ÄúI was burnt out by their BS and I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to care but since we were still friends they have a right to know how I feel‚Äù state.

Brief summary for what I said: 
- You‚Äôve become emotionally unstable (you have uncontrollable random emotions i.e. really happy, mad etc.)
- You‚Äôve become insensitive and inconsiderate about how people feel.
- You use degrading language like it‚Äôs regular (i.e. ‚Äúyou‚Äôre useless) 
- You use the ‚ÄúTHATS how I am excuse‚Äù for everything 
- You‚Äôre not easy to approach or make happy anymore
- You‚Äôre self sabotaging

They wanted an example for everything I said but I refused to give a single one. The reason being, if I did, they would try to find everything wrong with a said and dismantle my whole argument. Plus I have a shitty memory. And most importantly, this is how I‚Äôve felt, how are you going to argue against how I feel? Then the person told Toxic and toxic used a line I said as a pure joke. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt apologize to me. Apologize to yourself, because you did this to yourself.‚Äù I said that cause they were pissing me off cause I knew about the conversation they had the night before with Toxic and got reminded of it. Plus I didn‚Äôt want to out the person who told me. I knew they never respected my honest opinion but that was another strike for me. Keep in mind I was talking on the phone with this person and they were DEAD SILENT, I had to ask if they were still there and I when I asked ‚Äúwhat do you want me to do?‚Äù NOTHING. Ok then. So then here‚Äôs something someone told me that they thought was a valid point, ‚ÄúHow is she the least sensitive, but is suddenly sensitive about me now?‚Äù. I already answered that which means you selectively chose to listen and pick and choose some parts. We‚Äôve already had similar discussions of this sort in the past, once in late 2018 and then in February 2019 THIS YEAR! I can‚Äôt help but notice a fuckinnnn patternnnn. Each time they fixed themselves then SOMETHING sets them back to point A, this time though is different cause I‚Äôm not playing or merely tip toeing around the subject. They‚Äôre being absolutely salty and childish. 

So now, I want someone to tell me what did I do wrong, was I wrong for bringing it up and what am I to do in this situation cause no one can give me advice aside from stay away and let it simmer down but I doubt it will simmer down anytime soon. Can‚Äôt we be cordial adults? We‚Äôve been friends since high school. Oh another key point we don‚Äôt live in the same city, and it‚Äôs harder to have a face to face and I doubt FaceTime is an option, or maybe it is, you tell me. Most importantly TF do I do about Toxic, and his bitch ass. I‚Äôm stumped.",03Nov2019,1

So one of my best friends is a party person. They‚Äôre also in a committed relationship. And I mean truly committed. I‚Äôve never seen a love like theirs. It‚Äôs one of a kind.

 So I was talking to said friend today and we were talking about fears. They said that one of their biggest fears is drinking so much and then having drunk sex with someone else and ultimately betraying their SO. But then that made me think of the question: Does that classify as cheating?

I mean, we all know that you can‚Äôt really consent to sex while drunk because you‚Äôre not coherent. But I‚Äôve also read some stories on here of people leaving their ex because they got drunk and ‚Äúcheated‚Äù on them. And some people say that they shouldn‚Äôt have gotten themselves in that situation in the first place, but what if they just go to a bar with some friends and just get black out drunk? They didn‚Äôt go to a bar with the intent to cheat on their SO but it happened because they weren‚Äôt aware of whatever the hell was going on. 

I‚Äôm fully against cheating. I‚Äôm in a committed relationship myself and I would never think to cheat on them. But I put myself in that situation with my SO and if they did that to me I would be truly at a loss of what to do.

I‚Äôm asking for different viewpoints so I can finally pick a side of how to handle this situation if it were to happen to me. And I‚Äôm sure a lot of people with say it‚Äôs such an obvious answer but, really, it isn‚Äôt. So please, Reddit. Help me!!!",03Nov2019,4

609,"[California] So my mom says that if she found out I were dating, hooking up with, or even friends with a 30 year old man, she'd literally kill me. 

Which got me thinking. She probably says that because she might see it as 'pedophilia' like why the fuck would a 30 year old want anything to do with a 19 year old. I'm obviously never going to tell her, but it's legal. We're consenting adults, we're not hurting anybody. 

My mom also says I'm not allowed to date, hook up with, or be friends with anyone who is older than 22. But she's also like 'who tf are you?' type of parent. 

I do understand where she's coming from though. Our kids will always be our babies for the rest of our lives, I wouldn't feel comfortable with my kid fuckin a grown ass man, but if they're of age and they're being smart/not hurting anybody. I say go ahead.

I have been performing vvery poorly this past two years, and i really cant get interested in what im doing.I feel like programming and coding is a skill that should be developed early on if you want to have a competetive edge and now that im 20 nearing 21 i feel its too late.I dont know i really like this,personally i could problably study programming excucevily but my uni is filled with computer enginnering and architecture lesssons as well as other complex stuff that is completly trash and nearly useless to a programmer.I really cant get into the mood to start coding causse of the pressuyre the other lessson from uni are giving me and i feel like its wasting time if i study somehting not related to passing my lessons or getting better grades.

I legit feel i might have chosen poorly,but honestly its problably weird to say i dont feel the youthful excitement or energy i had for stuff and feels taught moving on from this point.There is problably no wayt i can take a break cause im already perfoming poorly and cant afford to fall even further behind,im just constantly in worry and i feel what im doing has no meaning what so ever for my future,it seemsunlikely to lead me to an enjoyable life.

I currently love reading chinese fantasy novels,exercice,and learning new skills,but i also feel like it wont benefit my future,and that i cant really become good at anything starting at this age.",03Nov2019,4

620,"Hello everyone,

I'm hoping that this is the right subreddit to ask such a drawn out and convoluted question. Admittedly this is probably something I should be asking a therapist or psychologist about rather than Reddit, but hey, I don't have one! So here I am.

Quick background about myself: 23 years old, and I'm about to finish college next month and graduate with a degree, I've already been in my jobs ""field"" for a couple years now and will be moving up the ladder to something very high paying very soon. Grew up in Ohio until I was 14, then moved to PA and have lived here since. Currently with a girl who I've been with for about a year and a half. I wouldn't consider myself ""depressed"" as I used to have severe depression during High School as a teen, and what I feel right now isn't ***that***, but something strangely similar? I am not sad and don't feel any sense that I don't enjoy my own life, I just feel that the ""eagerness"" of my life has come to a stop and I'm not sure how to make it move forward again.

I am not quite sure where to begin, so I will summarize how I currently feel and then go more into detail.

**Weird state of Limbo, nothing of interest**

Basically, my life for the past year or so has just felt like a weird limbo where I'm just waiting for something to happen in my life. For example, when you graduate High School, you are now finished with that and are awaiting the job/college. Or whenever you go through a breakup, you're finished with the relationship and are awaiting the next one or enjoying life as a single person. When you move away, you've finished your ""life"" in that area and are awaiting all of the opportunites and people you'll meet in the next place. I'm sure you get the idea. 

However, in my current stage, I feel like I'm in a weird permanent state of limbo where I'm in the ""in-between"" where I haven't quite ""finished"" anything and there's nothing worthwhile happening soon either. However I feel that I'm at a point where I'm afraid I might be stuck in this state permanently. It's a strange sense of nothingness that feels infinite. This is only one of the many things that I feel are wrong in my life at the moment.

**Inability to move forward \[mentaly\], can't seem to put a seal on my past**

Another strange thing is that I constantly think about the past and, despite my life LITERALLY moving forward and moving up the job ladder and achieving great things in my life, I still mentally cannot seem to move ""forward"". I am not quite sure how to describe it, or what I'm having trouble ""moving forward"" from. Like I'm autonomously succeeding in life but deep down, I just seem to be stuck in a timeless limbo. It feels like maybe a couple years after I graduated high school is when the ""limbo"" began. To be more specific, I am always thinking about my more youthful days of Middle School and High School where I had A LOT of friends and it seemed that I was making new friends and connections nearly every single day. I also always think about all of the females in my past that have flirted with me or had taken an interest in me that, at the time, I was oblivious to and ignored. I think about all of the ""could have beens"" if I had taken my chances with one of them, or I will think about the friends and girlfriends I had in Ohio and how things could be different if I had never moved. I'll even go as far as looking up people from my past online and seeing that most of them are a lot different now, have kids, etc. And then I look at myself \[present day\] and wonder what they would currently think of me now. Not that it matters because we haven't talked in years, but I guess a big part of me misses everyone from my past. My friends, previous relationships, and even family members. I miss them all. At my current age, I only have several friends that I've retained from high school. Didn't make many friends in college because I just commute, and my co-workers, while we're ""friends"" we aren't ""outside of work"" friends so it's kind of meh.

Just as well, this year alone, a few people that I knew from my ""Ohio"" days have died which has put things into weird perspectives for me as well. One older friend died from a Heroin overdose, another from cancer, and another from what I believe was suicide. It feels strange for me for people in my past that I feel I haven't had ""closure"" with to either now be dead, or to be fully grown and have kids where it would be ""weird"" for me to reach out to them now.

**Finding my place in the World**

As I mentioned earlier, obviously I feel my life anymore is just a state of limbo where nothing of interest has happened recently nor will it anytime soon. I know where I belong in the world, as I'm making achievements in my field of interest. But despite my successes, I still just feel like It's whatever and doesn't matter. It pays the bills and allows me to do the things I love, but it just doesn't satisfy me. I am not meeting new people, I am not making any new connections, and everyone just seems to be too busy or caught up in their own personal stuff that makes it hard to really ""connect"" with anyone anymore. I feel like at my job I'm just co-existing with these people. There is nothing wholesome about it. It feels robotic, just as my life has felt for a while.

I should mention that I had a previous relationship for a long time that ended in 2017, and after that I did feel another sense of happiness because it was a sort of alleviation where I started hanging out with a lot more people, catching up with older friends and making new friends from those friends. At that point is when my ""social"" life peaked again and it felt like it used to, but then that sort of died down again once I got into my new relationship and now I am back to only really talking to the same 4 or 5 friends again and only seeing them maybe once every couple weeks.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, I feel that right before I started college back in 2015 was the last time I had a huge ""motivational"" attitude and was happy and felt that I was really going somewhere. Then as soon as college started that feeling tanked and I've never felt like I was truly ""living life"" to my fullest since then. As mentioned previously, the only time I felt this feeling again was after my last breakup where I met a lot of new people after the breakup and made a lot more friends. But it has since gone away again and I feel like every day I am just doing the robotic dance of going to work and coming home and doing nothing. I feel lifeless and that I'm autonomously succeeding without actually feeling the mental reward of such successes.

If you actually made it through this post, I appreciate you taking the time to read it. Again, I know this is probably more for a therapist but maybe someone on here might know what I can do to move forward again. Thank you!",03Nov2019,4
621,"Okay so I've had this friend for 10+ years. Ever since he met me he has been liking me. Every once in awhile he brings it up and I have to politely tell him no and that he needs to move on because it isn't healthy to continue to go after someone who says no. Then I think he gets better until the next time he brings it up.

He's a decent friend, though a little bit on the desperate side. No self esteem. No ambition in life too. The ""If I had a gf all my problems would magically disappear"" type. This might sound harsh but it is true and I figure you need some insight into him. He's nice and funny, but has a lot of issues.

635,"Okay so, I feel like a bad person here...I have most things anyone could want at 23. I have my own business doing around average wage in the U.K and it's great. I have a gf, friends, family members. But I'm not happy. I can't seem to figure out why. 

My friends are good, bless them. But I dont go out with them or see them that often. (Once a month maybe) just to link and smoke. It's very rare to he honest. The last tike I saw any friend was 2 months ago. I always wanted to go out or have a flat party but they're not that type. I do appreciate them. they're support and wouldnt change any of them. I just want something different like friends who do go out to the bar, or set up flat parties or just more then sitting in a hot box for the day. Maybe it's me? Or wanting something more? Or maybe just more regularly? 

Gf is the same story- dont really see eachother use to be once a week but it's been a month. I get the feeling that we're becoming different. I dont know - it doesnt seem to be a spark. Shes great, attractive and funny. But little things start to bug me. For example- she doesnt like selfies. When I ever I take a picture she covers her face or I have to delete it. I get that it's her self esteem but we dont really do anything together. I wanted to go do things ...and most of the time it's a no, or shes not interested. Now I kinda dont bother and just stick to dates in a restaurant. I know that she wouldnt like dancing class, or workshops or anything of the sort. She gets mad really quickly and jumps to conclusions too which are annoying. She says in the moment like ""You dont do anything for me"" and this springs into my head from time to time. And all I'm trying to do is fix my own mental health issues, along with family problems, along with business. It's like I have nothing more to give? 

I dont know if its just me being stupid. But I want more from life then this. I want to have fun and go experience the world and what it has to offer. That why I started my own business in the first place. To go out and travel and meet people. Maybe I'm in the wrong circle? I dont really know the answer to this. Im just unhappy with this.

641,"So, I probably need to make a few things clear. I'm quite self-conscious when it comes to asking for advice online, and I really hope I didn't make too many mistakes writing this.

I recently started to flirt with this man again - he was my first true love, and honestly one of the nicest people I ever met. He always respected my feelings, he never did anything bad or something that made me uncomfortable, and I still trust him. We broke up a few years ago (the reasons why aren't important to this story), but I could never forget about him and our relationship means a lot to me. We also stayed friends after our break up. We both planned on meeting again, and I really think it might work out this time. That's why I referred to him as my almost-boyfriend.

We started chatting a few weeks ago, and he mentioned that he and a very good friend of his went on a holiday together, about two years ago. That's where they met this family with a dog and two young girls, and they all became friends. I thought it was pretty great that they were able to stay friends after their holiday, and apperently, they keep meeting each other from time to time; and this weekend, both my almost-boyfriend and his friend spent their weekend with this family. Which, again, is absolutely fine with me.

But he keeps sending me pictures whenever he meets this perfect little family, and I find this annoying for two reasons: one, I don't even know these people. I now have tons of pictures of this family that I have never met before. Yesterday I told him to stop sending me these pictures - again, he knows me pretty well. That's why I hope that he got the hint I gave him. Two, most of these pictures show the two children - either just them or him playing with the girls. I don't want this to sound like he's a pedophile, which he clearly isn't - I mean, it would be a whole different story if they were related to each other. It's just that I really don't care if he spends time with these kids or not. He's a nice person, and if he has fun with these kids, that's alright with me.

When he sent me pictures yesterday, however, he also sent me one which showed one of the girls laying next to him in his bed, playing on her phone. From the other pictures, I assume both kids are between 7 and 11 years old. He then texted me something like ""guess who crawled into my bed this morning"", and apparently, they always do this when he sleeps at their house. 

Which is weird, right?

Am I the only one who finds this odd? 

I know that they are just friends and that the girls are way too young to understand how I might see these things. And I'm being honest here, I am a little jealous at this girl laying next to him in bed. I don't like it. And he *knows* that I can be jealous sometimes, even if it's nothing - also, he acts the same way whenever I talked about other men when we were still a couple. 

Am I weird for feeling envious when I think of these girls cuddling with him? Is it unreasonable?

I cleary need advice, because I have no idea how I should approach this situation. I mean, how would he feel if I spended my weekends cuddlung in bed with an 11 year old boy? And they are doing this since months now. What will happen when the girls get older? Will they still cuddle in his bed when they are 14, 15 years old? Where and when will he draw the line? Or what if I moved in with him and the girls stayed overnight - will I be pushed out of the bed in the morning because these girls want to cuddle with him?

Should I interfere at all or just leave it alone? I'm not sure if I want a conversation about this... I hate that my thoughts seem to have their own will sometimes, but I can't change it.",03Nov2019,1

In one of my seminar classes a guy started talking to me (this was like on week 3) and as it was a discussion based class I engaged in conversation with him. I only have this class once a week so didn‚Äôt see him again until the next week.

The next week after that he got quite clingy, which I found a bit strange considering I‚Äôve know him for about 2 hours max. We started talking about films and our favourite horrors, and he often talked over me which was a little frustrating but i let it slide. He kept trying to recommend me films, which I didn‚Äôt mind because I like finding good stuff to watch.

644,"Lately I've really been struggling mentally and I think I should talk to someone about it, but I don't really have anyone to talk to.

My parents wouldn't understand and just make fun of me and my friends have their own problems to deal with.
There is only one friend I'd feel comfortable enough to tell, but she's been having a hard time the past few days and I'd feel shitty to draw the attention to my problems right now.

None of my family or friends know about it and I don't know how to tell them. 
I've considered informing a teacher of my situation because I don't feel like I can keep up with all the assignments and exams because of my mental health, but I'm not too close to any of the teachers and I don't think they care anyways.

It would probably be a smart idea to seek out to a therapist for help, but I'm very anxious and I don't even know if I can do that without my parents' permission, because I'm 17 years old.

What should I do?

645,"I have known my friend, we'll call her Hannah, for around a year. We didn't talk too much before, but now we talk pretty frequently. She really cares about people and is nice, but it's been getting to me recently.

It all started when she broke up with her girlfriend. That's when Hannah started to be around me constantly. I didn't really mind it. But any time that I would seem quiet or a bit bothered, she would immediately be super worried about what happened, asking me what's wrong, asking if it was her fault, if it's something to do with my family, etc.

One time, I had a really bad day, and I didn't want to talk to anyone. She ended up contacting one of my family members and asking if I was okay. I don't know how she got their contact.

I try to give her the hint that she's being too much, and she keeps on asking why I'm so depressed around her. She once asked for me to not leave her because I'm one of her only friends.

I don't like being around her, but I don't want to leave her with no friends. I'm really conflicted on what to do, if I should stay for her sake, or leave for my sake. I feel like an asshole for being annoyed. Any help is appreciated.",03Nov2019,4

648,"This is just friend group drama I'm involved in and I don't know what to do. I'll assign pseudonyms to make this easier to understand.

So there's me, Dan, Mark, Steve and Emma (all fake names)

Dan has a crush on Emma. He's had a crush on her for like 4 months and he's been going for her. She's kind of ""out of his league"" (I know that doesn't exist but you know what I mean). Emma has been going out with Dan a lot though, kinda getting closer to him and shit.

Recently, Mark told me and another close friend named Steve that Emma doesn't like Dan back. This was (in my mind) super bad news because Dan has a huuuge crush on Emma, and he'll be super hurt if he finds out about this.

Anyways, Emma is sort of an attention whore, and she's leading dan on big time. Mark is a very close friend to Emma. I, trying to be a good friend to Dan, told Mark to tell Emma to stop leading him on. Steve, Mark, and Emma ended up going to a coffee shop and talking this out. Since then, Emma has been sort of ghosting Dan, and she's been talking to Mark a lot.

I thought that everything was fine and dandy, until Dan told me that Mark has a crush on Emma. He had a very reliable, trustworthy, mutual friend source for this so I think it's true. I ended up confessing to Dan about how I told Mark to talk to Emma. I told Dan that I thought Mark had pure intentions, which is genuinely true. I am not entirely sure if Steve knows that Mark has a crush on Emma or not, but I think it's safest not to tell him. 

The thing is, it's true that Emma didn't like Dan back. But at the same time, was it in Mark's place to tell Emma that Dan likes her? Did Mark intentionally split Emma and Dan apart to become closer to Emma?

I know this is all stupid highschool drama, but it matters to me because our friend group is extremely tight-knit. We're all practically best friends. Dan and Mark have such a close friendship, but after I told Dan what I thought Mark is doing, Dan told me he will never trust Mark again. Also, I am inherently involved because I spilled the beans to Dan. What do you guys think I should do? Should I just stay completely silent on the matter?",03Nov2019,0
649,"Hello, I have recently wanted to seriously begin an adjustment in my life, which is; being healthier and stronger. I want to do this since I'm very weak for my age, and I eat unhealthy. Firstly I don't like to eat my mother's cooking, I barely finish a plate of what she cooks, and for breakfast I only drink a fruit smoothie and a few eggs, on weekdays I only drink a smoothie and a piece of bread or something. On Saturday and Sundays we go out to eat or order food, McDonalds, Olive Garden, Chipotle, Burger King etc. I don't really eat snacks though(I haven't ate a bag of chips in probably two months). I honestly feel sorry for my mother since she cares about my health, but she's approaching 60, and I don't want to stress her out more. The main reason is that I'm physically weak, I struggle to carry something over 50 pounds, I was always weak (When I was 11 I struggled to even carry my 3 week year old nephew), I want to start lifting gaining arm and leg muscles, my job requires me to carry somewhat heavy things, and I see girls, and young women carry them with ease, and I can't, I don't care if they think I'm weak, I just don't want to be weak anymore. I also need tips on how to get better sleep, from February to July(of this year) I started to sleep only six to seven hours every night because I actually took a crush to seriously, since I brainstormed how to possibly ask her out, which was weird for me since I never bother to even ask a girl out, since I never really wanted a girlfriend. She was perfect(to me) she was really nice to me, and was attractive, and funny, I'm not shy, it's just that she is popular and shy was one of my only friends so I never even made a move(now she has a boyfriend, and we are we aren't friends anymore). So yes, exercising, nutrition, and sleep advice would help, Thank You.

651,"Hello.

I turned 20 this year. I haven't finished high school due to some problems back then, therefore I can't join college yet. (At least on my country).

My parents always tried to provide me the best conditions they could. Although, I just can't socialize with my mom. She trips over every meaningless thing, she doesn't recognize when she is wrong, she doesn't apologize, she screams, and she always needs to be the one having the last word.

Although I fucked up in school I tried to make it up.
I'm attending school this year, I worked last year full-time while attending school at night, and now that I don't work, I do a lot of stuff at home to help my parents. (cleaning, walking my dogs, cooking, washing clothes and dishes, etc). 

Since the house is theirs and apparently I can't point out what is wrong or right, my mother often comes up with the line ""why don't you leave the house? You're already old enough, pick up your stuff and leave""

To be honest, I'm so tired of all of this toxicity, I tried to fix this relation over the past years, I'm so done making the effort.

I want to leave my house and start my own life but I also don't want to enter in that path where I will only work and sleep. While I'm on my parent's, I have time to study, money to save and a life to plan.

654,"So I'm in 8th grade and have just turned 14. I have been friends with the friend in question for about 2-3 years, and he has always been very nice and behaved in school and out of school. I noticed that last year he started to hang out with people that I guess he saw to be more popular and had a higher social standpoint than him. Doing so, I noticed he started to act up during classes. For example, he would just search random stuff up on the school laptops for the entire class for every class, or he would just play around with friends around the room. This by itself, is fine. He started to hang out with his new friends more and distanced himself a bit from me, not on purpose, but at the same time I was a bit forgotten. Then his parents took his phone because one of his friends sent him an inappropriate video on snapchat. This was the first major thing that happened that sparked change. The next year (this current school year) I noticed the occasional talk of him having weed or a juul. I didn't really belive it, but during one of our classes he pulled out some sort of weed pen, and in another class he pulled out his juul and attempted to use it during class. This year he does no work, leaves his classes whenever he feels like, disrespects teachers, and isnt much of a great person now. Each day of school he comes in high or drunk, and even filled his water bottle with vodka in school and drank it. I think the worst part is that his brother is also and addict and is always supplying him with new drugs or just the regular weed and juul pods. 

I dont know what to do. Or what to tell him, as I am not as close with him anymore. I miss my old friend; the new one is too screwed up from drugs to call my friend anymore.

659,"I‚Äôve had this friend now for about 2 years. We‚Äôve gotten pretty close and over this past summer we hanged out a lot. I‚Äôve always felt like she was only friends with me cause she had no one else to hang with and that she was only using me for my car. I tried to get over these feelings, saying it‚Äôs in my head and I have trust issues.

Well I‚Äôm a senior in college and I‚Äôm really busy right now due to working almost full time, full time school and a 50 hour field placement. I barely have time for myself and my family. Let alone friends.

My other friends understand that I‚Äôm busy, they have lives, work and are in school. We can go weeks without hanging like nothings happened.

But my new friend gets upset when I say I don‚Äôt want to or can‚Äôt hang. She calls me boring, wack etc and at this point I‚Äôm getting tired of the name calling. We aren‚Äôt talking right now because I feel like she‚Äôs trying to get me to do things I don‚Äôt wanna do. Now she‚Äôs becoming all buddy buddy with some of our coworkers. Talking about them going to the movies etc in front of me.

A part of me doesn‚Äôt care, but another part of me does, just cause we‚Äôve spent so much time together. But I‚Äôm focusing on my life and education, while she‚Äôs willing to be stuck in the same dead end job.

My question I guess is am I wrong in this situation? And should I try to keep our friendship going and make more time for her?

665,"Hi, 
First time posting here and please excuse if the format isn't up to par.
I have a best friend of 10 years. She is going through a very difficult time in her life. Her mother passed about 3 years ago and it's still hard for her. She had a bad childhood and wasn't close with her mom. That being said, everytime we hang out it seems all she talks about is how much she hated her mom and how her life was and still is ruined because of her. She tends to talk about how bad her life is and always dominates the conversation. I'll try to change the subject but even when I say something she'll take over and talk about her life again for the next 45 minutes straight.
I feel like such an awful friend thinking this and she has every right to feel the way she does. But it's taking a toll and sucking the energy right out of me. I even make it so I see her once maybe twice a month because I just don't enjoy her company as much.
So I'm here asking for advice. I still want her in my life. I want to find a way to tell her how I feel but without coming off as attacking her or making her feel shame. I don't want to force her to be happy we all know that gets no where and as I said before she has every right to feel the way she does. I just want to enjoy my time with her without going through the same conversation she's been doing for the past couple of years.",03Nov2019,1
666,"We were having a regular conversation with some new people we met and everything was going fine. I was cracking jokes and taking notes for the class we were in. Everything felt like it was going great then all of a sudden when my close friend texted me when she left, she asked me straight up ‚Äúdo you have Aspergers?‚Äù 

Im obviously stunned and confused, so I ask her to go into details. She tells me the way I carry myself, the way I talk, the way I look is awkward. So that bummed me out a little bit and asked her for advice. She kept bringing up autism and I told her I‚Äôm not. She even agreed with me but she still keeps bringing it up. 

Then the real icing on top is that another friend asked me for help with her homework. Fair enough, I go and help her out, only for her to tell me to go away because she wanted to study with the ‚Äúcute guy‚Äù and she said she‚Äôd ask me through text. So that one kinda hurt the self esteem a little. 

So basically my question is: what can I do to make myself less socially awkward and maybe feel more confident about the way I look?

I was at a bar about a month ago and two sexy women walked up to me while I was on a second date with this girl I was talking to and they very quickly escalated the conversation from flirting to asking for a threesome. First, I didn‚Äôt really know what to say and liked the girl I was there with and didn‚Äôt want to scare her off. Second, I always worry about STD‚Äôs and the likes. My friends thought I was crazy for turning that down. It isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve had an offer like this though and I did nothing to solicit the offer.

Just because someone is extremely attractive doesn‚Äôt mean I immediately feel a need to have sex with them. Am I supposed to? I intentionally try to dress down these days and in comfortable clothes rather than my expensive nice ones because I hate that sort of attention and I feel objectified by women frequently rather than them valuing my character and intelligence. My most recent ex would always get mad that I wouldn‚Äôt dress up or style my hair and would put a hat on. I just want to be ordinary most days.

670,"This started a couple months ago when my mom met some dude on Words with Friends or something (she's 20 years divorced). They got to talking and almost immediately fell in ""love"". Now, a couple details about this guy: he works on an oil rig, can barely respond to messages, evidently is super rich and is a widower. So my mom wants to fill the hole left by his dead wife. But despite being so rich, he still needed her to send his ""son"" $100 for his birthday.

 This goes on for a bit, while me and our roommate B have been trying to tell her she's being played. He claimed he was going to show up at our front door and whisk her away. Well, the day came and went and he didn't show (duh). And my mom had cooked and gotten all dressed up and the whole nine for this fake fucker. This actually pissed B off, he said it was ""too far."" 

Well, after he didn't show up we thought she might get the hint. But instead she heard out his apologies and still for some reason believed that he was coming to get her. However, that didn't stop her from starting up a few more conversations with a couple more fake guys. Now there was one with a toddler (she sent me a pic and said ""meet your new baby brother!"" which was just horrible on all levels). Needless to say, this was an emotionally challenging time. 

Well, she forgot all about that guy but kept talking to the first one. Every couple days she falls in ""love"" with another knight in shining SCAM armor that's going to save her from poverty and take her to his big house where she can raise kids all over again. It's tiring, and a huge waste of her time. At first I was concerned about her getting hurt but now I'm a little annoyed at all this. How can she still believe that any one of these people is serious. I think it might be one guy or something that keeps contacting her under different names. Mainly because she said another dude messaged her warning her that ""one of them"" was lying to her. 

This morning she messaged me telling me she's moving to New York at the end of the month. I said I don't believe it. I've already asked her to leave me out of this shit.

679,"Hello everyone.
Just looking for a bit of advice here. Getting small details out of the way first. I currently am on disability and took up a paper route to make extra money.
Be advised that this is in a very small town. And, they can't pay a lot, but I feel I'm getting screw somehow.

They pay about 10 cents paper. And, I deliver 125 papers once a week, that adds up to 500 total month. I'm also out on my feet delivering them for 2-4 hours a day, and still getting next to nothing in wages after working for this company for just over a year. 
The manager is paying me $40. Once a month. And. Honestly I think it should be more for the amount of work that has to be done. I'm tired of it. I was expecting to see a raise after a while, but still nothing. I have even told him I am looking elsewhere for work, but he's desperate to keep me. 
I want to quit, but need the extra money. I just feel.this isn't worth it. Should I just go ahead or maybe ask for a raise? Advice?",03Nov2019,1
680,"Together for 2 years, long-distance for a year, but we see each other one week per month. We are each other firsts.

He respects me, he adores me, we are very compatible in terms of goals, free time, children, hobbies, you name it. We‚Äôre also very comfortable with each other.

We have been through some harder times but we managed to get through them. But the sex is still bad. He never gave me an orgasm although I showed him how to. **The worst was when I stopped him because it was painful and he got annoyed and said it was a waste of time, even if I was crying.** 

I broke up with him for a short period of time, and in the meantime I hooked up with an old friend and the sex was amazing. Before that, I thought something was wrong with my body.

My BF begged me to come back. We got back together. We decided to try harder. I saw that he was more willing to make me orgasm, but he still didn‚Äôt manage to. **But he wanted to make me orgasm, he really tried everything**. He said that 30 mins of foreplay and me not feeling anything is not alright. He told me to just make myself orgasm and then he can penetrate me like we used to do it (I can‚Äôt orgasm from penis alone, I need clitoral stimulation and I don‚Äôt feel anything from cunnilingus), but I want an orgasm from him.

Is it is technique? Is it me losing sexual attraction? Is just making myself orgasm and then letting him do me the answer? I‚Äôm very sad and frustrated and confused.

TL;DR: perfect-on-paper BF never gave me an orgasm and I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs because of me.",03Nov2019,1
681," I live in a college town apartment with about 10 units in my building. Each unit is 1 bedroom with a living room and kitchen. Underneath the units are covered parking spaces. I've never had problems with people taking my assigned spot. We can keep pets but there is a $300 security deposit and a monthly fee. Last night I got home from going out for dinner around 6 pm, and there was a cat meowing insistently and staring at the door across the hall from me. The door was locked, and I knocked very loudly multiple times. People taking their dogs out for walks frequently travel near my door, so I was immediately worried about how some dogs might react to a cat and so I opened my door to see if the cat would enter. It did, and it searched my apartment for its owner, but eventually seemed to calm down and let me pet it. I wrote a note and put it on the door to let the owner know that their cat was in my apartment. Around midnight I wrote another note and put my phone number on it to say I'd be up around 8-9 am to give them their cat. Then morning came and still nothing. I left for breakfast, came back around 11 and the note still hadn't been moved, and I hadn't gotten a message on my phone. I checked their parking spot, and a car is parked there. It's possible they went out last night and had gotten picked up. I looked into their windows and it still has furniture in it. I was worried they intentionally locked the cat out because they were moving. I was worried about calling my apartment office in case they hadn't paid the fees and that this would kick them out of their unit. This cat is clearly missing their owner. School is very stressful and midterms are next week. I am thinking about calling for a welfare check if they still don't answer in a few hours, but that may be going overboard. I would just rather be safe than sorry. Can you guys give me some advice for what to do?",03Nov2019,2
682,"I'm posting this from a throwaway since my son uses reddit and he knows my account!

My son is currently in high school, and he's one of the few white kids in a predominantly black school. As a result, most of his friends from school are black. They are a group of really awesome kids, really nice and kind, just really sweet kids. Overall, they've been a great influence on him.

Recently, my son had a birthday and, to celebrate, I let them spend the night while my wife and I had a night out, so the kids had a night out to themselves. When we got home late in the evening the boys were asleep and I looked at the pile of stuff in our living room. It was some typical gifts; a few cards, a new Switch game. But one thing worried me: it was a small card with the words ""n--r pass"" written on it.

Concerned, I asked my son about it the next morning once his friends had left. He at first claimed it was a joke but then sheepishly admitted that one of his friends, who is black, gave it to him. I guess the story is that since my son has been friends with them for so long, they considered him part of their social circle and thus told him it would be okay to use ""the word"" around them.

Now, my son's black friends do use that word, though mostly without the ""hard r"". When they've been over at our house I've struggled about what to say about it, because I personally strongly dislike that word and don't like them saying it. On the other hand, I realize that black people have sort of ""reclaimed"" the word and use it in a different way than it was historically used by white people. I have, however, told my son he is never to say it, which he agrees with.

What makes me feel more uneasy is that last night, my son told me that after they had given it to them, a few of the boys were egging him on to say the word for the first time. According to my son, he was uncomfortable, but did say it. Afterwards, they sort of cheered him on, and, afterwards, one of the boys assured him by saying ""don't worry, it's cool with us man"" (implying they are okay if he uses it).

I really, really am not comfortable with my son using that word, even if his black friends are okay with it and even if it's in a playful way. But also don't want to hurt my son's relationship with his friends, as I'm sure this was meant to be a gesture of friendship and acceptance from them. This is especially notable for us given that my son is very shy and has had difficulty making friends. What is the best way to handle this situation? What should I do?",03Nov2019,1
683,"first time writing here but I need advice and I guess this is the right place to do so.

688,"My parents both came from really bad situations. My mom's mom died when she was 2 and her father quickly got remarried. His new wife, Doris, hated my mom and was very emotionally abusive. My mom was forced to eat her own vomit once which is a story I hear often. My dad's parents got divorced before he was born. His mom probably should have been in a mental hospital. My dad grew up poor and had to dig through trash to get food. My dad moved in with his dad when he was 12 and was physically abused. I love my parents and admire how hard they worked to give me and my siblings a future. I blocked out my childhood for a long time but this morning I was reminded of how my dad treated my siblings and I growing up. My younger brother (12) was throwing a fit, there are reasons to believe he might have some mental issues. My mom tried to calm him down but he wouldn't stop screaming. My dad lost it. He started yelling at him. All of a sudden there's the sound of my dad punching the table. I know this doesn't seem bad and it's probably just me being sensitive but it reminded me of the times my dad threw chairs across the room and punched a hole in the wall and threw a plate at my sisters head. Please I just need someone to tell me if I'm overreacting. My family acts like this is normal and the fact I can't look my dad in the eye bothers me. I've tried so hard to forgive him but I just remember holding my little brother and sitting in the corner while he repeatedly hit my younger sister. I know this has to be considered abuse but no one is saying anything. I just hear about how my brother and sisters deserved it cause they were misbehaving. I have some sensory issues so getting a haircut is pretty hard for me so my sister cut my hair a few years ago. My dad said it was okay but my mom got home and flipped out. She yelled at my dad and my dad started yelling back. Their yelling turned to screaming and my mom screamed that she wanted a divorce. My dad threw a stool at the wall and broke the stool. My mom left the house and I was sitting on the couch crying. I heard them talking at night about what had happened. We had a vacation planned a few days later so we were packing up the car and my older sisters were fighting. My dad got angry and started yelling so my younger sister was crying and curled up in the back seat. My dad told her to get out of the car and she refused so he grabbed her by the hair and yanked her out of the car. I forgot to say ages so I was 12 my younger sister was 10 and my older sisters 14 and 16. When my dad pulled my sister out of the car I couldn't deal with it. I screamed at everyone to stop fighting but they didn't so I just remember standing there and crying. I used to have reoccurring nightmares where my dad would turn into a beast and I've have to hide and protect my family. I just need someone to tell me if I'm too sensitive or if something is wrong and I'm not overreacting. Another thing that I forgot to mention is I was never hit or spanked because I saw the marks and bruises on my siblings and did anything I was asked.

689,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. My mother (55/F) recently tried to commit suicide. She has been struggling with mental illness for quite some time, but I had no idea until recently how bad it was. She is currently in a mental hospital. She has no insurance, no home, no phone, no where to go. I have tried to help her with government assistance in the past but she will not cooperate. Other members of my family have tried to get her mental health treatment in the past but she would not follow through. I hope this latest event will begin to change her. 

My family and I are not sure where to begin. We are not sure when they will release her. Hopefully, she will be assigned a social worker and a treatment plan. Right now the waiting is killing us. How do I begin to help her?

We have been texting  for 2 months and we actually seem comfortable around each other. However, we haven‚Äôt even met in person or gone on a date yet. (Not a catfish I know she is real). The first month was understandable because I was busy with work and traveling all month, but it seemed like whenever I was free she was busy. Now the next month has come around and she was busy all the time. Then we set a date, but she completely ignored me the day of. Then the next day she told me it was mental health issues and that is totally understandable. Now this week she has closed off the possibility of going on a date all week due to her mental health. I‚Äôm starting to have doubts if it is worth it.

Do you think
A) I‚Äôm getting played
B) completely unfortunate timings and she is telling the truth
C) other

But today we were talking about some random stuff and she asked me if I wasa virgin and after some playing I told her yes ( I was in a relationship with a girl which didn't want to do it for a very long time so I never had the opportunity). Ayli's more experienced than I am. After that, we started talking about sex and so on, and at the end she started to say that she couldn't have sex with me because I was a virgin (for me virginity isn't much of a big deal, it's just your first time). I told her there was nothing wrong with that because I trust in her and I feel comfortable with her, and she does too. But Ayli doesn't want to ""take my virginity"" because she thinks I should do it with someone important to me and with no experience because I'd not like what she likes. 
That makes no sense. 1st I want to do it with her because I trust in her and we have a very good relationship. 2ndly it'd be better if I started with someone who has experience in order to learn more and try what she likes. 
In few words:Girl wants to have sex with me but then says she can't because I'm a virgin.

715,"I always want to draw. But anxiety keeps chains on my hands so I can't do anything. I get very nervous but my inner self still really want to create something.. does someone has this too? I will give some more info how it goes: 

So, I sit down at the table to draw and surprise surprise, anxiety is already there sitting with me when I am only thinking about wanting to draw something. Now, I am browsing through my collected things on insta or pinterest, but then constantly I think ""what if I cant draw again, what if I fail"" -I know this is a quite fixed mindset- 

(meanwhile reading a book about fixed and growth mindset) it's very good, give it a go if you feel like you are feeling to change your mindset too.

Back to the point. Most of the time I can't draw by myself, and I have to take my meds so I will calm the fuck down. So I take 2 of them and then I feel that I will get calmer. Then when the moment is there, I know I can squeeze out a drawing or some sketches or so.... but when the meds ""stop working"" I feel that I fall back into that dark hole of mine, and feeling stressed, scared and nervous again. 

So this is kind of everything I can say about it, I will try and answer any questions if you got any :)

716,"I moved into a new apartment yesterday (Saturday), and it is great. My wife and I love the apartment. The first day in here, we‚Äôre so excited, and so on. Already picturing many years living here.

Then, today, reality reared it‚Äôs ugly head: The guy living below us is a smoker, and because of course he doesn‚Äôt want his own apartment to smell like shit, he steps out onto his balcony‚Ä¶ where it all goes directly into our apartment. When we first moved in, our own balcony smelled like cigarettes, but we assumed it had been painters or cleaners smoking before we moved in. But now we know the truth, and our balcony is now unusable. It reeks of smoke all the time. And because the door to the balcony and the windows on that side of the apartment were open, our whole apartment quickly smelled absolutely horrible.

When it first started, we thought, ‚Äúwell that fucking sucks, we can‚Äôt even open the windows on that side of the apartment now‚Äù, because we assumed that would at least stop the inside of the apartment from getting hit. But an hour or two later, when he went to smoke again, we found out it doesn‚Äôt work. The smell is weakened, and limited to the living room beside the balcony, but it still seeps in anyway.

My wife is going to talk to him tomorrow and see if he will agree to go outside the building to smoke. In anticipation of that going nowhere, I am wondering if anybody has any practical advice to stop this man‚Äôs habit from ruining our new apartment.

Fans at strategic points near windows maybe? But this is costly and complicated. Air freshener isn‚Äôt the solution, that stuff smells horrible as it is, and blended with cigarette smoke it‚Äôs even worse.

The Internet has led me to believe that no matter the problem, there are inevitably countless people out there who have faced a similar problem. Anybody have any experience they can relate?",03Nov2019,1

719,"So we are close friends since we started high school (4 years) and my BFF had always been the tough guy going out with the best chick of the school [he also had many haters because of that] and known for having good grades. For me, a boy with low to mid social skills, it was a blessing to be friends with the cool / successful guy of the school. We have also a lot in common so we became best buddies.

A lot of people describes him as unfriendly (at start he actually is) but actually he is kind and friendly under his shell. That's why he went downhill. Ever since he started dating with this girl, she mentally abused and manipulated him in a way that he went crazy. This unhealthy relationship almost lasted 3 years and she broke up with him 3 months ago. He was devastated.

Since the start of this school year, He works harder than ever and wants to have the highest grades in our school (He also studies in his free time). So he became socially isolated from everyone except me and some kids acting like as if they are ""disabled"" (Sorry I have lots of socially awkward friends but these people are the real deal, they don't have any hobbies and they are plain dumb). I also tried to be friends with one of these ""kids"" but they don't know even how to handle things like adults and they are expected to go to college next year (I am not sorry for them because they literally do nothing to improve themselves). So he started being best friends with these kids, whereas I became more social than ever making new friends. When I invited him out for a beer he also invited two of these ""kids"" (they have never drank any coffee in their life imagine that) and I was furious. I know it's his choice but I don't enjoy seeing my BFF going downhill losing respect of many people becoming depressed and a loser for his rest of his life.

I know he just wants to help these kids which I also tried but I can't hold it anymore. It doesn't help in school being best friends with an antisocial guy who can easily become angry towards others. I tried to talk him about it which made him angry and he don't want to admit the harsh truth that he literally went downhill.

I don't want to end our friendship. How can I help him? 

PS: I am not a popular guy but you have to get along with people to live in this world. Call me a jerk but I consider every person who don't want to improve themselves or have any life goals as a loser.",03Nov2019,1

I am a 19 year old student in dire need for help. For the past few years i was really depressed and hid my depression in video games. I kept on playing and playing and become truly addicted. I cant do anything else cause my addiction makes it boring. I am in my first year of studies and am starting to realize that i am fucking myself by playing every minute i can instead of studying. I wish it to stop but its impossible. It feels to good to continue to play and sink my times in those virtual nonsenses. I see what it is doing to my life, to my relationships, to my brain but i cant stop. It feels horrible but good at the same time. I have talked about it with a psychologist but at the rate at which im seeing her plus the fact that she apparently cant physically do anything doesnt really help me. I know i am the one who should help myself but its really too hard. Thats why in this cry for attention and for help i just wanna know what i should or could do.

726,"So let‚Äôs see where it all started I was born in October 6th 2003, making me 16 right now. I was born in a city called Charlotte, North Carolina. I grew up in apartments with my mom and my dad, but eventually we moved to a town on the outskirts of Charlotte named, Monroe. Monroe was the stereotypical suburban white skater dude neighbor hood. At the time I was in kindergarten and hung out with kids much much older, maybe because I loved the trouble we would get in lol. After some time passed my mom and dad would get into a lot of fights, I don‚Äôt remember much of them but all I know is that they were stupid. Basically my mom was always on the computer playing a game that recently came out called IMVU. My dad played the game with her off and on. My mom shortly became obsessed with it and wouldn‚Äôt care about anything else besides the game. My dad couldn‚Äôt handle the fighting between them anymore and ended up filing for a divorce. After this, one morning my mom woke me up and took me to Florida for some odd reason, I still don‚Äôt know why. When they went to court my dad got custody of me. I was still in Florida for the summer and started emotional eating ( it‚Äôs not only for older people lol). I became very over weight for a 7 year old child. After summer ended I went back to North Carolina with my dad. He bought an apartment in Matthews where I went to an elementary school and probably had the best time of my life. I went to this school for 3 and a half years. I‚Äôm now going to tell you what went on for those 3 and a half years. We lived at the apartment for about 2 years, my dad worked as a photographer for a lady who gave him crappy money for his hard ass work. This money coming in was not enough to support us as a single parent family so we ended up getting a place in mint hill, North Carolina, with his best friend. His best friend is still one of the best people in my life atm, love you uncle josh. Anyways, my dad ended up quitting his job and worked at a jets pizza place where he also made shit money. He started going to school to be a heat and air technician. At this time he and I found out that my aunt got cancer so we moved with her and her family. I started going to an elementary school called tar river elementary and ofc met some friends there. We got enough money to move out and get a town home. All of a sudden my dad told me we were moving again, this time out of state. We moved to South Carolina. I went to a Christian private school where I hated because I couldn‚Äôt relate to anyone. They liked athletics and I liked nerdy stuff like video games. Now what I haven‚Äôt mentioned is that I would see my mom every summer in Ohio where she moved to from Florida with her new boyfriend, Keith. Keith is also one of the best people in my life. I told my dad that I want to move with my mom because I wanted to try something new. And he agreed. So I moved and lived there for summer and ended up moving AGAIN. They broke up after 3 years of being together. This was pretty traumatic for me because I met his children who I felt like could be my actual siblings. My mom and I are now in Florida where she grew up and living with my aunt, grandparents, and my cousins. After I would say a year she left without telling me where she went. I became really worried and depressed where she was at. She would never answer my calls or anything. She met a guy named Chris 1 ( I‚Äôm naming this dude Chris 1 for the sake of the story, because she meets another Chris later on). She started living with him and got a place where other people lived in as well. A commune. All she did there was smoke weed, and drink. She invited me over there and I ofc I said yes because I haven‚Äôt seen her in over a few months. She ended up breaking up with him because apparently he had multiple personality disorder, BS. She said he punched her and threatened to kill her. She was lying to me ofc. I had taken over her room in the place I was staying at so when she came back she was mad at me. I‚Äôm 15 when this happened and I‚Äôm not sleeping in the same room as my mom. We got into very violent fights to the point where I didn‚Äôt want to live anymore. Fast forward to the present day she has found a new bf named Chris as well. Chris 2 is a skin head. I‚Äôm tired of writing all of this if you want more then please tell me.",03Nov2019,1

I (27M) have not spoken to this person (90M) or his partner (75M) in my recent adult life. I may have exchanged neighborly words as a young child. Today I came home form brunch to my extremely concerned parents (father and stepmother). They sit me down and relay this story to me. Apparently the older neighbor came over and told them that I have been harassing and bullying them for the last 15 years (since about the age of 12). They described circumstances in which I physically and aggressively approached the old man with my ""fist clenched."" He also described a time when I had multiple friends over and he almost called the police because of how threatening we were, but apparently a female intervened (who was apparently our friend). The suggestion is that my harassment was homophobic in nature which is completely against my character. I don't know what is going on.

I should also mention that I am only back at my parents house while looking for a job after grad school. I have lived away form home for undergrad, 2 years out of country, and grad school without living here full time. This makes the notion of constant harassment for 15 years even more incredible.

732,"Hello all.

So yes, I know this is a pretty giant fuck up on my part. In 2018 I was having a mix of issues: final exams, trying to graduate, working full time while being a student full time, frequent PTSD flashbacks thanks to an incident, and my federal taxes being (somehow) misfiled by TurboTax which lead to a delay in the return that I was relying on to prevent homelessness. As a result, my 2017 state taxes never got filed. 

This year, I filed through H&amp;R block online. I erroneously thought this included my state taxes; it didn't. It was at this point that I realized I *never filed my state taxes last year.* I can't figure out what forms I need to do this. 

I don't really know what to do besides call the state tax department tomorrow and try to figure out what to do. I've tried enrolling through their website, but can't, because I don't know what my AGI via my state tax return would be. 

I'm pretty sure I'm majorly fucked. Is there any way I can use my IRS transcripts to provide the information I would need for 2017-2018 state taxes? This sounds bad, but I worked so many part time jobs those years, I'm honestly not even sure if I have all the W2s, or how to go about finding them, because I don't even remember all the places I worked (it was a lot of shitty fast food jobs). Also, what should I expect in terms of penalties? I made less than 20k those years, and I think this year (2019) was probably closer to above 25k.

A few months ago, I sat down with my dad &amp; told him that I had a plan to be able to afford a car. The plan was to save $3000 + plus the average sales tax of the car I wanted to lower the monthly cost to $150-175. At first, he wasn‚Äôt entirely on board, but eventually he ended up coming to me and he told me if I stuck with this, we‚Äôll see about getting the car I want. Fast forward to now. I‚Äôve saved a little over $4000. I approached them last Friday about it &amp; all sudden he had excuses to why I shouldn‚Äôt have a car, which include:

2. How stable is your job, really?
3. What if you don‚Äôt pay us?

This has been one of the largest dilemmas I have ever had.

I am a junior animation major (so ya know I ain't gonna be making a lot of money ngl) and I have no student loans so far. I live fairly away from my college (80 miles all together) and the commute can vary depending on what time of the day I leave.  I take the bus so the tickets are 95 a book for 5 round trips and I go to school 3 times a week and because the commute is so great, I can't work too much because I need to make up for lost time. 

Basically, commute time is about 13 hours weekly. 

I have been able to get work done on time, but I kind of feel like I could've done more with it if I had the time and energy (low energy because im always on the move) 

I live at home with a dysfunctional family, they typically dump house work on me when I should be doing homework instead, and constantly charge me for stupid shit because I ""didn't do something right"" and it causes me to have anxiety a lot of the time when I am home.

Yeah, I hate commuting and I want to get away from my family. So why haven't I already?

The price tag. $6,000+ PER SEMESTER to live on campus. I don't know, it is a lot of money. I can't tell if I am being a ""whiny baby"" and I should suck it up or I should put out my very first student loan and live on campus. What do you guys think?

748,"Backstory: I have crippling social anxiety, have been on and off of pills, and in therapy (which I absolutely can‚Äôt stand). I just got off of pills and I‚Äôm afraid to tell my parents about the whole situation because they will likely stick me in therapy again. 

There is a group of kids that I used to be great friends with in middle school. We were pretty much inseparable and we hung out a lot outside of school. When high school started, I started seeing them less and less, thus growing much less comfortable around them. Fast forward to today (grade 10) and I‚Äôm really uncomfortable talking to/being around all of them. While my anxiety and awkwardness have prevented me from approaching them, they have all been hanging out without me, probably multiple times a week (I have been invited 0 times). When I muster up the courage to passive-aggressively invite myself over, they insist that they *aren‚Äôt*hanging out, while it‚Äôs obvious that they actually are. That to me is a real slap in the face. The thing that caused my epiphany was last night, when my former best friend (let‚Äôs call him Drew) invited a bunch of people to go to a basketball game and sit courtside for his birthday. Needless to say, I was left off the guest list. I had long considered him one of my best friends, but this made me realize how far apart we‚Äôve grown. In middle school, we were two peas in a pod (forgive the colloquialism), but now it‚Äôs to the point where we say hi to each other in the hallways and that‚Äôs about it.

5 images. Cut my finger like 2 months ago. Last image is from over 2 months ago and the others are from my two hands to compare. My finger still hurts when making closed fist and Has a bump that looks red. As for what originally happened imagine a knife like thing going down directly to that spot.

So what is wrong with it?
Do I need to go to some clinic to take care of it?
What happens if I do not do anything to it further?",03Nov2019,1
750,"Hi everyone, I need some clarification and advice from someone who may experience the same things my husband does.

I have been with my husband for almost 8 years. We are generally a very happy couple, of course having our moments of ups and downs along the way. My husband has always been more of an introvert; as where I am much more extroverted. I have a very close knit family that spends a lot of time together, whereas his family members live all over the US &amp; he hasn‚Äôt seen his dad in almost a year (which is normal for them.) As of about 6 months ago, I noticed my husband becoming more reclusive than he has been in the past. He is so happy being at home, he loves being able to just hang out at the house with me and our one year old. He has started not wanting to go anywhere with me outside of the house at all. When I have family events, I feel like I have to beg him to go or promise to only stay for half of the event. He doesn‚Äôt go grocery shopping with me, we don‚Äôt go out for dinner often, and he doesn‚Äôt like spending any time outdoors. It‚Äôs upsetting for me, because those are the things that make me the happiest. I‚Äôve tried my best to accommodate him, stay home more often, say no when we are invited to dinner, etc. 
Today I finally broke down a little when he said he didn‚Äôt want to go right down the street to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant with my parents and sister. I feel guilty taking my one year old with me, and leaving my husband home alone. But if my one year old stays with him, it makes me angry, like I don‚Äôt get to spend that time with him either.

He says going out makes him exhausted. Any amount of social interaction, being around any crowds, or having to speak to others makes him unhappy. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a social anxiety because he doesn‚Äôt fear the interactions. What could this be? Is there anything I can do to help him? Should he see a doctor? I‚Äôm worried this is beginning to negatively effect our marriage, and I don‚Äôt want it to negatively effect our son. 

Thanks in advance.",03Nov2019,4
752,"My ex and I divorced almost a year ago. I had found out that he was having an affair with my best friend, and we tried to work it out but I'm not really the forgiving type. They waited until after our divorce (and her divorce from HIS best friend) to make anything official. Well, she just moved in with him with her 3 kids, that's a whole other topic for another day, but I've had to become civil with her being around my son, even though she has been around him since he was little....my ex husband is not my sons biological father, but has been his dad since he was a baby.

My dilemma is, is that I'm not doing the best financially. I've never really had to do anything on my own. I went from my parents house to my sons fathers house to living with my ex husband. My sons father has in laws who dont like me and do whatever they can to rub in the fact that they can give my son things I can not. Well, my ex husband just came to me today and asked if he could take my son to Disneyworld with his girlfriend and her family, who also have money. Is it wrong of me to say no, for the simple fact that it feels like they too are trying to rub in my face they can do things with my child I am not able to?

Side Note: me, my ex, his gf and her ex took all of our kids to Disney 2 years ago together before any separations or anything happened...so he has experienced Disney world before.",03Nov2019,1
753,"Hello,

My situation is complex and I feel like shit in both cases, but let's go over all of this first:

F18, disabled student, who have panic attacks and suicidal pulsions? yup, that's me. My mind had been in a dark place october, and I was self harming myself on the thights since 15/16. I had a panic attack so strong my mother came to bring me back home (21 october). We saw a psychiatrist who gave me some light antidepressants (it was like... last Friday ?), and I slept a lot those last few week. I decided I wasn't going to Uni and began to search for another job. From art teacher, I changed to secretary as it would mean I wasn't going to go to Uni.  
I was at my grandparents' house this week end, and I and my dad lied about the situation. I told them everything was fine at Uni and everything's good. I then thought about my parents about all of their troubles getting me there in the first place about how my dad said I wasn't trying harder. So, going home, I came to my mom and asked her for two more days. She blasted me about how she started to write the e-mail for the appart rent and medical taxi (can walk but I cannot drive nor go on a train), and that I couldn't do this to her. My dad was surprised but seemed more supportive of me.   
The thing is :

My mom and dad paid for everything (+ dad took some time to teach me how to tinker lol) so I feel like I have to be a lot stronger than that. I also feel like I have to repay them, and be more graduate than my brothers. I feel like it would be a game over, a checkmate. I also also feel like I could not do this, it's too big a piece of cake for me. I don't like to draw for the teacher, following the same lines and the same schemes. The city is so fucking big too. It drives me crazy. I feel like I wouldn't be better, and that I would be dead by my own hands by Christmas. If I do quit now, but want to go back to uni next year, I would not be financially supported and helped by my parents to return to University. It's all in one try or it's done.

So what's your advice ?",03Nov2019,1

755,"A brief life story: 

I‚Äôve moved a few times in my life. Mostly earlier in life. 

Grew up in the Midwest, and on a whim (with the nudging of a then-buddy) moved all the way across the US to Gresham, OR. 

Despite difficulties that ensued, and a falling out with the dude I roomed with, I ended up staying and loving to central Portland for about 9 months. 

I absolutely loved living there. I loved where I worked, and made a killing compared to most places I‚Äôve worked still. I lived in a studio apartment, and got around via bike and walking. I visited my folks by flight that was connected to the trains running through town. 

After that, again on a whim, I decided to move across the US to the OTHER coast. 

I did not like living there, and moved back to the Midwest. Shortly after that, a horrible combination of things happened: I got a (well deserved) DWI, and the Great Recession was underway. Suddenly, I went from feeling like I could do anything, to being at the bottom of my barrel. 

It took *years* to get back on my feet. I lost my CDL (which was my main option for work in the Midwest) so I ended up clawing my way back into having moderate income. 

It‚Äôs been a long time since I lived back in Portland. It was tough because my family was not there, but I always feel like real opportunity lied there. I‚Äôve never felt like I belong here. I really dislike the state specifically (WI). It‚Äôs a pretty place, but too rustic for my tastes. 

I‚Äôve rebuilt myself over time. I‚Äôve overcome anxiety and depression that caused a lot of my rash decisions that caused my life to be rather unique. I‚Äôve developed as a person, and despite living comfortably, simply cannot shake that I should return to where I once roamed. 

I‚Äôm essentially single. I have a GF but it‚Äôs nothing too serious. No kids. I have a decent career going, and think it may be possible to network back into a nice enough job if I decided to finally move back. 

Tangible question: I‚Äôve never networked to a new job. Has anyone done something like this and been successful? Also, to people that currently live in Portland, is it still liveable in the city? 

Philosophical question: Is this a crazy concept? I‚Äôve heard people tell me that your problems move with you. I agree with that. However, I don‚Äôt feel like I have any major baggage anymore. I really feel like I belonged there, and made a huge mistake moving back to begin with. 

Thanks for reading. I feel this advice request is loaded; I‚Äôm trying to keep my situation concise without leaving out too much info.",03Nov2019,1
756,"(Just a warning, this subject might be a little sensitive to some people. Please don't make yourself uncomfortable to help me)

So, a few years ago I was diagnosed with autism, though it wasn't really a surprise for anyone. I've always been very anxious, and I got depression quite early. To give some backstory, all my life, it's just been me and my mother. My dad was quite...aggressive most of the time, which triggered alot of sensitivities I have now, but other than that, he's not important. I've had two stepdads so far, one being emotionally abusive for 6 years and the other being my mum's not understanding husband. In school, I was always the problem kid. You know, the one that stands out. Now, back to the main point.

Not long before I was diagnosed, I learned about the satisfaction of...harming. I have a tendency to panic at the sight of blood, so I always end up calling my mum afterwards. Now, don't get me wrong, I know she's only trying to help because she's worried about me, but she knows how sensitive I am to the choice of words she uses, my hearing is sensitive to loud sounds and yelling, and I'm sensitive to physical contact. Yet she still uses all three against me when she's mad or impatient. And when I also have sore wounds, it REALLY doesn't help my issues. She always ""forgets"" my issues. She has a habit of throwing everything at me at once, and then acting like it's all my fault for being born so weird and twitchy, and it honestly hurts. 

Then there's my stepdad. He's the WORST for this sort of thing. He watches things on the TV really loud, and complains when I mention the sound hurting. I have a fear of abandonment, so naturally he goes out during the day when I'm all alone and homebound, and also leaves me in the locked car in a busy car park when he rarely brings me with. He yells alot when I try saying my opinions on things. He grabs me alot. He fakes alot of fighting tactics on me. Stuff like that. 

And finally, my interests. They're always so...judging about the things I watch. They mock the shows I like and the games I play. Then when I talk about their boring shows? ""Hey, everyone likes what they like"". 

If this isn't the right place, please, let me know. This has been going on for years and I'm always so sad nowadays. I hate it. Thank you for reading and helping, if you got this far.",03Nov2019,1
757,"I(17M) like an argument and get aggressive about most of them, because it's very satisfying being right and winning it fair and square most of the time, even if it takes a huge amount of energy. Childish as it is, I find it fun, time passes quickly and you get some cognitive stimulation without it being too much. Most of my arguments were backed up by facts checked by authorities I believe ( foolish, right? ), yet they haven't been proven to be wrong and they sound very convincing all the time which kept me on their side (Ben Shapiro, JBP and some other less relevant people I blindly believed, but recently more JBP and B. Shapiro.) Since I am reading JBP's 12 rules for life it occured to me I have the responsibility to make my own beliefs believable and truthful. My position on existence of God, sexual protection and everything else that is important and relevant and pretty much can define my lifetime. To the point : I want in me to be more me, more autonomy, more MY decisions, more MY views and not borrowed from someone else. P.S.: it's worth noting that researching all this is boring for me and I tend to burn out so much energy, because I research in those situations with high intensity which I don't do habitually, I can't do anything else and turn to outsourcing the decision on someone else.

761,"Our relationship is really complicated, neither of us know what to call it. I had an ex who just sucked, but my ex's best friend was THIS friend that I will call C. My ex was extremely jealous and we werent really allowed to talk and we both respected it. Now neither of us really talk to my ex. C keeps making it seem like im romantically interested in him and I am just NOT. I've said several times that all I want is a friendship and he either says the same or kind of pretends like he doesnt even want that. Now he says we use the word friend differently and that he only has really close friends, everyone else are... Strangers? I guess? But he also says he thinks he wants me to be his friend eventually. (he only uses 'friend' to describe someone extremely meaningful to him).

This guy has major ''get them before they get me'' issues and a thick brick wall. I don't care, honestly. I'm not here to change him or date him, but he's a really fun guy. He pushes people away, and he keeps pushing me away, then asks me to hang out, THEN says we arent friends, asks me to hang out and then says he isnt romantically interested. Unless? 

I mean, it's even confusing on paper. I'm extremely confused at this point. My best friend says she thinks he's romantically interested but I doubt it. He's like a light switch and he keeps flickering. He has been there for me in the past. He picked me up after I left my ex's house after a pretty bad fight. He didn't even know I was there, he just went by my ex's house, heard the story, then drove out JUST TO FIND ME and drive me home safely. He helped me a ton with a job application recently as well. I appreciate him, and I want a friendly relationship with him, but is it worth my energy? He keeps using the excuse that he's a scorpio and that does paint a good picture of his personality.  I don't think it's a compliment though. I have a hard time trusting him when he keeps being like ''you're awesome and fun, lets hang out!'' and then 5 minutes later change to ''We arent friends, we should stop talking.'' and trust is important to me.

I told him this and he apologized. When he says we should stop talking I say ''If that's what you want.'' and he always apologizes and says no.

Am I blind? Is he just going to be trouble? He's damaged but so am I, and I know how big a difference a good friend can make, so I have a hard time just letting him go.

764,"* friend 1 and friend 2 started seeing each other (for a month and a half). I said to them both that I can't get in the middle of things if things go south as it isn't fair on me.
* It went south. Friend 1 had a change of heart realised friend 2 lied, arguments happened and it was a case of friend 1 saying that she won't talk badly of friend 2 cause it isn't fair for me. I said to friend 2 that I can't be in the middle but at this time all he did was talk badly about her and I did my best to be patient and give him advice and be there for him. He didn't listen to me. He still talks about her.  

   * So time has passed and recently friend 2 posted something racially insensitive and Friend 1 thought it was offensive (so did others) and made a tweet and deleted it after I explained things to her how it isn't his intention and how it isn't worth it so she blocked him.
   * Friend 2 messaged me that Friend 1 made a tweet calling her out. I reassured him that I explained to friend 1 and it's been deleted. However, he puts up another tweet calling her out and starting things up again. They argued, had a spat and then it was deleted. They then both started messaging me about it and putting me in the middle.
* Basically she ends up blocking him. He sends me loads of messages at 4 am drunk saying that he's done nothing wrong and that she started it and doesn't stop swearing and basically says everything under the sun. He also found a way to message her after blocking her sending immature nasty shit as well that friend 1 is upset about.

I'm now in the situation where my two friends have had a final ugly argument and it's ended the ugliest way. I've spoken to friend 1 and we had an adult conversation about everything and it's been moved on. We both agreed that friend 2 handled things horribly and the texts he sent weren't good.

772,"Hi. I‚Äôm having a bit of anxiety over talking to my Store Manager about this situation, &amp; am wondering if I should cancel the meeting I have with her to talk about this, or if it does indeed warrant a bigger conversation. 

Some background. I (29F) have been with my current employer for ~6 years. This company has a strong belief in ‚Äògiving feedback‚Äô, even so far as offering employees ‚ÄòRadical Candor‚Äô as suggested reading to live in this practice of giving &amp; receiving feedback. I personally love this policy, it‚Äôs where my best growth has come from, but newer employees struggle with this concept as it‚Äôs not widely practiced in most jobs. 

I‚Äôm a Key Holder (lower management), &amp; have been in this role for 4 years. My co-worker (29M) has been with the company for just under 2 years &amp; was recently promoted to Assistant Store Manager. Let‚Äôs call him Jake. Jake has been talked to previously by his peers when he was still a part time employee about the words he uses, how he comes across as ‚Äòrude, above the law, &amp; abrasive‚Äô.

On Wednesday, I was managing our sales floor &amp; talked to my team about removing a rolling rack from our fitting room section (previously used for go-backs) &amp; re-training the team to do go-backs quicker instead of relying on an ugly, janky rolling rack to hold go-backs for longer. We landed on this would help get the product back out onto the sales floor quicker, &amp; wouldn‚Äôt be unsightly for our guests. 
Around 2:30, we got a pretty big rush &amp; our fitting room tables were being overrun by go-backs. Jake walkied over that he was going to re-install the rolling rack. I asked if we could utilize the space under the tables (as thats what they are used for), &amp; he came over &amp; started questioning me about what looks better (a full table of go-backs vs a clean table &amp; a full rolling rack). We went back &amp; forth, me answering his questions, until he said, ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre wrong.‚Äù
I decided at that moment not to engage, &amp; said ‚ÄòOk‚Äô &amp; walked away &amp; continued leading. He came up to me asking if ‚ÄòI was mad about what he said‚Äô &amp; I responded that I didn‚Äôt want to have this conversation with him on the floor. I took a 10 minute break to regain myself (alone in the back hallway of the mall where no one could see me), &amp; went back to work. 

After my shift, I asked if we could chat. We sat outside the store, &amp; I told him that him telling me I was wrong in front of educators was mean, not really feedback. &amp; didn‚Äôt support my floor. He then went on to tell me about all the examples in the last year of how I am ‚Äòimpossible to give feedback to‚Äô, how I take every thing from him as ‚Äòa personal attack‚Äô, &amp; how he ‚Äòcouldn‚Äôt believe we were having this conversation over a rolling rack‚Äô. I expressed that this wasn‚Äôt what the conversation was about, that his tone &amp; the words he used were hurtful &amp; not helpful. He then let me know that after my ASM interview (which I didn‚Äôt get), he ‚Äòtold my SM that I shouldn‚Äôt get the position because of the issue mentioned above‚Äô (which is not what he initially told me - he told me that they decided there was something I needed to work on, but that they weren‚Äôt sure what it was). 
At this point, I started to cry. When I‚Äôm super nervous, or frustrated, my emotions literally get the best of me &amp; I couldn‚Äôt help it. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm working on with my therapist. I apologized that I was crying &amp; that I was upset, that if he really felt that way in previous conversations he should have told me in the moment &amp; not use this conversation to bring up missed opportunities for him to give me feedback, but felt like this conversation was getting nowhere, &amp; just requested that he watch how he talks to people &amp; be more aware of the words he uses (in return, I made the commitment to be more self-aware on how I receive feedback from him). He followed it up with ‚Äòhe‚Äôs not going to change the way he gives feedback just because I don‚Äôt like it‚Äô, &amp; that he‚Äôs not going to say ‚Äòoh iamthelawson I don‚Äôt want to hurt your feelings but....‚Äù. I reiterated (partially through tears I‚Äôll admit) that that isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm asking for. I again made the commitment of being more self-aware &amp; that at this point I was done having the conversation. &amp; he left. 

After the conversation, I left feeling really bullied &amp; honestly a little gaslighted by the way he made me feel &amp; the deflection he used to make him out to be the victim. 

Am I crazy here? Am I being overly sensitive? I chatted with my direct supervisor (another ASM) &amp; she encouraged me to talk to my SM but now I‚Äôm feeling really nervous that she‚Äôs going to have Jake‚Äôs back &amp; I‚Äôm going to leave feeling the same way I did on Wednesday.

774,"Hello, cut straight to the point I suppose.

I am 19 yo dude who has never found a gal who would like him enough. I completely understand their line of reasoning as I am not the most entertaining/good looking guy out there. I respect everyones decisions, but for some reason I still have similar line of reasoning as some of the infamous incels.

For example, when I was friends with a gal (this happened multiple times with different girls) I would be next to obsessed with them. I wouldn't let it show, I didn't spam them, ask them creepy questions or anything along the lines of r/niceguys. But on the inside it was tearing me apart. Whenever I saw them being online, talking to someone else (this was just online, with people I know irl I don't really experience this) I immediately hated myself. Went over all of the conversations we would have and tried to figure out what I did wrong, what I could do differently but never really came up with an answer. This doesn't really happen when I am talking with guys, so it has to do something with romantic relationships and so and so. This was happening with people I didn't even know that well, I would just talk with them for hour or so and be attached just like that. It's absolutely destroying me.

I fully recognise that what I am doing is completely shitty, I need all the help I can get.",03Nov2019,225

778,"My (17F) and my boyfriend's (19M) relationship is great...but I want to break up.

We were friends a long time before we starting dating, but I broke it off very early on because I felt that we weren't going to be compatible long-term, among other reasons. Then, a month later...I realized I still really, REALLY liked him and he obviously still liked me, so we got back together. We said the big L-word (too soon? yes. do I still love him? yes lol), talked all the time, it's all good. 

But I wish I hadn't gotten back with him. We AREN'T compatible long-term in the romantic sense.

I struggle with depression and anxiety (especially this year, bc some shit's gone down with my family and friends), but I feel like I'm supporting him with his anxiety and low self-esteem issues while he's just...not getting it when I can't be happy-go-lucky all the time and when I have problems, too. He tries, and I KNOW he tries, but sometimes he pushes me too far emotionally even after I tell him I'm already exhausted and just want to be alone for a few day. Plus, he always asks why I don't want to hang out and be lovey-dovey as if I don't love him and he blames me for having problems and they'll be fixed by him saying he's there for me. He never SAYS he blames me, but when he asks why I don't want to hang out or why I don't like him it really, really hurts because I don't ever want to make him feel worthless. 

That, among a few other things (I'm a senior in HS tryna figure my life out/go to college and he's already graduated and got a job with low hours but always wants to hang out when I dont have time being the big one), made me realize that the one thing I knew I needed in a partner is a quality he doesnt have: He doesn't help me grow. He's so...passive (his only goal is to be with me in the future) and he never pushes me to succeed when I'm ALWAYS pushing and encouraging and cheerleading for him. I use all my time and energy to support and love him, but when I need some support he doesn't seem to get that I can't push through everything on my own. Sometimes it feels like he idolizes me, and I HATE it because it makes me feel like I'm not a real person with feelings and problems, too.

That being said, I really do love him. He's one of the sweetest, most well-intentioned people I know. He's smart, funny, kind, calm...but like I said, he doesn't inspire me to grow and he doesn't help me when I need it in the way I need to be helped.

Most of all, I'm not ready for a relationship. I can't open up to him the way he wants me to and the way he deserves to be treated, and I hate when he tries to make my problems his own (all I want it encouragement, not fixing, thank you) because I'm a really avoidant person and it makes me feel uneasy when he pushes my emotional boundaries, even on really simple stuff other people would be okay with.

I...don't want to break up with him. I already broke up and then said I wanted him back, and it feels cruel to break his heart again, especially since we've been friends for awhile and I know he doesn't deal with heartbreak very well. But I've already talked to him about some of this stuff and it feels like nothing has changed. I said I needed some time to myself for a few days (and he begrudgingly relented even though he's still messaging me saying he loves me ;-;), but I also feel like a weight is off my shoulders. I miss talking to him, I always do, but I know the second I do itll be even more exhausting than the last time.",03Nov2019,4

784,"Okay so just to preface this, I finished a Masters degree in a pretty unemployable subject (ancient history), and after nearly two years of unemployment, despite applying to hundreds of positions, I am finally admitting that I need to go back to school to take something more applicable to real life. 

The main two options I've been considering are teaching and copywriting.

Now, I'm from Ontario Canada, so teaching is a very very well paid profession, with some of the best benefits/pension plan in the country. The main issue is, our current provincial government is making some big cuts to education, so it may be hard to find permanent work for a long while. Both my parents are teachers, however, so if nepotism DOES exist in the teaching world, it maybe help me out a bit, though I'm not sure it does. They'd also be willing to help out with lesson planning and stuff like that. The teacher's college is only 20 mins from my house, and it would take two years to complete the program.

On the other hand, copywriting is something that has always interested me. I know I'm a strong, convincing writer, and I feel like it's something I could excel at if I learned to put together a decent portfolio. There's a one year copywriting college program \~1 hour (more like two during rush hour) from me, and it is heavily focused on building a portfolio and landing an internship. With this one, I'd probably get a job much quicker than teaching. However, from what I have been told, copywriter salaries at ad agencies in Ontario aren't the greatest, with very few benefits, and the work hours can sometimes be crazy.

I'm kind of at a crossroads in my life right now. Two years of unemployment has taken a massive toll on my mental health, and I'm really at a loss here. I'm afraid if I go into teaching, I'll be in the same boat when I graduate. On the other hand, if I go into copywriting, I may land a job quicker, but for significantly less pay, and worse hours.

793,"My partner has a very active social life, he works as a barman and he's a performer locally - he's often asked to do gigs and he can't go anywhere without running into people he knows, via work he socializes a lot and goes out for drinks after work with his co-workers all the time. 

Meanwhile I have no life at all, I'm currently out of work so only volunteer and I've no friends so I'm socially isolated - this is not a choice and it's not something that will change any time soon. Yes I do feel envious of my boyfriends social life, but it's not just about envy, it's that it feels like he just doesn't share his life with me. 

When we're together it's great but we don't see each other as often as I'd like, when not together he rarely messages me - if I message him he will reply but conversation doesn't flow. I'm used to partners who communicate all the time via text, without that it feels a little like I'm still single. 

I don't feel like I'm part of my boyfriends life as he doesn't message me asking how I am or what my say was like, he doesn't message me just to chat or let me know what his day has been like. 

On Facebook I just noticed posts from him going to another performers album launch, big party, I didn't even know this was happening as he didn't tell me about it. It would have been nice to be invited, but that aside of course he's allowed to do his own things...I just don't understand why it is he won't casually talk to me about this sort of thing and let me know about his day. 

Last night I messaged him, he said he'd gone to play pool with coworkers after work and that was the end of messaging, again no problem with him having a life but would it have really been asking too much for him to send a few messages back and forth? Maybe text me later? 

To me if you like someone then you want to talk to them, you let them know what's happening in your life.

796,"Hello guys. This one might be rather long and is my first serious post on reddit please forgive my formatting. Feel free to leave any kind of advice, I need it. BTW this is a throwaway account but I'll read every reply.

Backstory: my dad loves me and would do anything for me without blinking. He ""bailed"" me out when I (M22) fucked up recently and became gambling addicted. He didn't hold a grudge for a second and supports me in any way.

Now this one will get complex. I don't like my dad because of the way he treats everyone except of me. Because he treats them poorly, disrespectful and is basically an asshole to anyone but me. My mom is a quiet type and would never really engage in fights EVER, so over the years she basically let him do whatever he wanted and this is what made this what it's become in a nutshell.

He doesn't know how I feel about him, he is smart at his job (like really smart) but he lacks of emotional intelligence I feel like.

So over the past few years he started drinking more and more and is right now at a point where he drinks 2 bottles of wine (or sometimes something else but in comparable quantities)  each and every evening and often goes to a bar to keep on Drinking. REMINDER: this is an average. Today for instance he drank 3 bottles of wine and 3 cans of beer in one evening.


Right now I'm at a point where I don't hate my father but I can honestly and unfortunately say that I don't care about him. Don't get me wrong he is an awesome father but the way he treats other people alienates me BIG TIME.

So what do I do reddit? Do I tell him that he needs to fucking stop and that he won't get to meet his grandchildren if he continues like that or do I let him drink until his liver gives up?

800,"My dog just killed another dog. The incident occurred on friday night and until now we had all believed that the other dog was just hurt around his chin. Two hours ago my mother and i received a message that the other dog will likely be dead in a few days due to swelling in the brain.

Here is what happened (according to my mother and the owner of the killed dog):

My mother walked our dog and it was late at night.

Suddenly three dogs (smaller than mine) with their two owners appear (only two of the dogs on a leash).

All three of them start to bark and so does my dog.

One of the three dogs (the one without a leash) starts running towards my dog barking the whole time and jumps at him (arguable attacking my dog).

My dog just puts the other dog into his mouth and starts to shake him. At this moment my mother had lost control over our dog and the shaking continued for the next 10 seconds. 

(Remember it was dark so nobody saw what exactly was going on)

My dog opens his mouth and the other dog starts to walk away, but the walking seems kind of odd.

My mother and the owner speculate it is because of the shaking.

Blood covers part of the street.

My mother and the owner of the other dog start to walk home.

According to the owner several hours went by until she noticed that the injuries were more serious than thought. 

At the vet the doctor said to the owner that the dog will likely be dead within the next days and he could try to operate on the dog, but it will probably fail. The doctor spoke to her about the incident and said that she probably will have to carry the costs, because the dog wasn't on a leash.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the story until now. The information about the seriousness of the injuries i received just hours ago. And i don't know what to do. I love my dog, but i can't trust him anymore. And i don't know in what way my mother and our dog will be held accountable and i don't know what the law says about this topic. I am from austria by the way.

803,"So, this is a weird series of events that have landed me where I am but I need some advice. To start, I'm a first-year in college at a school that's very far from home. I met a girl who lives on my floor, in fact, she lives next door to me. We realize we have a lot in common; we're from the same state, her brother goes to school in the particular town I live in, we've got a similar taste in music and humor, we can be ourselves around each other, and we have the same cynical perception towards the world.

I first hooked up with this girl 3 weeks into college (and I know what you're thinking: why are you hooking up with someone on your floor you dumb idiot? And granted it was dumb to initiate but here we are) and we have been doing so for the last month and a half. The hooking up has progressed into spending time just hanging out in each other's rooms or going to parties together on the weekends. We have been kind of cryptic with the ways we feel towards one another and it has kind of turned into a game of 3D chess where we're trying to see who likes who more without exposing ourselves. I think this comes from a collective fear of creating a strange floor dynamic should things go south. 

This brings me to the meat of this issue. This week, marking our 6th or 7th week together, her ex-boyfriend came to visit because he has been ""having a tough time adjusting to school"" and has some overall mental health problems. Simultaneously, this girl's roommate is not in town and is at a wedding, leaving the room to these two. And of course, leaving a pair of exes in a room for 4 days is guaranteed to create some tension. I assumed she would be committed to me considering we had had a conversation the night before his arrival that I trusted her and her decisions with this guy and when she first told me he was coming I said: ""welp he's gonna want to have sex."" Other than that, there was little conversation on the matter after that.

So Saturday night rolls around and I knock on her door with a friend of mine who needs something from her room only to find a very sus situation where she seems startled and is keeping the door as closed as possible to conceal what's behind her. They were having sex and had slept together the night before and this night as well. I, crushed, kind of sit by myself for the rest of the night processing what I just witnessed. She demands to speak with me the next day to explain herself.

I met twice with her today and with one of my close friends on campus to try and figure out what to do. She claims that our cryptic relationship wherein which our emotions are quite guarded gave her the impression that there was room for this kind of thing because she wasn't sure if I liked her enough to stay with her after this weekend and she also claims that her ex was rather manipulative when he brought about having sex.   


She apologized profusely today and suggested that any idea of her still being in love with him was impossible. The whole situation came out of reluctance according to her. She keeps saying that I'm the priority and that she talked with her ex today and said that she doesn't want to communicate with him when he goes home nor will he be sleeping in her bed for the rest of the time that he's here. With that being said, I still feel betrayed and my trust with her feels like it should be lost. 

I understand the specificity of this situation and can understand how easy it might be to cave and be intimate with an old girlfriend or boyfriend but I'm still not sure if that justifies the situation. She wants me to give her a second chance and thinks we're compatible but I need to know the opinions of reddit. Please help me, do I pass on this relationship because of the weird ex-boyfriend scandal or do I give it another shot?",03Nov2019,1

818,"For starters, I‚Äôm engaged to my boyfriend of 6 years and love him very much and would never cheat. Let‚Äôs just get that out of the way. I have feeling for anybody else. (We‚Äôre all 21)

So anyway, my friend, who we‚Äôll call Leaves, also has a SO (But they are not engaged). They rarely talk in school and I never see them hanging out. They only talk online. Keep this in mind. 

Her SO, who we‚Äôll call Flowers, is a very nice guy and fun to be around. Me and my fianc√© see him around town sometimes and we like to go to shop and eat sometimes. Leaves never joins us. 

Now fast forward a few weeks and they still don‚Äôt talk to each other IRL. We were all at a Halloween party and hanging out when we played truth or dare ‚Äúextreme style‚Äù (Yes we are college kids and we were drinking). Flowers gives me his phone and tells me to text any random person anything. I was like ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù and go into his messages. The most recent message I see is to Leaves. I enter it, thinking about something to write, and I also see the above message. I do know that it was bad to snoop, but honestly I don‚Äôt give a shit because of exactly what I had read. 

Leaves had been telling Flowers about how she didn‚Äôt want to trust me around him anymore, and that the only reason we hung out was because our boyfriend/fianc√©s liked hanging out. She also said more crude things that are a bit personal that I shall not share unless I must. 

I am extremely mad at her for talking behind my back. She had also said before this that she trusted me around him and felt totally comfortable when I hung out with him outside of school. She lied to me on top of talking about me behind my back. Now I just need to rant. 

How can she be so selfish? She also is so protective over him. How can you be protective over somebody you only talk to over text? This is basically an online relationship. She is a liar as well, lying to me about how she trusted me but then went behind my back and told her boyfriend she didn‚Äôt. We‚Äôve been friends longer than they‚Äôve been together (known her for about two years, they‚Äôve been dating for about two months). She also makes jokes about how I might steal him away from her. 

TL;DR I read through my friend‚Äôs texts to her boyfriend and found out she was talking about me behind my back saying she can‚Äôt trust me around him anymore, even though they don‚Äôt even hang out in person at all. She lied to me and went behind my back. We‚Äôve been friends longer than they‚Äôve been dating, and I am currently engaged and would not cheat.

821,"A bit of background, sorry if it‚Äôs so long:

I‚Äôve always been a very sexual person, and have masturbated at least once, if not twice, a day since I was 13. I saved my V card until I was 27 thanks to this, and got married to the girl shortly after. We divorced a year later, and after that, I became something of a man-whore. 

My sex during this time, while prolific, was somewhat unfulfilling. I enjoyed the chase/conquest part of it, but the actual act of sex was typically disappointing. Either it was just blah (partners who were dead fish, no matter what I tried) or I couldn‚Äôt cum, or I was too out of shape to continue the act. Eventually, this led to occasional bouts of ED (or just soft dick, if you prefer more direct language), especially if I had already jerked off that morning or somewhat recently.

Eventually, I actually started dating someone serious; we quickly bonded, and I spent nights over at her house often, but stayed a bit chaste in the beginning, just cuddling and a little bit of kissing/fooling around, no actual sex. 

Flash forward 4 years, after 2 years of dating and almost 2 years of marriage: We rarely have sex, and it‚Äôs my fault. We mostly mutually masturbate each other if we do anything. I still am having the same problems I had while single (inability to cum, no physical stamina, or limp dick issues), and it‚Äôs getting increasingly harder to convince my partner it ISNT HER. 

During all this time, however, I still watch porn and masturbate. Shocker, I know, and some will probably point to this as the cause for our marital issue and very likely be correct; I‚Äôm used to a certain schedule/way of doing it, and that seems to be the only thing that gets me off. 

I‚Äôve tried quitting before, but unsuccessfully.  She has asked me to quit entirely, and I am trying harder than I have before. I deleted all my porn files and links. Occasionally I still relapse, but the time in between is growing longer, which I consider to be progress but she does not. 

I also have tried initiating sex a lot more, but usually get rebuffed, either because of a legit medical issue down there, or sometimes just because it‚Äôs not the ‚Äúright time‚Äù (I get horny in the AM, and she sleeps late, but gets horny in the PM, when I‚Äôm tired)

My wife is unhappy with this, especially with my backsliding to masturbating; the fact that I do it much less matters little. This particular part is frustrating to me because there are things in her life that I‚Äôve asked her to cut out or back on and she has done the exact same thing. She drinks waaaayyyy too much soda and smokes cigarettes; they cause major health issues, and she stays at home for disability (other issues, not preventable ones). She has tried to quit both cigarettes, either with vaping and/or Chantix, and soda, by replacing it with water, per my suggestion... but SHE backslides all the time. 

I thought she‚Äôd be more understanding considering these two facts, but she seems to be either truly unhappy about that aspect of our relationship, or maybe just resigned to the fact that sex is not going to be an even semi-regular thing in our relationship. 

I need help. I want sex. I want my wife to be happy. I want to quit masturbating. Any suggestions how to go about doing any of these things?

TL;DR - I masturbate too much and it‚Äôs affecting my sex life with my wife. Help!",03Nov2019,0

We were originally communicating through facebook messenger where she decided to ""attack"" me in a group message with our immediate roommate, (by saying she asked for my contact info but I didn't give it to her for her to pay me back), I put in the whole story. 

After this, she started attacking me through my school email, nonetheless, and saying things like she tried contacting me, etc. I made sure once more to reiterate all of the details so it was clear as to what happened via email because it was my school email after all. She then started sending me messages that I was unprofessional through facebook messenger.  I was considering just attaching the message in the email, because the other roommates whom I've been communicating with have been saying that I am clearly not in the wrong here and one of them said to just block her overall. 

The thing though is that I'm not sure how to permanently block her on email as well as whether it's worth it to continue living here. I'm already under a ton of stress. Heck, I prefer my last roommate who would listen to podcasts at 3 am and would invite her boyfriend over whatever.

But here I am two months later, failing over half of my classes because I literally have no time to do anything. I haven't slept more than two hours in a week.

I've tried explaining this situation to them directly. My dad worked full time when he was in college, so he says I can too. However, he was good at school stuff in general, he was a business major (nothing wrong with business, it's just significantly easier than biology stuff), and he worked for his mom at her business. When I tell them that it's not the same, and I can't handle it, he says that I need the money and I'll regret not working later. This is valid, but I have a decent amount of money saved from working in high school. Then they say I'm failing my classes only because I don't try, but I do try.

Basically, they'll cut me off if I stop working as much. I don't want that, but I value my schooling way more than working. I'm bad at school in general, so I feel like I need to give most of my attention to that.

843,"I've asked on this subreddit (and nobody bothered to help beyond virtue signaling) before, so I'll try to keep it brief.

I'm 21, jobless, and about to be homeless in the coming months. I live in Rhode Island, and don't have a vehicle. I could feasibly get a Greyhound ticket to just about anywhere in the US, but don't know much about many states. For someone with a GED and a few MOS Certifications, what would be the best place to both find a job (ideally an office related one) and live a relatively comfortable life? I don't have much interest in money beyond keeping myself afloat (i.e paying for rent, food, and internet), if that helps as a metric for relative comfort.

Alternatively, is taking the dive into college for networking and potential career advancement worth the student loan debt? I figure living on campus would at least take some pressure off needing to find somewhere to live for a few years, but I guess I could just as easily end up in the same position then as I am now.

Any real advice would be much appreciated. Apologies for the tone, I am at wit's end.",03Nov2019,1
844,"Ok I'll try to keep it short but I'll provide any necisarry details if it comes up.

I've liked one of my close friends for around 2 years now and we've gotten pretty close. I was rejected by her in the past but only on the basis that she had just been asked out started dating another guy. I shrugged it off and got over her eventually but the feelings inevitably came back. Recently I've been flirting with her and spending alot of time with her wich me and her have enjoyed. I try to treat her as best I can because I know what shes into. Bottom line from that is that I know of no action I have done to make her not like me. Recently one of my other close friends started aspiring to get with her aswell because I had never talked abt her to him. Hes looking for a quick hookup and nothing more while the girl is extremely romantically rooted. Shes stated numerous times that she has no interest in having non romantic sex. Though this is the situation, she caught feelings for him, romantic ones at that. She also has a false hope that if they were to hookup they would inevitably date wich is the complete opposite as to what my other friend said. Me and her are both conscious that she has a bad habit if self sabotage and tends to make the wrong decisions on purpose but I dont want her to end up heartbroken again. On top of this Ideally I would be able to get a chance with her but that just seems further and further from a reality.",03Nov2019,1
845,"Today my dad asked me why I think mass shootings are so common in today's society.

 I replied I believe it's not something that's in black and white. That there are many reasons. But I believe that the main reasons are that morals are considered too religious to be taught in schools, and the school system is so broken that students are commonly depressed, and have hugh anxiety levels. Things like honesty, responsibility, and respect for others around you are not taught enough. And the school system is so broken. I could go on and on about things the school system could fix, but the simple fact that over 50% of high school students face severe anxiety speaks on its own. 

And just like with any other topic, he said it is due widespread liberalism. I guess he took ""morals"" as religion and is now ranting on how librals are anti-christian abd removing God from public school systems. 

I explained that morals is not in fact religion. And that you are in fact allowed to pray during school. It just can't be led by a teacher. Not pushing religion in school is beneficial because of so many different people going there. Not everyone's going to agree on the same things. I mean, just look at how many different denominations of Christianity there are.

He says I'm wrong. Liberals are trying to kill God! Students can be arrested for praying in school!

No,¬† the First Amendment clearly says that we are allowed religious freedom. Just because a teacher can't lead a body of students in prayer, does not mean you are not allowed to pray in school.

Now he's going on about how Liberals and Dempcrats are the cancer of America. 

Now I'm not a Democrat. But I'm also not a Republican. I agree with some things from either end. But I don't believe that anybody is a cancer of America today.

How do I tell him he's wrong when he refuses to listen to me?

My life drastically changed less than a year ago. I ran away from an abusive home and got into counselling and was referred to a psychiatrist. 

I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and PTSD. I was on different  medication trials  that had terrible side effects for a couple months until I was finally given Prozac. It helped so much with my anxiety attacks and triggers and I wouldn‚Äôt give it up for anything else. Unfortunately, it has made me gain over 50lbs within a couple months. 

Although my boyfriend says I‚Äôm beautiful, I can‚Äôt help looking at all my stretch marks and how full my face has become. I can‚Äôt fit into a lot of my clothes now, making any self esteem I have left evaporate. 

I‚Äôve tried all the dumb methods like skipping meals, apple cider vinegar, etc. I‚Äôve even done a lot of exercise and healthy eating for a month but it did not do a thing. I‚Äôm stressing myself out because I‚Äôm consistently gaining weight more and more as the months pass on.

847,"Okay for some back story i'm a 15 year old male from holland and don't have many Friends.
I only really have 5 friends that are important for my questian, four of them are a group and one not (wil explain later). I will call the group fg(friend group) and the other one f(friend).

Okay so i'm in the same class as f but i have known fg for a bit longer.
So f and fg don't get along at all. (If you want details about why then ask but i don't think it's relevant to the story)
I really like hanging out with and generally like to talk to f and some members of fg but, if i'm with f then fg will ignore me and vise versa.
And i don't know what to do anymore i have tried getting them to get along that didn't work out and i have tried just leaving it as it is so only talk to f or fg and never at the same time.
But now we are all going to Brighton for a week with the school and i'm in a room with f and not with fg.
But and here comes my need for advice fg have asked me to join thier room until i we all have to sleep and i have to go to my room.
So what should i do take the offer and just leave f alone wich i don't want or should i say no and not join fg wich i also don't want? I don't know anymore.

I should probably also say that f has these moods that if it happens he just doesn't talk to me anymore and if he does it's either sarcastic or just not serius.
And also some people in fg don't like me that much so he/she doesn't talk to me either.

Tl;dr: going to england with school and can either join one friend out of my class, or join my friend group who don't get along with the other friend?

Sorry for any spelling or gramatical issues i'm from holland and english is my second language.
And also sorry if it's hard to give advice you can ask for any other details if needed",03Nov2019,3

A fight about a job I didn‚Äôt want to do (gravyards, low wage like very low wage), I have an extremely amazing career but it‚Äôs seniority based so slow right now. My sibling and I live at home still because we are both working on our careers and my Father is understanding of that. My mom stresses so much about money to the point that she screams at you if you say you want to leave your $15 an hour, I was in the hospital for 6 weeks and almost died and she pressured me to go back before I felt ready. Sending horrible text messages to me constantly about going to work. Then she will be such a funny lady and I love her around but then back to the bullshit screaming at some point. So this summer i saved more then enough for bills and To be good for 4 months during slow time well long story short bank took it and left me with $67. My father told me originally he would help me out way before all this money was saved if I needed it for the first two years. I ended up becoming in the top 10 of 400+ of most hours worked and it‚Äôs shift work so imagine how much schedule change happens. I‚Äôm sober for a larger chunk of months and I have done a massive 180 turn around from my previous drug addiction on my own desire.She knows about a relationship that just finishd that was toxic and threatened me to use Fent and die which he went and used yes but he‚Äôs alive said it was my fault.  and knows I‚Äôm having mental issues (I‚Äôm seeking help).  She still screams in my face constantly and I had well still happens sometimes but massive anger issues which I did courses and self help stuff for. She just nags me constantly and on my back all the time. I just never even know what to do anymore but anyways...

I don‚Äôt pay rent neither does my sibling
I pay $800 In other bills a month. My mom never asked for rent or my dad. Never a bill to be contributed too. She‚Äôs always said it‚Äôs fine. Just keep the house clean which I do. Today I said I couldn‚Äôt help her take the dogs into the boarding facility because I have my first graveyard shift tonight.  At the crappy job, for no money at all, 8pm-630am... uh. Well I stayed up super late last night to try and start my schedule of graveyards. I slept 2.5 hours and she came and asked me to help. I said I‚Äôm exhausted (mind you just put the two large dogs which theyjump in themselves and take them to the guy who takes care of them) oh yes my family is going on vacation and I‚Äôm working Graveyard and sleep all day that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs better for them to go run and play at the place. Well this was a big deal apparently she started screaming and so on and so on. And I never raised my voice I said I‚Äôm trying to adjust to the sleep schedule. Nope so 45 mins later of us going back and forth and now I‚Äôm obviously yelling and everyone is. She‚Äôs trying to flip this on me  (mind you she has been saying I‚Äôm calling the cops and kicking you out the entire time) and I went outside to the front to take my dog because she said she‚Äôs calling the police (not sure what for, no threats were made to her) my dad hit my head on the wall and pinned me on the ground because I went to go get MY dog and my mom has gotten everyone worked up to the exploding point. I screamed and got up and had no shoes on and it‚Äôs cold in Canada and she‚Äôs saying how fucked I am: and I said I need to go inside I can‚Äôt do this just give me my dog and my feet hurt and she‚Äôs like thinking I‚Äôm on drugs cuz I said that. Which made me mad because it‚Äôs 9am it‚Äôs wet on the concrete and nov3 and I‚Äôm bare foot ya it‚Äôs hurting my feet.  


So she takes off in the car like a mental patient, my dad is trying to say sorry but being annoying cuz I just need cool down alone in my car. He‚Äôs saying don‚Äôt work the job it‚Äôs fine I‚Äôll give you cash for your bills etc etc my mom won‚Äôt talk to me. She‚Äôs already left on her trip didn‚Äôt say bye. My dad said sorry and cried I‚Äôve seen him cry 1. Grandma died 2. I was in hospital 3. Right then and there. And I‚Äôve been in my room since. They are gone for a 2 weeks and it‚Äôs just me here.

852,"27yo, 9 years of doing nothing: never worked, no study(I dropped college two months after, I started to drink like mad there...). Next 3 years, I changed friends, criminal people smoking weed everyday and metalheads secretly hating me and a first girlfriend fucking other guys. I realised I was better alone after almost beaten by 20 of those motherfuckers. A panic attack, anxiety, depression, no friends left except one from school that contacts me twice a year... To fight loneliness I use Grindr and get drunk to be able to have sex with guys (I prefer girls, even if I only watch gay porn).

I tried to kill myself twice in very mild ways (no self harm) but one of them I ended in that prison called ""psychiatry floor"" at a hospital. I tried 5 different psychologists and psychiatrists: they are all a scam and they only know to prescribe antiderpessants. One of them told me I was using her as a substitute for social relationships (the free one from universal healthcare). Fuck with them, they are useless and expensive.

I know my friends from school are doing very well: they are all MD and engineers. I did nothing, just surfing Reddit and Youtube all day, playing Total War... Every time I try to get out of this cycle I miserably fail, going back to this doom state. It's a nightmare. I see homeless guys and I'm pretty sure that's my fate, I hope to not live enough to live that.

Added to that I have no brothers and my father has been diagnosed with Alzheimer, he is a very old man unable to accomplish his duties as a parent and my mother is a stupid irresponsible person prone to derive her frustration on me. I hate them for how badly they educated me, if they died tomorrow I would feel some sorrow but also relief: I perfectly know their secret plan is to keep me at home forever so they don't feel old and they have ""support"" when things go south. Well, I'm not gonna take care of them, I refuse. Am I Evil? Yes I Am.

I hate society too, unemployment rate is so high here that getting a job is hard as fuck. You can only access bullshit ones like call center, etc... I don't think those jobs should exist. I will starve to death before doing a job that does not correlates with reason and justice.

I want to destroy the Universe, this is madness. The more I live, the more I realise this is a simulation and death is the only way to get out of this doomed cycle. So, fuck it, I will kill myself JAN 1st. You may say ""oh, don't do it"", fuck you, you're not living in hell, you know nothing and you cannot provide real help so just shut the fuck up and say, for at least once ""I support you"". Is that hard to understand some people are not supposed to live?",03Nov2019,1

866,"Hello Reddit!

Obligatory throwaway account and on mobile introductory statement. 

I'm not sure how to handle this scenario - just to preface, the child under circumstance is the victim of any physical/sexual abuse, just that I feel that how they're being raised straddles the line of neglect and I don't know whether I should intervene.

I have two long-time friends (I'll refer to them as the mother and father, both early 30s) who have a 4.5-year-old child. They live together with the mother's parents in a tiny, one-bedroom house that is in a state of complete disrepair. It's not far from a hoarder's house - lots of junk everywhere, *extremely* unclean, 10+ cats with their feces everywhere, and dozens upon dozens of caged rodents. The smell is unbearably painful. The grandmother chain-smokes inside the house, to make matters worse. They see nothing wrong with living like this.

Mother works a minimum wage job supporting her family, while father stays at home all day smoking weed and playing video games, citing depression as the reason why he will never be able to work (he's made no genuine attempt to help his condition.) Despite giving himself the stay-at-home dad title, he's provided almost zero help in raising his child, relying on the grandparents to take care of any basic needs while the mother is at work. They never bring the child outside to play or anywhere to socialize, nor have they done much in terms of teaching them the things you'd normally teach your children (shapes, colours, ABCs, body parts, animals, etc.) and still use baby talk with them. 

Myself and another friend who is close to the couple noticed a couple of years ago now that the child wasn't developing normally - very little interest in speech (and incomprehensible when attempted), hyperactive behaviours, running off, unable to understand basic requests, no attention span, seems off in their own little world. I'm not a doctor, but if you were to see the child, there are definite markers of either ADHD or even autism in their behaviour. I brought this up VERY gently to the father when the child was three, suggesting that maybe they bring the child to a speech therapist, and he just said that ""they'll talk when they're ready to talk."" And I left it at that. I didn't want to start an argument. 

The child started kindergarten this fall, and the school has already requested meetings with the parents to say that the child would benefit from certain therapies to help work towards developing essential skills. It's fallen on deaf ears, and as far as I know, the parents have made no plans to proceed with any of the suggested treatments for their child. 

I don't know what to do for the sake of the kid. Are these grounds to call Children's Aid for a wellness check? Like I said earlier, there is zero physical/sexual abuse, and the child's basic needs are arguably being met in terms of food and shelter, despite the living environment... But they're doing absolutely nothing to help the child develop as normally as possible at this point. They're completely in denial about it - or worse, they simply just don't care. 

What do you guys suggest? This has been bothering me for a while.",03Nov2019,1
868,"I had a bad falling out with a friend years ago. I have been quite traumatized by it. She ended up filing for an Order of Protection against me, which was dismissed, because she decided that covering my ears and rocking was violent. But we both attend anime conventions. The first convention after the hearing, she claimed I was ""following"" her because we passed in the hallways. She also followed me on Tumblr for months afterward (this was when there was just the ""ignore"" option) I had to threaten her with a public call out to get her to unfollow me.

We still have a few mutual friends who didn't want to get involved in the drama. So this weekend at another anime convention, I was talking to some of those friends and she came right up and started talking to them even though I was right there. If the roles were reversed she would have called the police. I had recently started shopping at a different Joann because she started working at the one I frequented. I'm sick of her messing with my life like this. 

I will confess her working at Joann is not a personal attack on me. I'm just mentioning it to show the lengths I go to avoid her. But she has held me to a double standard and it's so upsetting.",03Nov2019,1

870,"Hey, so I'm using a throw away so nobody personal can see this. I'm 14 y/o and lesbian and my girlfriend (14 y/o) wants us to have sex. We've been in a relationship for 9 months and I honestly trust her with anything but I honestly don't know if I'm old enough, I mean sure, I know I'm ready for it but I'm not sure if 14 years old is a normal age to loose your virginity at my age. My girlfriend is also a virgin and she says that she's ready too. We have done some roleplay sex online before and I'm really into it, I know having roleplay sex is definitely not losing your virginity in anyway but I do enjoy it greatly, so does my girlfriend. I honestly want to have sex with her irl and I have for a while but now that it's been offered right infront of me, it seems rather scary. I'm excited but also extremely nervous. I have spoken to my girlfriend about it in detail and she said that we don't have to do it if either of us is not ready. I think I'm ready to do this but I think I need a second opinion, I can't talk to people I know personally because where I'm known, shes known and I don't want anyone to know what we do in our private time as that's our business, hence why I'm using a throw away. I'm matured for my age, mentally and physically but I really think I need a second opinion. What should I do?

T.L.D.R: Girlfriend wants to have sex, I do too, fear that I could be too young to loose virginity (14 y/o), I want to know if Reddit things I'm too young or not (preferably what age virginity was taken at before giving opinion on my situation)",03Nov2019,0
871,"Hello, I am a sophomore in high school and I am getting discouraged from putting any effort into Algebra 2. It also doesn‚Äôt help when my teacher also doesn‚Äôt really help nor teach very well :/ I took the initiative to watch videos online, do practice problems, and go to tutoring almost every single day just for that class (with a different math teacher). I can honestly say that I felt like i got the topics when I came for extra help. However, when test day comes, I get 40s. This happened twice already. The first time it happened made me sad, but I told myself that I just need to study more but it happened again. A 46. all that hard work, just for a 46. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I am doing great in every other subject except Algebra 2. My teacher goes off in tangents and talks way too fast. I try to ask questions but when he answers them, I still don‚Äôt get it.

876,"Hello everyone. I'm sure from this outside this is probably a very cut and dry situation but I think I need to hear it from an outside perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

I (early 20s F) dated a guy (early 20s M) for about half and year and fell head. over. heels for him. He was pretty great and definitely my first love. We were still in the honeymoon phase of the relationship so we were really happy. My only complaint was that he didn't want to have sex nearly as much as I did (he only wanted sex once a week). He claimed he just had a lower sex drive, I didn't worry about it too much.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I opened Reddit on his computer one day and found out that he was active on Dirty Pen Pals. I didn't look at what he was posting at the time, but I was upset because I considered sexting with other people to be cheating. After a few days of getting up the nerve, I confronted him and he first tried to deny it, but finally admitted that he had been posting. He deleted the account immediately after I confronted him. He said that he was incredibly ashamed of the kinks he was talking about in the posts and he didn't want me to see them, which is why he deleted it.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to make things work and said as a step to restore trust, I would like him to tell me every time he posted and how many people he talked to. He told me a number, and I was later able to use some sort of deleted posts tool to determine he was lying. I broke up with him. That was two months ago, and we've been no contact for about a month and a half.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where I need advice. I found out through that tool that he was searching for pen pals to role play snuff porn scenarios. Where he killed women during sex. I honestly feel sick, anxious, and incredibly violated that he was likely fantasizing about that stuff while he was in bed with me. I'm trying to go out and date again, but anytime I even get close to a guy I get stressed out that he could be hiding disturbing secrets and I feel unsafe. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to reach out to my ex and ask for an explanation, or even just reassurance that he would never hurt me. But even though its completely illogical, I also still feel for him and think about him often, and I'm worried that this wouldn't be a good thing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

How should I get closure from this? My therapist had no advice other then that time will heal the feeling of violation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: dated a guy, turns out he was online role playing snuff porn behind my back. We broke up and now I feel a lot of anxiety and stress about future partners having secret violent fantasies. I want to reach out to get an explanation but worry my feelings for him are what is driving this.",03Nov2019,0
877,"Hi, how do I (16F) tell my mom that her boyfriend sucks. He constantly makes racist and demeaning jokes and thinks they‚Äôre funny. He gets mad when I do the smallest things and is constantly loud even if we‚Äôre in a quiet setting. If we‚Äôre in the library he talks at normal volume which is already loud compared to others, this is especially annoying when I‚Äôm trying to do homework or watch a tv show when he‚Äôs around. He constantly makes fun of me for no apparent reason and even made fun of me for my sexuality, I‚Äôm bi, my mom knows this and didn‚Äôt say a word to him when he made fun of me for it. At this point I‚Äôm at a loss I didn‚Äôt mind him so much at first but now I can‚Äôt stand him every moment I‚Äôm around him I feel like I‚Äôm going to lose it and just go off on him. He‚Äôs only been around for two months but ever since they started dating he basically lives at my house and treats it as his own. He acts like I can‚Äôt do anything for myself and when I talked to my mom about getting a service dog for my severe anxiety he made fun of me for it. What should I do? I don‚Äôt want to tell my mom because it seems like she really likes him but I can‚Äôt stand the thought that they may end up together.
